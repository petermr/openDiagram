<p>The specimens were transversely cut from the as-cast rods and from the upper central part (the lowest cooling rate) of the 100 g or 150 g ingots for the characterization by means of X-ray diffraction (Philips PW1050, Cu-Kα), scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss Supra 55) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Oxford) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Netzsch 204F1) at a constant heating rate of 20 K min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The liquidus temperatures of BT0 and BT100 were measured claorimetrically (Netzsch 404). The DSC isothermal time before crystallization was obtained by heating at rates of 60 K min
 <sup>−1</sup> to and then holding at different temperatures between 610 K and 640 K using a Netzsch 204F1. The elemental mapping of the 20 mm rod of BT48 was carried out by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ION-TOF, SIMS5). The composition of the constituent phases in BT48 samples cooled at different rates were quantitatively acquired by an electron probe micro analyzer (Shimadzu 1610) with a wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). The microstructure of the ϕ6 mm rod of BT48, the ϕ10 mm rods of BT15 and BT20 were investigated in a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai F20) with an electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) system attached. The TEM samples were prepared by ion-milling with the cooling of liquid nitrogen using a Gatan 691.

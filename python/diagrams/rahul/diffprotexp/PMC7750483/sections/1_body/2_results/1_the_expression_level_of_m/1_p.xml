<p>The workflow of the study and nomenclature and mechanism of m
 <sup>5</sup>C writer and reader was demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>. To characterize the expression of m
 <sup>5</sup>C writers and reader in GI cancer, we first used the TCGA data. Overall, the expression level of 
 <italic>NSUN3</italic>, 
 <italic>NSUN4</italic>, 
 <italic>NUSN6</italic>, 
 <italic>NUSN7</italic>, and 
 <italic>TRDMT1</italic> was lower than that of other m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). When comparing the expression level between 1,696 cancer and 148 normal samples, heat map showed that the expression of m
 <sup>5</sup>C writers and reader was generally higher in GI cancer than in normal samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The combination of the TCGA and GTEX databases was used to compare the expression level of m
 <sup>5</sup>C writer and reader between tumor tissue and normal samples in GI cancer. The results indicated that writers and reader were mostly up-regulated in GI cancer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Meanwhile, we did principal component analysis of gene expression in 1,695 samples of the five cancer types (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). X and Y axes explained 39.5 and 16.4% of the total variance, respectively. The further apart the two samples, the greater the difference in genetic background between them would be. From the figure, the five cancers were almost distinctively separated.

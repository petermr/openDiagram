<p>The consistency between the transcriptomic and proteomic results for each differentially expressed hit were illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> as a correlation between the average normalized volume of each protein and the quantitation cycle (Cq) mean for each gene. Red circles showing the hits that were up-regulated at both transcriptomic and proteomic levels, green circles showing the hits that were down-regulated at both transcriptomic and proteomic levels, and black circles showing the differently expressed hits between the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. The number of hits in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> is the same number of genes and proteins hits in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00305-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

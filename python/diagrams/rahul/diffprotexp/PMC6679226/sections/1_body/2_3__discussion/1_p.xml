<p>The murine LPS model is the most commonly used preclinical model for ARDS. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the BALF proteome following LPS-induced direct and indirect lung injury in mice. Our quantitative discovery-based proteomic approach identified commonalities as well as significant differences in BALF protein expression profiles following LPS-induced direct and indirect lung injury. Importantly, this study identified lung-specific mechanisms of immune suppression following LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Identification and validation of these pathways in human sepsis patients are thus warranted, and strategies aimed to enhance these suppressed pathways could form effective preventive measures or treatment options for secondary lung infection in sepsis patients.</p>

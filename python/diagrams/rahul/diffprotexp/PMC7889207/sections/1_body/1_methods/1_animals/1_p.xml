 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Briefly, three-week old male Wistar rats were fed either a high fat, high sugar cafeteria diet (CD) (n = 10) consisting of a patty containing 40% fat, 15% protein and 44% carbohydrates and a jelly cube supplemented with 15% (w/v) sucrose and fructose or a standard diet (STD) (n = 10) consisting of 11% fat, 15% protein and 74% carbohydrates for three months. Water was given

<p id="Par3">GC-MS analysis revealed 98 compounds in the EO flower of 
   <italic>T. minuta</italic> and &#946;-Ocimene (14. 40%) was the major chemical constituents. The EO exhibited highest inhibitory effect against DPPH radical, followed by its effect on ABTS, while LP radical showed the least sensitivity with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 2.45&#160;mg/mL, 2.76&#160;mg/mL and 3.23&#160;mg/mL respectively. The EO showed antibacterial activities against all test organisms with MIC value for 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
   <italic>M. smegatis</italic> and 
   <italic>S. uberis</italic> at 0.125&#160;mg/mL and for 
   <italic>L. ivanovii</italic>, 
   <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp., 
   <italic>E. cloacae</italic> and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> at 0.06&#160;mg/mL. The EO showed MBC against 
   <italic>E. cloacae</italic> and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> at 0.06&#160;mg/mL at 0.5&#160;mg/mL for 
   <italic>S. uberis</italic> and 0.125&#160;mg/mL for

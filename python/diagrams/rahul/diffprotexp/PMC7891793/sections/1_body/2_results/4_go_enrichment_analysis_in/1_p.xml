<p>A major goal of this research was to demonstrate differences in the functional analysis between lung tissue with lesions (LL) and lung tissue without lesions (LN) in the context of the comparison of each treatment group with the placebo group. GO terms were sorted based on type of tissue sample, treatment group and functional clusters. We combined GO terms to the following functional clusters relevant to this study: “Innate immune functions”, “Adaptive immune functions”, “Prostanoid synthesis and fatty acid metabolism”, “Oxidative stress”, “Damage and starvation”, “Vasculogenesis and regeneration” (
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Only GO terms with p&lt;0.05 were used for this selection. Interestingly, treatment group 6 had no difference between LL and LN in such innate system functions as inflammatory response, positive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokine-mediated signaling pathway, response to cytokines and negative regulation of viral genome replication. As for the other groups in the innate immune functions cluster, Group 1 had enriched terms for LL in activation of innate immune response, MAPK kinase, macrophage differentiation and several GO terms related to neutrophil activation, cell-cell adhesion and motility. In contrast, in group 2 innate immune function-related enrichment was observed mostly in LN, including: LPS-mediated signaling pathway, inflammatory response, defense response to virus, antigen processing and presentation by MHC class I. In group 4 LL had an enriched inflammatory response, neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokine signaling pathway, integrin adhesion, mast cell degranulation, cell migration and cytokine production. The last two terms were also enriched in LN in group 4. Other LN associated terms in this group were viral process, positive regulation of TNF alpha production and TLR-4 signaling pathway. Among innate immune functions specific to LN in treatment group 5, positive regulation of IL-8 production and positive regulation of I-kappa B kinase/NF-kappaB signaling were observed. Functions enriched in both types of lung tissue of group 5 were regulation of immune response and induction of positive chemotaxis.

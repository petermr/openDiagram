<p>To investigate the underlying mechanism of E-selectin upregulation in KD sera-treated HCAECs, high-throughput RNA sequencing of HCAECs was conducted, which were treated by sera from acute KD patients with or without CAL for 4 h. After that, the differential gene analysis including GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed (PRJNA686838). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>, there were 767 genes upregulated and 765 genes downregulated compared with those of the KD-CAL- group. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C,D</xref>, genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and ATP metabolism (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) were significantly upregulated. Pathways associated with OXPHOS were significantly upregulated. To confirm the upregulated OXPHOS process, we first examined the ATP level of HCAECs treated with KD and HC sera because OXPHOS is the main way of ATP production. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, HCAECs treated with sera from KD-CAL+ showed a high level of ATP content when compared to that of the KD-CAL– group and HC group. But previous studies have indicated that the main source of ATP in HCAECs was glycolysis, not OXPHOS (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We also found that the ATP was significantly decreased in HCAECs after intervention with deoxyglucose (10 mM) for 12 h than that after oligomycin (50 μg/ml) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine whether the increased ATP content was due to the upregulation of OXPHOS, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial gene transcription level, and mitochondrial complex I activity were tested. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C–F</xref>, HCAECs treated with serum from KD-CAL+ showed a high level of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial gene transcription level, and mitochondrial complex I activity compared with those of the KD-CAL– group and HC group.

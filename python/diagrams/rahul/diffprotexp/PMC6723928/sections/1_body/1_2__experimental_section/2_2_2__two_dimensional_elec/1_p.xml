<p>2-DE was carried out as described previously [
 <xref rid="B12-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Aliquots in sample buffer (7 mol/L urea, 2 mol/L thiourea, 4.5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonatehydrate, 100 mmol/L 1,4-dithioerythritol, 40 mmol/L Tris; pH = 8.8) were applied to immobilized pH 3–10 nonlinear gradient strips (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 80,000 voltage hours. The second dimension was analyzed on 9–16% linear gradient polyacrylamide gels (18 cm × 20 cm × 1.5 mm) at a constant 40 mA per gel for approximately 5 h. After protein fixation in 40% methanol and 5% phosphoric acid for 1 h, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant G-250 for 12 h. The gels were destained with H
 <sub>2</sub>O, scanned in a densitometer (GS710; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA), and the obtained data were converted into electronic files, followed by analysis with the Image Master Platinum 5.0 image analysis program (Amersham Biosciences, Little Charfent, UK).

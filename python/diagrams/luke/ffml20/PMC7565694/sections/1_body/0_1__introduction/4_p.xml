<p>In this work, a novel diamine (2,7-CDA) containing rigid planar carbazole moiety was designed and synthesized. Then, the 2,7-CDA was polymerized with PMDA to form polyimide (2,7-CPI). The chemical structure of 2,7-CDA is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Compared with 2,7-CPDA, the two amine groups in 2,7-CDA are directly attached to the 2,7-positions of the carbazole ring without the bridging of benzene rings. The stereo view of the lowest energy conformations of repeat units for 2,7-CPI and 2,7-CPPI are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f001">Figure 1</xref>. It can be observed that the diamine residues in 2,7-CPI exhibit a better coplanarity than those in 2,7-CPPI, which is conducive to the close chains packing. In addition, the direct connection of two large rigid planar structures (carbazole ring and dianhydride residue) in 2,7-CPI will increase the chains rigidity and reduce the mobility of polymer chains. These above-mentioned structural characteristics of 2,7-CPI are beneficial to the improvement of barrier performances.

 <caption> Venn diagrams displaying differential expression overlapping across developmental stages. a DETs occurring at different developmental stages. A total of 5268 DETs are differentially represented at all developmental stages. The developmental stage with the largest amount of stage-specific DETs is anthesis (7500). The developmental step with a largest amount of total DETs is premeiosis (23,651). b DEATs occurring at different developmental stages. A total of 32 DEATs are differentially represented at all developmental stages. The developmental step with a largest amount of stage-specific DEATs is anthesis (396). The developmental step with a largest amount of total DEATs is anthesis (495) </caption>

<p>Using the animal model of CDD-induced fatty liver disease, the present study confirmed the traditional use of 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic> extract and essential oil in NAFLD. This effect was demonstrated by the measurement of weight gain, lipid profile parameters, hepatic enzymes, and histopathological assessments of liver tissue. Further mechanistic studies as well as clinical trials are mandatory to prove the efficacy of the plant extract and essential oil as a treatment for NAFLD in human subjects.

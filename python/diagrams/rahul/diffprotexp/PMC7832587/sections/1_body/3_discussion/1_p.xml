<p>In this paper we have demonstrated for the first time that purified PcATP2/PcCdc50B complex catalyses ATP hydrolysis in the presence of phospholipids. The essential and irreplaceable putative lipid flippase activity of ATP2 [

There are obvious future possibilities since, for instance, PfATP2 was associated with drug-resistant phenotypes against two antimalarial drugs [

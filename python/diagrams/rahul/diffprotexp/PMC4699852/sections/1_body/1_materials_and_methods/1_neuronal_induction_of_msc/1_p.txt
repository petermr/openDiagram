0: Human MSCs isolated from bone marrow [ 16] were treated by the methylation of nine genes in the SWH signaling pathway to yield  me_SWH-treated MSCs [ 17].
1: The  me_SWH-treated MSCs retained markers of stemness, could be induced to differentiate, and were not shown to be tumorigenic in a nude mice assay.
2: Both human MSCs and  me_SWH-treated MSCs were cultured in a culture medium (CM) composed of Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco).
3: The medium was replaced with fresh CM every 34 days.
4: When the cells reached 7080% confluence, CM was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice.
5: Fresh neural induction medium (NIM) was then added.
6: The NIM consisted of neurobasal medium (Gibco), 0.5% B-27 supplement (Gibco), 250 ng/ml SHH (Peprotech), 100 ng/ml FGF-8 (Peprotech), and 50 ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech), as previously described [ 15].
7: The medium was not changed during the neural induction period.
8: For the study of signaling pathways regulating neuronal differentiation, TrkB inhibitor (0.5 M), Akt inhibitor (10 M), ERK inhibitor (10 M), or BDNF (100 ng/ml) was also added to the induction medium.
9: TrkB inhibitor (K-252a), Akt inhibitor IV in solution, and ERK inhibitor (PD98059) were obtained from Calbiochem.

<p>Numerous studies have focused on the factors of tumor recurrence of NFPA to improve the prognosis of patients postoperatively. Age is recognized as an important independent factor influencing the prognosis of NFPA, and a younger age indicates a greater chance of tumor recurrence (

A previous study tried to establish a statistical model that combined clinical features (age and tumor volume) and molecular markers (p16, WIF1 and TGF-Î²) to evaluate the recurrence probability of patients with NFPA postoperatively (

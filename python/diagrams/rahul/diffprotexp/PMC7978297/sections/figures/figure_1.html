 <caption> Molecular characterization of post-natal ovaries. (A) A schematic pipeline of sample collection, 10Ã— Genomics platform sequencing, and data analysis. (B) UMAP plots of ovarian cells based on sample group (upper) and Seurat cluster (below). (C) Dot plot of the three marker genes identified from ovarian cell types in each cluster. Dot size represents the percentage of gene expression in each cell cluster; color intensity refers to the intensity of expression, with strong color indicating high gene expression. The dendrogram of cell clusters is presented in the left panel. (D) Feature plots of specific marker genes from six main ovarian cell types. (E) The six main ovarian cell types are identified on a UMAP plot. </caption>

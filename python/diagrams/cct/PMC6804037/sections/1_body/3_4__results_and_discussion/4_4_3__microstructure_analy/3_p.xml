 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f013">Figure 13</xref>a displays the influence of ferrite percentages on the maximum microhardness of different LH samples. As seen, decreasing the ferrite percentage resulted in increasing the maximum surface hardness. In sample #9, the percentage of the ferrite phase was 0.43% in the center of the hardened zone, which was less than the value of the other samples. In

 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> infection of the host is a complex dynamic process, which involves the recognition and interaction of a variety of biological molecules, including genes [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and miRNAs [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which are of great significance for understanding the interaction mechanism between the parasite and the host, and for identifying the key factors of immune regulation and immune evasion, since up-regulation or down-regulation of these molecular expressions likely underpin the phenotype changes associated with the different life cycle stages [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. If the antigens and candidate vaccine markers specifically expressed in each developmental stage of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> can be screened from the perspective of molecular biology, this could provide the theoretical and practical basis for early diagnosis, preparation of new vaccines, and disease-resistant breeding of livestock.

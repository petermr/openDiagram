0: Mining of transcriptome data showed the presence of 21 novel MAPK genes.
1: The identified transcripts were mapped on the  Triticum aestivum genome sequence available on Ensemble Plants ( https://plants.ensembl.org/) for predicting the full length gene sequence.
2: The predicted sequences were used for designing the forward and reverse oligos using Genefisher2 primer designing software (Table S2).
3: Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cloning were performed as mentioned in Kumar et al.
4: [ 21].
5: Sangers Di-deoxy method was used for the sequencing and further, the sequence of the genes were submitted in NCBI GenBank.

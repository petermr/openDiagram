<p>From our results, it is evident that the room temperature methoxylation in H-ZSM-5 is methanol loading dependent: the higher the loading, the faster the methoxylation. The reaction is more than an order of magnitude faster with 8 molecules per Brønsted acidic site than that with 2 molecules. As well as methoxylation, hydrogen bonded methanol with protonated geometries are also formed. Significantly, no methoxylation is observed with methanol loading of ≤1 molecule per acidic site, but only hydrogen bonded methanol with neutral geometry is detected. Thus, the structure of hydrogen bonded methanol is also loading dependent. These findings will have significant implications for reactions involving zeolite H-ZSM-5 and methanol.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the extract BM-21, from sea grass 
 <italic>Thalassia testudinum</italic>, and thalassiolin B (a pheloic component of the extract, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9e</xref>) are both able to inhibit peak amplitudes of rASIC currents in DRG neurons (at pH 6.1 IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 720 μg/mL and 27 μM, respectively), as well as attenuating mouse pain behavior induced by acetic acid or formalin [
 <xref rid="cit0219" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. In a similar manner, chlorogenic acid (CGA, a natural organic structure common in plants, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9f</xref>), inhibits transient acid-evoked currents in DRG neurones with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 23.5 µM, given rASIC3 is predominant in rat DRG neurone and the nature of the biphasic currents measured, the inhibition observed with CGA is likely due to ASIC3 inhibition; localized injections (1–10 µM) also attenuated acetic-acid-induced pain behavior [
 <xref rid="cit0220" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. In a prior neuropathic behavior study in rats, 200 mg/kg IP injections of CGA produced a similar effect to the analgesic gabapentin (100 mg/kg) [
 <xref rid="cit0221" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>]; however, the effect of CGA reduced rapidly over time, which may be due to fast metabolism and/or a significant degree of excretion compared to the synthetic compound gabapentin; albeit direct ASIC involvement was not tested.

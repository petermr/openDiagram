<p>The present experiment found that the expression of INSIG1 was up-regulated in the eyes of the mice in the myopic model group and that SREBP1 was significantly activated after the rapid degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum protein INSIG1, leading to neuronal apoptosis induced by glutamate excitotoxicity. It was hypothesised that the up-regulation of INSIG1 might be a firing of the mechanism of neuronal self-protection. The expression of TDO2 was also up-regulated in the RPE cells of the mice in the myopic model group. TDO2 is a tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which is the metabolite of tryptophan. A strong expression of tryptophan hydroxylase was observed in the bipolar cells, amacrine ganglion cells, ganglion cells, and photoreceptors. In the nervous system, TDO2 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the canine urethane pathway that can induce the expression of the neuronal survival factor. The results of Fiedorowicz 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the kynurenine pathway is out of balance in an injured retina: during the process of retinal/optic nerve injury, the concentration of kynurenic acid transiently increases. The up-regulation of TDO2 therefore indicates the activation of the kynurenine pathway, while the increase of the concentration of kynurenic acid suggests retinal injury.

<p>We next examined whether MVs could enter the recipient cells. NRK-52E cells were labeled with Dil-C18, and the conditioned medium after TGFβ-1 treatment was collected to obtain MVs by ultracentrifugation. Subsequently, MVs were applied to treat recipient cardiomyocytes for indicated durations. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A–D)</xref> exhibits that Dil-C18-labeled MVs entered the recipient cardiomyocytes in a time-dependent manner. Red fluorescent positive labeled MVs were observed in the recipient cardiac myocytes, and the number increased with the extension of treatment time, suggesting that MVs could be transferred from TGF- β1 treated renal tubular epithelial cells to the recipient cardiac myocytes.

 <caption> Changes in the Fe K-edge (a) XANES and (b) FT-EXAFS operando data in Fe-based TMNC catalyst for ORR with increasing applied potential. (c) Sensitivity of XANES features to the off-plane displacement of the Fe ion in the Fe–N 4 structural motif, as obtained in theoretical XANES simulations. (d) Changes in the simulated spectra describe well the trends in the experimental data collected at 0.1 V in N 2-saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte for samples with different degree of distortion of the square-planar Fe–N 4 motif.

0: SCX chromatography using the AKTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare) was used to fractionate the iTRAQ labeled peptides.
1: After being reconstituted and acidified with 2 mL buffer A (10 mM KH 2PO 4 in 25% of ACN, pH 2.7), the peptides were loaded onto a PolySULFOETHYL 4.6  100 mm column (5 m, 200 A, PolyLC Inc., Maryland, U.S.A.).
2: Then, the peptides were eluted at 1 ml/min with a gradient of 010% buffer B (500 mM KCl, 10 mM KH 2PO 4 in 25% of ACN, pH 2.7) for 2 min, 1020% buffer B for 25 min, 2045% buffer B for 5 min, and 50100% buffer B for 5 min.
3: The elution was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm, and the fractions were collected after every 1 min.
4: The collected fractions (~30 fractions) were combined into 10 pools and desalted on C18 Cartridges [EmporeTM SPE Cartridges C18 (standard density), bed I.D.
5: 7 mm, volume 3 ml, Sigma].
6: Each pooled fraction was concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 40 l of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and stored at 80C for LC-MS/MS analysis.

<p>� Knowledge of the nature of the heterocysts of blue-green algae has been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for investigation of the physiology and biochemistry of these puzzling structures. Some successful technique for the isolation of heterocysts of Anabaena cylindrica was all based on ‘differential cell disruption’. Therefore, it is difficult for separation of NDV and NDH to acquire the intact vegetative cells.</p>

<p>In this study, candidate genes were selected based on their association with CLE pathogenesis, and were enriched with IFN pathway genes likely to distinguish between CLE-A and CLE-U skin. As expected, IFN response genes were plentiful in clusters 1 and 3, the gene clusters with the strongest differential in mean expression between CLE-A and HV, and between CLE-A and CLE-U lesions.</p>

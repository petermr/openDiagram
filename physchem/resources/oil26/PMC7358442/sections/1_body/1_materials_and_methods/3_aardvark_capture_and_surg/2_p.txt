0: We captured and immobilised our aardvarks as previously described ( Rey et al., 2014).
1: Each aardvark was immobilised using a propelled dart administered intramuscularly.
2: Each dart was filled with a combination of 150 mg ketamine, 4 mg medetomidine, and 10 mg midazolam using concentrated drugs (ketamine: 200 mg mL 1; medetomidine: 50 mg mL 1; and midazolam: 50 mg mL 1; Kyron Laboratories, South Africa), and topped up with sterile water to reach a final volume of 2 mL.
3: Anaesthesia was maintained by inhalation of isoflurane (Isofor, 0.56%, SafeLine Pharmaceuticals, South Africa) in 100% medical oxygen.
4: During surgery, each aardvark received a ringers lactate drip administered at a maintenance rate of 5 mL kg 1 h 1.
5: We monitored respiration (respiratory rate, peripheral haemoglobin oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide) and cardiovascular (pulse rate and arterial blood pressure) variables, and rectal temperature throughout anaesthesia.
6: A 100  100 mm section of the paralumbar region of each aardvark was shaved, washed and sterilised using antiseptic solutions (chlorhexidine: 5%, chlorhexidine gluconate: 0.5% in alcohol, F10 Products, Health and Hygiene, South Africa).
7: Local anaesthetic (lignocaine hydrochloride: 2%, 3 mL, Bayer Animal Health, South Africa) was injected subcutaneously at the surgical site.
8: Additionally, each aardvark received a long-acting antibiotic intramuscularly (Duplocillin, procaine benzylpenicillin: 6,000 IU kg 1, Intervet, South Africa), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (meloxicam: 0.5 mg kg 1, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, South Africa) and an opioid analgesic (buprenorphine hydrochloride: 0.01 mg kg 1, Reckitt Beckinser Healthcare, United Kingdom) subcutaneously.

0: The excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive species can lead to the peroxidation of lipids, glycation/oxidation/nitration of proteins, inactivation of enzymes, DNA damage and other alterations in the cellular organelles 12.
1: The oxidative DNA damage led to cell death and tissue damage, and is generally regarded as carcinogenic and actively participates in many pathological processes, including cancer and aging 3.
2: Supplementation of antioxidants can therefore prevent and protect the human body from oxidative stress related diseases 4.

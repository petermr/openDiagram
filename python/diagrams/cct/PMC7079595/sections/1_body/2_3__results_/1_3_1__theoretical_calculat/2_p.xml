 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b presents the CCT (Continuous Cooling Transformation) and TTT (Temperature Time Transformation) diagrams, respectively, which are calculated for non-equilibrium cooling conditions. According to these calculations, the A
 <sub>c1</sub> temperature is higher compared to the equilibrium conditions. During the non-equilibrium heating conditions, this temperature is equal to 660 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). This is much higher compared to 520 °C in equilibrium conditions. The reason for this is diffusion, which cannot keep up with a high heating rate [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, more time is necessary for it. Hence, the higher temperature of ferrite to austenite formation occurs. The starting temperature of martensite is equal to 270 °C. The bainite formation should start after 60 s at 400 °C. The transformation should be completed after 1700 s obtaining the full bainitic microstructure. At 350 °C, the transformation should start a few seconds later (150 s) and finish after 3500 s. This means that the longer time is necessary for bainite transformation to be completed at the lower temperatures.

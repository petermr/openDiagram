 <caption> Characterizations of the samples of BT48 obtained at different cooling rates. ( a–e) The back-scattered scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the as-cast rods with diameters of 2 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, and the ingot of 100 g, respectively. The different cooling rates have a strong influence on the volume fractions, the shapes, and the size of β-Ti. ( f) The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph of the rod with a diameter of 6 mm with an inset of diffraction pattern from the two-phase interface, showing a two-phase microstructure containing a glassy matrix and β-Ti with a body-centered cubic ( ) symmetry. ( g) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces of the samples. The differences between the rods with a diameter of 2 mm or 6 mm and other samples are marked by circles (arising from the glassy matrices) and rectangulars (arising from β-Ti), indicating the compositions of both phases in the rods with a diameter of 2 mm or 6 mm are slightly different with other samples. The exothermic events at about 540 K before T g arise from the metastable β-Ti. ( h) The summary of the measured volume fractions and particle sizes (herein refer to the diameters of the secondary arms, as shown in ( b)) of β-Ti in different samples. Error bars (s.d.) of the fluctuations of the measured volume fractions and particle sizes of β-Ti are given. Although particle sizes increase with lowering the cooling rates, the volume fractions of β-Ti are identical in the rods with diameters of 10 mm, and 20 mm, and the ingot of 100 g. </caption>

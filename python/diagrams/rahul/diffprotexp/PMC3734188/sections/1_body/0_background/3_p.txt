0: Perfusates contain secretory proteins, membrane proteins and intracellular proteins released by an isolated perfused organ [ 3].
1: Because perfusates pass through the same vascular systems in the organ as does the blood, in theory, perfusate proteins can easily enter into the bloodstream and be detected via routine blood assays.
2: Additionally, the structural and functional integrity of the organ remains relatively intact during perfusion, which preserves the disease state more naturally compared to assays performed at the tissue or cellular level.
3: Therefore, perfusates have the innate advantages in discovery of disease biomarkers.
4: Perfusates from isolated rat hearts during reperfusion were collected after brief periods of ischemia, and some known clinical biomarkers for myocardial ischemia were identified [ 4].

<p>AQP2 is a functional protein expressed in kidney's collecting duct principal cells and is of great importance for improving renal dysfunction. Firstly, AQP2 is down-regulated in rat models of acute endotoxemia within a short time treatment with LPS [

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Propofol pretreatment prevented AQP2 down-regulation and ameliorated LPS-induced renal injury in a rat model of AKI by inhibiting ICAM-1, TNF-α, and apoptotic proteins [

 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consistent with the previous findings, AQP2 suppressed LPS-induced sepsis in HK-2 cell models and AQP2 overexpression could attenuate renal injury by inhibiting inflammatory response and apoptosis. However, whether there is an interaction between AQP2 and other regulatory molecules in septic AKI is largely unknown.

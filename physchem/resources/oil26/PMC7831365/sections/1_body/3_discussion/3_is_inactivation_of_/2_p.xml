<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The record of enamel-degenerated armadillo fossil is significantly earlier than the estimated time of <italic>ACPT</italic> inactivation (10.18&#8211;11.30 Ma) (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Ciancio, Vieytes &amp; Carlini, 2014</xref>), which suggested gene loss as a consequence of adaptation is likely the result of the relaxation of the negative selection. The results further supported the previous study (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). Besides, during the tooth evolution, some enamel-related genes (e.g., <italic>ODAM</italic>, <italic>ENAM</italic>, <italic>AMBN</italic>) also have gone through the similar evolutionary trajectory. By integrating different results from different methods, we may better understand the evolution of teeth and enamel. The inactivation time of <italic>ENAM</italic> (~45.5 Ma) and <italic>ODAM</italic> (~40.43 Ma, range 36.38&#8211;45.45 Ma) is much earlier than inactivation date for <italic>ACPT</italic> in armadillo (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Springer et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>ACPT</italic> inactivation is later than the fossil record, conversely, the inactivation time of <italic>ENAM</italic> is relatively earlier than the fossil record, which implied the various mechanisms of enamel loss in armadillo. Here, the inactivation of <italic>ENAM</italic> gene might be the causes of degeneration/loss of tooth enamel in armadillos, <italic>ACPT</italic> inactivation might be the consequence of enamel loss.</p>

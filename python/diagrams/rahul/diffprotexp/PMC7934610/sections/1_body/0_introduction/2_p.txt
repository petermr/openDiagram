0: Echinococcus granulosus infection in the host is a complex dynamic process, which involves the recognition and interaction of a variety of biological molecules, including genes [ 33], proteins [ 1], and miRNAs [ 42].
1: Upregulation or downregulation of molecular expression likely causes different individuals of the same host to have different resistance, similarly to reports about  Plasmodium homocircumflexum [ 17].
2: It is very important to understand the interaction mechanisms between the host and the parasite.
3: Research and discussions about these mechanisms will help to determine the key factors of immune regulation in the host from the perspective of molecular biology, and further explore the mechanism of disease resistance.
4: This research will also provide new ideas for mining molecular markers of disease resistance and directional genetic breeding [ 19].

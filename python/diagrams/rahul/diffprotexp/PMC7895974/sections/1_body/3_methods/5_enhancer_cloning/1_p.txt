0: Chick genomic DNA (gRNA) was extracted from HH14 embryos using Invitrogen Purelink gDNA extraction kit (Cat no.
1: K1820-00).
2: Human genomic DNA was isolated from HeLa cells.
3: Putative enhancers were amplified using primers with specific sequence tails to enable cloning into reporter vector using a modified GoldenGate protocol 61 under the following conditions: 94 C, 3 min; 10 cycles of 94 C, 15 s; 55 C, 15 s; 68 C, 3 min, 25 cycles of 94 C, 15 s; 63 C, 15 s; 68 C, 3 min; and final step of 72 C, 4 min.
4: Amplicons were purified using Qiagen PCR Cleanup (Cat no.
5: 28104) and pooled with pTK nanotag reporter vector with T4 DNA ligase (Promega) and BsmBI (NEB) restriction enzyme.
6: This reaction was prepared for T4-mediated ligation and BsmBI digestion under the following conditions: 25 cycles of 37 C, 2 min; 16 C, 5 min; a single step of 55 C, 5 min; and a final step of 80 C, 5 min.
7: For mutagenesis of specific sites in enhancers we utilised FastCloning methodology 62.

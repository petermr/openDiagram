<p>A parallel reprogramming in mRNA expression may provide a partial explanation for the changes reported in cell cycle control, senescence, and melanogenesis; new studies are necessary to understand the molecular bases of miRNAs and epigenetic regulation. However, it is necessary to confirm the clusters generated here in the network models and establish the functional network associations between these microRNAs and their mRNAs target in cell cycle control and pigmentation. </p>

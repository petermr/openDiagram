<p>The chronic consumption of high caloric foods leads to obesity and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. White adipose tissue (WAT) is a key endocrine organ that plays an active role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in response to nutritional and environmental cues by altering lipid storage, tissue expansion through hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia and secretion of adipokines [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During excessive weight gain, the expansion and remodelling of WAT renders the tissue dysfunctional, leading to insulin resistance and metabolic derangement [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies in humans and rodents have shown that fat stored in visceral WAT depots is strongly linked to metabolic derangements and is associated with increased risk for obesity-associated comorbidities, possibly owing to its lipolytic nature and contribution to chronic low-grade inflammation [

 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Conversely, accumulation of subcutaneous WAT appears to be protective against metabolic diseases as it is associated with a reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease when adiposity is comparable [

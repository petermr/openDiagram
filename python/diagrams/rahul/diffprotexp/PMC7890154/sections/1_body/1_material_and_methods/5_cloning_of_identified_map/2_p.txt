0: For the cloning of identified transcripts, total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, UK).
1: The qualitative assessment of total RNA was carried out using visualization on non-denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis followed by reading of Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, U.S.A.).
2: Total RNA having A260/A280 ratio of >1.9 was subsequently used for the cDNA synthesis using the Revert Aid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo ScientificTM, USA) following the manufacturers instruction.

<p>The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of different treatment approaches on functional changes and immune status of the lung tissue in calves infected with BRSV. Previously, to the best of our knowledge results of differential gene expression between healthy lungs and BRSV infected lungs were reported in only one study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Behura et al was carried out using the same BRSV isolate (CA-1) and a similar mode of aerosol infection and allows some comparability of results, Behura et al examined differential gene expression in lung tissue (both lesional and non-lesional) in BRSV infected and uninfected untreated bovines. There are other differences.: Behura et al used 6–8 month old Angus-sired crossbred steers and performed necropsy at the peak of clinical illness (Day 6–7). This contrasts with our use of 5–6 week old pre-ruminant Holsteins and performance of necropsy after peak illness (Day 10), We compared the effect of two therapeutic drugs given at several time intervals and to a placebo. The similar mode of infection and virus isolate used as inoculum make it possible to compare the results of these studies, although breed and age differences are factors that may explain some differences in results.

0: It has been revealed that long non-coding (lnc)RNAs serve a key role in the processing of gene expression signals via the regulation of cell cycle distribution, stem cell differentiation and transcriptional and post-transcriptional control ( 19, 20).
1: Moreover, there are aberrant expression levels of spinal lncRNAs in peripheral diseases, such as pruritus ( 21, 22), acute kidney injury ( 23), neuropathic pain and inflammation-related pain ( 24).

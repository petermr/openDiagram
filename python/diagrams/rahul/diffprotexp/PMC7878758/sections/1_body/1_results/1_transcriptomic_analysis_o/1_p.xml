<p id="Par6">A total of 42,551 transcripts sequences were obtained from the NGS analysis of all four tail tissue samples. All the sequences were obtained from a total of ~ 30 million reads from each sample. De novo and functional annotation yielded 39,953 transcripts with highest similarity with 
 <italic>Gekko japonicas</italic> (41.3%) and no blast hit (49%) to any reptilian database. The transcripts were submitted to NCBI and obtained accession number (SUB6743288 &amp; PRJNA587566;

The transcripts were further translated to obtain the protein sequence database for proteomic analysis.

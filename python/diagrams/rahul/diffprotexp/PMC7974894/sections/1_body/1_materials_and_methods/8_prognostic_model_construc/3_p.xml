 <italic>Exp</italic> represented the gene expression level. According to the median risk score survival analysis, tongue cancer patients were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. A log-rank test compared the difference of overall survival (OS) between the two subgroups. Additionally, a time dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was implemented by using the above model

<xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>). The ACE2 that achieved a binding energy below a given cutoff was suggested to be an effective receptor for SARS-CoV-2. During structure modeling and binding energy calculation, the N-glycosylation on ACE2 and S-RBD was ignored because current methods are not well adapted for modeling glycosylated amino acids.

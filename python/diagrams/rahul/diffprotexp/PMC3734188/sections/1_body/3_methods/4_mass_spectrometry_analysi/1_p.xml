<p>The proteins in the two pooled perfusate samples were reduced, alkylated and trypsin-digested as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The tryptic peptides were subsequently desalted via solid-phase extraction (Oasis column, Waters, Inc.) and dried by vacuum evaporation. The dried peptides were resuspended in an aqueous solution containing 0.1% formic acid. In each run, 25 μg of the tryptic peptides was loaded into a 0.32 × 100 mm Polysulfoethyl A (5 μm, 300 Å, PolyLC, Inc.) strong cation exchange (SCX) column and separated into six fractions using the following elution steps: 12.5 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM, 75 mM, 125 mM and 1 M ammonium acetate. Each SCX fraction was loaded in-line onto a peptide trap and then resolved using a 0.1 × 150 mm Magic C18AQ reverse phase column (Michrom Bioresources, Inc.) with the Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent, Inc.). Separation of the peptides was performed at 500 nL/min and was coupled with online analysis via tandem mass spectrometry using an LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, Inc.) equipped with a Michrom nanospray ionization source (Michrom Bioresources, Inc.). The elution gradient for the reverse phase column ranged from 95% mobile phase A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 97.9% water) to 40% mobile phase B (10% water, 0.1% formic acid, 89.9% acetonitrile) over 210 minutes. Peptide ions were detected in a survey scan from 400–2000 amu (1 μscan), followed by seven data-dependent MS/MS scans (1 μscan, isolation width of 2 m/z, 35% normalized collision energy, dynamic exclusion for 1 minute). Five technical replicate analyses were performed for each pooled perfusate sample.

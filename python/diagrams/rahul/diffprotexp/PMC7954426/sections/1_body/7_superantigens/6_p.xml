<p>MAM also has potential DNase activity. The seven different amino acids located at the N-terminus of MAM may represent the putative DNase homology region; and substituting one of these amino acids is sufficient to eliminate the enzymatic reaction [
 <xref rid="cit0292" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>], revealing that the homology region in the MAM N-terminus is important for maintaining its DNase activity. However, this nuclease activity was not substantially reduced in knockout strains [

<p>Fifty-five 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> were expressed under mannitol stress (concentration of 260 Î¼M for 24 h), out of which only 17 had an expression value of &gt; 2FC. Among these, S
 <italic>tbZIPs</italic> 21and 66 showed expression of FC &gt;5. Forty-eight 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> were expressed during water stress, out of which six 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> had an FC &gt;5. Among these, 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>1, 14, 25, 53, 54 and 82 had log2 FC values of &gt;2. Fifteen 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> were negatively regulated under water stress, and only 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>3, 38, 62, and 71 had negative log2FC &gt;2. Based on this data, 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> can be further selected for functional validation using forward and reverse genetics approaches.

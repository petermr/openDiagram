0: All protein samples from non-shock and shock groups were assessed by 2-DE; a minimum of three samples were run per group to ensure reproducibility.
1: In the first dimension of the 2-DE, protein samples (80 g) were applied to immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (17 cm, pH 310, NL;  Fig.
2: 1), which were rehydrated overnight at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions with DeStreak Rehydration Solution containing 0.4% ampholytes with pH 310.
3: The IPG strips were initially run at 50 V for 12 h, and subsequently focused at 250 V for 30 min, 1000 V for 1 h, 10000 V for 5 h, and maintained at 10000 V until a total of 60,000 V/h was achieved.
4: Following is on electric focusing (IEF), the IPG strips were equilibrated with 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 M urea, 87% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 0.2% bromophenol blue.
5: After initially treatment with 15 ml 1% DTT for 10 min with constant shaking, alkylation with 15 ml 2.5% indole-3-acetic acid was performed for 15 min.
6: Following IEF, the equilibrated strips were subjected to second dimensional separation (SDS-PAGE) using 1.0 mm-thick 10% polyacrylamide gels on a Bio-Rad PROTEAN II xi Cell system.
7: Staining was carried out with silver nitrate (CWBIO, Beijing, China).

<p>Complexes involved in RNAi leading to antiviral defense could be identified through mapping clean reads to CMV genome with the perfect match option. Therefore, the same alignment option as described above was followed to retrieve vsiRNA sequences. These sequences provide information about nucleotide size distribution and 5’ end base enrichment of vsiRNA that have been cleaved by quinoa RNA silencing factors. Forty five percent of vsiRNA had a length of 21 nt, and 30% were 22 nt (

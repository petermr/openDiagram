<p>The development of single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized the dissection of cellular heterogeneity and cell fate transition 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. From such studies, many novel insights have been proposed regarding reproductive system development, derived from single cell datasets in both males

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and females

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Recently, the credo of a limited ovarian reserve has been reinforced by single-cell analysis of human ovarian cortical tissue, where no oogonial stem cells were detected 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. In addition, the transcriptomic landscapes of germ cells during early murine oogenesis have been delineated, which concentrates on two vital germline events, meiotic initiation 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and PF assembly 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. Furthermore, the respective waves of PF formation in the ovarian cortex and medulla disclose two distinct pathways for pre-granulosa cell differentiation 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. To date, the effect of DEHP on PF assembly has not been thoroughly examined and deciphered.

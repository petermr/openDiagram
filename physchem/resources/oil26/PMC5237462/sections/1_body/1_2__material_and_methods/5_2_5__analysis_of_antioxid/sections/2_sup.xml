Meanwhile, the negative control was prepared, this being a mixture of 2.7&#8201;mL of methanol and the methanolic solution of evaluated compounds. After 30 minutes, the readings were taken in a spectrophotometer (Biospectro SP-22) at a wavelength of 517&#8201;nm. For comparison, ascorbic acid was evaluated.

0: STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes,  https://string-db.org/) database [ 16] can construct protein-protein interaction network to evaluate functional genomics data.
1: We used STRING online database to construct PPI network of DEGs, the obtained source files were imported into Cytoscape software for visual analysis and hub gene screening.
2: Meanwhile, MCC algorithm was used to select the top 10 hub genes.

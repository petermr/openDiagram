 <caption>
  <p>Differential protein expression in glycolysis and pyruvate catabolism. Pyruvate catabolism, with emphasis on enzymes with electron transport in upstream glycolysis. Enzymes with a white background were not identified in the protein dataset but have been included for completeness of pathway. Metabolites are shown in black boxes. Direction of differential expression in proteins is indicated using arrows and colors as designated in the top right corner. Fd, ferredoxin; ADH LTC, alcohol dehydrogenase lateral transfer candidate; KB, ketobutyrate; KG, ketoglutarate.</p>

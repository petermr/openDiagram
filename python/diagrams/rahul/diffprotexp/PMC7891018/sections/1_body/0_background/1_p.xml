<p id="Par20">H5N1, an influenza A virus (IAV), is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It was first isolated and identified in domestic geese in Guangdong Province, China, in 1996. The spread of H5N1 avian influenza illness in poultry populations increases the risk of human infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In May 1997, the first human H5N1 virus infection occurred in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China: 18 people were infected and 6 died. As of 2019, H5N1 IAV had migrated to at least 17 countries, caused 861 confirmed infections and 455 deaths in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To date, more than 850 cases of human infection with the H5N1 virus have been confirmed, with a mortality rate of approximately 60% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. H9N2, another IAV, is a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Individuals infected with LPAI H9N2 viruses generally have a mild upper respiratory tract illness, with only one death to date.

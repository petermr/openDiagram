<p id="Par48">At the completion of the behavioral assays, we collected three males from the T and control treatment groups to obtain trunk blood and brain tissue. While most males from T-treated eggs (68.8%) had an aggression score higher than the average control male, T males did show greater inter-individual variation in their behavioral responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which could have stemmed from variable sensitivities to the treatment. Therefore, as a first step toward understanding how prenatal T generates aggressive phenotypes, we minimized this within-group variability and selected males that were most sensitive to the treatment (i.e., males from T-injected eggs that had consistently high aggression scores), while also ensuring only unrelated males were selected to eliminate genetic bias (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S2, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Selecting unambiguously aggressive males is not dissimilar to other studies that have used individuals with behavioral extremes to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity (e.g., [

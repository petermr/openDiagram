 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-19-00095">Figure S3</xref>) contained six additional signals not observed in the HSQC spectrum, and these could all be assigned to non-protonated sp

 <sub>C</sub> 151.0 and 157.4 in combination with the presence of a two-proton broad singlet at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 9.05 suggested that a 1,3-di-
 <italic>N</italic>-methylpyrimidin-2-imino-4-one moiety was present in the molecule. HMBC correlations from the two methylene proton resonances and the amine proton at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 8.15 to the carbon resonances at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 147.9/148.0 suggested that a disubstituted dehydrothiomorpholine was present in the molecule. The chemical shift of the remaining carbon signal at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 120.6 was consistent with it being assigned to C-4a of the pyrimidine [

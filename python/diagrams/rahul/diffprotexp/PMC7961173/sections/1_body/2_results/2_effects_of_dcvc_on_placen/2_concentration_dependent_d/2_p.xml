<p id="Par31">Both 10 and 20 µM DCVC treatment in cells for 6 h caused differential gene expression with some overlap. For example, the only gene that met both criteria (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) for significant differential gene expression with 10 µM, 5′-aminolevulinate synthase 1 (
 <italic>ALAS1)</italic> (0.37 logFC [1.3 FC], FDR = 2.15 × 10
 <sup>–03</sup>)
 <italic>,</italic> was also differentially expressed with 20 µM (0.37 logFC [1.3 FC], FDR = 5.51 × 10
 <sup>–04</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The 10 µM DCVC treatment group yielded an additional 276 genes that had a logFC magnitude difference &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3] but did not meet the FDR criterion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, Suppl. Table 3). Consequently, 10 µM treatment for 6 h demonstrated the smallest transcriptional response out of all the comparisons made for HTR-8/SVneo cells. Whereas 20 µM DCVC treatment for 6 h yielded 7 differentially expressed genes that met FDR &lt; 0.05 criterion only, an additional 354 genes had a logFC magnitude difference &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3] only. Moreover, a total of 12 genes met both criteria (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, Suppl. Table 3). Among the genes that met both criteria, the highest magnitude differentially expressed genes between 20 µM-treated and controls were oxidative stress-induced growth inhibitor 
 <italic>(OSGIN1)</italic> (0.91 logFC [1.9 FC], FDR = 0.036), tripartite motif-containing 16-like 
 <italic>(TRIM16L)</italic> (0.63 logFC [1.5 FC], FDR = 0.036) and glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (
 <italic>CHAC1</italic>) (0.62 logFC [1.5 FC], FDR = 0.015) (Suppl. Table 3). Overall, these results indicate an increase in the number of genes differentially expressed with 20 µM DCVC, compared to 10 µM treatment.

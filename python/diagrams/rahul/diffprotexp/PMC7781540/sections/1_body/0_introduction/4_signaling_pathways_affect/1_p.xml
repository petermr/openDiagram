<p>Studies probing into signaling pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>) that are affected by K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers to produce these beneficial reductions in pro-inflammatory microglia functions 24 or 48 hours later have rendered somewhat conflicting results, suggesting that the effects of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers are dependent on the stimulus and maybe the species. While Fordyce 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers do not affect p38MAPK phosphorylation in LPS treated neonatal rat microglia [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], several other studies using mouse microglia have found that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers strongly reduce p38MAPK phosphorylation as well as activation of NF-κB following stimulation with LPS, AβO, αSyn
 <sub>Agg</sub> or HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 [

 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the microglial cell line BV2 K

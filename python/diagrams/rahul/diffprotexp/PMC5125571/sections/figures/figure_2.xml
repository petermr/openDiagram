  <title>Volcano plot of the significantly differentially expressed proteins.</title>
  <p>Differentially expressed proteins in hemocytes (A) and plasma (B) of 
   <italic>Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos</italic> following infection with 
   <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic> at different time points (24, 48 and 96 hpi) compared to controls. Volcano plots showing log

   <italic>P</italic>-values. Blue dots represent proteins with significantly down-regulated expression, while red dots represent proteins with significantly up-regulated expression. Proteins of interest discussed in the text have been labelled.

<p>On the other hand, analysis of EXAFS spectra by Mukerjee et al. and others suggested that Pt–Pt distances in all alloy samples are lower than in pure Pt, thus changes in interatomic distances can also be responsible for the increased activity.

 </sup> In fact, both effects seem to be correlated since an inverse relationship can be observed between the Pt–Pt bond distance and the Pt d-band occupation.

 </sup> The effect of the reduced Pt–Pt bond length (compressive strain due to alloying) on the weakening of the adsorption of oxygen species is also well reproduced in theoretical simulations.

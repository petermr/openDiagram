0: Here, we investigate differences in protein expression between congenital and acquired cholesteatomas using proteomic analysis (for protein mass screening) and immunohistochemistry.
1: Our data suggest that protein expression patterns in congenital cholesteatomas are quite different from those in acquired cholesteatomas and skin.
2: The results of our study may provide clues that allow for a better understanding of congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.

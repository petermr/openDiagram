  <p>Go-annotation enrichment for cell type-specific clusters. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Enriched pathways and their 
   <italic>p</italic>-values were obtained from the Fisher exact test &lt; 0.05 in Perseus. D1 cell type displays protein expression changes broadly associated with spliceosome, cell differentiation, metabolic pathways, and other biological pathways listed in this figure. (
   <bold>B</bold>) D2 cell type displays protein expression changes broadly associated with protein processing, inositol phosphate metabolism, protein maturation, and other biological pathways listed in this figure.

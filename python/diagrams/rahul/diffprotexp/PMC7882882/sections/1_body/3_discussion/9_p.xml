<p>A few limitations of the current study need to be acknowledged. First, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of these PCGs and lncRNAs in NFPA are still unclear, and further studies might provide important information to understand their functional roles. Second, sequencing data for NFPA are limited; thus, it was not possible to verify the results in an independent validation set. Third, the limited number of samples used for RT-qPCR testing make it necessary to perform larger scale experiments in the future. Finally, the application of the present signature in clinical practice should be tested prospectively. Despite these limitations, the current study verified a certain association between PCG and lncRNA signatures and regression, which is a potentially powerful prognostic marker of NFPA.</p>

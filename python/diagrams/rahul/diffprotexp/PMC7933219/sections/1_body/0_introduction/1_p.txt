0: Tumor metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related death in humans.
1: It is a complex process that involves a wide variety of cellcell communication ( HDaF, 1996).
2: According to the seed and soil hypothesis, primary tumor cells first invade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) and stromal cell layers, intravasate into the bloodstream, and then survive and disseminate in the circulation and reach distant organs ( Fidler, 2003).
3: During extravasation, the intact endothelium serves as a defensive barrier to prevent the extravasation of tumor cells.
4: During this complex cascade of events, tumor cells have shown an ability to induce endothelial changes by directly targeting cells via soluble factors, adhesion receptors, gap junctions, and vesicles ( Lopes-Bastos et al., 2016).
5: Evidence has been provided that tumor cells can increase the number of dead endothelial cells when they were co-cultured and that tumor cell-induced endothelial necroptosis promotes tumor cell extravasation and metastasis, leaving gaps in the endothelial barrier ( Strilic et al., 2016).
6: Additionally, tumor-induced activation of quiescent endothelial cells involves the expression of angiogenesis-related receptors and the induction of autocrine growth loops ( Khodarev et al., 2003).
7: Hence, investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms and biological processes during tumorendothelium interaction is important to understand and control tumor metastasis.

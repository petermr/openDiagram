<p>To gain direct molecular-scale insight into the hydration of birnessite, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of K
 <sup>+</sup>-saturated birnessite at different water loadings were also undertaken. The lattice of one UC
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
 </sup> was expanded into a system containing 6 × 12 × 4 UCs, with a composition of K
 <sub>144</sub>[Mn
 <sub>576</sub>O
 <sub>1152</sub>] × (H
 <sub>2</sub>O)
 <sub>3840</sub>. This initial composition corresponded to an average of 0.25 K
 <sup>+</sup> ions and 13.333 water molecules per UC. After energy minimization and 2 ns of volume and pressure optimization, 61 × 3 ns successive production runs in the isobaric–isothermal ensemble (
 <italic>NPT</italic>) were performed at decreasing water loadings. This was realized by successively evaporating a constant number of randomly selected water molecules (0.22 water molecules per UC per step) from each interlayer region, while preserving the same

 <sub>001</sub> of each interlayer at each step. Each evaporation step was followed by a 100 ps of pre-equilibration run not included in the analysis.

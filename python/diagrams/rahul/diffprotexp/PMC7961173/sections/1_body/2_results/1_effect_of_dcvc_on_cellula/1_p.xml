<p id="Par28">We evaluated key biological processes as indicators of acute cytotoxicity after exposure to 0–20 µM DCVC for up to 12 h in the HTR-8/SVneo cell line. We previously reported that 12-h 20 µM DCVC treatment did not cause cell death in the same cell line (Elkin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020b</xref>). Here, we extended those findings by showing that the maximal 12-h 20 µM DCVC treatment did not cause significant expression changes in genes that regulate apoptosis (Suppl. Table 1). Moreover, there were no significant DCVC-induced changes in cell cycle progression (Suppl Fig. 1), proliferation (Suppl Fig. 2) or the majority of genes that regulate these cellular functions (Suppl. Table 2). These results suggest that the concentrations and time durations used in this study did not cause overt toxicity in the cell model, likely due to biological resilience at these stages.

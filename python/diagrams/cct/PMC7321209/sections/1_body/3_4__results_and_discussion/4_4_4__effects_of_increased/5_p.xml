<p>Between the 4th and 10th layer, the t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times for a CTWD of 12 mm were slightly lower of approximately t
 <sub>8/5</sub> = 1.5 s in comparison to a CTWD of 28 mm, respectively 44 mm. This development is controversial to the process behavior and reduced energy input per unit length with increasing CTWD. The reason for the opposite development is the fact that the weld bead geometry and thus the conditions of heat conduction to the substrate change with increasing contact tube distance. The width of the weld bead (compare

The effect of thermal conduction is the essential driver of heat transfer close to the substrate. This observation is consistent with the research of Cunningham et al. [

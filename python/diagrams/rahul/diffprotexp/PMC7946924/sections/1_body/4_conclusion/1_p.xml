<p id="Par43">In the present study, the intent was to obtain credible information on master modulation of gene expression by miRNAs and their target genes associated with hormonal dynamics that obfuscate processes governing genotype difference of rice cultivars in quantum of grain filling. In pursuit, two etreme type spikelets of panicle, apical and basal, were assessed for epigenetic regulation of grain filling in high sterile SR-159 and low sterile SR-157 RIL lines with reference to genes regulating ethylene and auxin homeostasis. The inferior basal spikelets of SR-159 were most vulnerable to the detrimental action of the hormones that resulted in poor grain filling and thereby widened gradient of grain weight between apical and basal spikelets of cultivar SR-159 compared to SR-157. The study identified gene targets of MIR2877 and MIR530-5p for ethylene and MIR396h for auxin homeostasis pathways at very early post anthesis stage. The credence given to the hypothesis of ethylene induced grain morbidity at this stage is conceptually more invincible because fold change values of DGE and the pattern of expression (relative transcript level) of miRNAs matched in the qRT-PCR studies. In furtherance, the targets of miRNAs on transcriptome dynamics of protein factors controlling ethylene perception and transduction and auxin homeostasis were evaluated for confirmation in qRT-PCR. This information is valuable for promotion of grain filling of disadvantaged spikelets of rice panicle, where morbidity for sometime immediately after fertilization curtails endosperm cell number and final seed size.</p>

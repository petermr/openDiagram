0: 45 cutaneous neurofibromas, 17 plexiform neurofibromas, and 9 normal skin and nerve samples were collected from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
1: These samples were collected prospectively under an approved Spectrum Health/Van Andel Research Institute IRB protocol (SH/VAI IRB#2014295) (NCT02777775).
2: Additional specimens were analyzed according to ethical standards and under a Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol (JH IRB # J1649, PI Pratilas).
3: The JH NF1 biospecimen repository is supported by a grant from the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP, n-tap.org), to C.A.P.
4: Analysis by Sage Bionetworks is supported through the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP, n-tap.org).
5: Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
6: Tumor samples were isolated by microdissection to remove adjacent normal tissue then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80 C. Quality parameters included assessment of percent content (> 95%) and viability (> 90% nuclear viability) by H/E staining.
7: Biospecimen handling was performed according to BRISQ guidelines.

<p id="p0105">A 2-DE-based comparative proteomics analysis was performed to investigate the possible target-related proteins of RGE in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Extracted proteins were separated by using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) to detect the quality of protein extraction (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). The proteins were further separated by using 2-DE and silver stained to evaluate their relative abundance levels by analyzing all protein spots from three independent replicates using an imaging software (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B and C). Among the 65 differentially abundant protein spots on the 2-DE gels, 38 spots were successfully identified by using MALDI-TOF MS/MS (

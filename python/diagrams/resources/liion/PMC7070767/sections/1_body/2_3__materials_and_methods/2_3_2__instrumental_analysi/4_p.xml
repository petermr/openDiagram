<p>The results of capacitive properties and stability were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface and galvanostatic charge-discharge by BioLogic SP-200. Cyclic voltammetry of samples BatS1, BatS2, and BatS3 was performed in an LP40 (1M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in 1:1 ethylene carbonate (EC): dimethyl carbonate (DMC)) as electrolyte, glass fiber separator and Li foil as counter and reference electrode at room temperature and scan rate 1 mV/s. To assess the charge/discharge capability the electrodes were galvanostatically cycled between 2.0 and 0.1 V vs. Li/Li

<p>To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced DU sensitivity observed after MT knockout, the differences in protein samples from kidney tissues collected after exposure of MT+/+ mice and MT−/− mice to DU or normal saline for 4 d were evaluated using 2-DE. Typical results of silver staining of 2-DE images of samples in all groups are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. Image analysis was conducted using Image Master 2D Elite 3.01. A total of 5,488 protein spots (about 1,300/gel) were discovered in these 4 groups, and the matching rate between two groups reached 78.042–80.88%. Pairwise comparisons between these 4 groups revealed 43 differential points using a 2-fold difference as a cut-off. After the images stained with silver were analysed using ImageMaster 2D Elite 3.01, 17 differentially expressed protein spots visible to the naked eye on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were selected. The specific locations are shown in

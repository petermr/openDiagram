<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">On the basis of the calculated
binding energy and experimental data,
we mapped the ACE2 usage effectiveness for each of the 285 species
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Fish (including <italic>Actinopterygii</italic>, <italic>Chondrichthyes</italic>, and <italic>Sarcopterygii</italic>), amphibians, reptiles, and birds were predicted
to have a relatively high binding energy (&gt; &#8722;47 EEU), suggesting
the ACE2 proteins of these species may be less permissive to SARS-CoV-2
binding. Mammals showed the broadest binding energy distribution,
from &#8722;56.21 to &#8722;38.67 EEU (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>). 97 nonhuman mammals achieved a binding energy below &#8722;47
EEU; that is, besides the experimentally validated species, another
49 species were also predicted to have an effective ACE2 receptor
for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>). These results
suggest that mammals rather than other species are likely to be the
main source of SARS-CoV-2 and hence they should be the major focus.
This finding is also consistent with previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>&#8722;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> but a more quantitative measurement was given here. Our findings
also refute isolated reports claiming that nonmammal vertebrates such
as reptiles could be the intermediate host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup></p>

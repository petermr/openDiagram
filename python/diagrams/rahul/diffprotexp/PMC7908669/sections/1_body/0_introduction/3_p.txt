0: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large set of newly characterized non-coding RNA molecules that are covalently closed and in single-stranded form.
1: They are synthesized through the back-splicing of pre-mRNAs (precursor mRNA) encoded by eukaryotic genes [ 17].
2: Recent reports have demonstrated that circRNAs are broadly expressed in distinct tissues and cell types to modulate functional gene expression, mainly by sponging microRNA (miRNA), regulating transcription, and even influencing the pre-mRNA splicing process [ 17].
3: Because of their significant impact on gene expression, the dysregulated expression of circRNA profiles has been reported to be closely associated with the pathogenesis of various human disorders, such as cancer, neurological diseases, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and cardiovascular disorders [ 18].
4: The expression of circ_0002060 and other circRNAs have been suggested to be potential markers for OP diagnosis because of their correlation with OP pathogenesis [ 19,  20].
5: Furthermore, circRNA_0016624 was recently shown to regulate the progression of postmenopausal OP by sponging miR-98 to modulate the expression of the  BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) gene [ 19].
6: Similarly, OP induced by glucocorticoids may be alleviated by circRNA_0006393 by sponging miR-145-5p to elevate forkhead box O1 ( FOXO1) gene expression [ 21].
7: Additionally, the proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs and their effects on osteogenesis were also recently reported to be modulated by circRNAs [ 22].
8: However, little is known about the implications of circRNAs in the effects of MEL on BMSC osteogenic differentiation and OP progression.

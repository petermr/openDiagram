<p>AQP2 was successfully down-regulated in LPS-induced HK-2 cells after the transfection of si-AQP2 (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), which guaranteed the effectiveness of si-AQP2 in later cell transfection for investigation of the miR-34b-5p/AQP2 axis. The apoptosis rate was reduced in the LPS + inhibitor + si-NC group while increased in the LPS + inhibitor + si-AQP2 group (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, vs the LPS + inhibitor NC + si-NC and LPS + inhibitor + si-NC group, respectively). Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were decreased while Bcl-2 was increased in the LPS + inhibitor + si-NC group compared to the LPS + inhibitor NC + si-NC group; inverse expression patterns of these apoptosis-related proteins were detected in the LPS + inhibitor + si-AQP2 group in comparison with the LPS + inhibitor + si-NC group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(D)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were down-regulated in the LPS + inhibitor + si-NC group while up-regulated in the LPS + inhibitor + si-AQP2 group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(E–G)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, vs the LPS + inhibitor NC + si-NC and LPS + inhibitor + si-NC group, respectively). Taken together, miR-34b-5p inhibits AQP2 to promote LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response in HK-2 cells.

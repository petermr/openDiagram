0: Additionally, a control problem within the DSC measurement at high quenching rates must be considered.
1: The maximum cooling rate possible is dependent on the temperature difference between the DSC furnace and the cold block, which necessarily decreases during the cooling process.
2: Therefore, the scan rate may fall to below the programmed value.
3: When the actual cooling rate of the experiment switches from the cooling step to zero during isothermal soaking, it is inevitable that cooling becomes slower than any critical cooling rate.
4: Hence, a reasonable starting point must be defined.

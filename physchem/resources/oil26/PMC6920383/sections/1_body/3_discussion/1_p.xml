<p id="Par25">Burrowing affected vegetation characteristics and soil properties in all three environments. These biogeomorphological impacts were mostly inconsistent between the sites, differing in their nature and/or magnitude, and highlight the difficulty of predicting the impacts of ecosystem engineering in different environments. Some impacts were, however, consistent across all three sites, including lower vegetation cover at both burrow entrances and impacted areas than at controls. This is consistent with results from other studies, which show lower plant cover at burrow mounds than in undisturbed surrounding areas

 </sup>, and in some cases even at mounds of long abandoned burrows

 </sup>. In our study, the lower plant cover is not driven by changes to soil physical properties (i.e. soil temperature, moisture and compaction) within and around burrows, because burrowing had inconsistent effects on soil characteristics at the different sites. The reduced cover is therefore, more likely due to the burying and uprooting of vegetation during burrow creation

 </sup>. Hereafter, vegetation cover may remain low at burrows for an extended time, possibly due to disturbances associated with the use of burrows by both the original creator and other subsequent occupant species. As a result, disturbances associated with the creation of burrows may negatively affect vegetation cover, potentially for the entire lifespan of the burrow

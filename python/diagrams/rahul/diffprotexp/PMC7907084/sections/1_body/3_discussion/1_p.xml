<p id="Par25">It has long been proposed that in avian ovaries, granulosa cells encircling the oocyte in large preovulatory follicles show heterogeneity and can be roughly subdivided into two cell subpopulations: Gp cells which is proximal to the GD and Gd cells which is distal to the GD. These two granulosa cell subpopulations are likely to differ in their morphology, proliferative potential, and steroidogenic capacity. However, this hypothesis still lacks molecular evidence for support. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of Gp and Gd cells and provided clear evidence for their heterogeneity and possible functional difference.</p>

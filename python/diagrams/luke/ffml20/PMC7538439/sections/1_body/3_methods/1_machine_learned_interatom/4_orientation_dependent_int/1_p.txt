0: The orientation-dependent contribution is the last considered.
1: These are fitted to the residuals once covalent and pairwise interactions are subtracted from the DFT energies.
2: The corresponding fingerprints for the orientation-dependent interactions are listed in Supplementary Note  3 and Supplementary Table  2.

 <caption> Average interaction force experienced by nascent chain atoms with ERY and the ribosome when we turned on non-bonded parameters one by one residue. ( A) Average non-bonded interaction force, per nascent chain atom, between the nascent chain and Erythromycin. ( B) Average non-bonded interaction force, per nascent chain atom, between the nascent chains and the ribosome. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Line is to guide the eye and does not represent a model. Note well, the individual trajectory force traces were first aligned such that F max occurs at time equal to zero, and then the average across trajectories was calculated. </caption>

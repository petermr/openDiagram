<p>Video observations consisted of instantaneous scan sampling at one-minute intervals, all-occurrence, and continuous sampling. Three 20-min observations on each aardvark occurred seven days a week for eight weeks, resulting in a total of 168 observations or 56 h for each aardvark. The first observation of the night started when the animal care staff set down the last enrichment item in the aardvarks’ habitat, usually between 21:00 and 22:00 (PM). The second and third observations of the night took place between 00:30 and 01:30 (MID), and 04:00 and 05:00 (AM). At each scan, we recorded the focal’s behavior (

0: The kinetic curve of DOX adsorption on modified MWCNTs was determined as described above at 298 K. The initial concentration of DOX was chosen on the basis of the adsorption isotherm (the concentration at which the isotherm reached maximum).
1: The obtained mixtures were shaken for 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 min, respectively.
2: Next, the concentration of DOX was determined by the spectrophotometric standard curve method [ 69].
3: In order to evaluate the effect of contact time on the amounts of DOX adsorbed on modified and nonmodified MWCNTs, the adsorption capacity at time  t was calculated according to Equation (2): (10)qt=VC0Ctm where  m (g) is the mass of adsorbent,  V (mL) is the total solution volume, and  C0 and  C  t (mg mL 1) represent the initial and time ( t) concentrations of DOX.

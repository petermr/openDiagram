<p>Type I and type II interferons are cytokines produced in response to viral infections and have critical roles in limiting viral pathogenesis. While type I IFNs induce an antiviral response through the production of molecules that will directly interfere with viral replication, both type I and type II IFNs contribute to the activation of components of innate and adaptive immune responses [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. A lack of type I IFN responses resulted in severe disease characterized by decreased ISG expression, exacerbated viral load, microgliosis and higher expression of proinflammatory mediators. On the other hand, a lack of type II IFN was moderately beneficial to mouse survival, but did not affect viral load, proinflammatory cytokine production, ISG expression or the recruitment of leukocytes to the brain. Therefore, we conclude that type I and type II IFNs have distinct roles in experimental SLEV infection.

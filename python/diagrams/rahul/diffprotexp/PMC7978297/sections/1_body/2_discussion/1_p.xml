<p>DEHP is widely used as a plasticizer and is ubiquitous in every-day products; its toxicity has been well demonstrated by numerous studies

Meanwhile, during PF assembly in mammals, the multicellular regulatory networks make the parsing of its mechanism tough and many biological enigmas remain unknown. In the current study, using a maternal perinatal exposure of DEHP from 16.5 dpc to postnatal day 3, scRNA-seq was used to investigate the alteration of transcriptome programs in pup ovaries to explore how the gene regulation networks and cell interaction were affected by DEHP during PF formation in mice.

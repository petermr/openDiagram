<p>The stained gels were scanned using an ImageScanner and LabScan 3.00 software (Amersham Biosciences). Image analysis was carried out using the ImageMaster 2D, version 2002.1 (Amersham Biosciences). In this study, we performed 2DE on three repeats of each sample, respectively. To prevent variation between different 2DE gels, all volumes of protein spots in the 2DE map were normalized by using the ratio of each spot over the sum.</p>

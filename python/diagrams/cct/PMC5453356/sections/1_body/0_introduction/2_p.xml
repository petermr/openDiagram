<p>The most important heat treatment to increase the strength of aluminum alloys is precipitation hardening, which is composed of three steps: solution annealing, quenching and ageing. The maximal strength values can be achieved only when age hardening aluminum alloys are quenched above a critical rate. If quenching is too slow, coarse precipitates will form during cooling. Those coarse precipitates do not increase the strength, but reduce the remaining solid solution available for the growth of strengthening precipitates during ageing.</p>

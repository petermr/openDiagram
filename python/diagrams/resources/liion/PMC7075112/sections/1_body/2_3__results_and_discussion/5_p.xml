<p>The rate property of the HPC anode is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. Reversible capacities of 604, 512, 399, 279, and 175 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> are achieved at different current densities from 100 to 2000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. When the current density comes back to 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the specific capacity returns to 460 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, revealing a goodish rate performance. To further improve the rate performance, some previous reported methods, including nitrogen/phosphorus doping, conductive metal doping, and forming a three-dimensional conductive cross-linked carbon network, can be adopted [

 <xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The related work can be carried out in the future. The HPC electrode also exhibits good cycling performances (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). When cycled for 50 cycles, the reversible capacity of the HPC anode reaches 593.4 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>. After cycling for 100 cycles, the reversible capacity of the HPC anode can be stabilized at 581.2 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Even cycling at a high current density of 1000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the HPC anode shows a discharge capacity around 300 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> invariably, revealing an outstanding cycling stability. After 1000 cycles, a reversible capacity of 298.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> still remains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). The good rate and cycling performance could be ascribed to the unique hierarchical porous structure of the biomass carbon material.

  <p>Relative expression levels of VATA, GPDA, HSP70, 1433Z, UCHL1, and ALF by Western blot analysis. (A) Western blotting in this study was performed in triplicate and the target protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry using Image J processing software and normalized to the signal intensity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). (B) The data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed using Student 
   <italic>t</italic> test. Statistical significance: *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 (RGE-treated vs. wild type). 1433Z, 14-3-3 zeta; ALF, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; GPDA, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HSP70, heat shock 70 kDa protein; UCHL1, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase; VATA, V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A.

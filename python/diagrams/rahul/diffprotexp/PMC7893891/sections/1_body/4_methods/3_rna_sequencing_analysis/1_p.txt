0: Extracted and DNase-treated RNA was quantified using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher) with the High Sensitivity RNA reagents and Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with RNA 6000 Pico reagents.
1: Ribosomal depletion, DNA conversion, and library preparation was performed on all samples using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit.
2: 151 base pair reads were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq.
3: Across fifteen samples (three independent experiments x five time points) the total number of reads generated for each sample ranged from approximately 26 million to 40 million reads.
4: Sequencing data was quality trimmed using FaQCs [ 56] with a quality score cutoff of Q20.
5: Differential expression analysis was performed using PiReT [ 57] V 0.3.2 and utilizing DEseq2 [ 58] default parameters and setting a q-value of 0.05 (false discovery rate metric).
6: The experimental design file (provided in the supplementary material) was used to dictate the replicate sample IDs and sequencing data to be used in the PiReT analysis.
7: Human genome version hg38 was used as the reference genome.
8: KEGG [ 59,  60] pathway mapping was performed using Omics Pathway Viewer - OPaver (Li, unpublished).
9: Raw RNA-Seq reads were deposited in the NCBI SRA database under the accession numbers SRR11994167- SRR11994181.
10: Metadata for each sample are also accessible under NCBI BioProject PRJNA638768.

<p>On the other hand, while the use of 2D-PAGE gels coupled to protein sequencing by MS is a mature and powerful method, widely used for protein characterization, the analysis of a complete proteome is not always possible with this approach. It has been shown that only 40% of the proteins in a typical 2D-PAGE gel are sufficiently abundant to be identified by MS (20).</p>

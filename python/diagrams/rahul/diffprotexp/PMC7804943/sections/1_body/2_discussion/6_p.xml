 </sup>. However, to-date, these studies have primarily relied on measuring GE changes. As differential GE patterns between cell and tissue types are generally more conserved than differences at the level of post-transcriptional regulation

 </sup>. It is also important to note that our results are based on analyzing cell types initially identified by gene expression markers and, therefore, probably also underestimate neuronal diversity driven by post-transcriptional regulation. Therefore, based in part on the findings of the present study, in the future it can be anticipated that additional spatially and functionally distinct neuronal subtypes will be defined by integrating measurements from multiple transcriptomic regulatory lawyers. Our results thus highlight the importance of developing cost-effective approaches to measure and incorporate the analyses of multiple regulatory layers when identifying and characterizing distinct neuronal subtypes using single-cell RNA-seq.

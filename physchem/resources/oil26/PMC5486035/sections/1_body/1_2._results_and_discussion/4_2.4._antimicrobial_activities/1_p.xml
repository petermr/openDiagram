Results of negative controls indicated the complete absence of inhibition of all the strains tested (data not shown). A concentration of 7.11 mg/mL inhibited the growth of all the tested strains with the exception of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9027. The same concentration was found to be bactericidal against all strains. Several studies have previously demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils [<xref rid="B32-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The compound 4-carene, also identified amongst the main constituents of the Iranian Cymbobogon Olivieri essential oil, has been implicated in the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and the yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref rid="B35-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

<p id="Par31">In the present study, we domesticated the mandarin fish to accept artificial diets, and conducted the transcriptome sequencing and metabolome analysis to search the common pathways of transcriptome sequencing and metabolome. In addition, using western blotting and bisulfite sequencing PCR, we examined the methylation of histone and DNA, to investigate the molecular mechanism of food habits domestication in mandarin fish, which could promote the culture of mandarin fish with artificial diets.</p>

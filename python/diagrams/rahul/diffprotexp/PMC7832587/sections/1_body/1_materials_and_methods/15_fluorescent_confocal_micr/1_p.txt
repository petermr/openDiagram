0: 1 mL of small-scale cultures was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000   g followed by two washing steps with 1 mL of PBS pH 7.4.
1: The cells were re-suspended in 1 mL of PBS pH 7.4, and 2 L were deposited on an agarose pad (1% (w/v) agarose gel in milliQ water).
2: The pictures were taken in the Light Microscopy Facility of ImaGif (I2BC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) using a Leica confocal microscope SP8 controlled by the LAS-X software and using an oil immersion objective lens with 100 x magnification.
3: Samples were excited with a 488 nm laser.

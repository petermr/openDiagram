<p id="Par19">A total of 21,282 lncRNAs (including 1797 known lncRNAs and 19,485 novel lncRNAs) and 43,674 mRNAs were identified from four groups (MM_F, MM_L, ww_F and ww_L) (Supplementary material 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">1</xref>A, B, 
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Overall, 10,785 intronic lncRNAs, 7091 intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) and 1609 antisense lncRNAs were screened in the novel lncRNAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Four comparison groups were set based on their genotypes and estrous cycle, MM_FP vs MM_LP, MM_FP vs ww_FP, MM_LP vs ww_LP, and ww_FP vs ww_LP. For MM_FP vs MM_LP, 17 lncRNAs and 414 mRNAs were upregulated, 22 lncRNAs and 350 mRNAs were downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, Supplementary material 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">3</xref>A, 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">4</xref>A). For MM_FP vs ww_FP, 11 lncRNAs and 122 mRNAs were upregulated, 29 lncRNAs and 116 mRNAs were downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, Supplementary material 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">3</xref>B, 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">4</xref>B). For MM_LP vs ww_LP, 12 lncRNAs and 86 mRNAs were upregulated, 18 lncRNAs and 154 mRNAs were downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, Supplementary material 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">3</xref>C, 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">4</xref>C). For ww_FP vs ww_LP, 64 lncRNAs and 208 mRNAs were upregulated, 32 lncRNAs and 388 mRNAs were downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, Supplementary material 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">3</xref>D, 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">4</xref>D). All DE lncRNAs (

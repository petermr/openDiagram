<p id="Par2">Programmed cell deaths (PCDs) are a group of diversified processes that are triggered by stress or developmental events, occurring in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. The main phenomenon are associated to the activation of complex molecular pathways that lead to membrane depolarization, DNA fragmentation and breakdown of the plasma membrane
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Specific events involving translation processes during PCD have also been reported. In 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, it has been shown that, during apoptosis, there is a reduction in cap-dependent translation, because of the cap cleavage by caspase 3, or by changes in the phosphorylation state of canonical initiation factors (including eIF4G, eIF4B, eIF4EBP1, and eIF2α)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, certain mRNAs, coding for proteins that are essential to the apoptotic process (including Apaf-1
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup> and c-Myc
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>), are translated by the recognition of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> changes in protein synthesis act as a physiological signal to initiate cell death in germ cells. In particular, a modification of the balance between the two eIF4G isoforms (the long and the short ones) disrupts cap-dependent mRNA translation in favor of a cap-independent mechanism. Indeed, the depletion of the long eIF4G isoform promotes the cap-independent translation, inducing the translation of pro-apoptotic proteins

 </sup>. Lastly, in 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the pro-apoptotic protein Reaper binds specifically the 40S subunit, affecting the AUG recognition, thereby inhibiting cap-dependent translation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>, and facilitating the selective translation of specific pro-apoptotic mRNAs thanks to the recognition of IRES segments
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Interestingly, the involvement of the translational machinery in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> PCD has been clearly described by the MazEF module
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, in the toxin–antitoxin system. Stress conditions (like amino acid starvation, exposure to antibiotics, DNA damage and phage infection, overproduction of ppGpp
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>) reduce MazE levels in the cell, favoring the release of the MazF toxin
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. This endoribonuclease can produce leaderless mRNAs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> and modify 16S rRNA structure in the ribosomes, producing the “stress ribosomes”
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. These events dramatically affect the overall translational process
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>, determining the parallel production of “death” (ClpP, SlyD, YfiD, ElaC, YgcR, and YfbU) and of “survival” (YajQ, RsuA, and DeoC) proteins, promoting a higher propensity to cell death

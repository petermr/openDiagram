0: RNAseq datasets obtained from different brain regions were used (Mayo 2; MSBB 3; ROSMAP 4).
1: Datasets were downloaded from AMP-AD Knowledge Portal ( https://www.synapse.org) following all terms and conditions to use the data.
2: The brain area analyzed and the number of individuals per condition was the following: Mayo - Temporal cortex, which neuroanatomically subdivides into the inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri (STG), and cytoarchitectonically can be subdivided into Brodmann areas (BM, instead of BA) 20/21/22/41/42 49,  N = 160 subjects (82 AD and 78 controls); MSBB - BM22, which is part of the Wernickes area in the STG,  N = 159 subjects (98 AD and 61 controls); MSBB BM36, corresponding to the lateral perirhinal cortex,  N = 154 subjects (88 AD and 64 controls); MSBB BM10, corresponding to the anterior prefrontal cortex,  N = 176 subjects (105 AD and 71 controls); MSBB BM44, corresponding to the inferior frontal gyrus,  N = 153 subjects (90 AD and 63 controls); and ROSMAP - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), containing BM46 and part of BM9,  N = 423 subjects (222 AD and 201 controls).
3: Unless stated otherwise, data obtained from different analyses were grouped in temporal lobe (TL) - Mayo, MSBB BM22 and MSBB BM26; or frontal lobe (FL) - ROSMAP, MSBB BM10 and MSBB BM44.

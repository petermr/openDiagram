 <caption> IVT-SAPAS reads and poly(A) sites in IPEC-J2 cells. a Genomic location of reads. b Distribution of poly(A) sites. c Genes with different numbers of tandem poly(A) sites. d Boxplot of the median distances between stop codons and poly(A) sites in genes with single poly(A) sites and distances between stop codons and closest poly(A) sites or farthest poly(A) sites in genes with APA in the 3′-end. The elements of box means the upper limit of outliers; 75th percent (Q1); 50th percent (Q2); 25th percent (Q3); the lower limit of outliers. The circles in box plot means outlier. The upper limit of outliers = Q3 + 1.5*(Q3-Q1); the lower limit of outliers = Q1-1.5*(Q3-Q1). (E) PAS usage of poly(A) sites. ucsc: database of University of California, Santa Cruz </caption>

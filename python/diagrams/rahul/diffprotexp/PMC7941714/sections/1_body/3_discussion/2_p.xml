<p id="Par52">In this study, we analyzed TCGA sequence data from CRC patients and constructed a prognostic ceRNA network to explore the potential function of lncRNAs and their related genes. MIR4435-2HG and ELFN1-AS1 were identified as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CRC based on survival and clinical feature analysis. MIR4435-2HG promotes CRC growth and metastasis through the miR-206/YAP1 axis and predicts poor prognosis in CRC patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. ELFN1-AS1 is elevated in CRC tissues, and its upregulation promotes CRC cell proliferation and migration and inhibits apoptosis by competing with the endogenous miR-4644/TRIM44 axis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While downregulation of ELFN1-AS1 suppresses the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), decreases vimentin expression, and increases E-cadherin expression.

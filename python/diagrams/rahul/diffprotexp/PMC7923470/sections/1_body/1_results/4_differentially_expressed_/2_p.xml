<p id="Par40">Mevalonate pathway has a minor contribution to the GA biosynthesis pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this regard, we observed that two GHMP kinase genes (
 <italic>Ma08_g34050</italic> and 
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb08t33270</italic>) having mevalonate kinase activity (based on GO annotation) had increased expression in MT. It is also known that cytosolic acetyl-CoA is further involved in the biosynthesis of mevalonate-derived isoprenoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. One gene (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb01t19300</italic>) annotated as cytosolic acetyl-CoA showed decreased expression in MT.

0: Previously, we carried out a series of studies to research the relationship between MHC polymorphisms and resistance or susceptibility to CE in native Chinese sheep, including Chinese Merino [ 21], Duolang [ 28], and Kazakh sheep [ 29].
1: Our previous studies indicated that in Kazakh sheep, when exposed to the same number of parasites, the rate of  E. granulosus infection in the internal organs of sheep with haplotype  MHC MvaI bc- SacII ab- Hin1I ab haplotype was significantly lower than in sheep without this haplotype.
2: Statistical results and analysis showed that sheep with this haplotype have an increased genetic capability to respond to and subsequently reject  E. granulosus when infected.
3: The haplotype  MHC MvaI bc -SacII ab -Hin1I ab was therefore identified as a genetic marker of CE resistance in Kazakh sheep [ 29].

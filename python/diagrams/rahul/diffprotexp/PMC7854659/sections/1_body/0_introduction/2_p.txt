0: The brain, liver, and muscle tissues have different priorities in nutrient partitioning when limited resources are available, affecting their development and functionality 8,  12.
1: The liver plays a key role in body energy metabolism 13, whereas the brain, by regulating liver metabolism, prioritizes its own glucose needs over those of other tissues 14.
2: Thus, with restricted energy availability, more glucose is allocated for the functioning of the central nervous system 14, potentially impairing muscle development and reducing muscle mass 12.
3: Reduced number of myofibers and liver sizes have been reported in nutrient restricted sheep fetuses and adults, respectively 15,  16.
4: Furthermore, intrauterine growth restricted bovine fetuses showed increased brain weight as a percentage of fetal body weight in response to early maternal undernutrition 6.
5: Altogether, the nutritional regulation of fetal programming underlies a complex genomic regulatory network that modulates gene expression and leads to changes in tissue structure and function 2,  3,  8.
6: Differences in gene expression patterns and regulation of epigenetic mechanisms were reported as underlying the tissue-specific metabolic changes observed in nutrient restricted offspring 1,  15  17.

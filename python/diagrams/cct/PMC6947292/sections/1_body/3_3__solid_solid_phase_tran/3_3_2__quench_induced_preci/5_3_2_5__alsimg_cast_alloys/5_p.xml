 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f072">Figure 72</xref> shows a substantial acceleration of quench-induced precipitation and the drop in hardness is shifted to faster cooling rates for a shorter solution treatment in the case of a much finer initial microstructure prior to cooling (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f071">Figure 71</xref>). The UCCR of the finer eutectic structure (after 20 min soaking at 525 Â°C) appears to be above 1000 K/s. For this reason, the difference in the solution treatments between Al7Si0.3Mg and Al10Si0.3 should be kept in mind when considering

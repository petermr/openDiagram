0: HCAECs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and sealed with bovine serum albumin (BSA).
1: Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (1:500 dilutions, Beyotime) was used to detect rabbit anti-E-selectin (1:200 dilutions, CST, Danvers, USA).
2: Dil (Beyotime) was used for cell membrane labeling.
3: Here, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Keygen) was used for nucleus labeling.
4: Fluorescence was measured by confocal microscopy.
5: The NIS Element Viewer statistical software was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity.

<p>The nucleation mechanism of the low-temperature plate particle precipitation is not yet fully resolved. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f026">Figure 26</xref> (middle and right image) show that plate-shaped Si particles with a length of several Âµm have nucleated on an equiaxed particle of about 200 nm diameter. It therefore appears that at a cooling rate close to the critical cooling rate, some of the plate-shaped particles forming in the LTR can nucleate on fine Si particles formed in the HTR. However, this is only possible if there is a sufficient driving force for precipitation during the LTR in the vicinity of the equiaxed particle, i.e., if the HTR reaction is incomplete and leaves a substantial supersaturation of Si in the Al-rich phase near the small equiaxed particle. This explains why this type of nucleation of plate-shaped particles is only seen for cooling rates close to the critical cooling rate.

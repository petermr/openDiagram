<p id="Par23">Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on their normalised reads count. To study the effects of the progeny stress treatment, paired-comparisons were made between AtCC and AtCW, AtWC and AtWW (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). For progeny from the control parents, 463 genes showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) between the control and water-deficit treatment group in the flag leaf (AtCW_L vs AtCC_L). In the developing grains, 77 genes showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1, AtCW_G vs AtCC_G). For progeny from the stressed parents, 727 genes showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) between the control and water-deficit treatment group in the flag leaf (AtWW_L vs AtWC_L). In the developing grains, 204 genes showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1, AtWW_G vs AtWC_G). It appears that in both leaf and developing grain tissues, there were a higher number of DEGs responsive to water-deficit stress in the progeny from the stressed parents (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Further KEGG pathway enrichment analysis provided information on the biological functions of these stress-responsive DEGs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Some pathways were triggered under watered-deficit stress in both progeny from the control and the stressed parents, while some pathways are specific to progeny from the stressed parents. For example, in the flag leaf tissue, KEGG pathways such as starch and sucrose metabolism and MAPK signalling pathway − plant were enriched in progeny from both the control and stressed parents (AtCW_L vs AtCC_L; AtWW_L vs AtWC_L). Pathways like carotenoid biosynthesis and porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism were only enriched in progeny from the stressed parents (AtWW_L vs AtWC_L).

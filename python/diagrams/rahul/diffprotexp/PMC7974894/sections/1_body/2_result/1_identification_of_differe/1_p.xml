<p>Here, to investigate the role of RBPs in tongue cancer, we conducted a systematic analysis of key roles and prognostic values of RBPs. The study design was illustrated in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. We first downloaded the RNA-seq and clinical datasets from TCGA, including 147 tumor tissues and 15 normal tissues. The “Limma” packages were implemented to handle the data and discovered the differently expressed genes. A total of 3823 RBPs were then included in the analysis (

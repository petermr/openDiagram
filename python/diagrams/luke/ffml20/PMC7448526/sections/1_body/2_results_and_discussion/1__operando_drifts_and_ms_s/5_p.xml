<p>Furthermore, we have verified the occurrence of loading dependent room temperature methoxylation by isotopic methanol experiments using CD
 <sub>3</sub>OH. Zeolites with loadings of 8 (the highest) and 1 (the lowest) methanol molecules per acidic site are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>. The hydrogen bonded methanol C–D stretching bands at 2217 and 2082 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> attributable to

 <sub>as</sub>(C–D) and 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>(C–D) modes are present for both the zeolites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, no bands assignable to methoxy C–D stretching modes are visible from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref> and hence difference spectra derived from the earliest measurement and at a later stage of the reaction are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>, which is similar to the one reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>. It is evident that the highest methanol loading zeolite exhibits the bands that are attributable to methoxy species at around 2242, 2176 and 2066 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>,
 <xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> while these bands are completely missing for the lowest methanol loading zeolite. The bands at 2242 and 2176 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> are assigned to methoxy 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>as</sub>(C–D) and the corresponding 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>(C–D) stretching modes are at 2072 and 2066 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, which appear to encompass two types of methoxy species. The band at 2072 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> should be treated with some caution because the hydrogen bonded methanol with neutral (lowest methanol load) geometry exhibits a blue shift in the C–D stretching modes as compared with the protonated geometry (highest methanol load), as discussed for the normal methanol loading experiments in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. Thus, the band at 2072 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> could also reflect the hydrogen bonded methanol of protonated geometry, whilst the counterpart band at 2082 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is observed for the neutral geometry. Nonetheless, the isotopic methanol experiments confirm the occurrence of loading dependent room temperature methoxylation, in agreement with normal methanol loading experiments reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref> and also in agreement with our earlier INS and DRIFTS studies.
 <xref rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In line with these observations, water formation is observed only for the highest methanol loading zeolite by MS (not shown), and no water formation is detected for the lowest methanol loading zeolite, consistent with the above results reported with normal methanol experiments in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>. In line with methanol loading dependent room temperature methoxylation experiments, recent simulations of methoxylation show that the energy barriers decrease from 160 to 119 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup> when the loading is increased from 1 to 4 methanol molecules per Brønsted acidic site, respectively.
 <xref rid="cit66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> The energy barriers calculated are in line with the previous literature.
 <xref rid="cit20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, the energy barrier of 119 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup> for 4 methanol molecules per acidic site remains significant in the context of a process observed at room temperature. Also, we recognise the importance of Si/Al ratio of the zeolite in the reaction which is a topic for future study.

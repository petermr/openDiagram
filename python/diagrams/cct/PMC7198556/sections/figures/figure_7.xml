  <p>The mesh of the FEM simulation, with the rotational symmetry axis indicated by the red dash-dotted line on the left. The length of the rod above and below the induction coils was chosen to match the mass of the flanges to the sides of the bearing journal, so that it approximates the heat sink of the surrounding material. The yellow dashed line in (
   <bold>b</bold>) shows the path of the temperature analysis.

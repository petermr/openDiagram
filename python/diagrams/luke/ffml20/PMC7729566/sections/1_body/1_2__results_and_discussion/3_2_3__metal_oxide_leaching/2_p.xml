<p>Total metal oxide solubility in the [P

 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH mixture is consistent with that reported for choline chloride ([Ch]Cl) + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH DES as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05570-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Interestingly, CoO presents a higher solubility in the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system compared to that in the corresponding 1:2 [Ch]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH solvent despite the lower chloride concentration of 1.68 mol kg
 <sup>−1</sup> compared to 3.82 mol kg
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This is attributed to the greater hydrogen-bonded network, and therefore greater viscosity in choline chloride-based mixtures compared to the more aliphatic character of the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system. The presence of water in the mixture negatively influences the total CoO solubility. For a constant [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl to CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH molar ratio, the solubility of CoO slightly decreased from 0.349 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> in the “dry” mixture (containing 1.3 wt.% H
 <sub>2</sub>O) to 0.258 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> for a diluted mixture containing 30.0 wt.% H
 <sub>2</sub>O. This is most likely due to the increased solvation of the chloride anion limiting its chemisorption onto the active sites of the metal salt [

 </sup>. It remains to be established whether any adaptation related changes in motor cortical signals present in scalp EEG are also present in neural population activity recorded directly from the brain as a local field potential (LFP). LFP recordings from the motor cortex are not available in healthy human participants during motor adaptation, so in addition to recording EEG signals over the motor cortex in healthy humans, we also recorded LFP directly from the motor cortex in an animal model of visuomotor adaptation, using a previously established reach-retrieve task in cats. This allowed us to test whether changes in beta activity in motor cortex could be related to adaptive drive, and whether such changes are generalizable across species. We focus on beta activity in the pre-movement period when adaptive drive is greatest for upcoming task performance. This pre-movement period has the advantage that it is not confounded by the execution of the movement (which differs across the motor adaptation tasks in the two species), allowing a direct comparison of results between the two lines of experiment.

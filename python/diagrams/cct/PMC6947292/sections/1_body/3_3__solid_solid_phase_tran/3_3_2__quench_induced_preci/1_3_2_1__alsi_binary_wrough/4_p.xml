<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f023">Figure 23</xref>, it can be seen that the precipitation enthalpy obtained directly from in situ cooling DSC and the values from indirect DSC measurements fit together very well, thus providing additional confirmation of the validity of these approaches. In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B117-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], it is demonstrated that the specific precipitation enthalpy shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f023">Figure 23</xref> is directly proportional to the volume fraction of quench-induced Si precipitation. The continuous lines plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f023">Figure 23</xref> in addition to the measured data points are the results of a model (for details, see [
 <xref rid="B117-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>,
 <xref rid="B132-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]). This model allows us to accurately calculate the volume fraction of quench-induced Si precipitation as well as the fraction of Si left in the solid solution for various temperatures and cooling rates.

<p id="p0255">Annotations for 23 molecular profiles published here include the response data on radioactive iodine therapy, of them 10 were for the treatment responders and 13 for the non-responders. This sampling is modest in terms of robust biomarker discovery. However, these datasets can be combined with the previously published or future data collections

<p>All 2-DE was performed as described [
 <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, aliquots in sample buffer (260 μg) were applied to immobilized pH 3–10 nonlinear gradient strips (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 80,000 Vh. The second dimension was analyzed on 9–16% linear gradient polyacrylamide gels (18 cm × 20 cm × 1.5 cm) at a constant 40 mA per gel for 5 hours. After protein fixation in 40% methanol and 5% phosphoric acid for 1 hour, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 for 12 hours. Gels were then destained with H
 <sub>2</sub>O, scanned in a Bio-Rad GS710 densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and converted into electronic files (12 bit tiff).

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our genome-wide results suggest that duplication of tumor suppressors is pervasive in Afrotherians and may have enabled the evolution of larger body sizes in multiple lineages by lowering intrinsic cancer risk either prior to or coincident with increasing body size. However, our study has several inherent limitations. For example, we have shown that genome quality plays an important role in our ability to identify duplicate genes, and several species have poor quality genomes (and thus were excluded from further analyses). While several efforts have been established with the goal of generating high quality (chromosome length) reference genomes for mammals, such as DNAZoo, The Zoonomia Project, the Vertebrate Genomes Project, and Genome 10K, Atlantogenatans represent a minority of available genome projects. And while a few high quality Atlantogenatan genomes are available, they lack reference gene and transcriptome annotations, and genome browser graphical user interfaces that allow for easy access to genome data for the broader community, limiting their usefulness. Similarly, without comprehensive gene expression data we cannot be certain that duplicate genes are actually expressed, and thus functional. Our results on genome quality suggest several research priorities for these less well-studies species, including generating chromosome length reference genomes and genome annotations, and incorporating these species into existing genome browsers (such as UCSC Genome Browser).</p>

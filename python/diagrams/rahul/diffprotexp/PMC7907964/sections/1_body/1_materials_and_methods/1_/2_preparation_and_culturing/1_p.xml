<p>Skin samples were obtained from the dorsal region of the inner upper arm of each participant, maintained in tubes with DMEM, stored at 4˚C and processed within 4 h. Fibroblast harvesting was performed by explant, isolating the dermis from the epidermis with scalpels and scissors. Passaged cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All culture media and reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. Skin fibroblast cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37˚C. All experiments were performed on cells with 6-11 passages. When cell density reached 80% confluence, the cells were washed and harvested in 1X PBS using a cell scraper. Next, the cells were washed 2-3 times with PBS by centrifugation at 721 x g for 10 min at 4˚C. The pelleted cells were stored at -80˚C until required for use in the enzyme activity and protein identification assays.

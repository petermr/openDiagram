<p id="Par6">A number of molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain the left–right asymmetry at the heart level and in the internal organization of the amniote embryo. Starting from Kartagener’s syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with 
 <italic>situs inversus</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>, researchers have proposed as primary left–right asymmetry determinant a mechanosensitive detection mechanism of unidirectional yolk sac fluid movement. One interesting hypothesis emphasizes the role of 
 <italic>Pkd2</italic> (polycystin 2, transient receptor potential cation channel), in sensing the leftward flow of fluid in the yolk sack produced by unidirectional rotation of cilia on the endodermic surface of the Hensen node
 <sup>

 </sup>. The yolk sac fluid movement is generated by cilia rotation on the endoderm side of the primitive node, involving TRPP2 ion channels belonging to the polycystin subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP), activation of non-canonical Hedgehog pathway and asymmetrical calcium signaling

 </sup>. Another rare clinical condition, the Holt-Oram syndrome, associated with congenital heart defects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>, has led to an elegant demonstration using differential gene expression methods of the rheostatic control exerted by the transcriptional activator 
 <italic>Tbx5</italic> in interventricular septum formation and ventricular patterning. Other researchers have evidenced the role played by differential left–right expression of Nodal and bone morphogenetic (BMP) signaling pathways along the lateral plate mesoderm, leading to asymmetrical activation of transcription factors Pitx2 and Prrx1 and subsequent heart laterality in vertebrates by asymmetrical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition

 </sup>. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies on isolated cardiomyocytes have demonstrated the role of Notch1 signaling pathway in achievement of a mature shortened triangular ventricular action potential (AP) phenotype and the role played by various voltage-dependent K
 <sup>+</sup> channels (Kv) subunits and interacting proteins like KChIP2

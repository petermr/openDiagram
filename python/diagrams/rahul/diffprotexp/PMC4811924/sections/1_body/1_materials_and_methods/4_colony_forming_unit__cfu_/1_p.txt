0: Overnight cultures of  S. suis were adjusted to an OD 600 of 0.2.
1: Then, the bacteria were inoculated into 96-well microtiter plate wells containing 200 L of THB alone (untreated wells) or adding the tylosin solution with the final concentrations of 1/4 MIC (0.125  g/mL).
2: In addition, a negative control (with THB alone) and a positive control (with bacteria alone) were also included.
3: After incubation at 37C for 72 h without shaking, the medium was removed by aspiration, and the wells were washed three times with sterile physiological saline.
4: Biofilm cells were removed from wells by sonication for 5 min in 200 L of THB.
5: The cell suspensions ( n = 3) underwent 10-fold dilutions in THB, and 100 L of each dilution was spot plated onto THB soft-agar plates and incubated at 37C for 24 h. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.

0: For each sample, 100 g of protein was dissolved in 100 L TEAB dissolution buffer and then diluted with 500 L (50 mM) NH 4HCO 3.
1: After the reduction of disulfides and alkylation, 2 g trypsin was added and then incubated overnight at 37 C for protein digestion.
2: An equal volume of 0.1% FA was then added for acidizing.
3: Peptides were purified on the Strata-X C18 pillar, which was first activated with methanol and then balanced by adding 1 mL 0.1% FA for three times, washed with 0.1% FA + 5% ACN twice, and eluted with 1 ml 0.1% FA + 80% ACN.
4: Eluted peptides were then dried with a vacuum concentration meter.
5: The dried peptide powder was re-dissolved with 20 L (0.5 M) TEAB for peptide labelling.

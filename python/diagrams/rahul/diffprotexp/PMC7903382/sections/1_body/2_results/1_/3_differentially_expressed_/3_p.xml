<p>The results identified that 126 lncRNAs, which included 41 upregulated and 85 downregulated lncRNAs, were significantly altered in the MIRI group compared with the sham group. The most upregulated lncRNAs were ENSRNOT00000086475, ENSRNOT00000087028, ENSRNOT00000091108, ENSRNOT00000031815, ENSRNOT00000082061 and ENSRNOT00000087777. The most downregulated lncRNAs were ENSRNOT00000080713, ENSRNOT00000090564, ENSRNOT00000082588, ENSRNOT00000091080, ENSRNOT00000091570, ENSRNOT00000077319, ENSRNOT00000077509, ENSRNOT00000089288, ENSRNOT00000083187 and ENSRNOT00000091435.

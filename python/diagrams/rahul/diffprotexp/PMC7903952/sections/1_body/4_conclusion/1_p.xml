<p>In conclusion, our study predicted that the LINC00466/miR-137/PPP1R14B signaling axis was closely linked to the malignant progression and resistance to TMZ of glioma, and we also confirmed that LINC00466 played a positive regulatory role in glioma cells. MiR-137 was the target of LINC00466 and PPP1R14B was the target of miR-137. Overexpression of LINC00466 increased the expression of PPP1R14B, promoted the proliferation, metastasis and cell resistance to TMZ of glioma. These findings lay a foundation for the exploration on the novel targeted therapy of glioma.</p>

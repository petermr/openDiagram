0: The mouse OP model was established by ovariectomy surgery as previously described [ 27] and approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Usage Committee of the Sun Yat-sen University (Guangdong, China).
1: The LV5-sh_NC and LV5-sh-hsa_circ_0003865 lentiviruses were packaged and prepared by the Vigene Biosciences company (Jinan, Shandong, China).
2: Thirty female SPF-grade C57BL/6J mice between 6 and 8 weeks old were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) and randomly divided into a sh-NC group ( n = 10), an OP + sh-NC group ( n = 10), and an OP + sh-hsa_circ_0003865 group ( n = 10).
3: The sh-NC group was injected with 10 l empty vector at the distal femur (10 13 copies/mouse) before the sham operation.
4: Mice in the OP + sh-NC group were injected with a 10 l empty vector (10 13 copies/mouse) in the distal femur, followed by ovariectomy surgery.
5: Mice in the OP + sh-hsa_circ_0003865 group were injected with 10 l of sh-hsa_circ_0003865 (10 13 copies/mouse) in the distal femur and then subjected to ovariectomy.
6: Bone microstructure analysis by micro-CT examination was conducted as previously described [ 16].
7: Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the relative expression of circ-0003865,  ALP,  RUNX2,  OPN,  GAS1, and miR-3865-3P in bone tissues.
8: The relative abundance of RFP (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), ALP, RUNX2 OPN, and GAS1 proteins in bone tissues was measured by immunofluorescence using the Immunol Fluorescence Staining Kit (#P0179; Beyotime Biotech) according to the manufacturers instructions.

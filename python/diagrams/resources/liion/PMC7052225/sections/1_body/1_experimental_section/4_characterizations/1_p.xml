<p id="Par15">Prior to the analysis, the samples are vacuum-dried at 120 °C for several hours. The self-standing electrodes are observed with a FlexSEM 1000 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation) in a dry room. Secondary electron images are obtained at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a working distance of approximately 5–5.5 mm with various magnifications. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy images and corresponding optical images are obtained with a Keyence VK-x200 3D laser microscope at 150× magnification.</p>

0: Similar to the RNA-seq analysis process, the raw reads were subjected to QC, and trimmed, and m6A-enriched peaks were obtained by mapped to hg38.
1: StringTie (version: 1.3.0) was performed for each gene count from trimmed reads.
2: 21 Gene counts were normalized by TMM, 22 and FPKM was performed using Perl script.
3: 23 EdgeR was used to determine differential gene expression, 24 with significance determined by a p-value<0.05 and an absolute value of a fold change >2.
4: 25

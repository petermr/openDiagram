<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In a previous study of <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> from Congo&#8208;Brazzaville, (1) the volatile components from the stems and the roots were obtained by hydrodistillation and head&#8208;space solid phase microextraction (HS&#8208;SPME), and (2) for the extracts obtained with methanol, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane, the antioxidant activities of the extracts were demonstrated and compared. The essential oil of <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> did not have significant properties of DPPH and ABTS<sup>.+</sup> for either the stems or the roots. However, the solvent extracts are effective antioxidants according to in vitro assays. The authors conclude that the extracts of <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> have potential as natural additives for the food and pharmaceutical industries (Yang et&#160;al., <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).</p>

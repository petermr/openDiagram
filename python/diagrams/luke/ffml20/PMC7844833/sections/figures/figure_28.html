 <caption> (a) Operando Pd K-edge and (b) Pd L 3-edge XANES for Pd NPs under CO 2RR conditions. (c) Changes in the Pdâˆ’Pd distance obtained from EXAFS data under applied potential, signaling the formation of Pd hydrides. This conclusion is supported also by prominent changes in the Pd L 3-edge XANES. (d) The white line intensity at the Pd L 3-edge changes nonmonotonically and (e) can be linked to a switch between different reaction regimes with distinct selectivity toward different products.

<p>Proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing using a Dionex Utimate 3000 capillary LC system on line with LTQ-Fourier Transform (FT) mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., Bremen, Germany) at the Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University. The tandem mass spectra were annotated and peak list files were generated. The resulting peak list files were then used to interrogate sequences present in the indexed IPI mouse database with the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science). A positive identification was accepted when a minimum of two peptide monoisotopic masses matched a particular protein with sequence coverage â‰¥10%, and low expectation value (p &lt; 0.05).</p>

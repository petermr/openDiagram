<p id="Par50">This study has discovered biomarkers that could potentially be used to identify patients destined not to respond adequately to adalimumab treatment at an early stage and to support treat-to-target approaches. Whilst patients can be withdrawn from a therapy according to a limited change in DAS28 at 3 months, in reality, many patients remain on ineffective treatment for longer periods. Biomarkers could therefore aid clinical decisions to rapidly switch non-responder patients at 3 months or earlier to an alternative therapy. Much larger studies are now needed to test the utility of the identified biomarkers as a classifier of future response.</p>

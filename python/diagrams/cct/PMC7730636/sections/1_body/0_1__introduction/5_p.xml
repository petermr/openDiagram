<p>Phase transformations caused by temperature change can also be noticeably affected by application of proper deformation resulting to significant change of mechanical properties [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Application of the deformation brings effect at wide range of temperatures. If the deformation is applied at high temperatures with recrystallization effect, austenitic grain refinement occurs due to the repeated recrystallization what leads to improvement of mechanical properties. More noticeable effect to microstructure occurs at lower temperatures without recrystallization effect. The austenitic grains remain deformed and the deformation strips are formed inside them. Consequently, new phase (martensite) nucleates not only as a standard at grain boundaries but also inside the grain at the deformation strips. Nucleation within the deformed austenitic grains is one of the most important aspects of thermo-mechanical processing [

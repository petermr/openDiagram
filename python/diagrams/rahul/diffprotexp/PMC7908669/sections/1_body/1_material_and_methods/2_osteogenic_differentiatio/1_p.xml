<p id="Par10">Human BMSCs were cultured in six-well plates at 37 °C until cell confluency reached approximately 85%. The cells were then subjected to induction of osteogenic differentiation by culturing in adult BMSC osteogenic differentiation medium (#HUXMA-90021; Cyagen Biosciences, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The culture medium was renewed every 3 days. The human BMSCs were then incubated with 100 μmol/L MEL (#M5250-1G; Sigma Aldrich), which was added to the osteogenic differentiation medium. The 293T human embryonic kidney cell line (#SCSP-502) was purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultured at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% FBS and supplied with 5% CO

0: For each cancer, in order to identify whether the network structures of the target pathways have changed from the complete remission group to the progression group, we have performed differential network analysis [ 5] using the R package  dna [ 6] .
1: This differential network analysis for each pathway is conducted based on connectivity scores between the proteins in these target pathways.
2: The difference in connectivity between the two groups (progression versus complete remission) is computed mathematically, using the following statistic: 1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \varDelta \left(\mathcal{F}\right)=\frac{1}{k\left(k-1\right)}{\displaystyle \sum_{p\ne {p}^{\prime}\in \mathcal{F}}}\left|{s}_{p{p}^{\prime}}^{pr}-{s}_{p{p}^{\prime}}^{cr}\right| $$\end{document}(F )=1k(k1)p=pF|sppprsppcr|where  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathcal{F} $$\end{document}F denotes the set of proteins present in a target pathway and  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ k $$\end{document}k denotes the number of proteins in  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathcal{F} $$\end{document}F. Here  spp ' pr and  spp ' cr are the connectivity scores between the proteins  p and  p ' in the progression and complete remission groups, respectively.
3: For our analysis, the connectivity score of a protein pair in a network is taken to be the Pearsons correlation coefficient of the expression values of the two proteins in the corresponding sample data.
4: A permutation test is then carried out using the test statistic ( F) as follows: let  p denote the number of proteins in the sample (132 in this case).
5: Let  Npr and  Ncr denote the number of patients in the progression group and in the complete remission group, respectively.
6: The expression profiles of the patients in the two groups are given in the matrix form of orders  Npr   p and  Ncr   p, respectively.
7: Now, a matrix  E is constructed by merging the rows of the two profiles, i.e.,  E is of order ( Npr +  Ncr)   p. Then, the rows of  E are randomly permuted and the first  Npr patients are considered as one group and the remaining  Ncr patients as another group.
8: For the  ith permutation, the connectivity scores  spp ' pr,  i and  spp ' cr,  i between the proteins  p and  p ' are then computed using the expression profiles of the permuted data.
9: Thus, the  ith permuted test statistic ( F,i) is given by 2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \varDelta \left(\mathcal{F},i\right)=\frac{1}{k\left(k-1\right)}{\displaystyle \sum_{p\ne {p}^{\prime}\in \mathcal{F}}}\left|{s}_{p{p}^{\prime}}^{pr,i}-{s}_{p{p}^{\prime}}^{cr,i}\right| $$\end{document}(F,i)=1k(k1)p=pF|spppr,isppcr,i|

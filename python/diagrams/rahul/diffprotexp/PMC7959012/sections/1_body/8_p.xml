<p>The results of the signal pathway enrichment analysis showed that 219 pathways were detected in the model group vs. the control group, of which 87 were statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The 30 highest expressions of the KEGG pathway in the RPE cells of mice in the myopic model group showed that neurotransmitter-related pathways (such as the glutamatergic synapses and GABAergic synapses), oxidative-phosphorylation-related pathways (such as the fructose/mannose metabolism), and protein-related pathways (such as the oxytocin pathway) were activated (

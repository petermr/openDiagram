<p>The effect of austenitizing temperature on continuous cooling transformed microstructures at different cooling rates was investigated adopting the scheme shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. The experiment was carried out on Formastor-FⅡ full-automatic transformation equipment using cylinder samples of dimensions Φ3 mm × 10 mm. Vickers hardness of treated samples was tested by a KB hardness testing machine (KB Prüftechnik, Hochdorf-Assenheim, Germany). In order to clarify the transformation behaviors in detail, in situ observation by high-temperature laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was carried out, referring to the thermal cycle process in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. The samples were machined into disks with a diameter of 7 mm and thickness 3.5 mm, mirror polished, and set into an alumina crucible on a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The austenite coarsening and ferrite formation behaviors were directly observed. The effect of austenitization holding time was also evaluated through experiment as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f001">Figure 1</xref>c. Steel samples were heated at 1250 °C and held for different times between 1 and 60 min and then continuously cooled at 2 °C/s.

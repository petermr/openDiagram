<p>Only a few studies have analyzed the proteome in seminal plasma.[

 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] I.e. Pilch and Mann reported 923 proteins in human seminal plasma from healthy men by mass spectrometry (MS).[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Recently, approximately 2300 unique proteins have been identified by MS in semen specimens from fertile control and postvasectomy males.[
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In seminal plasma, 59 putative biomarkers of prostatitis have been recognized that need further validation for diagnosis and monitoring.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In addition, Milardi 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found 919 proteins in the seminal plasma from a group of fertile men and showed that semenogelin I and II are the main proteins in human semen. These proteins were previously reported to play an important role for fertility.[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, many seminal plasma proteins are poorly known.[

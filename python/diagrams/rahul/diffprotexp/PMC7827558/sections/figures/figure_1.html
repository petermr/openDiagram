 <caption> Schema of the new arm of the DNA damage signaling pathway (DDR). Irradiation (IR) suppresses hSMG1 kinase activity, inactive hSMG1 releases from p53 pre-mRNA and allows ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26)–SRSF7 to bind, resulting in splicing to generate p53β. p53β is indispensable for induction of senescence markers after IR, perhaps through transcriptional repression.

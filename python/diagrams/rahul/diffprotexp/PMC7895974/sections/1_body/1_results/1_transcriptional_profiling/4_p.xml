<p id="Par9">The functional clustering by gene ontology (GO) terms of differentially expressed genes across all four stages reveals enrichment of biological processes involved in cell differentiation in DS and MS versus PSM and ES samples. Genes involved in myoblast differentiation, cartilage condensation, skeletal muscle fibre development and myotube cell development were up-regulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Further analysis of genes involved in positive regulation of myoblast differentiation shows that they display dynamic expression across the four groups and include classic markers for different stages of paraxial mesoderm differentiation. Genes differentially expressed in somite compartments include in the dermomyotome and myotome: 
 <italic>MYF5</italic>, 
 <italic>MYF6</italic> and 
 <italic>MYOD1</italic>, whilst 
 <italic>MYOG</italic> and 
 <italic>KLHL31</italic> are associated with differentiated muscle. Classic markers for chondrogenesis and cartilage condensation within the sclerotome include the TFs, SOX9, PAX1 and PAX9, and the extracellular matrix component, COL11A1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Functional clustering of differentially expressed genes also reveals enrichment of signalling pathways involved in anterior–posterior pattern formation. These pathways are expressed in an opposing fashion and include the FGF and Wnt signalling pathways, which are highly expressed in PSM and the retinoic acid (RA) signalling pathway, which is more highly expressed in somite samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>).

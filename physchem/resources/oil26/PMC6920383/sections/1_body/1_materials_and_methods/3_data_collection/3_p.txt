0: At each microsite all vascular plants were identified to species level where possible, and canopy cover for each species was visually estimated.
1: Three soil properties were also measured at each microsite: (1) volumetric water content within the top 3.8 cm of the soil (TDR 300 soil moisture meter; Spectrum technologies; USA), (2) soil resistance to penetration at 5 mm depth (as a measure of soil compaction) using a hand-held pocket penetrometer (Geotest; USA), and (3) soil temperature at 2 cm depth using a hand-held RTD thermometer (Eutech Instruments; RSA).

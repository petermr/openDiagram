<p id="Par16">We further identified 36 genes for which knock-down or overexpression has the potential to reduce the molecular differences between high-grade and low-grade cartilage (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">6</xref>), for example knock-down of 
 <italic>IL11</italic>. IL11 is a cytokine with a key role in inflammation, and several therapeutics that inhibit IL11 signalling are in development against a range of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases

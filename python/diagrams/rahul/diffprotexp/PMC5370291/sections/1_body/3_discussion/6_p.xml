<p>Calnexin forms heterodimeric complexes with the calnexin-associated protein disulfide isomerase ortholog ERp57 to exert its chaperone activity 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. A Recent study is reported that calnexin and another ER-associated chaperone GRP78 are overexpressed in keratocystic odontogenic tumors 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. Our results revealed that protein level of HSP70, HSP90 and calnexin were increased in response to TNFÎ± treatment, suggesting that the promoted molecular chaperone expression may play an important role in the evoked prosurvival signals in HepG2 cell.

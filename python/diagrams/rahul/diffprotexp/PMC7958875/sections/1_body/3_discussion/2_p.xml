<p>We identify differentially expressed ookinete genes in 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> using a nested approach by identifying highly variable genes and using them as the input for further analysis in order to minimize potential noise in the data. Using this approach, we identify 11 genes showing expression dependent on vector species and 12 genes showing expression dependent on vector individuals. Additionally, we identify 28 potential bet-hedging genes, which show a variable pattern of expression independent of the vector individual. For the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> samples, we performed the differential expression and highly variable gene search independently due to the bulk data collection and found 2 genes showing expression dependent on vector mating status, 24 genes showing expression dependent on vector antibiotic treatment, and 12 that show a highly variable pattern of expression. Only three genes were identified in more than one analysis. UFD1 and ISP3 were differentially expressed in the 
 <italic>Pb vector species data set</italic> and identified as potential bet-hedging genes in the 
 <italic>single-gut ookinete data set</italic>. CelTOS was identified as both differentially expressed and a potential bet-hedging gene in the 
 <italic>single-gut ookinete data set.</italic> Additionally, it was differentially expressed in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in response to antibiotic treatment in the 
 <italic>Pf bulk data set</italic>.

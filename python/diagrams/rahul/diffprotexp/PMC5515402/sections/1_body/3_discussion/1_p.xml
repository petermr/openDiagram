<p>The current study identified changes in the proteome of the hypothalamic GT1-7 cells in response to the synthetic androgen, 17α-meT. Since physiological levels of androgens have been determined as 0.01 μM [

 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the dose regimen used in our study is considered a chronic supraphysiological (100-fold) exposure (1 μM for 48 h) [

 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], systemic exposure to high levels of methyltestosterone during 6 days (40–240 mg/day) led to concentrations in the CSF that ranged between 0.065–0.9 μM [

These results suggest that cell populations in the brain of AAS abusers can be under the direct influence of supraphysiological concentrations of the drug, and that anabolic steroids have the potential to cause negative consequences at the molecular, physiological and/or behavioral levels.

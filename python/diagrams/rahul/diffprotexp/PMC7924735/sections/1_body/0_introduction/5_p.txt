0: In 2015, our research team published the complete  T.  solium secretome, obtained directly from the genome of the helminth; in total, 838 proteins were identified and characterized by their function and antigenicity [ 12].
1: The increasing availability complete genome sequences, that allowed us to systematically examine genetic data and provided us with a complete list of promising biological markers instead of a limited set of candidates, demonstrating the validity of bioinformatics-based approaches to predict a secretome [ 12].

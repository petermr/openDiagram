 <caption>
  <p>SEM images of NASICON film a) pristine; b) after being immersed in 5 
   <sc>m</sc> NaOH. c) X‚Äêray diffractogram pattern of pristine NASICON film and NASICON treated in 5 
   <sc>m</sc> NaOH. Authors examined the XRD at both side of the film. Reproduced with permission.[qv: 5e] Copyright 2019, The Royal Society of Chemistry. d) XRD of NASICON film in different acidic electrolyte and in pure acid. The diffractogram of NASICON film was completely changed when dipped in 0.1 
   <sc>m</sc> HCl solution which indicates the susceptibility of NASICON film in acidic solution. Reproduced with permission.

<p id="par0175">HD3086 showed maximum expression of 
 <italic>SOD</italic> (3.2-fold) under T
 <sub>2</sub>. A significant increase in the expression of 
 <italic>SOD</italic> was observed with HS (

 <italic>AGPase (LSU)</italic> and 
 <italic>SSS</italic> showed maximum expression under T
 <sub>1</sub> and further downregulation was observed. The expression of 
 <italic>SSS</italic> in HD3086 was observed maximum (1.85-fold) under T
 <sub>1</sub>. We observed downregulation in 
 <italic>SSS</italic> under T
 <sub>2</sub> treatment (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>c).Similarly, BT-Schomburgk showed maximum 
 <italic>POX</italic> expression (3.9-fold) under T
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>d). Abundance of 
 <italic>POX</italic> transcript was observed, as compared to 
 <italic>SOD</italic> under HS.

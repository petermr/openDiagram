<p id="p0225">The payload of DEX in DEX@CD-MOF was 1.43 ± 0.21% measured by HPLC-MS/MS. In the system of DEX and SCU co-loaded CD-MOF, DEX payloads with feed molar ratio of 2:2:1 and 1:2:1 were 1.33 ± 0.05% and 0.87 ± 0.04%, respectively, whilst the SCU payloads were 28.36 ± 0.30% and 17.80 ± 0.31%, respectively. It was worth to note that DEX was a highly active drug that can achieve local therapeutic effects in small quantity. On the other hand, it also showed that the loading efficiency of SCU in CD-MOF would not be reduced by co-loading of DEX.</p>

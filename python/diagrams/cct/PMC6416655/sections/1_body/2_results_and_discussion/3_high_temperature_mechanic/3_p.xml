 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows the tensile strength of high-alloy mould steel slab between 973–1623 K. It could be concluded that the tensile strength is decreasing along with the temperature increase. The tensile strength remains shallow and gentle gradient when the temperature is above 1273 K.

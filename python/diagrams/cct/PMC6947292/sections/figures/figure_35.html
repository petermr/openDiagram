 <caption> Quench-induced precipitation in 6005A after different cooling rates [ 128]: ( A) OM and ( B) SEM secondary electron micrographs of quench-induced β-Mg 2Si particles originating from the HTRs; ( C) TEM images of quench-induced rod-shaped B’ or β’ particles. In each case, the particle dimensions are substantially reduced with increasing cooling rate. </caption>

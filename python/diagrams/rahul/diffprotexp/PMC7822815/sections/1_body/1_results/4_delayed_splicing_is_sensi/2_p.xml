<p id="Par22">Interestingly, expression of diffEEJs (affected by 
 <italic>RUNX1/RUNX1T1</italic> knockdown; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) showed a much stronger bimodal distribution resulting in a lower median compared to non-diffEEJs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). For the nascent RNA, the number of low abundant diffEEJs substantially exceeded that of high abundant ones, while the opposite was true for total RNA. In contrast, the distribution pattern of non-diffEEJs shifted only slightly towards higher abundances. Importantly, neither expression levels of differentially spliced versus non-differentially spliced genes nor the distribution of intron lengths differed substantially between non-diffEEJs and diffEEJs and, thus, are not the cause for the observed shifts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>). Therefore, these findings suggest the presence of differential splicing events which undergo delayed processing. Furthermore, they imply that delayed splicing is more sensitive to genomic and transcriptomic perturbations induced by the changes in the 
 <italic>RUNX1/RUNX1T1</italic> expression.

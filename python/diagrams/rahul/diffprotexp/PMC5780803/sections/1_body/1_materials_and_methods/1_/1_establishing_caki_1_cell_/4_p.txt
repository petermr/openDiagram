0: Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine  (250 ng/l) 2000 transfection reagent (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and a BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi Entry Vector kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).
1: In order to generate stably transfected clones, the transfected cells were selected with Geneticin (KangWei Technology, Beijing, China) for 34 weeks (the successfully transfected Caki-1 cell exhibited Geneticin resistance).
2: The stably transfected Caki-1 cell clones were cloned and collected, and were termed Caki-1/XIAP-shRNA-pENTR, with Caki-1/pENTR as the control cells.
3: Due to the fact that the PENTR/U6 plasmid possesses the GFP gene, it is able to produce green fluorescence under a certain wavelength laser and thus, a fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to identify transfected cells.
4: Following formation of the clone cells, the monoclonal cell colony with green fluorescence was selected and transferred onto a 24-well plate for amplification.

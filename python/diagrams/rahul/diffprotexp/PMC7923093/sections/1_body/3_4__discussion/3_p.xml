<p>The miRNAs are a class of non-coding small RNA involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing to regulate transcription primarily via degradation of the complementary mRNA target and/or translational suppression. The development of mammary tissue is accompanied by morphological and transcriptional changes through the stages of lactation associated with differentially expressed miRNA. Thus, miRNA sequencing offers the opportunity to reveal the gene expression of an individual in a particular developmental period and in a given tissue. In other words, a miRNA will be assumed to play a regulatory role in a particular tissue or cell, or at the specific developmental stage if differential expression of the miRNA is associated with that condition. In this study, we observed seven miRNAs up-regulated via differential expression analysis and verified by qPCR including miR-206-3p, miR-133a-5p, miR-133b-3p, miR-1-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-1b and miR-486, suggesting these miRNAs probably play roles in the well-developed acini cells when rats were fed arginine.</p>

<p>HBMEC was a generous gift from professor Huang, (University of Southern California, USA). Human embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells were kindly provided by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province. The newly identified strain of EV71 (KC122766) was isolated from a rectal swab specimen of a 6-year-old male which was diagnosed as critical care HFMD with encephalitis complications. EV71 were amplified by using RD cells. Vero cells were conserved in our laboratory. DJ-1, vimentin, and heat shock proteins 27 rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa, USA). All other chemicals in this study were analytical grade.</p>

<p id="Par32">These results therefore suggest that pre-movement beta signals in the motor cortex may contain information relating to the kinematics of the upcoming reach, and that movement parameters are not uniform over the different stages of motor adaptation. To take this into account we therefore incorporated both metrics as covariates in subsequent analyses of the dynamics of beta power through the adaptation epochs.</p>

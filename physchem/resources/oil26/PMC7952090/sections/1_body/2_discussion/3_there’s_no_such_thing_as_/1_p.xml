<p>While we observed that duplication of genes in cancer related pathways – including genes with known tumor suppressor functions – is pervasive in Afrotheria, the number of duplicate tumor suppressor genes was relatively small, which may reflect a trade-off between the protective effects of increased tumor suppressor number on cancer risk and potentially deleterious consequences of increased tumor suppressor copy number. Overexpression of 
 <italic>TP53</italic> in mice, for example, is protective against cancer but associated with progeria, premature reproductive senescence, and early death; however, transgenic mice with a duplication of the 
 <italic>TP53</italic> locus that includes native regulatory elements are healthy and experience normal aging, while also demonstrating an enhanced response to cellular stress and lower rates of cancer (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">García-Cao et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Tyner et al., 2002</xref>). These data suggest that duplication of tumor suppressors can contribute to augmented cancer resistance, if the duplication includes sufficient regulatory architecture to direct spatially and temporally appropriate gene expression. Thus, it is interesting that duplication of genes that regulate TP53 function, such as 
 <italic>STK11</italic>, 
 <italic>SIAH1</italic>, and 
 <italic>BRD7</italic>, preceded the retroduplication 
 <italic>TP53</italic> in the Proboscidean stem-lineage, which may have mitigated toxicity arising from dosage imbalances. Similar co-duplication events may have alleviated the negative pleiotropy of tumor suppressor gene duplications to enable their persistence and allow for subsequent co-option during the evolution of cancer resistance.

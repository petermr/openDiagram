<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The root powder sample (5.0&#160;g) was refluxed with 6&#160;M HCl (50&#160;mL) at 110&#160;&#176;C for 24&#160;h for protein hydrolysis. Then the solution was kept in an evaporating dish to evaporate HCl on a water bath. The residue was again dissolved in 20&#160;mL 0.1&#160;M HCl and evaporation was repeated twice to remove excess of the acid. It was then filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper with 0.1&#160;M HCl in a volumetric flask which was known as a stock solution. Again, the stock solution was filtered through 0.45&#160;&#956;m syringe filter with pressure for amino acid analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Then the stock and standard solutions were run through Shimadzu amino acid analyzer with a fluorescent detector. The sample amino acids were identified by comparing with standard amino acids retention times and calculated the percentage of their individual areas.</p>

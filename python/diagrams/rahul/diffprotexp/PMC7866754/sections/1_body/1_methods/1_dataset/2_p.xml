<p id="Par16">As a result, this work focuses on two pairs of transcriptome/proteome generated by Lindner et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The authors produced transcriptomic and proteomic data for oocyst sporozoites from wild-type 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites (NF54 strain) as well as salivary gland sporozoites, with three biological replicates for each sample type. The reasons for narrowing down to these datasets are threefold: firstly, the original analysis by Lindner et al. only considered annotated genes, leaving room for the discovery of novel ORFs. Secondly, the two life cycle stages analysed correspond to the mosquito-infectious and human-infectious stage, and therefore novel ORFs detected by proteogenomic analysis could help explain the development of human-specific infectivity. Finally, since the datasets were produced in the same laboratory, the conditions should presumably be similar and differential expression is mainly caused by biological differences between the developmental stages. The transcriptomic data was downloaded from the GEO database (Accession #GSM3109291, GSM3109292, GSM3109293 for oocysts sporozoites; # GSM3109294, GSM3109295, GSM3109296 for salivary gland sporozoites), and the proteomic data from PRIDE (Accession #PXD009726 for salivary gland sporozoites, #PXD009728 for oocysts sporozoites).

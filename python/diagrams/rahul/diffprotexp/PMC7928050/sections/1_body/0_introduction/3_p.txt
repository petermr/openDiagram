0: To address this question we undertook a study, where we used autologous fat transplantation in a murine dorsal skinfold chamber model and performed gene expression analysis before transplantation, 7, and 15 days after transplantation.
1: The model of the dorsal skinfold chamber was chosen on the one hand, to allow for best identification of the transplanted fat tissue after 7 and 15 days.
2: On the other hand, as the graft size is rather small, particle size correlates with that reached in lipofilling[ 8], using the dorsal skinfold chamber allowed to clearly identify the graft after 7 and 15 days after transplantation.
3: Our data were completed by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis of three selected antibodies corresponding to significantly differentially expressed genes.

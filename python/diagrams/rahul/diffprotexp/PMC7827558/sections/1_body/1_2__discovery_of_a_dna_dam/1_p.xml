<p>After the discovery that RPL26 was involved in increasing p53 translation after DNA damage, it seemed unlikely that p53 would be the only cellular gene product regulated after stress by such an elegant pathway. In order to investigate whether gene products other than p53 might be upregulated by translation in a similar fashion after DNA damage, we performed gene array analyses to identify RNA molecules that interact with the RPL26 protein following IR. One of these RNA products turned out to be the β (beta) isoform of p53 (p53β), an alternatively spliced form of p53 RNA. More than 10 different alternatively spliced forms of human p53 have been described, but we have a very limited understanding of the regulation and function of these isoforms [

Full-length p53 (FLp53) and p53β share their first 331 amino acids, including the DNA binding domain, but differ in that the C-terminal 62 amino acids of FLp53, which contains the oligomerization domain, are eliminated by alternative splicing in the p53β isoform and a novel 10-amino-acid segment is added to the protein (reviewed in [

As we conducted studies of IR-induced translational regulation of p53, we demonstrated an IR-induced increase in levels of the β isoform of p53 RNA and protein, suggesting a potential role for this p53 isoform in cellular responses to DNA damage [

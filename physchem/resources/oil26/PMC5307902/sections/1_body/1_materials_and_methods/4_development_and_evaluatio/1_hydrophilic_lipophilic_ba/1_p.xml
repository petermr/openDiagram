<p>The emulsions were prepared following the spreadsheet design shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. This spreadsheet includes two surfactants: one of a lipophilic nature [Span 80
 <sup>®</sup>, HLB=4.3] and the other of a hydrophilic nature [Tween 20
 <sup>®</sup>, HLB=16.7]. The final HLB value of each system varied according to the relative proportion of each surfactant.[

<p id="Par35">Total RNA (100 ng) was amplified and converted into biotinylated sense-strand cDNA targets using the Affymetrix WT PLUS kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All samples were collected using the same study protocol, irrespective of clinical features. We adhered to the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding RNA quality control (260/280 ratio between 1.7 and 2.1). The Nanodrop ND-1000 was used to monitor and normalise cDNA concentration across samples throughout the target preparation. Samples of different response status and time-point were arranged in the 96-well plate at random to avoid cDNA conversion bias. For each sample, 5-μg of fragmented, end-labelled sense-strand target cDNA was hybridised to a GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array (HTA) 2.0 before incubation for 16 h at 45 °C in the GeneChip® Hybridization Oven 645. Following hybridisation, arrays were washed and stained using the GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G with Autoloader to generate a raw CEL data file for each sample.</p>

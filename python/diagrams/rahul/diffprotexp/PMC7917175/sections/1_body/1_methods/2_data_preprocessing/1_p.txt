0: To process the ICGC data, the microarray probes with null gene test value were first removed and the remaining probes were mapped to human genes.
1: A total of 239 immune cell-related genes were retained from 1982 expressed genes.
2: TCGA tumor samples lacking clinical information and the normal tissue data were first excluded, followed by genes with 0 FPKM in > 50% of the samples.
3: Finally, 103 immune cell-related genes with log2(FPKM + 1) fold-change were included for the subsequent analysis.

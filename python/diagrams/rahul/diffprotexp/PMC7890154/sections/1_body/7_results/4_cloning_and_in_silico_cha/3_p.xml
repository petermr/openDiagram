<p id="par0150">BLASTn sequence analysis of 
 <italic>MAPK</italic> and 
 <italic>MAPK-1</italic> showed maximum homology with MAPK gene reported from 
 <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> (acc. nos. AK353742 and AK376245). Similarly, protein sequence analysis of MAPK showed maximum homology with MAPK gene reported from 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> (acc. nos. NP_001167676 and XP_015643193). MAPK showed ORF of 369 amino acids, 5′ UTR of 3 aa and 3′ UTR of 79 aa. Similarly, 
 <italic>MAPK-1</italic> showed ORF of 393 amino acids, 5′ UTR of 42 aa and 3′UTR of 98 aa. Conserved domain (CD) search showed the presence of Serine/Threonine Kinase (STK) domain in both the MAPK genes which is conserved functional domain of MAPK family (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a &amp; b). We observed 22 phosphorylation sites in MAPK with 11 threonine beyond the threshold level (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). Similarly, 49 phosphorylating sites were observed in MAPK-1 with 9 serine, 5 threonine, and 5 tyrosine beyond the threshold level (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d). Based on phylogenetic analysis, the cloned MAPK genes were grouped into 4 families designated as family-I, II, III and IV; 
 <italic>MAPK</italic> and 
 <italic>MAPK-1</italic> cloned in present investigation belongs to family-IV (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a &amp; b). Signal peptide identification showed both the MAPK proteins to be nucleus-localized.

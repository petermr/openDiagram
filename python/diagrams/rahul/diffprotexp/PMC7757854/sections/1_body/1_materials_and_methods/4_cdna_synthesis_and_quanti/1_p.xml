<p>Total isolated RNA (0.1 ng) was used as a template for synthesizing complementary DNA (cDNA) using a First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen™) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was diluted 1:50 in ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O prior to its use as a template for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using SYBR Green (Thermo Scientific™). A total volume of 10 ul was prepared for the SYBR Green qPCR reaction [2.5 ul diluted cDNA product or nH
 <sub>2</sub>O, 2.5 ul 2 mM forward + reverse primer mix (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) (
 <xref rid="t0008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>) and 5 ul of SYBR Green]. The qPCR thermal cycle utilized an Applied Biosystems™ StepOnePlus™ platform, with one cycle of 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10 min followed by 44 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Expression of gene targets values was normalized to housekeeping gene 
 <italic>β-actin</italic> and was estimated using the ΔΔCt approach. Results represented on a log2 scale.

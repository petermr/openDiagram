<p>Mtz IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated at each consecutive 4-week passage (P8, P16, P24; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, panel A). After 4 weeks without Mtz selection, MtzR-P8 trophozoites in both lines had significantly increased Mtz susceptibility compared to MtzR lines (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>), with a lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> in 106-MtzR-P8 of the 2 isolates. In MtzR-P16 trophozoites, 713-MtzR-P16 had further increases in Mtz susceptibility, while 106-MtzR-P16 increased in Mtz resistance compared to 106-MtzR-P8 to levels equivalent to its drug-selected parent (i.e., 106-MtzR at week 0; Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). After 12 weeks (P24) without drug selection, IC
 <sub>50</sub> in both lines plateaued, with no significant change in Mtz sensitivity compared to week 8 (P16) trophozoites. Based on this, 106-MtzR-P16 and 106-MtzR-P24 trophozoites retained both drug resistance and improved growth rates (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At their lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> throughout the 12 weeks, neither MtzR line returned to levels of Mtz susceptibility as recorded in parent MtzS lines, with the lowest fold changes (resistance factor) in IC
 <sub>50</sub> throughout the 12 weeks at +2.8 and +2.9 in 106-MtzR-P8 and 713-MtzR-P24, respectively.

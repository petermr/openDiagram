<p>Cy3 labeling for preparative gels: A total of 250 μg of protein (31.25 μg/ sample) from samples represented in analytical gels were pooled, speed vacuum-dried, resuspended in 250 μl of cell lysis buffer and treated with TCEP for 1 h at 37°C. Protein (250 μg) was labeled with Cy3 saturation dye for 30 min at 37°C. To stop the reaction, sample buffer was added to a final volume of 450 μl.</p>

<p>To increase the value chain of recycling products, significant efforts are devoted to developing a direct recycling approach, with Argonne Laboratory being one of the most active supporters of this route. In addition to shortening the chemical process path, direct recycling allows to process economically low-value battery chemistry, such as LFP, by generating added-value products. However, this technique is yet to prove full restoration of the initial cathode capacity. Nevertheless, recent progress in relithiation methods, particularly in electrochemistry, and mechanical separation of cathode materials (selective flotation, magnetic separation, and so on) show promise for improved efficiency. </p>

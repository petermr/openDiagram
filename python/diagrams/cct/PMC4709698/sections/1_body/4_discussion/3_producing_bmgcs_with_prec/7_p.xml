<p>Finally, the CCT curves for the BT
 <italic>X</italic> shall be discussed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). For several alloys the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>–, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>– and 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub>–lines are drawn. Two cooling rates are also depicted, one for a rod with a diameter of 10 mm and for an ingot with a weight of 100 g. As 
 <italic>x</italic> ≥ 0.3, the cooling curve of the rod intersects the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>–lines of these alloys and the outcome is a microstructure, which has attained a two-phase quasi-equilibrium: The compositions of both phases are identical in all alloys and crystalline volume fraction can be predicted (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). As 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.2, however, the cooling curve of the 10 mm rod crosses the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>–line at a temperature close to its nose temperature, and then quickly reaches the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub>–line, generating a non-equilibrium BMGCs with a very small fraction (&lt;5%) of β-Ti (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). When 
 <italic>X</italic> is even smaller (e.g. 
 <italic>X</italic> = 15), the cooling curve of the 10 mm rods does not cross the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>–line and a fully glassy rod can be obtained. At slower cooling (100 g ingot of BT15), yet, β-Ti precipitates with a volume fraction less than 5% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>) because the cooling curve representing the 100 g ingot intersects the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>–line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Since the cooling rate of the 100 g ingot approaches the critical cooling rate for the formation of a glassy matrix, BT10 and BT15 can never achieve the quasi-equilibrium BMGCs due to decomposition of the supercooled liquid into Be
 <sub>2</sub>Zr and Cu
 <sub>10</sub>Zr
 <sub>7</sub> at even lower cooling rates.

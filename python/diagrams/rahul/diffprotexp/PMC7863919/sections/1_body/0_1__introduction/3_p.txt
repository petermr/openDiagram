0: USP8 gene encodes for deubiquitinase enzyme involved in the regulation of proteasomal protein degradation.
1: USP8 mutations are small, single codon deletions or missense variants that occur in the region involved in binding 14-3-3 proteins family members.
2: Thus, these changes impair interactions between USP8 and 14-3-3 proteins, which normally suppress deubiquitinase activity [ 16].
3: As a result of mutation, USP8 activity is enhanced and leads to preventing proteasomal degradation of particular proteins and dysregulation of natural protein turnover.
4: This was clearly shown in in vitro experiments, providing the explanation of the sustained EGFR signaling in  USP8-mutated corticotroph PitNETs [ 4, 5].
5: Since USP8 deubiquitinase has many molecular substrates, its impaired functioning has potentially a wide effect on the protein level.
6: The pleiotropic effect of the mutation is reflected by differences in gene expression between  USP8-mutated ( USP8mut) and  USP8-wild type ( USP8wt) tumors [ 1, 2].
7: Accordingly, differences in expression of particular proteins related to corticotroph tumors growth were also found [ 15].
8: The understanding of the biological difference between wild type and mutated tumors appears important, since  USP8 mutation may potentially serve as prognostic and predicting factor [ 2].

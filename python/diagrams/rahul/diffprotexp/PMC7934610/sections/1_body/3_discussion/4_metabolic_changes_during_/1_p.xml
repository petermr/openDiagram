<p>Finally, our study revealed that cytochrome metabolism may contribute to defense against 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infection. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that many DEGs associated with Cytochrome 450 (CYP450), including 
 <italic>CYP1A</italic>, 
 <italic>CYP3A</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP26A</italic> in CE-resistant sheep were clearly higher than in CE-non-resistant sheep. These DEGs were mainly enriched in the “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450” pathway (46 genes, 
 <italic>p-value</italic>: 2.357955e-08; Pathway ID: ko00980) and “drug metabolism – cytochrome P450” pathway (39 genes, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 5.695932e-08, Pathway ID: ko00982). The CYP450 enzymes family includes membrane-bound hemoproteins that play a pivotal role in the detoxification of xenobiotics, cellular metabolism, and homeostasis [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has been reported that genes of the CYP450 family varied similarly in the liver of experimental mice infected with 
 <italic>E. multilocularis</italic> [
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that members of the CYP family CYP1A could enhance inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This aligns with the results of our previous study showing several upregulated miRNAs, which are related to NF-KB inflammation pathways, and play important roles in the response of intestinal tissue to 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infection in sheep with resistant haplotypes [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We can infer that the upregulation of the CYP family in the present study might enhance inflammatory responses, thus contributing more strongly to defense responses to CE infection in CE-R sheep than in CE-NR sheep.

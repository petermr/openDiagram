<p>Various molecular and genetic changes occur during the multistep process of tumor dissemination, and these have been called the “metastatic cascade” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This cascade starts with escape from the primary tumor by invasion of the surrounding tissue, entry into the bloodstream (intravasation), extravasation at a distant site, and finally survival and proliferation to form metastases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In this study, expression of TPI-1 and ENO1, which enhances cancer cell survival and proliferation, were higher in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors, and TAGLN2, which suppresses invasion of cancer cells, was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors. The different expression of these proteins between primary and metastatic tumor may require characteristics for brain metastasis in these gynecological cancers. In addition, tubulin beta, 60S ribosomal protein L7 and Myosin light chain 6B were also identified in this study. Their role in tumor metastasis requires further investigation, but the role may be similar to that of proteins such as TPI-1, ENO1, and TAGLN2.

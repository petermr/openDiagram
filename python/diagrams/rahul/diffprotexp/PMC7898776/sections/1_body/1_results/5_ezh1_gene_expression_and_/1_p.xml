<p id="Par38">The mRNA expression of histone methyltransferase 
 <italic>ezh1</italic> gene was lower in the mandarin fish of Group X (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). As histone methyltransferase Ezh1 could methylate ‘Lys-27’ of histone H3, we analyzed the H3K27me3 levels of the two groups. The results showed that H3K27me3 level was also lower in the mandarin fish of Group X than that of Group W (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).

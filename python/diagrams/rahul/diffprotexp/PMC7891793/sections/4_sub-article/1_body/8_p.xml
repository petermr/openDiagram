<p>We have provided the viral load as determined by qRT-PCR from daily nasal swabs beginning on day 0 prior to infection through day 10 when necropsy was performed. With this infection model, which we have previously performed and reported for other studies, the maximum viral load in the lung tissue occurs on or around day 7 post infection. By day 10, as demonstrated in other studies by both viral isolation attempts and immunoperoxidase staining for the virus, there is often little or no virus still present in the tissue. For this reason we did not attempt to quantitate virus in the lung tissue on day 10 of necropsy. The viral shedding data has been reported in reference 19 along with clinical data. A summary of this data has been included in the revision (lines 535-539).</p>

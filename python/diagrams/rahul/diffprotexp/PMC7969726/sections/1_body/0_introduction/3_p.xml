<p>Alternative polyadenylation is mediated by a group of constant proteins that constitute the CPA multicomponent complexes, including four core components: cleavage and polyadenylation specific factors (CPSFs), cleavage stimulation factors (CSTFs), cleavage factor I (CFI), and CFII, along with numerous dynamic partners (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>). CPSFs are site-specific cleavage subunits composed of CPSF1, CPSF2, CPSF3, CPSF4, and Fip1. As the largest component of the CPSFs complex, CPSF1 (also known as CPSF160) is primarily located in the nucleus and functions in pre-mRNA 3â€²UTR processing by recognizing a conserved AAUAAA polyadenylation signal near the polyadenylation site (pA site) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Murthy and Manley, 1995</xref>). Differential expression of CPSF1 has been reported to be closely associated with the progression of multiple human diseases. For example, CPSF1 binds to influenza virus NS1, resulting in the inhibition of wild-type influenza A virus replication (

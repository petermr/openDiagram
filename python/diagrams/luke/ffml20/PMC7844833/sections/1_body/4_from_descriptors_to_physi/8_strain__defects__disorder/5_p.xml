<p>Static disorder effects due to surface relaxation or interactions with adsorbates or support are most pronounced for atoms near the NP surface.

 </sup> This limits the applicability of the XAS method for their investigation since the analysis of sample-averaged XAS spectra normally does not allow one to distinguish between the contributions of near-surface atoms and atoms in the NP core. As a result, the disorder at the NP surface (which is most relevant for understanding the catalytic properties) can in fact be much larger than that obtained from XAS data analysis since the latter weighs-in contributions of atoms at the surface but also those in the more ordered core. Nevertheless, in some special cases of very small NPs with well-defined geometry, the contributions of surface atoms can be elucidated, as described by Ericson et al. based on an 
 <italic>operando</italic> study of Pt nanocatalysts during ORR. In such examples, the variations of bond lengths obtained due to surface relaxation effects can be directly compared with those yielded by surface-sensitive techniques.

 </sup> In well-defined Au NPs prepared by a dendrimer encapsulations method, the challenge to discriminate between the disorder in the near-surface layers and that in the NP core was also addressed using the RMC method.

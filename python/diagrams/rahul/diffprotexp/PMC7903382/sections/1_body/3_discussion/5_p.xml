<p>The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is associated with MIRI (
 <xref rid="b54-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). p53 is a tumor suppressor, which exerts an important role in the process of apoptosis and is associated with the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease (
 <xref rid="b55-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="bibr">55-57</xref>). Previous studies have shown that apoptosis is a typical manifestation and primary pathological mechanism of MIRI (

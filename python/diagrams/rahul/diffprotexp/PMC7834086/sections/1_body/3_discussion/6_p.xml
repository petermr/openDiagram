<p>In summary, the current study reveals for the first time that the PirB toxin protein of VP
 <sub>AHPND</sub> induces hemocyte apoptosis by binding to histones in nucleosomes. While these are interesting findings, the specific mechanisms involved would have to be further explored using nucleosome disassembly assay, histone modifications, etc. These results provide useful information for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of AHPND in crustaceans.

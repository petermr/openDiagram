<p>Carrageenans represent a class of linear water-soluble sulfated galactan polysaccharides that are isolated mainly from marine red algae. This class of biopolymers possesses a high tendency to form thermoreversible gels through extended hydrogen bonding between molecules adopting a single-helix conformation (λ) or between double-helix molecular associations (κ and ι carrageenans) [

 <xref rid="B19-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Carrageenans form strong interpolymer complexes through hydrogen bonding with poly (vinyl alcohol), these complexes imparting higher tensile strength and improved water barrier properties to PVA films in comparison with other biopolymers such as Na-alginate, gelatin, chitosan or carboxymethylcellulose [
 <xref rid="B20-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Carrageenan (CAR) is entirely miscible with poly (vinyl alcohol) in the amorphous region, while in the crystalline domain miscibility is only partial, due to differences in the conformation and molecular weight between the two polymers [

 <xref rid="B22-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. PVA/CAR hydrogels crosslinked through the application of β and γ radiation or alternative freeze–thaw cycles (physical crosslinking) have been found useful for wound dressing [

 <xref rid="B23-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or cultivation of microalgae [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and in the lyophilized (freeze-dried) state, also suitable for tissue engineering applications [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ionic-crosslinked and chemically crosslinked PVA/κ-carrageenan hydrogels and films have been found to possess excellent in vivo biocompatibility and functionality as drug release vehicles [

 <xref rid="B27-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Composite PVA/κ-carrageenan hydrogel matrices obtained through physical crosslinking have also been applied as sorbents for cationic dyes [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or as support for photocatalytic oxides [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and bacteria [

 <caption> Mutations of m 5C writer and reader in GI cancer. (A) Alteration frequency of m 5C regulatory factors in GI cancer, including mutations, amplification, and deletion, and multiple changes were analyzed from the TCGA database and studied in cBioPortal. About 28% (52/186) of esophageal cancer, 8% (14/186) of pancreatic cancer, 19% (91/478) of stomach cancer, 5% (33/640) of colorectal cancer, 13% (56/442) of liver cancer, and 12% (234/1,928) of GI cancer had genomic changes of m 5C regulators. (B) The alteration frequency of m 5C regulatory factors in gastrointestinal cancer from the TCGA database was analyzed in cBioPortal. The gene alteration frequencies of m 5C regulators in GI cancer was 2.4% in NSUN1, 4% in NSUN2, 1.8% in NSUN5, and 2.2% in ALYREF, etc. (C) Protein structure alteration (missense, truncating, and inframe mutation) was analyzed in GI cancers. </caption>

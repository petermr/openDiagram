<p>On the other hand, it is interesting to further explore the function of MPO in the pediatric sepsis study. The neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) is mainly shown to promote oxidative stress by the production of active chlorinated molecules (

These evidences highlighted the importance of understanding the relation between the MPO gene family pathway and pediatric sepsis, which initiated a tremendous starting point for the following study. Importantly, a recent study using two feature selection methods including Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI) and Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (MRMR) also provided multiple differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways for pediatric sepsis. Within these, MPO was also a primary candidate (

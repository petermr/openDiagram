0: Our outputs were examined against the  Mycobacterium avium 104 UniProt KB database (Proteome ID UP000001574) with concatenated decoy database using Mascot search engine (version 2.4, Matrix Science, London, UK).
1: If the peptides swept the identity and homology thresholds of the Mascot algorithm, it takes up with FDR<1%.
2: Gene Ontology annotations were explored from the UniProt database ( http://www.uniprot.org/).

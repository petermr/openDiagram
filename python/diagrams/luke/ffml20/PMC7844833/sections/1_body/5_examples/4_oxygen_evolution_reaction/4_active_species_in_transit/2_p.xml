<p>Remarkable activity for OER was observed in transition metal-based oxides, hydroxides, and related materials. Moreover, the different oxidation states of the metal encountered in these materials (often coexisting within the same structure), and a multitude of possible different structures, phases, and structural motifs provide enormous possibilities to tune the properties of these catalysts.

 </sup> Ni- and Co-based oxide materials are considered to be the most active for OER due to their optimal binding to oxygen species and reaction intermediates.

 </sup> Because of their applicability for OER in neutral pH-conditions, Co-based materials are particularly attractive.

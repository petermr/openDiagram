Based on the cytotoxic activity obtained from MTT assay, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for HeLa and lymphocyte cells were calculated to be 26.4 &#956;g/m1 and 4266.7 &#956;g/m1, respectively. The IC<sub>50</sub> showed higher cytotoxicity of the oil towards the human tumor cell line in comparison with healthy human cells requirement.</p>

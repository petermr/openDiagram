<p>The differential interactome methodology is based on the idea that significant alterations occur in the proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs) among phenotypes. The success of this approach has been effectively demonstrated in various cancers and their subtypes [

The differential interactome approach made it possible to estimate the probability distributions for any possible co-expression profile of gene pairs (encoding proteins that interact with each other) across phenotypes and to determine the uncertainty of whether a PPI is meeting the corresponding phenotype.

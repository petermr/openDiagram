<p id="par0120">The proteome comparison between CV-PTC and FV-PTC showed that the expression of 2 proteins was remarkably high in all FV-PTC samples (p &lt; 0.005). Phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK1), an important glycolytic enzyme that has dual roles in tumorigenesis—regulation of cancer cell metabolism and gene transcription—was upregulated in FV-PTC samples. PGK1 has previously been reported in gastric, colon and pancrease cancer

 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Their results demonstrated that loss of PGK1 in combination with an increase in Galectin-3 could distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules. Although their study set contained 33 FV-PTC cases, there was no specific information on how PGK1 expression was changed in FV-PTC. However, increased expression of PGK1 in FV-PTC and decreased expression of this protein in CV-PTC in our work, are consistent with the findings of Ralhan et al.

0: Few tools have proven as powerful as the  Cre recombinase for the investigation of gene function in mouse models.
1: Both spatial and temporal genetic manipulations can be performed using cell-type-specific promoters to drive the expression of  Cre recombinase in combination with  Cre recognition (loxP) sites in a gene, or genes, of interest [ 1].
2: Several adipocyte-targeted  Cre transgenic mouse models have been created to facilitate the study of adipose tissue biology, function, and regulation.
3: The  Fabp4 (also called aP2[ 2],) promoter-driven  Cre mouse model was initially widely used to generate adipocyte targeted knockout mouse models but suffered from gene deletion in cells other than adipocytes, sometimes with dramatic effects [ 3, 4].
4: Further attempts to create a more adipocyte-specific  Cre transgenic mouse model used the adiponectin ( Adipoq) gene promoter to drive  Cre expression.
5: Two groups created  Adipoq-Cre mouse models, with one using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene [ 5] and the other using a 5.4-kb promoter fragment to drive  Cre expression.
6: These models demonstrated greatly improved selectivity for adipocytes and the model using the BAC transgene has gained wide use, with higher levels of observed recombination in adipocytes compared to the 5.4-kb promoter fragment driven  Adipoq-Cre model [ 6], and public availability through the Jackson Laboratory mouse repository (Stock #028020).

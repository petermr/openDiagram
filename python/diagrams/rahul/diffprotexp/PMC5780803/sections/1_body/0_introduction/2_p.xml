<p>In the present study, the Caki-1 cell line with XIAP overexpression was selected and a stably transfected Caki-1 cell line with XIAP-knockdown was established using RNA interference technology. The general dynamic difference in proteins between the 2 cell lines was determined through proteomic analysis, using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology, during apoptosis induced by etoposide. Through determination of the significantly differentially expressed proteins, certain features in the potential downstream regulatory proteins of XIAP were observed. These results suggest that XIAP may serve important roles in a diverse set of non-apoptotic signaling pathways in RCC and may have potential value in tumor gene therapy.</p>

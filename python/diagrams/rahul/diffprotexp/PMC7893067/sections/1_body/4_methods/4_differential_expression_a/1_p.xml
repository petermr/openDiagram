 <italic>.</italic> Strand-specific read counts were used with the R package DESeq2 (v1.12.4)

 </sup> to identify differentially expressed genes (adjusted 
 <italic>p-value</italic> &lt; 0.05, Benjamini–Hochberg correction). Gene counts were normalized prior to differential analysis using the normalization method implemented in DESeq2. To identify differentially expressed snoRNA genes, all the rRNA and tRNA genes were removed from the quantified genes prior to performing differential analysis. For the cyto–cyto and nuc–nuc differential gene expression analysis, we subsampled the read counts from the samples to obtain equal library sizes using metaseqR

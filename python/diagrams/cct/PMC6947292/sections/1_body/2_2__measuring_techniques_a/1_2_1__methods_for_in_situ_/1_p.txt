0: In metals which allow precipitation hardening, the relevant solid-solid phase transformations typically only amount to a small percentage of the total atomic fraction (excluding Ni-based super-alloys), and thus their detection requires very sensitive measurement setups.
1: As mentioned in the introduction, the in-situ analysis of solid-solid phase transformations typically requires continuous analysis of the property of a particular material that changes with the phase transformation.

<p>In this study, SASCs, EASCs, and PASCs were extracted from three different adipose deposits in rats, and transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were used to reveal that there were 720 DEGs in EASCs and 688 DEGs in PASCs compared with SASCs. In addition, there were 166 unique DEGs in EASCs (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>), and 554 common DEGs between EASCs and PASCs. Furthermore, there were 226 differential metabolites in EASCs, 255 differential metabolites in PASCs, 83 unique differential metabolites in EASCs, 112 unique differential metabolites in PASCs, and 143 common differential metabolites between EASCs and PASCs.

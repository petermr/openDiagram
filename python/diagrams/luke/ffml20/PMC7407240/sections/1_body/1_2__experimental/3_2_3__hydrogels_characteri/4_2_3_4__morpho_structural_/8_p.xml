<p>A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a total attenuated reflectance device (ATR-FTIR, Nicolet iS10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to attain the IR spectra of the samples (dried over CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> for seven days before analysis) in the 4000–600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> domain, with a 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> resolution, with 10 averaged scans per spectrum.

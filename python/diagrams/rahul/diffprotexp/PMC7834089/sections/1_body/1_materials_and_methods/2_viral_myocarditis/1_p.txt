0: CVB3 (Nancy strain, USA) was maintained and expanded using Hep2 cells.
1: The viral titer was determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay.
2: Mice were randomly assigned to six groups receiving the following treatments: normal mice (Control), VMC mice (VMC), VMC mice with unilateral (right-sided) cervical vagus nerve dissociation without mutilation of cervical vagus nerve (VMC+Sham), VMC mice with vagotomy (VMC+Vag), VMC mice with vagotomy and pnu282987 administration (VMC+V+P), and VMC mice with pnu282987 administration (VMC+Pnu).
3: In preparation for vagotomy, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2% sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and fixed in place on the operating table.
4: After shaving and sterilizing the neck and chest, a one-centimeter incision was made in the middle of the neck, and the tissue was separated.
5: The right cervical vagus nerve was dissociated and cut off, and the incision was sutured.
6: In the VMC+Sham group, the vagus nerve was only isolated from surrounding tissue but was not transected.
7: All operations were performed under anesthesia.
8: After surgery 24 h, all mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 0.1 mL of normal saline containing 10 5 TCID50 of CVB3 except for the Control group.
9: The Control group was intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 ml saline solution.
10: The day of virus inoculation was defined as d 0.
11: For agonist treatment, mice received intraperitoneal injection of pnu282987 (Pnu, a selective 7nAChR agonist, Sigma, USA, 2 mg/kg/d, 0.1% DMSO) from d 1 to 14 [ 21], while controls were injected with the same dose of vehicle (0.1% DMSO in saline).

0: Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed using the QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) as per manufacturers protocol and published methods [ 10].
1: All reaction preparation was performed in a dedicated PCR hood.
2: ddPCR runs included negative template controls and were run in triplicate.
3: Thresholds were manually set for each sample using acceptance criteria defined during the optimization of each assay.
4: The QuantaSoft Analysis software V1.0 was used to assign positive/negative droplets and convert to a copies per mL format.
5: This data was then normalized to  Rpp30 and presented as copies per genome.

<p id="Par14">The presence of ERY changes not only the magnitude of rupture force but also the shape of the force versus time profile. For ErmCL, the mean-maximum-rupture force is increased dramatically from 469 pN to 2,640 pN. Moreover, sharp peaks in the force profiles appear in the presence of ERY (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results indicate that the presence of ERY in the exit tunnel impedes the movement of ErmCL through the tunnel. In the case of H-NS, the presence of ERY also increases its mean-maximum-rupture force from 599.9 to 1,394 pN, however, the rupture force is nearly half that of ErmCL. Additionally, the distribution of rupture forces is statistically different between the two peptides in the presence of ERY (Student’s t-test,

<p id="Par24">The regulatory network between circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA indicated that circRAB11FIP1 might regulate the expression of ATG14 and ATG7 through miR-129 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). The sequencing data found that the mRNA expression of ATG14 and ATG7 was induced by Torn1. The study confirmed using qPCR that Torn1 induced the expression of ATG14 and ATG7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). The knockdown of circRAB11FIP1 obviously suppressed the expression of ATG7 and ATG14 within SKOV3 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). In contrast, circRAB11FIP1 ectopic expression significantly promoted the expression of ATG7 and ATG14 within A2780 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). It was predicted that ATG14 and ATG7 were also the targets of miR-129 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). The dual-luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that ATG14 and ATG7 were the direct targets of miR-129 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). The miR-129 mimics inhibited the expression of ATG14 and ATG7 in SKOV3 cells. This regulation was rescued via circRAB11FIP1 overexpression. The miR-129 inhibitor significantly elevated the expression of ATG7 and ATG14 in A2780 cells. This regulation was rescued via the knockdown of circRAB11FIP1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>).

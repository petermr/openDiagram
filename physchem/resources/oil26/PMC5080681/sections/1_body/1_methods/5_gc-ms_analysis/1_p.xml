The GC was equipped with Rtx-5&#160;ms column (30&#160;m long, 0.25&#160;&#956;m thickness and 0.250&#160;mm inner diameter). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1&#160;ml/min. Injector temperature was 220&#160;&#176;C. Oven temperature was programmed from 50&#160;&#176;C (1&#160;min hold) at 5&#160;&#176;C/min to 130&#160;&#176;C, then at 10&#160;&#176;C/min to 250&#160;&#176;C and kept isothermally for 15&#160;min. Transfer line temperature was 290&#160;&#176;C. For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system, with detector volts of 1.7 KV was used. A scan rate of 0.5&#160;s, and scan speed 1000&#160;amu/s was applied, covering a mass range from 38&#8211;450&#160;M/Z.</p>

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We recovered the <italic>ACPT</italic> gene tree with well-supported values by using Mrbayes method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). In this gene tree, most of orders have been well reconstructed, and have high support rate, for example, Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Eulipotyphla, Carnivora, Chiroptera etc. In addition, phylogenetic relationships of higher levels have also been well reconstructed, such as Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires, Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria. In this gene tree, bayesian posterior probability (PP) values of nearly 70% nodes are generally greater than 0.70. However, the relationship between some order level were relatively chaotic, such as Lagomorpha didn&#8217;t cluster with Rodentia, but as the sister group of Primate; Chiroptera and Carnivora clustered together first, and then they became sister group of Perissodactyla.</p>

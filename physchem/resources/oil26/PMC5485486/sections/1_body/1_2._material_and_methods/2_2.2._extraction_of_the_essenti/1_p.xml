Then the essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type device (samples were 100&#8201;g of crushed leaves in 1.5&#8201;l distilled water). At the end of the distillation process, the organic phase which contains the essential oil is separated from the hydrosol (aqueous phase) with ether followed by gentle removal of the solvent by evaporation. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.1% to 0.2%.</p>

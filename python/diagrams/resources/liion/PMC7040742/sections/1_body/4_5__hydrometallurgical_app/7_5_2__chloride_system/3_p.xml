<p>The first reaction is thermodynamically favored when comparing the standard potential of O
 <sub>2(g)</sub> (1.23 V) versus Cl
 <sub>2(g)</sub> 1.36 V). However, the slower kinetics of oxygen evolution can promote oxidation of chloride anions to chlorine. On the other hand, cobalt is frequently used as an oxygen reduction catalyst in fuel cells. Therefore, considering the proximity of electromotive forces (EMF) for both reactions, kinetic aspect, and effect of local concentration gradient, both reactions are most probably happening. Previous literature does not provide a clear answer to this.

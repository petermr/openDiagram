<p>Upon stimulation with AC EFs, similar to PC12 cells [
 <xref rid="B41-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], no significant differences in corneal epithelial cell viability or proliferation were observed. All of the literature reports so far used constant electric stimulation to study the effects of external EF applications on corneal epithelial cells and showed increased cell division, directional migration [
 <xref rid="B42-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], regeneration [
 <xref rid="B43-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and wound healing [
 <xref rid="B1-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MMPs play a crucial role in corneal wound healing [
 <xref rid="B44-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and corneal epithelial cells show enhanced MMP3 and unaltered MMP2 and MMP9 expression following DC EF stimulation [
 <xref rid="B45-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our gene array data also showed increased expression of MMP1 (48-fold), MMP10 (20-fold), and MMP9 (4-fold) and decreased expression of MMP2, MMP13, and MMP19 (2-fold each), whereas protein array data showed upregulation of MMPs 1, 7, 10, and 12. The application of DC EFs is known to significantly increase the activation of AKT and impact the PI3K/AKT pathway, which plays an important role in cell survival, growth, migration, and metabolism [
 <xref rid="B46-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further, DC-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway was also reported in different cell types, including neural progenitor cells [
 <xref rid="B47-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], Schwann cells [
 <xref rid="B48-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) [
 <xref rid="B49-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], as well as in ocular cells, including the corneal epithelium [
 <xref rid="B6-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway is also reported through the application of EFs in neuronal cells [
 <xref rid="B51-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], fibroblasts, HUVEC [
 <xref rid="B53-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and corneal epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B6-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Likewise, we also observed activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, along with other interconnected pathways, including T cell receptor signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, TNF signaling, IL-17 signaling, FoxO signaling, and focal adhesion pathways, upon stimulation of corneal epithelial cells with oscillating EFs. In addition, electric stimulation upregulates expression of RAGs, increases neurotrophin signaling, accelerates axon guidance and outgrowth during peripheral nerve regeneration [
 <xref rid="B25-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and is also known to activate axon guidance, along with various metabolic and signaling pathways that play crucial interconnecting roles during axon regeneration [
 <xref rid="B17-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,

 <xref rid="B59-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Accordingly, our gene array data analysis also showed activation of similar pathways during AC EF stimulation of corneal epithelial cells.

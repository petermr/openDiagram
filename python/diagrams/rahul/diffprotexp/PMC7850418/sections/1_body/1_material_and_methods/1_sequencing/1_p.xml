<p>Early routine genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the National Reference Center (NRC) of Respiratory Viruses is based on daily random selection of samples with SARS-CoV-2 detected with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) &lt;20 [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which were then sequenced using an RNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) method previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, viral genetic material contained in nasopharyngeal and stool samples was extracted by the EMAG® platform (bioMerieux, Lyon, FR). After DNAse treatment (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), samples underwent random amplification using Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA2 kit, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, DE) before sequencing on an Illumina NextSeqTM 550 with mid-output 2 × 150 flow cell. Importantly, the variants displaying an ORF6 deletion were confirmed by 3 other techniques, including capture- and amplicon-based strategies [

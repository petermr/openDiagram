<p id="Par37">While the high expression levels of mitochondrial H
 <sup>+</sup> transporters in all chambers is understandable given the energy needs for the sustained muscular effort, those of 
 <italic>Kctd14</italic> (potassium channel tetramerisation domain containing 14) came as a surprise. Not only the observed high expressions are against the negligible values reported by NCBI sequencing data for the adult mouse heart (

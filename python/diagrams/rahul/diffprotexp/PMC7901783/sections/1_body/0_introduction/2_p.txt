0: Plant viruses are obligate parasites that are dependent on their host to establish a successful infection cycle including gene expression, genome replication, protein synthesis, and intercellular movement.
1: During the infection, protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions may induce plant defense mechanisms such as innate immunity, translational repression, autophagy-mediated or ubiquitinated-mediated protein degradation, and RNA interference (RNAi) [ 15,  16].
2: Activation of the host immune responses result in either a compatible or incompatible response in the plant and is followed by a susceptible or resistance reaction to virus, respectively.
3: Among these interactions, RNAi is one of the major evolutionarily-conserved defense mechanisms against viruses, and viral evasion from this resistance response is a crucial event in viral pathogenesis [ 17].

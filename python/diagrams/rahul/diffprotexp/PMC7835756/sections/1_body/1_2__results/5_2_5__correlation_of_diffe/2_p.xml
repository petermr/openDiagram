 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows a heatmap of 83 genes with DmC-DEG, where the gene ID number and identity of the gene was aligned with the differential methylation level and the context in each one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), as well as the differential expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). In most of the genes, a positive correlation was observed, where hypomethylated sites were associated with downregulation expression of genes.

<p>The extraction of graphite from the mixture of shredded anode and cathode can be performed via selective flotation. This common technique is part of the processes patented by Retriev Technologies [

 <xref rid="B108-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The effectiveness of flotation was studied by Yu et al. who used n-dodecane as collector [
 <xref rid="B109-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] and generated a 97.2% LCO concentrate. Alternatively, He et al. proposed the decomposition of the PVDF binder via a Fenton process prior to carbon flotation [
 <xref rid="B110-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The amount of carbon black and PVDF effectively decreased by 50% in the LCO flotation concentrate [
 <xref rid="B110-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Lastly, Kepler et al. proposed the recovery of carbon from the floating fraction of the dense media separation step by allowing the active material to deposit at the bottom of the vessel [
 <xref rid="B111-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Although many organic and inorganic liquids or solutions could be used for this process, it could be challenging to find those that are non-toxic and environmentally friendly.

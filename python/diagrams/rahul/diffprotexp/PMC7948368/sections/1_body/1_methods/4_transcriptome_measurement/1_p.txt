0: Total RNA (100 ng) was amplified and converted into biotinylated sense-strand cDNA targets using the Affymetrix WT PLUS kit according to the manufacturers instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: All samples were collected using the same study protocol, irrespective of clinical features.
2: We adhered to the manufacturers recommendations regarding RNA quality control (260/280 ratio between 1.7 and 2.1).
3: The Nanodrop ND-1000 was used to monitor and normalise cDNA concentration across samples throughout the target preparation.
4: Samples of different response status and time-point were arranged in the 96-well plate at random to avoid cDNA conversion bias.
5: For each sample, 5-g of fragmented, end-labelled sense-strand target cDNA was hybridised to a GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array (HTA) 2.0 before incubation for 16 h at 45 C in the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 645.
6: Following hybridisation, arrays were washed and stained using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G with Autoloader to generate a raw CEL data file for each sample.

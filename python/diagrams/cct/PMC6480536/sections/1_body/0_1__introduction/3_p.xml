<p>It is widely accepted that oxide particles tend to be stable at high temperatures and induce AF nucleation during cooling. In welding HAZ, the effect of oxide particles is always evaluated under conditions of a high peak temperature around 1400 °C and a short holding period between several and a few tens of seconds [

The effectiveness of oxide inducing AF nucleation and the relevant Mn-depleted zone (MDZ) mechanism remains to be further verified. Results of Wen et al. showed that AF could well nucleate with an austenitizing temperature at 1200 °C in Ce deoxidized steel [

Effects of austenitizing temperature and holding time on microstructure transformation at various cooling rates in Ti–Ca deoxidized steel have not been researched. The present study is aimed to clarify the influence of austenitization parameters on the effect of Ti–Ca oxide particles on microstructure evolution behaviors in low carbon steel, which will be conducive to its application in hot rolled or forged steel products.

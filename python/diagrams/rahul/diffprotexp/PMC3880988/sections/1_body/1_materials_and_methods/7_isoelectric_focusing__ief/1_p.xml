<p>Prior to IEF, cell lysate was precipitated in acetone. Immobiline DryStrips (24cm, pH 3-10, GE Healthcare-Amersham Biosciences, NJ) were rehydrated with 100 μg of protein, in 450 μL of solubilization solution. IEF was conducted using the IPGphor IEF System (GE Healthcare, USA) 
 <italic>via</italic> rehydration for 18 hours at room temperature, 1 hour at 500 V, 1 hour at 1000 V and 8 hours at 8000 V, resulting in a total of 75 000 V hour. The gel strips were equilibrated in two steps of 15 minutes each with gentle agitation. The first equilibration solution contained 1% DTT. In the second equilibration solution, the DTT was replaced with 1.5% iodoacetamide. After equilibration, the IPG strips were rinsed gently with

 <sub>2</sub>O, followed by a blotting to remove excess equilibration buffer. The IPG strips were then transferred onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels before being overlaid with 0.5% agarose. 2-D SDS-PAGE was conducted at 100 V for 1 hour and 400 V for 7 hours using the Ettan DALT twelve system (GE Healthcare, USA). The proteins were stained using a silver-staining method as described by Chevallet

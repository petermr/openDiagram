<p id="Par13">RTPCR analysis of 50 genes selected for the validation study showed significant differential expression of the genes for the regeneration mechanism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b). Almost all the up and downregulated genes which were identified from the transcriptomic analysis were found to be associated with regeneration through differential regulation based on RTPCR analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Heat map analysis of the gene expression based on RTPCR analysis also showed association of 2 and 5-dpa as cluster against 1-dpa expression.

<p>The manuscript by Canales provides a comprehensive study of the effects of maternal immune activation (MIA) using a rigorous and carefully validated MIA mouse model. A major strength of the manuscript is the investigation of changes across time. The results are of broad interest to the fields of developmental neuroscience and neurodevelopmental disorders, where MIA is a risk factor for schizophrenia and autism.</p>

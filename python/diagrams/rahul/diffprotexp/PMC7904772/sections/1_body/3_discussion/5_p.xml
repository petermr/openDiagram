<p id="Par29">These PRM-detected phenotype-specific dysregulated proteins were primarily involved in the synapse, signaling, and metabolic pathways. Cplx2, Gnai2, and Grm2 were involved in synaptic plasticity-associated pathways, such as synaptic vesicle cycle and glutamatergic synapse. Gfap, Spred1, and Mtor participated in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and Urod, Gpcpd1, and Tsta3 were involved in various metabolic processes, such as porphyrin and chlorophyll, choline, and sugar metabolisms. Previously, these important pathways have been preliminarily implicated in stress-related disorders

 </sup>. In the present study, the found protein expression perturbations distinctly associated with the three behavioral phenotypes could provide clearer information for future research.

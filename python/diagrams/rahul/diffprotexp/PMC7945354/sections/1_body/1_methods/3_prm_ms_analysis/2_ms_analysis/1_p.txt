0: The same mass of peptides from each sample was extracted and mixed well, and 2 g of each sample was separated with nano-LC and analyzed by online electrospray tandem MS.
1: The complete liquid-mass tandem system was composed of a liquid system (Easy nLC system; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and an MS system (Q-Exactive; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).
2: Buffer A was composed of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution, and buffer B was composed of 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile aqueous solution (acetonitrile was 80%).
3: The sample was separated by an analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA; Acclaim PepMap RSLC 50 m  15 cm, nano viper, P/N164943) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min using the following nonlinear increasing gradient: 01 min, 2% B to 8% B; 146 min, 8% B to 28% B; 4656 min, 28% B to 40% B; 5657 min, 40% B to 90% B; and 5760 min, 90% B.

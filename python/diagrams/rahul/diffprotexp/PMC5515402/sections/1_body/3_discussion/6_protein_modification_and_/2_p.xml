<p>PDIA6 and PPIA, two isomerases involved in protein modification and folding, were modulated in response to AAS treatment. Increased PDIA6 is associated to unfolded proteins response (UPR), a biological process that accumulates misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, as a result of stress signals [

 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], since 2D-DIGE detects PTM’s and protein isoforms, whereas western blotting detects the overall protein signal [

Although 17α-meT might be inducing PTMs on PPIA, as observed by over and underexpressed spots, increased expression of this protein has been related to dexamethasone [

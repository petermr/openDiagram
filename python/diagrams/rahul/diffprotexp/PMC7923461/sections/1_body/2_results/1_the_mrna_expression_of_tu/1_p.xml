<p id="Par46">In order to determine the difference between the expression of TUBA1C in tumor tissues and normal tissues, we used TIMER algorithm to analyze the mRNA expression of TUBA1C in different types of tumors that were obtained from TCGA database (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Compared to normal tissues, the mRNA expression of TUBA1C was found to be higher in the following types of tumors: bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HWSC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), LUAD, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC).

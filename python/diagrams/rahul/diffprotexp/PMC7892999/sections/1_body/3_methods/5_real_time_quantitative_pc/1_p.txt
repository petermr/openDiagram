0: One microgram of total RNA from each of the 12 carrot samples described above was used for RT-qPCR.
1: Protocols for cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR were performed according to Lijavetzky et al.
2: (2008) using a StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies).
3: Non-template controls were included for each primer pair, and each RT-qPCR reaction was completed in triplicate.
4: Expression data were normalized against the carrot  actin-7 gene (LOC108202619).
5: Relative quantification was performed by means of the Ct method using the pcr R package 80.
6: Gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer Blast web tool 81 and the sequences are described in Supplementary Table  S7.

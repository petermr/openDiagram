 <caption> Identification of common genes in sepsis. ( A) Petal plot of sample size for sepsis and control groups in four datasets. Red petals represent healthy controls; blue petals, sepsis patients. ( B) Manhattan plot of differentially expressed genes between sepsis patients and healthy controls in GSE13904 and GSE154918. Up, up-regulation in sepsis; Down, down-regulation in sepsis; Not, no significant difference from controls. The three genes in each group showing the largest fold difference are labeled. ( C) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes in GSE13904 (children) and GSE154918 (adults). ( D) Venn diagram showing DEGs in GSE13904 (children) and GSE154918 (adults) as well as module genes, that are common to adults and children or specific to each one of those groups. </caption>

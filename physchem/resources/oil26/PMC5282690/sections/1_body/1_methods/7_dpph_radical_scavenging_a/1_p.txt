0: The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of the EOs was evaluated as described by Senthilkumar et al.
1: [ 42], with slight modifications.
2: A volume of 1 ml of 0.1 mM of methanolic solution of the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) was added to 1 ml of increased doses of AcEO ranging from 0.1 mg/ml to 2 mg/ml previously dissolved in methanol.
3: A control sample using methanol instead of AcEO was prepared.
4: Ascorbic acid dissolved in methanol (0.12 mg/ml) was used as standard.
5: The preparations were incubated for 30 min in obscurity at room temperature, then after, absorbance was measured at 517 nm.
6: Pure methanol was used as blank.
7: Measurements were carried out in triplicate for each experiment.

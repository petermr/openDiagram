<p>Protein lists and their corresponding expression values (fold change) were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) web based software [
 <xref rid="B22-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to interpret the biological relevance of the differential protein expression data. IPA Core Analysis was used to get a rapid assessment of the signaling and metabolic pathways, upstream regulators, molecular networks, and biological processes. IPA Functional Analysis was identified based on Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base (IPKB) that was most significantly related to the dataset. 
 <italic>p</italic>-value calculated by Right-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the probability that each biological function assigned to that data set was due to chance alone. The Canonical Pathways Analysis identified the pathways from IPA’s library of canonical pathways based on the proteins involved in each pathway. The Upstream Regulator Analytic identified the cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators that can explain the observed gene expression changes in a dataset and illuminate the biological activities occurring in the tissues or cells being studied.

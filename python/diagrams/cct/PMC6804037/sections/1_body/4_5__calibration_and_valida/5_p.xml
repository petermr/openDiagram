<p>The model was validated comparing the thermal cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f018">Figure 18</xref>) with CCT curves to predict the microstructures in the hardened zones of AISI 4130 steel. Based on the CCT diagram, at high cooling rates (v = 130 Â°C/s) a martensitic microstructure with retained austenite was observed. The CCT curve is shown in

0: The DPPH free radical scavenging activity was evaluated according to Bellocco et al.
1: [ 24].
2: Briefly, freshly DPPH methanol solution (10 4 M), was mixed with 37.5 L of sample solution (range 2.40.300 mg/mL), and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s at room temperature (RT).
3: The decrease in absorption at 517 nm, against blank, was measured after 20 min using an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601, Kyoto, Japan).
4: The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated by the following equation: (1)Inhibition (%)=A0ASA0100 where  A0 is absorbance of the control and  A  S is absorbance of the sample after 20 min incubation.

<p id="p0200">We provided the potential mechanisms of obesity-associated dysfunctions and dysregulations of inter-organ metabolic cycles of glucose-alanine and glucose-lactate: (1) activation of the gluconeogenesis pathway both from alanine and lactate by increased enzyme expression in the liver and (2) impaired glycolysis by decreased enzyme expression in skeletal muscle. In the activation of gluconeogenesis pathway in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, expression of 
 <italic>Gpt2</italic> and 
 <italic>Ldha</italic>, encoding enzymes that catalyze alanine and lactate to pyruvate, respectively, and of 
 <italic>Asct2</italic>, encoding an alanine transporter, were upregulated by the common DRTF, 
 <italic>Pparg</italic>, suggesting a mechanism for coordinated activation of these dysregulated processes in liver. Taken together, the data suggested that dysregulations of the glucose-alanine and glucose-lactate cycles involve activation of gluconeogenesis in liver and inhibition of glycolysis in skeletal muscle, which may contribute to hyperglycemia of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. However, further studies are required to elucidate the causal relationship between obesity-associated changes of the activation status of pathways and dysregulation of the inter-organ metabolic cycles. Moreover, we found that blood glucose and phosphorylation of As160 in skeletal muscle increased, whereas downstream glycolytic metabolites (G6P to PEP) decreased, suggesting that Glut4 translocation to plasma membrane, which is downstream of As160, may be impaired in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. This may be the key mechanism of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice.

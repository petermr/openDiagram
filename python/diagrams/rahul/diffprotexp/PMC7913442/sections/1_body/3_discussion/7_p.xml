<p id="Par47">Our data revealed that ectopic expression of FOXO1 specifically and strongly moderated the overall effect of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> compared to FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup>, directly repressing the number of DEGs between FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> + FOXO1 and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b, f). This parallels our previous findings where our data indicated the inhibitory action of FOXO1 to SMAD3/FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We identified potential targets of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> that are significantly modulated by FOXO1 (58 genes, of which 39 in common) in the DEGs between FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> + FOXO1 and FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d) confirming that FOXO1 attenuates DEGs genes that were upregulated/downregulated by FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>. We also identified 10 targets genes annotated in both ChIP-seq analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). GO analysis of these genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) revealed FOXO1 modified similar pathways (peptidyl-lysine modification, chromatin remodeling, and ECM regulation) as those triggered by FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>.

0: In this study, we sought to analyze the role of miRNAs in seed development and seed size/weight determination using a smallseeded (Himchana 1) and a largeseeded (JGK 3) chickpea cultivar.
1: Small RNAs (smRNAs) from seven successive stages of seed development and leaf tissue were sequenced from both the cultivars.
2: Several known and novel miRNAs were identified and their differential expression at different stage(s) of seed development within and between the cultivars was determined.
3: To understand the influence of miRNAs on gene regulation, the correlation between expression and/or differential expression of miRNAs with their target genes was analyzed.
4: The sets of coexpressed miRNAs and their functional relevance in seed size/weight determination were also interrogated.
5: Further, we investigated the role of miRNAs in regulating sets of genes encoding transcription factors and genes located within known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed size/weight determination.
6: Overall, we provide a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs and revealed their roles in seed development and seed size/weight determination in chickpea.

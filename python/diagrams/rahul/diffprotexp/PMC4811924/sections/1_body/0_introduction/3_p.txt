0: Apart from surgical intervention (when applicable), antibiotics are the main option for the treatment of biofilm infections (Bjarnsholt et al.,  2013).
1: Previous studies showed that macrolides successfully inhibited  Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and reduced its virulence when used at sub-inhibitory concentrations (Fujimura et al.,  2008).
2: In addition, a sub-minimal inhibitory concentration of erythromycin can inhibit  S. suis biofilm formation (Zhao et al.,  2015).
3: Tylosin, a macrolide antibiotic produced by  Streptomyces fradiae, is widely used as a veterinary medicine.
4: However, there is still not much effective research of sub-MIC tylosin inhibiting biofilm formation of  S. suis in vitro.

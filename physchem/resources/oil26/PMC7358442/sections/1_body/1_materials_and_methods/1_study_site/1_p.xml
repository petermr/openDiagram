<p>The study was carried out between July 2012 and September 2015 at Tswalu, a private nature reserve in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa (S 27°14′, E 22°22′). The dominant vegetation type comprised Kalahari thornveld (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Engelbrecht et al., 2015</xref>), and already experiences low and highly variable rainfall, including sporadic droughts (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>). The majority of rain falls between December and April (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Tokura, 2016</xref>). The hot season in which air temperatures peak at ∼35°C lasts from November to February, which overlaps with the period during which rainfall typically occurs. The cold season in which air temperatures frequently drop below zero lasts from June to September and typically coincides with the driest period.

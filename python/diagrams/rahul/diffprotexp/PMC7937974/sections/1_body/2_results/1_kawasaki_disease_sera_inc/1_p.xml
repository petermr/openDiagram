<p>We first detected the levels of E-selectin in HCAECs after treatment with KD sera or healthy control sera for 4 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A–C</xref>, incubation of HCAECs with sera from KD subjects with CAL+ resulted in a significantly higher expression of E-selectin when compared with CAL– and HC group, which followed the order of HC &lt; KD-CAL– &lt;KD-CAL+. Intracellular localization and the expression levels of E-selectin were determined by immunofluorescence. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D,E</xref>, E-selectin was mainly distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm when treated with serum from KD subjects. The expression levels of E-selectin were consistent with Western blot and qPCR.

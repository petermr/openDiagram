<p>The following

 <italic>E
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic> was set to values between 4.2 and 8.2 kJ/cm in the initial state of 12 mm CTWD. Increasing CTWD from 12 to 52 mm shows a steady reduction of the energy input per unit length. This relation is represented independently from the parameter set. It was evident that an increase in CTWD of 8 mm led to a reduction of energy input per unit length of 8%. A CTWD of 52 mm exhibited the maximum reduction in energy input per unit length of 40% compared to the initial state. These results correspond to the state of the art in the field of joint welding and cladding as described [

0: 10 ml of induced overnight cultures (LB medium supplemented with arabinose 1% (w/v)) was harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3000 x g, 4C).
1: The supernatant was discarded, and the bacterial pellets were washed by re-suspending in sterile PBS followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 x g and 4C.
2: The washing step was repeated twice.
3: Pellets were frozen for 30 min at 80C and then resuspended in 1.1 ml protein resuspension buffer (1045 l PBS, 11 l PMSF solution (100 mM), 44 l protein inhibitor complete (25x) (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
4: The samples were transferred to Lysing Matrix E tubes (MP Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany) and processed with the Precellys24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France).
5: The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and stored at 20C until further use.
6: The protein concentrations of the whole cell extracts were determined using the Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (BioRad, Munich, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions in a Tecan Infinite F200 plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany).
7: 10 g, 5 g, and 2.5 g of total protein extracts of EAEC strain 55989  agg3   harboring one of the plasmids pAAF/I, pAAF/III, pAAF/IV or pAAF/V, as well as 10 g of EAEC strain 55989  agg3  (pBAD24) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting according to the standard protocols described elsewhere [ 28].
8: Polyclonal antibodies used for detection of AAF variant major subunits AggA to Agg5A expression were generated by Davids Biotechnologie GmbH (Regensburg, Germany).
9: Primary antibodies were used in a 1:2000 dilution.
10: For the detection of the primary antibodies an anti-rabbit antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) (1:15,000) and the Clarity ECL solution (BioRad, Munich, Germany) was used.
11: The signals were recorded using the ChemiDoc MP System (BioRad, Munich, Germany).
12: For details about antibodies see Supplementary Table S4.

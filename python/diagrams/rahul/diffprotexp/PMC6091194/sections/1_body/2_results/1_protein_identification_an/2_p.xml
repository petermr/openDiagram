 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref> show the total number of proteins either up- or downregulated per two age group comparisons. Proteins only present at a particular age were observed separately. We compared the mean normalized spectral counts to identify proteins that were upregulated during development. The data show there are 359 proteins differentially expressed between P3 and P14, and of these, 116 and 39 proteins are up- and downregulated on P3, respectively, with a greater than two-fold change. In comparison, of the 389 proteins differentially expressed between P3 and P30, 103 and 62 are up- and downregulated on P3, respectively, with a greater than two-fold change. The 25 proteins with the largest fold change between P3 and 14 and between P3 and P30 are listed in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, respectively. A complete list is in Additional file

<p>We selected seven miRNAs to confirm their expression by RT-qPCR stem-loop. For this, we used a stable loop-type structure (stem-loop) to provide additional length to the target cDNA, optimize its melting temperature (Tm), and improve the assay’s specificity (

The miRNAs RT and qPCR assays were conducted with the mirVana™ microRNA Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. We started with 65 ng of RNA for RT, and cDNA synthesis run in a thermocycler (BIO-RAD, Hercules, California, USA): 30 min at 16 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 85 °C. For qPCR, we used 2.5 µg of cDNA in the Chromo4™ thermal cycler (BIO-RAD) under the program: 3 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles: 15 s at 95 °C for denaturation, followed by 1 min at 60 °C for ringing and 1 min at 72 °C extensions, after 40 cycles a final extension left at 72 °C for 10 min.

<p>Cultured HCC cells were plated in six-well plates and transfected with CPSF1 plasmids or siRNAs. Equal number of cells (1,000 cells) from each group was embedded in 2 mL of 0.35% agar solution and layered on top of 1.5 mL of 0.6% basal agar layer pre-coated in a six-well plate. Fresh medium (200 μL) was added every 3 days. The plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 3 weeks. Colony formation was determined by counting colonies larger than 50 μm in 10 fields under the 4× magnification under a microscope.

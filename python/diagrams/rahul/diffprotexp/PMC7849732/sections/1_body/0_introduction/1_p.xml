<p>Poorly managed pain is a global health concern. Women, in particular, show a high prevalence and sensitivity to both visceral and somatic pain and an increased tendency to develop certain chronic pain diseases [

 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To develop better treatment approaches for these conditions, the molecular underpinnings of pain processing need to be fully characterized. Unfortunately, the vast majority of investigations into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of spinal nociceptive processing have been conducted in male rodent models of pain only. Direct comparison of the molecular determinants of spinal excitability between males and females is therefore essential to understand which potential pain targets are conserved or diverge across sex.

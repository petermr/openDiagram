0: The superoxide anion scavenging activity of the sample was determined according to Barreca et al.
1: [ 23].
2: The reaction mix was composed of 1.0 mL of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) solution (156 M NBT in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), 1.0 mL of -nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) solution (468 M in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), and 20 L of sample solution (range 603.75 g/mL).
3: The reaction was started by adding 100 L phenazine methosulphate (PMS) solution (60 M PMS in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) to the mixture.
4: The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 C for 5 min, and absorbance at 560 nm was measured against blank samples with a Varian Cary 50 UV-VIS spectrophotometer.
5: The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).

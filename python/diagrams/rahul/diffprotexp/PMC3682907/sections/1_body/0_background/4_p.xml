<p>In this study, we used SELDI-TOF-MS to obtain protein profiles from mitochondrially-enriched fractions derived from EAE and control mouse brain. To gain insight into sources of experimental variability, we examined the reproducibility of sub-cellular fractionation, anion exchange fractionation as well as spot-to-spot and chip-to-chip variation using pooled samples from brain tissue.</p>

<p>Then, we filtered DIPs by considering whether they are secreted in body fluids and renamed secreted proteins as “s-DIPs” (

The importance of secretion in body fluids that can be accessed without surgery is that it might provide serious convenience for early diagnosis. While s-DIPs were used for diagnosis analysis, all DIPs (s-DIPs and non-s-DIPs) were considered in prognosis and druggability (virtual screening) analyses.

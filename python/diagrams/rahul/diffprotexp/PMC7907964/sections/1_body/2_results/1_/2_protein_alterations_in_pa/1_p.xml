<p>Proteomics and label-free quantitative analysis were performed to identify proteins that may be associated with PD. For this purpose, the protein lysates of four healthy controls were pooled and compared with those of the individual variants. The first comparison set was the pool of controls (controls 1-4) and two individual samples of patients with PD carrying heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants; PD-GBA-1 (c.1309delG) and PD-GBA-2 (IVS2+1G&gt;A). The second set was the pool of controls (controls 1-4) and two individual samples of patients with PD carrying heterozygous 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants; PD-PARK2-1 (c.2T&gt;C) and PD-PARK2-2 (exon8del).

<p>In this study, we carried out a series of bioinformatics analysis and qPCR validation of differential mRNAs and lncRNAs based on the transcriptome data obtained from Affymetrix GeneChip HTA2.0. The bioinformatics analysis results indicated important biological processes and pathways in tumor–endothelium interaction. By constructing and analyzing a differential mRNA–mRNA interaction network and mRNA–lncRNA expression co-expression network, we identified important mRNAs and lncRNAs in the tumor–endothelium interaction, providing new directions for the study of the mechanisms of tumor–endothelium interaction.</p>

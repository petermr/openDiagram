<italic>A. campestris</italic> L. is an Asteraceae plant commonly known as field wormwood; it is a perennial undershrub (30&#8211;150&#160;cm height), with branched and ascending brownish-red stems. Leaves are green, the basal are 2&#8211;3 pinnatisects, the upper are simple. Inflorescence is an ovoid, heterogamous yellowish capitulum, with an involucral bracts; ray flowers are female, pistillate and fertile, while the disk flowers are sterile, and functionally male [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Morocco, <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. known as &#8220;Allal&#8221;, is used as antidiabetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], to treat digestive, respiratory, metabolic, allergic problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and cutaneous problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This herb has many other ethnomedicinal uses like antihypertensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], emmenaguogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and well known for treatment of liver and kidney disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and as. Previous pharmacological studies proved that <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. possesses antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], antibacterial, antifungal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], insecticidal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], antitumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], antivenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], hepatoprotective, nephroprotective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and antidiabetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] effects. Recently a clinical trial conducted on volunteers demonstrated that <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. enhanced 33.3% to 50% decrease in arterial pressure among hypertensive smoker patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In another study, the administration of <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. extract induced antihypertensive effect on envenomed hypertensive rats, and provoked 10% to 30% of hypertension drop, while the pretreatment with the herb extract prevented the rise of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, no in-vitro study has been elaborated to evaluate the antihypertensive potential of this plant. In the aim to highlight the importance of this plant in the cardiovascular therapy, this study was performed to analyze the essential oil of <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. (AcEO) growing in oriental Morocco, to investigate its vasorelaxant and subsequent mechanism of action and to determine its antiplatelet and antioxidant effects.</p>

 <caption>
  <p>Characteristics of the curated human small-airway epithelial cell (hSAEC) transcriptome. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Size distribution of transcripts for multi-exon and mono-exon genes. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Number of isoforms per gene. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Comparison of isoforms identified for annotated vs. novel genes. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Percentage of reverse transcriptase (RT) switching. Note that full splice match (FSM) and incomplete splice match (ISM) switching is 0%. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Distance of annotated reads to known transcription start sites (TSS). Note the high percentage of reads mapped within 20 nt of known TSS, indicating high-quality reverse transcription of the complementary DNA (cDNA) library. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Distribution of transcripts to known polyadenylation (polyA) sites. The median location is within 18 nt of known polyA sites for all transcript categories.

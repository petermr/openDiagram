0: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common means of RNA modification, accounting for 0.10.4% of adenosine, and its biological significance has been gradually revealed.
1: 1, 2 RNA m6A modification is widely found in the mRNAs of eukaryotes, specifically, m6A methylation means that RNA has been modified by methylation at the N6 site of the adenine base, and the modified adenosine is m6A adenine.
2: 3, 4 Similar to DNA or histone methylation, RNA m6A methylation is also mainly catalyzed by methyltransferases and demethylases.
3: 5 This means that the m6A methylation modification is a dynamic reversible process.
4: 6 Various m6A methyltransferases, known as writers, including methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), METTL14 and Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), catalyze the m6A methylation of mRNA.
5: 5, 7 Various m6A demethylases are called erasers, including fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and ALKB family member 5 (ALKBH5), which function is to reduce the modified RNA to the original RNA.
6: 8 In addition, m6A binding protein acts as a reader and mainly includes the YT521-B homology (YTH) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (HNRNP) families, such as HNRNPC, YTHDC1, YTHDC2, YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, which recognize m6A-modified RNA and thus regulate mRNA metabolism and function.

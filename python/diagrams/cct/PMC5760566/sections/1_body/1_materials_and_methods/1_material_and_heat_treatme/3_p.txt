0: The steel was subjected to a heat-treatment process (see Table  2) consisting of heating at 920, 900, and 640 C for 2, 2, and 8 h, respectively.
1: Subsequently, the steel was austenitized at 860 C for 5 h. To obtain different quenched structures, the quenching cooling rate (QCR) was determined from the continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curve.
2: The critical phase transformation point and CCT curve of the steels were measured with a thermal dilatometer (Fuji Electronic Industrial, FormastorF) according to the Chinese standard YB/T 51271993 and YB/T 512893.
3: The specimens cut from the steel bars were machined into long   3  10 mm cylinders.
4: These cylinders were then heated to 860 C at a rate of 10 C/s, austenitized for 5 min at this temperature, and then cooled to room temperature at linear cooling rates of 12.8, 6.4, 3.2, 1.28, 0.64, 0.28, 0.14, 0.07, 0.03 C/s.
5: The CCT curve was drawn based on the experimental data and is shown in Fig.
6: 1.
7: The CCT curves show that a critical cooling rate ( Vc) of 35 C/min is required for martensite formation.
8: Therefore, QCRs of 60 C/min (martensite) and 4.4 C/min (bainite) were applied (surface and 1/4  T, Wall thickness:  T = 700 mm).
9: Afterward, the steel was tempered at 620 C for 8 h. All the specimens were then removed from the furnace and exposed to air until they were cooled to room temperature.
10: Part of the sample was removed to determine the mechanical properties of the material from tensile and impact tests.
11: Another part of the sample was subjected to a step-cooling heat treatment (see Fig.
12: 2) that promotes temper-embrittlement.
13: Then, the performance and microstructure analyses were carried out.

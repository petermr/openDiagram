<p>Spots of interest were excised from the preparative gel and transferred to individual 1.5-mL tubes. The gel sample was washed with 100 μL of distilled water; and 100 μL of 50 mmol/L NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) and acetonitrile (6:4) were added and agitated for 10 min. This process was repeated at least three times until the Coomassie brilliant blue G250 dye had disappeared. After decanting the supernatant, the gel was dried in a speed vacuum concentrator (LaBoGeneAps, Lynge, Denmark) for 10 min, followed by digestion with sequence-grade modified trypsin (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA) (enzyme to substrate ratio = 1:30) at 37 °C with shaking for 16 h.</p>

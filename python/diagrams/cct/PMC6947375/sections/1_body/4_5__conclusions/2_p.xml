<p>(1) The microstructural features of the hot rolled 1.0C-1.5Cr steel mainly exhibited as netlike pearlite and pre-eutectoid carbides. The pre-eutectoid carbide mainly located at LAGBs. Close TEM observations showed that a large number of cementite particles with tens of nanometres in spherical interspersed among the lamellar cementite, and the thicknesses of lamellae varied from 10 nm to 20 nm.</p>

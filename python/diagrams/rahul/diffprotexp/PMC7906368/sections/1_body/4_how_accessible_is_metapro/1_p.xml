<p>Similar to DNA or RNA sequencing, MS-based research is often facilitated by dedicated research service core facilities available at many institutions. Thus, to conduct a metaproteomics experiment, the researcher does not necessarily need a mass spectrometer in their laboratory. Mass spectrometry research centers can provide the analyses as a service; however, many centers currently do not have adequate experience with the preparation, acquisition, and analyses of samples and data for metaproteomics, and thus, it will be up to the researcher to guide the process through frequent communication with facility staff. A frequent mistake is to transfer approaches developed for proteomics of individual organisms or tissues directly to metaproteomics samples, which have additional challenges such as sample matrix, diversity of cell types in the sample, and protein inference issues caused by the presence of large numbers of homologous proteins in the sample and protein sequence database.</p>

0: Beta frequency oscillations in scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings over the primary motor cortex have been associated with the preparation and execution of voluntary movements.
1: Here, we test whether changes in beta frequency are related to the preparation of adapted movements in human, and whether such effects generalise to other species (cat).
2: Eleven healthy adult humans performed a joystick visuomotor adaptation task.
3: Beta (1525 Hz) scalp EEG signals recorded over the motor cortex during a pre-movement preparatory phase were, on average, significantly reduced in amplitude during early adaptation trials compared to baseline, late adaptation, or aftereffect trials.
4: The changes in beta were not related to measurements of reaction time or reach duration.
5: We also recorded local field potential (LFP) activity within the primary motor cortex of three cats during a prism visuomotor adaptation task.
6: Analysis of these signals revealed similar reductions in motor cortical LFP beta frequencies during early adaptation.
7: This effect was present when controlling for any influence of the reaction time and reach duration.
8: Overall, the results are consistent with a reduction in pre-movement beta oscillations predicting an increase in adaptive drive in upcoming task performance when motor errors are largest in magnitude and the rate of adaptation is greatest.

<p>These reports indicated that there are several changes of protein expression between primary and metastatic tumor, and the metastasis may be supported by the expression changes. In the present study of clinical tumor samples, we identified the expression of TAGLN2 in primary tumors and we also identified TPI-1 and ENO1 in metastatic tumors, predominantly by LC–MS/MS. Although the three proteins identified in this study have previously been suggested to be cancer-related, their functional role in gynecological cancer remains controversial. Also, we investigated the three proteins by western blotting. There were a few disparities in the results between western blot and LC–MS/MS. We described that TPI-1 was predominantly identified in metastatic tumors. However, the TPI-1 expression in primary tumor was higher than metastatic tumor in cervical cancer. It has been reported that TPI-1 was represented overexpression in tumor cells [

In any case, difference of cancer type may indicate difference of metastatic character. Further study is necessary to obtain their credibility as biomarkers.

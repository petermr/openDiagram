<p>DSC thermograms of raw loratadine, sulpiride and their 1:1 physical mixture are revealed 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. Loratadine exhibited a sharp endotherm at 135 °C ascribed to its melting temperature Akhgari et al., 2016 (Akhgari et al., 2016). Thermogram of sulpiride displayed a sharp endotherm at a temperature of 175
 <bold> </bold>°C attributed to its melting transition (Zidan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The physical mixture DSC thermogram presented the melting endothermic peak of loratadine at 135
 <bold> </bold>°C while showed the absence of the melting endotherm of sulpiride.

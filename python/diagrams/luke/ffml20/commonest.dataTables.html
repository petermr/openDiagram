The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the effects of the incorporation of dG(Me) instead of a dG residue are strongly dependant upon the positioning of a single base replacement along the sequence. As such, d(TG(Me)GGT), d(TGG(Me)GT) have been found to form 4-fold symmetric quadruplexes with all strands parallel and equivalent to each other, each more stable than their natural counterpart. NMR experiments clearly indicate that [d(TG(Me)GGT)]4 possesses a G(Me)-tetrad with all dG(Me) residues in a syn-glycosidic conformation while an anti-arrangement is apparent for the four dG(Me) of [d(TGG(Me)GT)]4. As the two complexes show a quite different CD behaviour, a possible relationship between the presence of residues adopting syn-glycosidic conformations and CD profiles is briefly discussed. As far as d(TGGG(Me)T) is concerned, NMR data indicate that at 25 degrees C it exists primarily as a single-strand conformation in equilibrium with minor amounts of a quadruplex structure.">

Comparing the MD predicted δ value at 298 K and the glass transition temperature (T(g)) of the polymer determined from δ-T curve with the experimental value confirm the accuracy of our method. The MD modeled relationship between δ and T agrees well with the previous theoretical works. We also observe the specific volume (v), cohesive energy (U(coh)), cohesive energy density (E(CED)) and δ shows a similar temperature dependence characteristics and a drastic change around the T(g).

For detection purpose, high specificity is one of the most important factors to be considered in G-quadruplex probe design. It is well known that end stacking and groove binding are two dominated quadruplex-ligand binding modes, and currently most reported G-quadruplex probes are designed based on the former, which has been proven to show good selectivity between quadruplexes and non-quadruplexes. Because groove of G-quadruplex also has some unique chemical properties, it could be inferred that probes that can interact with both the groove and G-tetrad site of certain G-quadruplexes simultaneously might possess higher specificity in aspects of discriminating different quadruplexes. In this article, we report a cyanine dye as a potential novel probe scaffold that could occupy both the 5'-end external G-tetrad and the corresponding groove of the G-quadruplex simultaneously. By using various spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, we give a detailed binding characterization for this dual-site simultaneous binding mode. A preliminary result suggests that this mode might provide highly specific recognition to a parallel-stranded G-quadruplex. These findings and the structural elucidation might give some clues in aspects of developing highly specific G-quadruplex probes.">

A comparison of the currents generated by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and its mutants as well as the electrochemical analytical results reveal that the accelerated EET was attributed to enhanced interactions between the bacterial outer-membrane cytochromes and the immobilized methylene blue. A further investigation into the process using in situ Raman spectro-electrochemical method coupled with density functional theory calculations demonstrates that the electron shuttling was achieved through the change of the molecule conformation of phenothiazine in the redox process.

        <span class="abst" title="Psychostimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine are illicitly used drugs that act on neurotransmitter transporters for dopamine, serotonin or norepinephrine. These drugs can by themselves already cause severe neurotoxicity. However, an additional health threat arises from adulterant substances which are added to the illicit compound without declaration. One of the most frequently added adulterants in street drugs sold as cocaine is the anthelmintic drug levamisole. We tested the effects of levamisole on neurotransmitter transporters heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. Levamisole was 100 and 300-fold less potent than cocaine in blocking norepinephrine and dopamine uptake, and had only very low affinity for the serotonin transporter. In addition, levamisole did not trigger any appreciable substrate efflux. Because levamisole and cocaine are frequently co-administered, we searched for possible allosteric effects; at 30μM, a concentration at which levamisole displayed already mild effects on norepinephrine transport it did not enhance the inhibitory action of cocaine. Levamisole is metabolized to aminorex, a formerly marketed anorectic drug, which is classified as an amphetamine-like substance. We examined the uptake-inhibitory and efflux-eliciting properties of aminorex and found it to exert strong effects on all three neurotransmitter transporters in a manner similar to amphetamine. We therefore conclude that while the adulterant levamisole itself has only moderate effects on neurotransmitter transporters, its metabolite aminorex may exert distinct psychostimulant effects by itself. Given that the half-time of levamisole and aminorex exceeds that of cocaine, it may be safe to conclude that after the cocaine effect &quot;fades out&quot; the levamisole/aminorex effect &quot;kicks in&quot;.">

We examined genetic diversity in Bachman's Sparrows to determine whether natural barriers have led to distinct population units and to assess the effect of anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation. Genetic diversity was examined across the geographic range by genotyping 226 individuals at 18 microsatellite loci and sequencing 48 individuals at mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Multiple analyses consistently demonstrated little genetic structure and high levels of genetic variation, suggesting that populations are panmictic. Based on these genetic data, separate management units/subspecies designations or translocations to promote gene flow among fragmented populations do not appear to be necessary. Panmixia in Bachman's Sparrow may be a consequence of an historical range expansion and retraction. Alternatively, high vagility in Bachman's Sparrow may be an adaptation to the ephemeral, fire-mediated habitat that this species prefers. In recent times, high vagility also appears to have offset inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity in highly fragmented habitat.">

The app was developed to make target information available to as large an audience as possible.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We now report a major update of the iOS version of the app. This includes enhancements that use an implementation of ECFP_6 fingerprints that we have made open source. Using these fingerprints, the user can propose compounds with possible anti-TB activity, and view the compounds within a cluster landscape. Proposed compounds can also be compared to existing target data, using a näive Bayesian scoring system to rank probable targets. We have curated an additional 60 new compounds and their targets for Mtb and added these to the original set of 745 compounds. We have also curated 20 further compounds (many without targets in TB Mobile) to evaluate this version of the app with 805 compounds and associated targets.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;TB Mobile can now manage a small collection of compounds that can be imported from external sources, or exported by various means such as email or app-to-app inter-process communication. This means that TB Mobile can be used as a node within a growing ecosystem of mobile apps for cheminformatics. It can also cluster compounds and use internal algorithms to help identify potential targets based on molecular similarity. TB Mobile represents a valuable dataset, data-visualization aid and target prediction tool.">

This model of clay-polymer interactions is based on a three-level approach, which uses quantum mechanical and atomistic descriptions to derive a coarse-grained yet chemically specific representation that can resolve processes on hitherto inaccessible length and time scales. The approach is applied to study collections of clay mineral tactoids interacting with two synthetic polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(vinyl alcohol).

Here we exfoliate 2D materials directly in pure water without using any chemicals or surfactants. In order to exfoliate and disperse the materials in water, we elevate the temperature of the sonication bath, and introduce energy via the dissipation of sonic waves. Storage stability greater than one month is achieved through the maintenance of high temperatures, and through atomic and molecular level simulations, we further discover that good solubility in water is maintained due to the presence of platelet surface charges as a result of edge functionalization or intrinsic polarity.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The most common approach to studying dynamic balance during walking is by applying perturbations. Previous studies that investigated dynamic balance responses predominantly focused on applying perturbations in frontal plane while walking on treadmill. The goal of our work was to develop balance assessment robot (BAR) that can be used during overground walking and to assess normative balance responses to perturbations in transversal plane in a group of neurologically healthy individuals.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;BAR provides three passive degrees of freedom (DoF) and three actuated DoF in pelvis that are admittance-controlled in such a way that the natural movement of pelvis is not significantly affected. In this study BAR was used to assess normative balance responses in neurologically healthy individuals by applying linear perturbations in frontal and sagittal planes and angular perturbations in transversal plane of pelvis. One way repeated measure ANOVA was used to statistically evaluate the effect of selected perturbations on stepping responses.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Standard deviations of assessed responses were similar in unperturbed and perturbed walking. Perturbations in frontal direction evoked substantial pelvis displacement and caused statistically significant effect on step length, step width and step time. Likewise, perturbations in sagittal plane also caused statistically significant effect on step length, step width and step time but with less explicit impact on pelvis movement in frontal plane. On the other hand, except from substantial pelvis rotation angular perturbations did not have substantial effect on pelvis movement in frontal and sagittal planes while statistically significant effect was noted only in step length and step width after perturbation in clockwise direction.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Results indicate that the proposed device can repeatedly reproduce similar experimental conditions. Results also suggest that &quot;stepping strategy&quot; is the dominant strategy for coping with perturbations in frontal plane, perturbations in sagittal plane are to greater extent handled by &quot;ankle strategy&quot; while angular perturbations in transversal plane do not pose substantial challenge for balance. Results also show that specific perturbation in general elicits responses that extend also to other planes of movement that are not directly associated with plane of perturbation as well as to spatio temporal parameters of gait.">

We anchor DNA onto gold nanoseed with various alignments to form gold nanocrystals with defined topologies. Some topologies are asymmetric including pushpin-, star- and biconcave disk-like structures, as well as more complex jellyfish- and flower-like structures.

At room temperature, liquids such as water and methanol can form solvation structures, but the molecules remain highly mobile, thus preventing the formation of long-lived supramolecular assemblies. Here we show that mixtures of water with methanol can form a novel type of interfaces with hydrophobic solids. Combining in situ atomic force microscopy and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we identify solid-like two-dimensional interfacial structures that nucleate thermally, and are held together by an extended network of hydrogen bonds. On graphite, nucleation occurs above ∼35 °C, resulting in robust, multilayered nanoscopic patterns. Our findings could have an impact on many fields where water-alcohol mixtures play an important role such as fuel cells, chemical synthesis, self-assembly, catalysis and surface treatments.">

        <span class="abst" title="Piperine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, is well known as anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-tumor and anti-proliferative agent. Piperine exerts such pharmacological activities by binding or interacting with various cellular targets. Recently, the first report for Piperine interaction with duplex DNA has been published last year but its interaction with G-quadruplex structures has not been studied yet. Herein, we report for the first time the interaction of Piperine with various DNA G-quadruplex structures. Comprehensive biophysical techniques were employed to determine the basis of interaction for the complex formed between Piperine and G-quadruplex DNA sequences. Piperine showed specificity for G-quadruplex DNA over double stranded DNA, with highest affinity for G-quadruplex structure formed at c-myc promoter region. Further, in-vitro studies show that Piperine causes apoptosis-mediated cell death that further emphasizes the potential of this natural product, Piperine, as a promising candidate for targeting G-quadruplex structure and thus, acts as a potent anti-cancer agent.">

However, attempts to fabricate systems giving highly efficient energy transfer between luminescent donor and acceptor have achieved limited success to date. Herein, we present a strategy towards phosphorescence energy transfer at a 2D orderly crystalline interface. We first show that new ultrathin nanosheet materials giving long-afterglow luminescence can be obtained by assembling aromatic guests into a layered double hydroxide host. Furthermore, we demonstrate that co-assembly of these long-lived energy donors with an energy acceptor in the same host generates an ordered arrangement of phosphorescent donor-acceptor pairs spatially confined within the 2D nanogallery, which affords energy transfer efficiency as high as 99.7%. Therefore, this work offers an alternative route to develop new types of long-afterglow nanohybrids and efficient light transfer systems with potential energy, illumination and sensor applications.">

In this article, we review the recent progress in the development of analytical potential energy functions that aim at correctly representing many-body effects. Starting from the many-body expansion of the interaction energy, specific focus is on different classes of potential energy functions built upon a hierarchy of approximations and on their ability to accurately reproduce reference data obtained from state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements. We show that most recent potential energy functions, which include explicit short-range representations of two-body and three-body effects along with a physically correct description of many-body effects at all distances, predict the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase with unprecedented accuracy, thus opening the door to the long-sought &quot;universal model&quot; capable of describing the behavior of water under different conditions and in different environments.">

The interface between the polymer and the clay nanoparticles was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques by selectively addressing spin probes either to the surfactant layer (labeled stearic acid) or the clay surface (labeled catamine). Continuous-wave (CW) EPR studies of the surfactant dynamics allow to define a transition temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;* which was tentatively assigned to the order-disorder transition of the surfactant layer. CW EPR studies of PCNC showed that completely exfoliated nanoparticles coexist with agglomerates. HYSCORE spectroscopy in PCNCs showed couplings within the probe -assigned with DFT computations- and couplings with nuclei of the environment, ¹H and &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na for the surfactant layer probe, and &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si, ⁷Li, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F and &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na for the clay surface probe. Analysis of these couplings indicates that the integrity of the surfactant layer is conserved and that there are sizeable ionic regions containing sodium ions directly beyond the surfactant layer.

This protocol then guided how to stabilize the amorphous formulation. Indapamide, metolazone, glibenclamide and glipizide were selected as model drugs and HPMC (Pharmacoat 606) and PVP (K30) as stabilizing polymers. Spray-dried amorphous indapamide, metolazone and glibenclamide crystallized via solution-mediated nucleation while glipizide suffered from solid-to-solid crystallization. The addition of 0.001%-0.01% (w/v) HPMC into the dissolution medium successfully prevented the crystallization of supersaturated solutions of indapamide and metolazone whereas it only reduced the crystallization rate for glibenclamide. Amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) formulation of glipizide and PVP K30, at a ratio of 50:50% (w/w) reduced but did not completely eliminate the solid-to-solid crystallization of glipizide even though the overall dissolution rate was enhanced both in the absence and presence of HPMC. Raman spectroscopy indicated the formation of a glipizide polymorph in the dissolution medium with higher solubility than the stable polymorph. As a complementary technique, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of indapamide and glibenclamide with HPMC was performed. It was revealed that hydrogen bonding patterns of the two drugs with HPMC differed significantly, suggesting that hydrogen bonding may play a role in the greater stabilizing effect on supersaturation of indapamide, compared to glibenclamide.">

Therefore, the ability to study and characterize these materials is more relevant than ever. Despite the wealth of simulation and modeling studies of nanoparticles reported in the literature, a rigorous description of the interface of such materials is rarely included in analyses which are pivotal to understanding interfacial behavior. We propose a novel method for constructing the continuous intrinsic surface of nanoparticles, which has been applied to a model system consisting of a sodium dodecyl sulfate micelle in the presence of testosterone propionate. We demonstrate the advantages of using our continuous intrinsic surface definition as a means to elucidate the true interfacial structure of the micelle, the interfacial properties of the hydrating water molecules, and the position of the drug (testosterone propionate) within the micelle. Additionally, we discuss the implications of this algorithm for future work in the simulation of nanoparticles. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are the class of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs most recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV-1 infections. INSTIs block the strand transfer reaction catalyzed by HIV-1 integrase (IN) and have been shown to potently inhibit infection by wild-type HIV-1. Of the three current FDA-approved INSTIs, Dolutegravir (DTG), has been the most effective, in part because treatment does not readily select for resistant mutants. However, recent studies showed that when INSTI-experienced patients are put on a DTG-salvage therapy, they have reduced response rates. Two new INSTIs, Cabotegravir (CAB) and Bictegravir (BIC), are currently in late-stage clinical trials. RESULTS:Both CAB and BIC had much broader antiviral profiles than RAL and EVG against the INSTI-resistant single, double, and triple HIV-1 mutants used in this study. BIC was more effective than DTG against several INSTI-resistant mutants. Overall, in terms of their ability to inhibit a broad range of INSTI-resistant IN mutants, BIC was superior to DTG, and DTG was superior to CAB. Modeling the binding of CAB, BIC, and DTG within the active site of IN suggested that the &quot;left side&quot; of the INSTI pharmacophore (the side away from the viral DNA) was important in determining the ability of the compound to inhibit the IN mutants we tested. CONCLUSIONS:Of the two INSTIs in late stage clinical trials, BIC appears to be better able to inhibit the replication of a broad range of IN mutants. BIC retained potency against several of the INSTI-resistant mutants that caused a decrease in susceptibility to DTG.">

Potentiodynamic measurements indicate that this nanomaterial inhibits corrosion due to its adsorption on the metal surfaces. The adsorbed layer of carboxylated graphene hinders two electrochemical reactions: the oxidation of the metal and the transport of metal ions from the metal to the solution but also hydrogen evolution reaction by acting as a protective barrier. The adsorption behavior at the molecular level of the carboxylated graphene oxide with respect to Nb, NbO, Ta, and TaO (111) surfaces is also investigated using Molecular Dynamic and Monte Carlo calculations.">

In addition to a redshift of the salophen ligand absorption bands, mainly composed by &lt;i&gt;π → π&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; electronic transitions, additional bands of around 470 nm were observed, resulting in a partial metal-to-ligand charge transfer. Furthermore, a significant increment of its band intensities was observed, favoring a more intense absorption in a broader range of the visible spectrum, which is a desired characteristic for applications in the field of organic electronics. This finding is related to an increment of the planarity and consequent electron delocalization of the macrocycle in the complex, which was estimated by the calculation of the current strengths at the PBE0/cc-pVTZ (Dyall.v3z for Ni(II)) level.">

The screening methodology consists of four subsequent screening steps for each adsorbate. At the end of each step, the most promising MOFs for AC application are selected for further investigation. In the first step, the structures are selected on the basis of physical properties (pore limiting diameter). In each following step, points of the adsorption isotherms of the selected structures are calculated from Monte Carlo simulations in the grand-canonical ensemble. The most promising MOFs are selected on the basis of the working capacity of the structures and the location of the adsorption step (if present), which can be related to the applicable operational conditions in AC. Because of the possibility of reversible pore condensation (first-order phase transition), the mid-density scheme is used to efficiently and accurately determine the location of the adsorption step. At the end of the screening procedure, six MOFs with high deliverable working capacities (∼0.6 mL working fluid in 1 mL structure) and diverse adsorption step locations are selected for both adsorbates from the original 2930 structures. Because the highest experimentally measured deliverable working capacity to date for MOFs with methanol is ca. 0.45 mL mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the selected six structures show the potential to improve the efficiency of ACs.">

However, beyond basic considerations such as spectral absorption, the factors that dictate their photocatalytic activity are poorly understood. Here we investigate a series of linear conjugated polymers with external quantum efficiencies for hydrogen production between 0.4 and 11.6%. We monitor the generation of the photoactive species from femtoseconds to seconds after light absorption using transient spectroscopy and correlate their yield with the measured photocatalytic activity. Experiments coupled with modeling suggest that the localization of water around the polymer chain due to the incorporation of sulfone groups into an otherwise hydrophobic backbone is crucial for charge generation. Calculations of solution redox potentials and charge transfer free energies demonstrate that electron transfer from the sacrificial donor becomes thermodynamically favored as a result of the more polar local environment, leading to the production of long-lived electrons in these amphiphilic polymers.">

The results suggest that the interaction between nia and methacrylic acid (MAA) is mainly based on hydrogen-bonding between amide protons and MAA. Computational density functional theory (DFT) studies on MAA-nia complexes have been also performed to better understand hydrogen-bonding interactions. The imprinted activity of the microspheres, synthesized in chloroform or acetonitrile (MeCN), has been evaluated by spectrophotometric analysis of nia solutions when chloroform or MeCN are used as incubation solvents.

The loading of the GEM lipophilic prodrugs on MSNs was explored with the aim to obtain both a physical and a chemical protection of GEM from rapid plasmatic metabolization. For this purpose, MSNs as such or with grafted aminopropyl and carboxyethyl groups were prepared and characterized. Then, their different drug loading capacity in relation to the nature of the functional group was evaluated. In our experimental conditions, GEM was not loaded in any MSNs, while C12GEM was the most efficiently encapsulated and employed for further evaluation. The results showed that loading capacity increased with the presence of functional groups on the nanoparticles; similarly, the presence of functional groups on MSNs' surface influenced the drug release profile. Finally, the cytotoxicity of the different preparations was evaluated and data showed that C12GEM loaded MSNs are less cytotoxic than the free drug with an activity that increased with the incubating time, indicating that all these systems are able to release the drug in a controlled manner. Altogether, the results demonstrate that these MSNs could be an interesting system for the delivery of anticancer drugs.">

The use of bromide leads to ~95 % sulfur utilization by suppressing electrode passivation. More importantly, the electrolytes with high-donor-number salt anions are notably compatible with lithium metal electrodes.

Morphologies with monodisperse chains were generated previously using an optimized molecular dynamics force-field and represent a spectrum of nanostructured order. We discover that a combined consideration of backbone clustering and system-wide disorder arising from side-chain conformations are correlated with hole mobility. Furthermore, we show that strongly interconnected thiophene backbones are required for efficient charge transport. This definitively shows the role &quot;tie-chains&quot; play in enabling mobile charges in P3HT. By marrying QCC and KMC over multiple length- and time-scales, we demonstrate that it is now possible to routinely probe the relationship between molecular nanostructure and device performance.">

        <span class="abst" title="Significant research has been directed toward the incorporation of bioactive plant extracts or essential oils (EOs) into polymers to endow the latter with antimicrobial functionality. EOs offer a unique combination of having broad antimicrobial activity from a natural source, generally recognized as safe (GRAS) recognition in the US, and a volatile nature. However, their volatility also presents a major challenge in their incorporation into polymers by conventional high-temperature-processing techniques. Herein, antimicrobial polypropylene (PP) cast films were produced by incorporating carvacrol (a model EO) or carvacrol, loaded into halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), via melt compounding. We studied the composition-structure-property relationships in these systems, focusing on the effect of carvacrol on the composition of the films, the PP crystalline phase and its morphology and the films' mechanical and antimicrobial properties. For the first time, molecular dynamics simulations were applied to reveal the complex interactions between the components of these carvacrol-containing systems. We show that strong molecular interactions between PP and carvacrol minimize the loss of this highly-volatile EO during high-temperature polymer processing, enabling semi-industrial scale production. The resulting films exhibit outstanding antimicrobial properties against model microorganisms (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alternaria alternata&lt;/i&gt;). The PP/(HNTs-carvacrol) nanocomposite films, containing the carvacrol-loaded HNTs, display a higher level of crystalline order, superior mechanical properties and prolonged release of carvacrol, in comparison to PP/carvacrol blends. These properties are ascribed to the role of HNTs in these nanocomposites and their effect on the PP matrix and retained carvacrol content.">

Their mode of action has been proposed as dual, combining plant protection activation and antifungal activities. The present work focuses on the interaction of natural RLs with plant and fungi membrane models at the molecular scale. Representative models were constructed and the interaction with RLs was studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (²H NMR) spectroscopic measurements. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to investigate RL insertion in lipid bilayers. Our results showed that the RLs fit into the membrane models and were located near the lipid phosphate group of the phospholipid bilayers, nearby phospholipid glycerol backbones. The results obtained with plant plasma membrane models suggest that the insertion of RLs inside the lipid bilayer did not significantly affect lipid dynamics. Oppositely, a clear fluidity increase of fungi membrane models was observed. This effect was related to the presence and the specific structure of ergosterol. The nature of the phytosterols could also influence the RL effect on plant plasma membrane destabilization. Subtle changes in lipid dynamics could then be linked with plant defense induction and the more drastic effects associated with fungal membrane destabilization.">

Since halogen bonds are similar to hydrogen bonds in a number of aspects, the existing knowledge of hydrogen bonded systems can be applied to halogenated systems. Here we evaluate the applicability of a retrosynthetic approach based on topological similarity between hydrogen and halogen bonds to obtain predictable halogen bonded networks. The self-assembly of 1,3-dibromo-5-alkoxybenzene derivatives was studied in analogy with well-explored alkoxy isophthalic acids using a combination of experimental and theoretical tools. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the networks formed at the liquid-graphite interface revealed that while the retrosynthetic approach works at the level of small clusters of molecules within the 2D network, the overall structure of the network deviates from the anticipated structure. The monolayers consist of fractured rows of halogen-bonded modules instead of the expected continuous lamellar structure. Each module consists of a discrete number of halogen-bonded molecules. The interactions responsible for the stabilization of halogen bonded dimers are delineated through detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations coupled with natural bonding orbitals (NBO) and perturbation analysis. A modified force field that includes an extra charged site to imitate the σ hole on the halogen atom was developed and applied to extract total potential energies of the anticipated and observed networks. Plausible reasons for the deviation from the anticipated structure are discussed. Finally, a modified molecular design that allows successful application of the hydrogen bond-halogen bond analogy was tested experimentally.">

To solve this problem, a linear hindered phenol with amorphous state and low polarity was synthesized and related polyurethane-based hybrid materials were prepared in this study. The structure and state of the hindered phenol were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) between hindered phenol and polyurethane was confirmed by FT-IR, and the amorphous state of the hybrids was confirmed by XRD. Moreover, by a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and dynamic mechanical analysis, the relationship between the structure optimization of the hindered phenol and the high damping performance of the hybrids was quantitatively revealed. By constructing the synthetic hindered phenol, the intramolecular HBs between hindered phenols were restricted, while the strength and concentration of the intermolecular HBs increased by increasing the amount of hindered phenol. Thus, intermolecular interactions were enhanced, which lead to the compact chain packing of polyurethane, extended chain packing of hindered phenol, and good dispersion of hindered phenol in polyurethane. Therefore, the stability of the hindered phenol and the damping properties of the hybrids were both improved. The experiment results are expected to provide some useful information for the design and fabrication of high-performance polymeric damping materials.">

        <span class="abst" title="A porous and low-density protective film on a steel surface in the corrosive environment can undergo deterioration even in the presence of organic inhibitors due to infiltration of aggressive ions into the pinholes and/or pores. This phenomenon is related to the localized corrosion that takes place even in the presence of an optimal concentration of organic corrosion inhibitors in the given medium. To overcome this issue, we have designed an organic protective film on a steel surface with the help of titania nanoparticles (TNPs) combined with an organic corrosion inhibitor derived from &lt;i&gt;Aganonerion polymorphum&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract (APLE), all to be studied in a simulated ethanol fuel blend (SEFB). The TNPs with varied diameters and concentrations have been studied for examining their effect on the inhibition capacity of 1000 ppm APLE on the steel surface in SEFB medium using electrochemical and surface analysis techniques. Enhanced corrosion inhibition of the surficial film was observed in the presence of both the APLE inhibitor and small amounts of TNPs. A direct agreement was observed between the experimental and molecular dynamics theoretical investigations showcasing high binding energy between inhibitor molecules and steel substrates, resulting in a much higher adhesion of the protective film, good thermal stability of the adsorbent film, and electron abundance for the supply of steel substrate of inhibitor species.">

The influence of adsorption through factors, such as pulverized coal dosage, adsorption reaction time, initial concentration, and temperature effect, was investigated. The removal efficiency of MB reached 96.5% under optimum reactive conditions. The adsorption equilibrium was accorded with a Langmuir isotherm adsorption equation. The adsorption of MB onto coal was a spontaneous process because the adsorption free energy ΔG 0 was negative. It was consistent with the conclusion of a negative interaction energy between bituminous coal and MB obtained by molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, the density distribution along z-axis of each component molecule showed that MB molecules were adsorbed on the coal surface because of the polar interactions between the methyl groups of MB and the hydrophilic sites at the coal surface. Also, the diffusion degree of water molecule in liquid phase showed that as MB molecules formed hydrogen bonds with the water molecules, the activity of water molecules was restricted.">

Other important elements of the sensor, such as the optical system, image sensor, and post-image analysis algorithm, have been developed.

Herein, we report the development of a new method for phthalate detection in cheese powder using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence detection, in which the presence of the phthalate analytes leads to highly analyte-specific changes in the fluorescence emission signal of a fluorophore bound in a cyclodextrin cavity. This method relies on subtle changes in the analyte affinity for the fluorophore and the cyclodextrin cavity and provides for markedly more straightforward sample preparation procedures and an extremely rapid read-out signal, with potential for the development of portable fluorescence sensors. Using this method, we were able to detect 15 phthalate esters with highly analyte-specific responses and at concentrations as low as 0.12 μM, which is well below regulatory levels of concern. Computational investigations strongly support the observed experimental trends.">

This somatosensory attenuation occurs because the brain predicts the tactile consequences of our self-generated movements. To produce attenuation, the tactile predictions need to be time-locked to the movement, but how the brain maintains this temporal tuning remains unknown. Using a bimanual self-touch paradigm, we demonstrate that people can rapidly unlearn to attenuate touch immediately after their movement and learn to attenuate delayed touch instead, after repeated exposure to a systematic delay between the movement and the resulting touch. The magnitudes of the unlearning and learning effects are correlated and dependent on the number of trials that participants have been exposed to. We further show that delayed touches feel less ticklish and non-delayed touches more ticklish after exposure to the systematic delay. These findings demonstrate that the attenuation of self-generated touch is adaptive.">

Specifically, APT is well suited to study the interfacial properties of granular or heterophase systems. Traditionally, the identification of the interface between, for precipitate and matrix phases, in APT data has been obtained either by extracting iso-concentration surfaces based on a user-supplied concentration value or by manually perturbing the concentration value until the iso-concentration surface qualitatively matches the interface. These approaches are subjective, not scalable, and may lead to inconsistencies due to local composition inhomogeneities. We introduce a digital image segmentation approach based on deep neural networks that transfer learned knowledge from natural images to automatically segment the data obtained from APT into different phases. This approach not only provides an efficient way to segment the data and extract interfacial properties but does so without the need for expensive interface labeling for training the segmentation model. We consider here a system with a precipitate phase in a matrix and with three different interface modalities-layered, isolated, and interconnected-that are obtained for different relative geometries of the precipitate phase. We demonstrate the accuracy of our segmentation approach through qualitative visualization of the interfaces, as well as through quantitative comparisons with proximity histograms obtained by using more traditional approaches.">

The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), The Fourier transform infrared (FT - IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), EDX for elemental analysis, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) equation, particle size distributions and Zeta potential measurements. In addition, the synthesized materials were used as adsorbents for removal of potassium dichromate from aqueous solutions under various experimental conditions. The adsorption of Cr (VI) was strongly pH dependant and the pH&lt;sub&gt;PZC&lt;/sub&gt; was studied. Kinetic studies were evaluated through different models including, pseudo first and second orders, mixed 1, 2 orders, intra particle diffusion and Avrami models. For adsorption isotherms, two-parameter models (Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin) and three parameter models (Sips, Langmuir-Freundlich and Tooth) were investigated showing maximum adsorption capacity of 50.43 mg/g and 136.05 mg/g for Ni/Fe LDH and Ni/Fe LDH/GL, respectively. Also, the effect of temperature was investigated at (23, 35, 45, 55 °C) and the thermodynamic parameters (∆H°, ∆S° and ∆G°) were calculated showing exothermic and spontaneous adsorption process.

This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with fMRI to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When we touch our hand with the other, the resulting sensation feels less intense than when another person or a machine touches our hand with the same intensity. Early computational motor control theories have proposed that the cerebellum predicts and cancels the sensory consequences of our movements; however, the neural correlates of this cancelation remain unknown. By means of fMRI, we show that the more participants attenuate the perception of their self-generated touch, the stronger the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the somatosensory cortical areas. This provides conclusive evidence about the role of the cerebellum in predicting the sensory feedback of our movements and in attenuating the associated percepts via its connections to early somatosensory areas.">

In particular, how many descriptors would be necessary to model the degradation behavior of ocean plastics or understand if degradation is possible? Here, we report a data-driven approach to elucidate degradation trends of plastic debris by linking abiotic and biotic degradation behavior in seawater with physical properties and molecular structures. The results reveal a hierarchy of predictors to quantify surface erosion as well as combinations of features, like glass transition temperature and hydrophobicity, to classify ocean plastics into fast, medium, and slow degradation categories. Furthermore, to account for weathering and environmental factors, two equations model the influence of seawater temperature and mechanical forces.">

For the first route, the following steps have been followed: (i) (RS)-2-(6-chloro-9H-carbazol-2-yl)propanonic acid (carprofen) treatment with methanol, yielding methyl (RS)-2-(6-chloro-9H-carbazol-2-yl)propanoate; (ii) the resulted methylic ester was converted to (RS)-2-(6-chloro-9H-carbazol-2-yl)propane hydrazide (carprofen hydrazide) by treatment with hydrazine hydrate; (iii) reaction of the hydrazide derivative with acyl chlorides led to N-[(2RS)-2-(6-chloro-9H-carbazol-2-yl)propanoil]-N'-R-substituted-benzoylhydrazine formation, which; (iv) in reaction with phosphorus oxychloride gave the (RS)-1-(6-chloro-9H-carbazol-2-yl)-1-(1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)ethane derivatives. In the second synthesis pathway, new 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring compounds were obtained starting from carprofen which was reacted with isoniazid, in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride to form (RS)-1-(6-chloro-9H-carbazol-2-yl)-1-[5-(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]ethane. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, screened for their drug-like properties and evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity. The obtained compounds exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, some of the compounds being particularly active on E. coli, while others on C. albicans. The most significant result is represented by their exceptional anti-biofilm activity, particularly against the P. aeruginosa biofilm. The cytotoxicity assay revealed that at concentrations lower than 100 μg/mL, the tested compounds do not induce cytotoxicity and do not alter the mammalian cell cycle. The new synthesized compounds show good drug-like properties. The ADME-Tox profiles indicate a good oral absorption and average permeability through the blood brain barrier. However, further research is needed to reduce the predicted mutagenic potential and the hepatotoxicity.">

The structures of intermediary and final substances (compounds 7a-j) were confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and IR spectra, as well as by elemental analysis. The in silico bioinformatic and cheminformatic studies evidenced an optimal pharmacokinetic profile for the synthesized compounds 7a-j, characterized by an average lipophilic character predicting good cell membrane permeability and intestinal absorption; low maximum tolerated dose for humans; potassium channels encoded by the hERG I and II genes as potential targets and no carcinogenic effects. The obtained compounds exhibited a higher antimicrobial activity against the planktonic Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis strains and the Candida albicans fungal strain. The obtained compounds also inhibited the ability of S. aureus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli and C. albicans strains to colonize the inert substratum, accounting for their possible use as antibiofilm agents. All the active compounds exhibited low or acceptable cytotoxicity levels on the HCT8 cells, ensuring the potential use of these compounds for the development of new antimicrobial drugs with minimal side effects on the human cells and tissues.">

        <span class="abst" title="The identification of molecules whose biological activity can be properly modulated by light is a promising therapeutic approach aimed to improve drug selectivity and efficacy on the molecular target and to limit the side effects compared to traditional drugs. Recently, two photo-switchable diastereomeric benzodiazopyrrole derivatives 1RR and 1RS have been reported as microtubules targeting agents (MTAs) on human colorectal carcinoma p53 null cell line (HCT 116 p53-/-). Their IC50 was enhanced upon Light Emitting Diode (LED) irradiation at 435 nm and was related to their cis form. Here we have investigated the photo-responsive behavior of the acid derivatives of 1RR and 1RS, namely, d1RR and d1RS, in phosphate buffer solutions at different pH. The comparison of the UV spectra, acquired before and after LED irradiation, indicated that the trans→cis conversion of d1RR and d1RS is affected by the degree of ionization. The apparent rate constants were calculated from the kinetic data by means of fast UV spectroscopy and the conformers of the putative ionic species present in solution (pH range: 5.7-8.0) were modelled. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results suggest that the photo-conversions of trans d1RR/d1RS into the corresponding cis forms and the thermal decay of cis d1RR/d1RS are dependent on the presence of diazonium form of d1RR/d1RS. Finally, a photo-reaction was detected only for d1RR after prolonged LED irradiation in acidic medium, and the resulting product was characterized by means of Liquid Chromatography coupled to High resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.">

In this work, we follow this trend and employ machine learning to study (high-order) electric properties of organic compounds. The results of quantum-chemistry calculations of polarizability and first hyperpolarizability, obtained for more than 50,000 compounds, served as targets for machine learning-based predictions. The studied set of molecular structures encompasses organic push-pull molecules with variable linker lengths. Moreover, the diversified set of linkers, composed of alternating single/double and single/triple carbon-carbon bonds, was considered. This study demonstrates that the applied machine learning strategy allows us to obtain the correlation coefficients, between predicted and reference values of (hyper)polarizabilities, exceeding 0.9 on training, validation, and test set. However, in order to achieve such satisfactory predictive power, one needs to choose the training set appropriately, as the machine learning methods are very sensitive to the linker-type diversity in the training set, yielding catastrophic predictions in certain cases. Furthermore, the dependence of (hyper)polarizability on the length of spacers was studied in detail, allowing for explanation of the appreciably high accuracy of employed approaches.">

Here we report a diastereoselective gridization of superelectrophilic diazafluorene-containing substrates (AmBn) with crescent shapes into Drawing Hands grids (DHGs). The meso-selectivity reaches 75.6% diastereomeric excess (de) during the gridization of A1B1-type substrates and maintains ~80% de during the polygridization of A2B2-type monomers. Such stereocontrol originates from the centrosymmetric molecular packing of two charge-delocalized superelectrophiles with synergistically π-π stacking attractions and coulombic repulsions. As meso-stereoregular structures show 20∼30 nm in length, the rigid ring/chain-alternating polygrids have a Mark-Houwink exponent of 1.651 and a molecular weight (M) dependence of the hydrodynamic radius Rh ∼ M1.13. Via the simulation of chain collapse, meso-configured polygridarenes still adopt rod-like conformations that facilitate the high rigidity of organic nanopolymers, distinguished from toroid backbones of rac-type polygrids.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Biofilm infection caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria is difficult to eradicate by conventional therapies. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective antibacterial method for fighting against biofilm infection. However, the blocked photosensitizers outside of biofilm greatly limit the efficacy of PDT. Methods: Herein, a novel acid-responsive superporogen and photosensitizer (SiO2-PCe6-IL) was developed. Because of the protonation of the photosensitizer and the high binding energy of the polyionic liquid, SiO2-PCe6-IL changed to positive SiO2-PIL + in an acidic microenvironment of biofilm infection. SiO2-PIL + could combine with negatively charged extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and create holes to remove the biofilm barrier. To strengthen the interaction between SiO2-PIL + and EPS, SiO2-PIL + of high charge density was prepared by grafting the high-density initiation site of ATRP onto the surface of the SiO2 base. Results: Due to the rapid protonation rate of COO- and the strong binding energy of SiO2-PIL + with EPS, SiO2-PCe6-IL could release 90% of Ce6 in 10 s. With the stronger electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction of SiO2-PIL + with EPS, the surface potential, hydrophobicity, adhesion and mechanical strength of biofilm were changed, and holes in the biofilm were created in 10 min. Combining with the release of photosensitizers and the porous structure of the biofilm, Ce6 was efficiently concentrated in the biofilm. The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial experiments proved that SiO2-PCe6-IL dramatically improved the PDT efficacy against MRSA biofilm infection. Conclusion: These findings suggest that SiO2-PCe6-IL could rapidly increase the concentration of photosensitizer in biofilm and it is an effective therapy for combating biofilm infection.">

However, contradictions in the literature appear considering the value of the water contact angle (WCA). The purpose of this study is to present a holistic experimental and theoretical approach to the WCA determination. To do this, we checked the chemical composition of the silicon (1,0,0) surface by using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) method, and next this surface was purified using different cleaning methods. As it was proved that airborne hydrocarbons change a solid wetting properties the WCA values were measured in hydrocarbons atmosphere. Next, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to determine the mechanism of wetting in this atmosphere and to propose the force field parameters for silica wetting simulation. It is concluded that the best method of surface cleaning is the solvent-reinforced de Gennes method, and the WCA value of silicon covered by SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer is equal to 20.7° (at room temperature). MD simulation results show that the mechanism of pure silicon wetting is similar to that reported for graphene, and the mechanism of silicon covered by SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer wetting is similar to this observed recently for a MOF.">

Evidence of an intra-molecular hydrogen bond involving the amide group and ring oxygen was not observed; however, two separate inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding inter-actions were observed between the amide hydrogen atoms and adjacent carbonyl oxygen atoms along the b- and a-axis directions. The latter inter-action may also be supported by an inter-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen bond. The lattice is filled out by close-packed layers of this hydrogen-bonded network along the c-axis direction, related from one to the next by a 21 screw axis.">

Both compounds were chemically and structurally characterized by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR, infrared and UV-vis spectroscopies, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The study was complemented with density functional theory calculations (DFT). The results show an asymmetrical charge distribution in both compounds, with the electron density accumulated around the nitrogen and oxygen atoms, leaving the positive charge surrounding the N-H and C-H bonds in the hydrazine group. Consequently, the molecules stack in an antiparallel fashion in the crystalline state, although the contribution of the polar contacts to the stability of the lattice is different for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (18%) and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (42%). This difference affects the density and symmetry of their crystal structures.

The electron density difference maps (EDDM) revealed that during light absorption, the electron density flows within the π-delocalized system, among the pyridyl/thiophene ring, the nitro group, and the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;'-methyleneacetohydrazide moiety.

Moreover, CH4 and CO2 gases usually associate with oil and natural gas reserves, and their adsorption onto sedimentary rocks may influence the exploitation of fossil fuels. By employing the molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, the adsorptions of CH4 and CO2 onto three different CaCO3 polymorphs (i.e., calcite(10.4), aragonite(011)Ca, and vaterite(010)CO3) are compared in the present work. The calculated adsorption energies (E ad) are always negative for the three substrates, which indicates that their adsorptions are exothermic processes and spontaneous in thermodynamics. The E ad of CO2 is much more negative, which suggests that the CO2 adsorption will form stronger interfacial binding compared with the CH4 adsorption. The adsorption precedence of CH4 on the three surfaces is aragonite(011)Ca &gt; vaterite(010)CO3 &gt; calcite(10.4), while for CO2, the sequence is vaterite(010)CO3 &gt; aragonite(011)Ca &gt; calcite(10.4). Combining with the interfacial atomic configuration analysis, the Mulliken atomic charge distribution and overlap bond population are discussed. The results demonstrate that the adsorption of CH4 is physisorption and that its interfacial interaction mainly comes from the electrostatic effects between H in CH4 and O in CO3 2-, while the CO2 adsorption is chemisorption and the interfacial binding effect is mainly contributed by the bonds between O in CO2 and Ca2+ and the electrostatic interaction between C in CO2 and O in CO3 2-.">

The effects of the energetic plasticizers A3 [1:1 mixture of bis-(2,2-dinitropropy) acetal (BDNPA) and bis-(2,2-dinitropropyl) formal(BDNPN)] and Bu-NENA [N-butyl-N-(2nitroxyethyl) nitramine] on the curing reaction between ATPET and GAP have been studied. A diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DOSY-NMR) approach has been used to monitor the change in the diffusion coefficient of cross-linked polytriazole polyethylene oxide-tetrahydrofuran (PTPET). The change in the diffusion coefficient of PTPET with A3 plasticizer is significantly higher than that of PTPET with Bu-NENA. Viscosity analysis further highlighted the difference between A3 and Bu-NENA in the curing process-the curing curve of PTPET (A3) with time can be divided into two stages, with an inflection point being observed on the fourth day. For PTPET (Bu-NENA), in contrast, only one stage is seen. The above methods, together with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, revealed distinct effects of A3 and Bu-NENA on the curing process of PTPET. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that Bu-NENA has little effect on the valence oxidation of copper in the catalyst. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis indicated that Bu-NENA helps to improve the thermal stability of the catalyst. After analysis of several possible factors by means of XPS, modeling with Material Studio and TG, the formation of molecular cages between Bu-NENA and copper is considered to be the reason for the above differences. In this article, GAP (Mn = 4000 g/mol) was used to replace GAP (Mn = 427 g/mol) to successfully synthesize the PTPET elastomer with Bu-NENA plasticizer. Mechanical data measured for the PTPET (Bu-NENA) sample included ε = 34.26 ± 2.98%, and σ = 0.198 ± 0.015 MPa.">

Results are presented for model molecular liquids: pairwise Lennard-Jones, three-body Stillinger-Weber, and bottom-up coarse-graining of water. Here, covariant meshing proves to be an efficient strategy to learn canonically averaged instantaneous forces. We show that molecular dynamics simulations with tabulated two- and three-body ML potentials are computationally efficient and recover two- and three-body distribution functions. Many-body representations, decomposition, and kernel regression schemes are all implemented in the open-source software package VOTCA.">

A total of 180 non-duplicated &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa strains&lt;/i&gt; were isolated from patients with HAIs in the Suez Canal University Hospital. Phenotypically, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was done for all MDR and PDR strains before and after addition of efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP). Molecular detection of &lt;i&gt;mexA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mexB&lt;/i&gt; genes was done by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of the isolated strains (126 strains) were MDR (70%); only 10 samples (5.5%) were PDR. &lt;i&gt;MexA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mexB&lt;/i&gt; genes were detected in 88.2% (120 strains) and 70.5% (96 strains) of stains, respectively.

Recent efforts are directed at using such frameworks as tunable scaffolds for chemical reactions. In particular, COFs have emerged as viable platforms for mimicking natural photosynthesis. However, there is an indisputable need for efficient, stable, and economical alternatives for the traditional platinum-based cocatalysts for light-driven hydrogen evolution. Here, we present azide-functionalized chloro(pyridine)cobaloxime hydrogen-evolution cocatalysts immobilized on a hydrazone-based COF-42 backbone that show improved and prolonged photocatalytic activity with respect to equivalent physisorbed systems. Advanced solid-state NMR and quantum-chemical methods allow us to elucidate details of the improved photoreactivity and the structural composition of the involved active site. We found that a genuine interaction between the COF backbone and the cobaloxime facilitates recoordination of the cocatalyst during the photoreaction, thereby improving the reactivity and hindering degradation of the catalyst. The excellent stability and prolonged reactivity make the herein reported cobaloxime-tethered COF materials promising hydrogen evolution catalysts for future solar fuel technologies.">

To this end, the methanol loading in H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al ≈ 25) pores is systematically varied between 32, 16, 8 and 4 molecules per unit cell, which corresponds to 8, 4, 2 and 1 molecules per Brønsted acidic site, respectively. The &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; DRIFTS/MS data show that the room temperature methoxylation depends on the methanol loading: the higher the methanol loading, the faster the methoxylation. Accordingly, the reaction is more than an order of magnitude faster with 8 methanol molecules per Brønsted acidic site than that with 2 molecules, as evident from the evolution of the methyl rock band of the methoxy species and of water as a function of time. Significantly, no methoxylation is observed with ≤1 molecule per Brønsted acidic site. However, hydrogen bonded methanol occurs across all loadings studied, but the structure of hydrogen bonded methanol also depends on the loading. Methanol loading of ≤1 molecule per acidic site leads to the formation of hydrogen bonded methanol with no proton transfer (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; neutral geometry), while loading ≥2 molecules per acidic site results in a hydrogen bonded methanol with a net positive charge on the adduct (protonated geometry). The infrared vibrational frequencies of methoxy and hydrogen bonded methanol are corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Both the experiments and calculations reflect the methoxy bands at around 940, 1180, 2868-2876 and 2980-2973 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; which correspond to &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt;(C-O), &lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(C-H) and &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;as&lt;/sub&gt;(C-H), respectively.">

Here, we present a fast interatomic potential, which reproduces the molecular hydrogen phases: orientationally disordered Phase I; broken-symmetry Phase II and reentrant melt curve. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vibrational frequency drops at high pressure because of increased coupling between neighbouring molecules, not bond weakening. Liquid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is denser than coexisting close-packed solid at high pressure because the favored molecular orientation switches from quadrupole-energy-minimizing to steric-repulsion-minimizing. The latter allows molecules to get closer together, without the atoms getting closer, but cannot be achieved within in a close-packed layer due to frustration. A similar effect causes negative thermal expansion. At high pressure, rotation is hindered in Phase I, such that it cannot be regarded as a molecular rotor phase.">

When the inhalable micron-sized crystals of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (CD-MOF) was utilized as dry powder inhalers (DPIs) carrier with high fine particle fraction (FPF), it was found in this research that the encapsulation of a glycoside compound, namely, scutellarin (SCU) in CD-MOF could significantly enhance its laryngeal deposition. Firstly, SCU loading into CD-MOF was optimized by incubation. Then, a series of characterizations were carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of drug loading. Finally, the laryngeal deposition rate of CD-MOF was 57.72 ± 2.19% improved by SCU, about two times higher than that of CD-MOF, when it was determined by Next Generation Impactor (NGI) at 65 L/min. As a proof of concept, pharyngolaryngitis therapeutic agent dexamethasone (DEX) had improved laryngeal deposition after being co-encapsulated with SCU in CD-MOF. The molecular simulation demonstrated the configuration of SCU in CD-MOF and its contribution to the free energy of the SCU@CD-MOF, which defined the enhanced laryngeal anchoring. In conclusion, the glycosides-like SCU could effectively enhance the anchoring of CD-MOF particles to the larynx to facilitate the treatment of laryngeal diseases.">

The synthesized diamine and polyimide were fully characterized by elemental analyses, FTIR and NMR. The 2,7-CPI displays very attractive barrier performances, with oxygen transmission rate (OTR) and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) low to 0.14 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;·day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.05 g·m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;·day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Meanwhile, 2,7-CPI also exhibits exceptional thermal stability with a glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) of 467 °C, 5% weight-loss temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;d5%&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) of 550 °C under N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and coefficient of thermal expansion (&lt;i&gt;CTE&lt;/i&gt;) of 3.4 ppm/K. The barrier performances of 2,7-CPI are compared with those of a structural analogue (2,7-CPPI) and a typical polyimide (Kapton). Their barrier performances with respect to microstructure were investigated by molecular simulations, wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The results show that 2,7-CPI possesses better coplanar structure and more number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the three PIs, which result in tight chain packing and thereby high crystallinity, low free volume, and decreased chains mobility. That is, the high crystallinity and low free volume of 2,7-CPI reduce the diffusion and solubility of gases. Meanwhile, the poor chains mobility further decreases the gases diffusion. The reduced diffusion and solubility of gases consequently promote the improvement of barrier properties for 2,7-CPI. The polyimide has a wide application prospect in the field of flexible electronic packaging industries.">

Here, we test whether changes in beta frequency are related to the preparation of adapted movements in human, and whether such effects generalise to other species (cat). Eleven healthy adult humans performed a joystick visuomotor adaptation task. Beta (15-25 Hz) scalp EEG signals recorded over the motor cortex during a pre-movement preparatory phase were, on average, significantly reduced in amplitude during early adaptation trials compared to baseline, late adaptation, or aftereffect trials. The changes in beta were not related to measurements of reaction time or reach duration. We also recorded local field potential (LFP) activity within the primary motor cortex of three cats during a prism visuomotor adaptation task. Analysis of these signals revealed similar reductions in motor cortical LFP beta frequencies during early adaptation. This effect was present when controlling for any influence of the reaction time and reach duration. Overall, the results are consistent with a reduction in pre-movement beta oscillations predicting an increase in adaptive drive in upcoming task performance when motor errors are largest in magnitude and the rate of adaptation is greatest.">

        <span class="abst" title="The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a physical barrier that regulates the homeostasis of the neural microenvironment. A relative estimate of the BBB permeability, which is important for drug design, may be experimentally provided by the logBB (the blood-brain concentration ratio) and the logPS (permeability-surface-area product), while many computational methods aim to identify key properties that correlate well with these quantities. Although currently existing computational methods (e.g., quantitative structure activity relation) have made a significant contribution in screening various compounds that could potentially translocate through the BBB, they are unable to provide a physical explanation of the underlying processes and they can often be computationally demanding. Here, we use steered molecular dynamics simulation to estimate the BBB permeability of various compounds on the basis of simple lipid-membrane models by computing the nonequilibrium work, &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;neq&lt;/sub&gt;, produced by pulling the compounds through the membrane. We found that the values of &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;neq&lt;/sub&gt; correlate remarkably well with logBB and logPS for a range of compounds and different membrane types and pulling speeds, independently of the choice of force field. Moreover, our results provide insight into the role of hydrogen bonds, the energetic barriers, and the forces exerted on the ligands during their pulling. Our method is computationally easy to implement and fast. Therefore, we anticipate that it could provide a reliable prescreening tool for estimating the relative permeability of the BBB to various substances.">

While intractable as a whole, modern machine learning (ML) is increasingly capable of accurately predicting molecular properties in important subsets. Here, we therefore engage in the ML-driven study of even larger reaction space. Central to chemistry as a science of transformations, this space contains all possible chemical reactions. As an important basis for 'reactive' ML, we establish a first-principles database (Rad-6) containing closed and open-shell organic molecules, along with an associated database of chemical reaction energies (Rad-6-RE). We show that the special topology of reaction spaces, with central hub molecules involved in multiple reactions, requires a modification of existing compound space ML-concepts. Showcased by the application to methane combustion, we demonstrate that the learned reaction energies offer a non-empirical route to rationally extract reduced reaction networks for detailed microkinetic analyses.">

The main aim of the work was to propose probable adsorption mechanisms and interactions between the anticancer drug and surface of modified and pristine carbon nanotubes at blood pH. The carbon nanotubes were oxidized to optimize the absorbance efficiency relative to that of pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The adsorption isotherm of the modified system was well described by the Temkin equation. It confirms that the adsorption in the system studied involves also hydrogen and covalent bonding and is exothermic in nature. The experimental kinetic curves of adsorption were fitted to different mathematical models to check if the kinetics of doxorubicin adsorption onto the modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes follows a pseudo-second-order model and the chemical sorption is bound to be the rate-limiting. On the basis of the molecular dynamics simulation, it was shown that &lt;i&gt;in vacuo&lt;/i&gt; the aggregation tendency of doxorubicin molecules is far more favorable than their adsorption on pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs). It suggests that only functionalization of the nanotube surface can affect the interaction between doxorubicin and functional groups of the carriers and increases the efficiency of the drug loading process.">

This was accomplished by enhancement of van der Waals (vdW) forces which facilitate self-healing in relatively narrow copolymer compositional range. In this work we report the acceleration of self-healing in alternating/random hydrophobic acrylic-based copolymers in the presence of confined water molecules. Under these conditions competing vdW interactions do not allow H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-diester H-bonding, thus forcing nBA side groups to adapt L-shape conformations, generating stronger dipole-dipole interactions resulting in shorter inter-chain distances compared to 'key-and-lock' associations without water. The perturbation of vdW forces upon mechanical damage in the presence of controllable amount of confined water is energetically unfavorable leading the enhancement of self-healing efficiency of hydrophobic copolymers by a factor of three. The concept may be applicable to other self-healing mechanisms involving reversible covalent bonding, supramolecular chemistry, or polymers with phase-separated morphologies.">

In this methodology, the time evolution of an aqueous electrolyte solution generated from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is used to compute the reorientation time of different water subpopulations. The value of h is determined by considering whether the reorientation time of the water subpopulations is retarded with respect to bulk-like behavior. The application of this computational protocol to magnesium chloride (MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ) solutions at different concentrations (0.6-2.8 mol kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ) gives h values in excellent agreement with experimental hydration numbers obtained using GHz-to-THz dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. This methodology is attractive because it is based on a well-defined criterion for the definition of hydration number and provides a link with the molecular-level processes responsible for affecting bulk solution behavior. Analysis of the ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories using radial distribution functions, hydrogen bonding statistics, vibrational density of states, water-water hydrogen bonding lifetimes, and water dipole reorientation reveals that MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a considerable influence on the hydrogen bond network compared with bulk water. These effects have been assigned to the specific strong Mg-water interaction rather than the Cl-water interaction.">

        <span class="abst" title="Prediction of material behavior using machine learning (ML) requires consistent, accurate, and, representative large data for training. However, such consistent and reliable experimental datasets are not always available for materials. To address this challenge, we synergistically integrate ML with high-throughput reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the constitutive relationship of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel-the primary binding phase in concrete formed via the hydration of ordinary portland cement. Specifically, a highly consistent dataset on the nine elastic constants of more than 300 compositions of C-S-H gel is developed using high-throughput reactive simulations. From a comparative analysis of various ML algorithms including neural networks (NN) and Gaussian process (GP), we observe that NN provides excellent predictions. To interpret the predicted results from NN, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which reveals that the influence of silicate network on all the elastic constants of C-S-H is significantly higher than that of water and CaO content. Additionally, the water content is found to have a more prominent influence on the shear components than the normal components along the direction of the interlayer spaces within C-S-H. This result suggests that the in-plane elastic response is controlled by water molecules whereas the transverse response is mainly governed by the silicate network. Overall, by seamlessly integrating MD simulations with ML, this paper can be used as a starting point toward accelerated optimization of C-S-H nanostructures to design efficient cementitious binders with targeted properties.">

Recent usages of XAS in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, with emphasis on examples concerning electrocatalysis, will be presented. The latter is a rapidly developing field with immense industrial applications but also unique challenges in terms of the experimental characterization restrictions and advanced modeling approaches required. This review will highlight the new insight that can be gained with XAS on complex real-world electrocatalysts including their working mechanisms and the dynamic processes taking place in the course of a chemical reaction.

        <span class="abst" title="Birnessite is a layered MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mineral capable of intercalating nanometric water films in its bulk. With its variable distributions of Mn oxidation states (Mn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;), cationic vacancies, and interlayer cationic populations, birnessite plays key roles in catalysis, energy storage solutions, and environmental (geo)chemistry. We here report the molecular controls driving the nanoscale intercalation of water in potassium-exchanged birnessite nanoparticles. From microgravimetry, vibrational spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we find that birnessite intercalates no more than one monolayer of water per interlayer when exposed to water vapor at 25 °C, even near the dew point. Molecular dynamics showed that a single monolayer is an energetically favorable hydration state that consists of 1.33 water molecules per unit cell. This monolayer is stabilized by concerted potassium-water and direct water-birnessite interactions, and involves negligible water-water interactions. Using our composite &lt;i&gt;adsorption-condensation-intercalation&lt;/i&gt; model, we predicted humidity-dependent water loadings in terms of water &lt;i&gt;intercalated&lt;/i&gt; in the internal and &lt;i&gt;adsorbed&lt;/i&gt; at external basal faces, the proportions of which vary with particle size. The model also accounts for additional populations &lt;i&gt;condensed&lt;/i&gt; on and between particles. By describing the nanoscale hydration of birnessite, our work secures a path for understanding the water-driven catalytic chemistry that this important layered manganese oxide mineral can host in natural and technological settings.">

The structures of tedaniophorbasins A and B were deduced from the analysis of 1D/2D NMR and MS data and through application of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR DFT calculations. Tedaniophorbasin A possesses a novel 2-imino-1,3-dimethyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-[1,4]thiazino[3,2-g]pteridin-4(6&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one skeleton, while tedaniophorbasin B is its 2-oxo derivative. The compounds show significant Stokes shifts (~14,000 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) between excitation and emission wavelengths in their fluorescence spectra. The new compounds were tested for bioactivity against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and the protozoan parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei brucei&lt;/i&gt; but were inactive against all targets at 40 µM.">

<p>For even better time-resolution, various pump-and-probe techniques can be used, where the spectrum is collected point-by-point, by repeating an experiment many times with fixed time delay between the sample perturbation (“pump” pulse) and the absorption measurements (“probe” pulse). Such studies are attractive, for instance, for the investigation of photocatalysts, where the excitation of the sample by the laser results in well-reproducible structural modifications with well-defined onset times. For example, Borfecchia et al. used this approach to follow light-induced excited state dynamics in photoactive metal complexes with 100 ps time resolution.

 </sup> However, this approach is less common for the study of heterogeneous catalysts due to the challenge to repeatedly initiate the reaction at well-defined times in a typically macroscopic reactor with significant gradients of temperature, reactant concentrations, pH, etc.

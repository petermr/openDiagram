<p id="Par16">Functional analysis revealed a total of 374, 212, and 143 significant biological process (BP) terms over-represented in the liver, muscle, and cerebrum gene lists, respectively (
 <italic>adj.pvalue</italic> ≤ 0.05). In the liver, common BP across DE, TFs, and TS genes included categories such as blood coagulation, immune response (defense and inflammatory response), and energy metabolism (fatty acid metabolic process and cellular glucose homeostasis). Tissue specific genes highlighted BP related to metabolism, transport, and blood coagulation, whereas TFs underlined regulation of RNA biosynthetic process and hormone metabolic process (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The pathway analysis included complement and coagulation cascade (
 <italic>adj.pvalue</italic> = 2.9E−13), metabolic pathways (
 <italic>adj.pvalue</italic> = 2.64E−02), and maturity onset diabetes of the young (
 <italic>adj.pvalue</italic> = 2.64E−02) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Moreover, MAPK (
 <italic>adj.pvalue</italic> = 3.32E−02), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (
 <italic>adj.pvalue</italic> = 3.68E−02), and oxidative phosphorylation (
 <italic>adj.pvalue</italic> = 3.32E−02) pathways were retrieved from DC genes.

<p>This chapter provides assessments of the kinetics of solid-solid phase transformation, and particularly the kinetics of quench-induced precipitation for two AlSi binary wrought alloys, two high purity AlMgSi ternary wrought alloys, and a range of 20 wrought alloys from the heat treatable alloy systems AlMgSi (eight variants), AlZnMg(Cu) (10 variants) and AlCuMg (two variants). Some of the aforementioned alloys are laboratory alloys, and some were produced commercially; however, all contain amounts of trace elements and impurities typical of commercial production. Three AlSiMg cast alloys are also considered.

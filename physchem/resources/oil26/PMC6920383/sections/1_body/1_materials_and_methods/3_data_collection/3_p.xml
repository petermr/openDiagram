Three soil properties were also measured at each microsite: (1) volumetric water content within the top 3.8&#8201;cm of the soil (TDR 300 soil moisture meter; Spectrum technologies; USA), (2) soil resistance to penetration at 5&#8201;mm depth (as a measure of soil compaction) using a hand-held pocket penetrometer (Geotest; USA), and (3) soil temperature at 2&#8201;cm depth using a hand-held RTD thermometer (Eutech Instruments; RSA).</p>

<p>One potential oversight in the interpretation of these trials is the tissue specificity of the mode of action of the ERα (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19-22</xref>). It is now well established that the epigenetic landscape of individual tissues, in combination with the set of coactivators and corepressors of the ERα expressed, drastically affects the numbers and nature of the binding sites of the ERα in a tissue-specific manner (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19-22</xref>). The implication of these observations is profound, since it suggests that individual SERMs may have a selective effect in particular tissues and therefore their clinical use should be guided by understanding this selectivity. In agreement with this hypothesis, tamoxifen, but not raloxifene, is associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, also in the field of neurodegeneration, it is formally possible that different ERα ligands may have differential effects in specific regions of the CNS and on the activity of the proteasome. The current study was designed to begin addressing this possibility.

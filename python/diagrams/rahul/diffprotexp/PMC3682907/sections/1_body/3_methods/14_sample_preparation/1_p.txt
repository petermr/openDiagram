0: Whole brains were harvested from euthanized pregnant wistar rats and stored at -80C.
1: Brains were homogenized in parallel with and without 500 L of fluorescent MBP added to 1.5 mL of general lysis buffer (20 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.9, 0.5% NP-40, 5% glycerol with protease inhibitors (P2714, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO using a Wheaton homogenizer with a Teflon pestle.
2: in thirty strokes.
3: The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500g at 4C.
4: The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 minutes at 4C.
5: The pellet containing the mitochondrially enriched fractions was further purified by washing once in 20 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4.
6: The mitochondrial fractions were stored at 4C.

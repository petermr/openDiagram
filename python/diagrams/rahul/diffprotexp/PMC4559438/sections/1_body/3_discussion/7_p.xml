<p>Even with these limitations, our proteomic study on congenital cholesteatoma tissue provides some clues on cholesteatoma pathogenesis. It is tempting to speculate that the origin of congenital cholesteatomas differs from that of acquired cholesteatomas, which originate from tympanic membrane epithelium. This study provides justification for future research on congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.</p>

sequence alignment (MSA) analysis using Clustal Omega<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> with default parameters. Pairwise sequence identities between
the full-length sequence of hACE2 (accession ID: NP_001358344.1) and
the other ACE2 sequences were calculated based on the MSAs. Besides
the full-length sequence identities, the sequence identities for the
20 interface residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and five critical
S-RBD binding residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> were also calculated
from the MSAs. The results for these three types of sequence identities
are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>.</p>

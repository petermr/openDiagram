<p>A previous study has shown the role of 
 <italic>bZIP</italic> StABF1 in inducing tolerance to salt, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) stress in potatoes [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, a detailed identification and characterization of the 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> gene family in response to abiotic and hormonal stress in potato is lacking. A thorough study of the gene expression pattern of 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> under various stress conditions in the potato will help us to understand stress regulatory mechanisms. Here, we identified members of the 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> gene family using computational approaches, and the subfamily classification was performed based on prior annotations in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The distribution and conserved domain analysis of the 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> family were studied and validated using proteome sequence data and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data available in the public domain. Based on this information, a few candidate 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> that are expressed under various stress conditions were identified. This research will be valuable in further functional validation of the 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> and developing stress-tolerant elite varieties either using trans/cis-genic route or via molecular breeding programs.

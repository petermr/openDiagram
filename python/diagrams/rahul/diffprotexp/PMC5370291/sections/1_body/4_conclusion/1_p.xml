<p>In this study, we establish a label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS approach provide a differential protein expression profile of HepG2 cell in response to TNFα stimulus. Our results indicate that TNFα stimulus significantly modifies protein expression level of 511 cellular proteins, and the association of the 56 identified proteins with TNFα is first reported. GO and KO and KEGG pathway analysis categorize the identified proteins with significant expression changes into mainly cell cycle process, RNA process, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, and cell death process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inducible overexpression of HSP70 involves in the promotion of migratory ability and suppression of apoptosis in response to TNFα, suggesting that HSP70 could be a potential target to enhance sensitivity to anti-tumor drugs for HCC cells.</p>

<p id="Par38">In a brief summary, the transcriptomes of Gp and Gd from F1 and F5 follicles were analyzed in this study. We found that genes related to cell cycle and DNA replication are preferentially expressed in Gp cells, particularly in F1 follicles, while genes associated with steroidogenesis are preferentially expressed in Gd cells. These findings clearly indicate that Gp cells (especially G1p cells) is highly proliferative with a lower steroidogenic capacity, whereas Gd cells are of a higher steroidogenic capacity and is less mitotically active. In addition, genes associated with extracellular matrix organization, paracrine/autocrine signaling, and sperm binding are differentially expressed in Gp and Gd cells. All these findings, together with the detection of the abundant/differential expression of receptors for pituitary hormones (eg LHR/FSHR) or local factors derived from the GD or somatic cells (eg EGFR, NGFR) in two granulosa cell subpopulations, provide substantial evidence that Gp and Gd cells differs significantly in their mitotic activity, sperm binding, steroidogenesis and morphology.</p>

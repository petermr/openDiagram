<p>One should note here that the interpretation of EXAFS spectra in TMNC materials may be far for trivial due to the heterogeneity of their structure and coexistence of different structural motifs with different bond lengths, whose contribution to the EXAFS spectra cannot be easily separated. One approach that improves the chemical sensitivity of the EXAFS analysis is the wavelet transformation. WT was used by Zhang et al.

 </sup> to better distinguish between metallic and nonmetallic contributions. However, even in this case, caution is needed in the assignment of different features to particular structural motifs. For example, M-O, M-N, and M-C contributions cannot be easily distinguished by EXAFS data analysis due to the similarity of the photoelectron scattering properties for atoms that are neighbors in the Periodic Table; thus, the contribution of oxidic species could be hard to distinguish from that of Mâ€“N-C motifs. Similarly, the commonly used argument that the lack of a M-M contribution in the Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra signifies the lack of metallic clusters in the sample should be used with caution, because the presence of such structural motifs may be masked by the strong disorder or destructive interference of different contributions to the total EXAFS signal.

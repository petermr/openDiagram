0: It has been noted that epigenetic status might be modified by environment and diets [ 9].
1: In mice, by feeding the diets with high levels of methyl donors (e.g.
2: folic acid) to pregnant dams, it was possible to modify the expression of the agouti gene in the offspring with the high levels of DNA methylation [ 10,  11].
3: Histone modifications correlate with transcriptional activation and repression.
4: The maternal undernutrition led to a decreased H3K27me3 level of the promotor region and increased expression of  pomc gene in offspring mice [ 12].
5: Therefore, whether epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the food habits domestication is unknown.

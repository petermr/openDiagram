<p>Four types of hydrogels were prepared in this study, corresponding to poly (vinyl alcohol), ι-carrageenan, respectively, to two PVA and CAR blends, with their composition and sample coding reflected in 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-01544-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. These ratios were chosen considering our hydrogel recipe optimization trials and our previous study on PVA/κ-carrageenan hydrogels [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which were more dimensionally and compositionally stable up to a 0.140 κ-carrageenan weight fraction.

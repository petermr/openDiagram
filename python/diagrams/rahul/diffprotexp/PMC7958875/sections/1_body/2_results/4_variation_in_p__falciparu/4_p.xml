<p>Finally, we asked which 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes show a highly variable pattern of expression across individual midguts. Using the Brennecke method (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brennecke et al., 2013</xref>), we identified 12 genes that have significant biological variation (FDR &lt; 0.05) (

  <bold>Figure 4C</bold>
 </xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST4">
  <bold>Table S4</bold>
 </xref>). Seven of these genes were highly expressed rRNA encoding genes (

  <bold>Figure 4D</bold>
 </xref>). The active rRNA subunits switch between the mammalian and vector host across 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Waters et al., 1989</xref>), and their expression pattern may represent inter-vector individual variation in this process driven by selection of different parasite clones or a response to the environment. We also identified a single gene PF3D7_1255200 from the clonally variant 
 <italic>var</italic> gene family which encodes the virulence factor Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1). This particular 
 <italic>var</italic> gene has previously been identified as the primary 
 <italic>var</italic> expressed in transmission stages originating from field samples (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Díaz et al., 2017</xref>).

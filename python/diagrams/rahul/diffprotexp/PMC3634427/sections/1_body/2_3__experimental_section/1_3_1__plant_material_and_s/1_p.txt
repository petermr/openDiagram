0: Vegetatively-propagated apical potato shoots from 3-week-old  in vitro plantlets of two varieties of potato (the commercial cultivar  S. tuberosum L. cv.
1: Desiree and the wild potato  S. commersonii spp.
2: commersonii, provided by the CGR, the Netherlands) were submitted for 2 weeks to osmotic stress at 22 C, 16/8 h day/night and a light intensity of 40 mol m 2 s 1.
3: The Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (MS salts and vitamins + 0.09 M sucrose) was taken as control [ 89], while the osmotic treatment was provided by MS medium supplemented with 0.21 M of sucrose and MS medium plus 0.21 M of sorbitol (resulting in a total sugar concentration of 0.3 M).
4: A fourth batch of plantlets was cultivated in MS medium, but at 6 C in order to evaluate the changes occurring in the plant tissues after exposure to chilling temperatures.

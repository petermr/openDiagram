<p>By collecting XES data at different incidence energies, both at resonant and nonresonant conditions, exhaustive information about occupied and unoccupied states and the possible excitations in the material can be collected. For example, detailed information about electronic excitations in the d-band can be obtained. The latter are sensitive to the presence of ligands and the chemical environment around the absorbing atoms, as well as interactions with adsorbates, as demonstrated in recent studies of the interaction of Pt with CO

 </sup> and with the CeO
 <sub>2</sub> support.

 </sup> In the latter case, a significant similarity in the RIXS features for singly dispersed CeO
 <sub>2</sub>-supported Pt catalysts and that of oxidized Pt was demonstrated, suggesting a more localized nature of the 5d states in ultradispersed catalyst than in metallic Pt (

 </sup> At the same time, a better discrimination between different oxidation states of catalytic species (e.g., Co oxidation state in OER catalysts) can also be achieved through the analysis of the RIXS features.

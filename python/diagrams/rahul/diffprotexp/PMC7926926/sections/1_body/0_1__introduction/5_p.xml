<p>The goal of this study was to identify the key proteins underlying the alleviated Al toxicity in 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> under ectomycorrhizal fungi inoculation. We employed a comparative proteomics approach to probe the symbiotic relationship of 
 <italic>S. luteus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> seedlings in response to Al toxicity. This study provides insight into the proteome variations induced by ectomycorrhizal fungi under Al toxicity in 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic>.

<p>Melanin was quantified by spectrophotometry and fluorometry following previously reported protocols [

 <xref rid="B24-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In short, we dissolved synthetic melanin (Sigma-Aldrich) 100 µg/mL and melanin from B16F1 cells with 1 M NaOH (Merck) at 80 °C, the collected supernatants after centrifugation (1 min at 12,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C), and we assess the optical density (O.D.) by spectrophotometry at 405 nm. For fluorescence melanin quantification, after incubation with 15% (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) (Sigma-Aldrich), we read the supernatants on the Glomax equipment with a wavelength of 470 nm and 550 nm excitation and emission, respectively. We described the results according to the number of viable cells after determining cell number by MTT reductase assay. Data were expressed as the average of three independent trials ± standard deviation and analyzed by unpaired

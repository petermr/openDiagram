0: For the human experiments, data from five epochs, each of 72 consecutive trials, was extracted from each participant.
1: The five epochs were: baselinethe final trials of the baseline period; early adaptationthe set of trials following the visuomotor rotation, in which endpoint errors were greater than 2SD from baseline; late adaptationfinal trials under the visuomotor rotation condition; early aftereffectthe 72 trials following the removal of the visuomotor rotation, in which endpoint errors were greater than 2SD from Baseline; and late aftereffectthe final 72 trials of the task.

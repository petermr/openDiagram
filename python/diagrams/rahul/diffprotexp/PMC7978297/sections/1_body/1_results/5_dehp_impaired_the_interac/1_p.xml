<p>The two datasets of female germ cells and pre-granulosa cells during PF formation, were integrated to investigate the interaction (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>A-B). Using the gene differential expression analysis above, the key DEGs affected by DEHP produced 194 genes in germ cells (DEGs detected by at least two strategies) and 138 genes in granulosa cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>C-D). Enrichment of germ cells in the processes of “oxidative phosphorylation”, “cytoplasmic translation” and “cellular responses to stress”, and mTORC1 signaling were also included (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>E). For granulosa cells, the terms of “ribosome assembly”, regulation of catabolic process and cell death, as well as WNT signaling and reactive oxygen species were also enriched (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>F). It is noteworthy that the “Downregulation of SMAD2/3: SMAD4 transcriptional activity” term was enriched in both cell types. Thus, components of the TGF-beta pathway were highlighted in subsequent analysis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). In the results, most known elements regarding TGF-beta signaling were expressed by both or either of germ cells or granulosa cells. Results suggested that
 <italic> Gdf9</italic> and 
 <italic>Bmp2</italic> were slightly expressed by germ cells and granulosa cells, respectively, while the receptors were mostly expressed by granulosa cells, and the target genes and effectors were highly expressed by germ cells. Moreover, the effect of DEHP on germ cells was not apparent, except for a reduction of 
 <italic>Gdf9</italic> at PD3 and a rise in the levels of 
 <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> and 
 <italic>Smad4</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C, left). However, it caused upregulation of 
 <italic>Smad4</italic> in granulosa cells, as well as a reduction of other genes such as the receptors of 
 <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> and 
 <italic>Bmpr2</italic>, targets of 
 <italic>Id2</italic> and 
 <italic>Id3</italic>, and effectors of 
 <italic>Smad2</italic> and 
 <italic>Smad3</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C, right)
 <italic>.</italic> Furthermore, the ovarian section staining of GDF9 protein revealed its location in germ cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D), Western blot in the protein level exhibited a decline of GDF9 and LHX8 after DEHP treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>E), and BMPR1A and SMAD3 expression was also affected by DEHP exposure (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>G-H).

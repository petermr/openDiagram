  <p>A computational pipeline for ACE2 usage analysis. 321 ACE2 orthologs were downloaded from NCBI. The crystal structure of the hACE2/S-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) was used as a template for homology modeling. For each ACE2/S-RBD pair, 100 initial Modeller complex models were constructed and repacked by FASPR, and then five models were generated by EvoEF2/SAMC remodeling for each FASPR model. The binding energy cutoff (

   <sub>cutoff</sub>) was set to âˆ’47 EvoEF2 energy units.

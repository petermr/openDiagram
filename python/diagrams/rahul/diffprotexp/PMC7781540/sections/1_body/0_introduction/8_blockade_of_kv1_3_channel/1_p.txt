0: As a follow-up experiment to our previous paper on the role of K V1.3 in regulating P2X4 mediated calcium influx, we here specifically asked the question if the K V1.3 blocker ShK-223 would also reduce SOCE in LPS differentiated microglia, the same stimulation condition, where we had observed the highest K V1.3 current densities and the largest effects of K V1.3 inhibition on ATP induced calcium signaling [ 40].
1: Using the ratiometric calcium indicator Fura-2 to track changes in the free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+] i) we found that LPS differentiated microglia had a resting cytosolic calcium concentration [Ca 2+] i that varied between 60 nM and 370 nM, averaging 150  8.8 nM (n = 50;  Figure 3a,c,g), which is consistent with a previous report [ 54].
2: To elicit SOCE, intracellular calcium stores were first depleted with thapsigargin (Tg), a blocker of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+-ATPase, applied in a nominally Ca 2+-free bath solution.
3: Removal of extracellular calcium produced a roughly 25 nM decrease in [Ca 2+] i ( Figure 3a) indicating the presence of a calcium influx at rest.
4: Subsequent application of Tg (1 M) elicited small amplitude (> 25 nM) asynchronous elevations in [Ca 2+] i due to passive calcium mobilization from stores.
5: Re-addition of calcium into the bath solution elicited a rapid elevation in [Ca 2+] i above the resting levels caused by SOCE.
6: The magnitude of the SOCE-induced [Ca 2+] i transients (peak SOCE) measured as the difference between [Ca 2+] i level in the Ca 2+-free bath solution and maximal [Ca 2+] i elevation following calcium re-addition varied significantly among individual cells with peak SOCE distribution displaying a maximum at 120 nM and a tail up to 1800 nM ( Figure 1b).
7: This heterogeneity in the strength of SOCE is likely caused by variations in resting membrane potential, which provides the driving force for calcium entry during SOCE.
8: The resting membrane potential of LPS-differentiated microglia has been found to vary between 90 mV and 40 mV in individual cells [ 40, 55] and thus could account for the observed differences in SOCE.

<p>To label the GluN2D subunit we used a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit (Alomone Labs, #AGC-020). It recognizes the N-terminus sequence CRTQNRTHRGESLHR corresponding to the amino-acid residues 345â€“359 of the rat GluN2D. This GluN2D antibody has been successfully employed in both immunohistochemistry and cytochemistry experiments [

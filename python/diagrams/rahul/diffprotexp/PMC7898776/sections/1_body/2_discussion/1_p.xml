<p id="Par39">In rearing conditions, mandarin fish accept only live prey fish, refusing dead prey fish or artificial diets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although pervious research showed the methods of mandarin fish domestication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], little is known about the mechanism of food habits domestication. In the present study, we domesticated the mandarin fish to feed on artificial diets, and found a part of mandarin fish could accept artificial diets easily (Group X), but another part could not accept completely (Group W). To uncover the molecular mechanism why mandarin fish refuses artificial diets, we conducted the transcriptome sequencing and metabolome analysis. The results showed that the differentially expressed gene between the two groups were enriched in metabolism, in which the global and overview maps and lipid metabolism were the most enriched. And the rich factors of steroid biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism were the highest. The metabolome results showed that the pathways with different metabolites were mostly enriched in the metabolic pathways, which were consistent with transcriptome sequencing results. Previous research has shown that the most important pathways related to the domestication of dead prey fish in mandarin fish included the retinal photosensitivity, circadian rhythm, appetite control, learning and memory pathway [

Our results showed that metabolism, especially lipid metabolism, might contribute to the domestication of artificial diets, which was different from the domestication of dead prey fish, as the different constituents between dead prey fish and artificial diets.

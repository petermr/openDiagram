<p>Plant viruses are obligate parasites that are dependent on their host to establish a successful infection cycle including gene expression, genome replication, protein synthesis, and intercellular movement. During the infection, protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions may induce plant defense mechanisms such as innate immunity, translational repression, autophagy-mediated or ubiquitinated-mediated protein degradation, and RNA interference (RNAi) [

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Activation of the host immune responses result in either a compatible or incompatible response in the plant and is followed by a susceptible or resistance reaction to virus, respectively. Among these interactions, RNAi is one of the major evolutionarily-conserved defense mechanisms against viruses, and viral evasion from this resistance response is a crucial event in viral pathogenesis [

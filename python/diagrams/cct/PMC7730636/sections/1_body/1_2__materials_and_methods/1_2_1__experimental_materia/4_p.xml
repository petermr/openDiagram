<p>Two different martensite morphologies occurred in steel in the delivered state. The first form was represented by lath martensite, and the second was the occurrence of plate martensite. Lattice martensite occurs predominantly in steels that have a lower carbon content and medium content of additive alloying elements. In contrast to steels with a medium carbon content, martensite morphology is formed with both types. Small dimension of the lath martensite structure brings significant effect on the strengthening mechanism.</p>

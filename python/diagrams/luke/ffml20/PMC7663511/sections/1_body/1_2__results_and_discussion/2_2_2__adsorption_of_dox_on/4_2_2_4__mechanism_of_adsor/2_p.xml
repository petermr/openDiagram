<p>Considering the driving forces and mechanisms of adsorption of DOX on the surface of nanotubes, it is worth emphasizing that non-oxidized MWCNTs act as nano-reservoirs adsorbing drug molecules by host–guest interaction. The hydrophobic and π–π stacking interaction force between the chains of adsorbed molecule and surface of CNTs play a key role in adsorption and do not affect the electronic network of the tubes [

In contrast, the adsorption process of the modified MWCNTs involves not only physisorption, electrostatic, and π–π stacking interactions but mainly hydrogen and covalent bonding. The kinetic studies suggest that the adsorption of the drug on the modified MWCNTs depends on the types of adsorbent and adsorbate and involves chemisorption as well as physisorption.

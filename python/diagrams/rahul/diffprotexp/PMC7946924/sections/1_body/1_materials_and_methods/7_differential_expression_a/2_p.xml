<p id="Par14">Size factor was calculated by dividing each column by the geometric means of the rows. The median of these ratios was used as the size factor for this column. For comparison, log
 <sub>2</sub> fold of 1 was used as cut-off miRNA, &gt; 1 were considered as up-regulated (UP), miRNAs &lt; − 1 were considered as down-regulated (DOWN) and those between 1 and − 1 were considered as “NEUTRAL”. Heat maps were generated for top 40 miRNA DGEs (top 20 UP and top 20 DOWN according to Log
 <sub>2</sub> fold change) among all 12 samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Scale with colour code has been given for SR-159 and SR-157 samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).

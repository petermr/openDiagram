<p id="Par41">The expression of a few critical protein-coding genes that were significantly affected by AS6 and are involved in cellular stress, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis was validated through real-time PCR and Western blotting. HUMEC and MCF7 cells were treated with AS6 at either 0.25 or 0.5 μM for 72 h and total RNAs or proteins were extracted. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses indicated that RNA expression of representative DNA repair proteins for DNA double strand break, including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (
 <italic>ATM</italic>) and breast cancer susceptibility 1 (
 <italic>BRCA1</italic>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, was notably reduced in AS6-treated MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>A; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These proteins are essential for homology-directed DNA double strand break repair (HDR)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>, which is error-free
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. Because of the enhanced genomic fidelity that can be achieved by HDR compared to non-homologous end joining, these repair proteins are considered to be critical, and their mutations or malfunctions have been implicated in various cancers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. In particular, 
 <italic>ATM</italic> and 
 <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations are strongly linked to breast cancers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. An inherited mutated copy of ATM confers an increased risk of developing breast cancer as well as pancreatic, prostate, colon, and other cancers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. 
 <italic>BRCA1</italic> is a potent tumor suppressor gene, whose mutations increase the risk for breast and ovarian cancers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. Such mutations also increase the risk for other cancers including pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and cervical cancers. In addition, BRCA1 deficiency can lead to an accumulation of DNA double strand breaks in genes activated by estrogen receptor
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. p53 (TP53) is a critical genome guardian protein that senses the status of DNA breaks and genome integrity, leading to DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup>. Real-time PCR using AS6-treated HUMEC and MCF7 cells indicated reduced 
 <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 
 <italic>ATM</italic> expression in MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). In particular, 
 <italic>BRCA1</italic> mRNA levels decreased more than 80% in MCF7 cells compared to the control. 
 <italic>ATM</italic> expression was downregulated in both HUMEC and MCF7 cells but more significantly and extensively in MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Immunoblotting results demonstrated that the protein levels of BRCA1 and ATM as well as p53 (for p53, also see below) were dramatically reduced by AS6 treatment in MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>A). These data suggest malfunctions in HDR and the sensing of DNA breaks and an increase in genome instability in MCF7 cells that are treated with AS6.

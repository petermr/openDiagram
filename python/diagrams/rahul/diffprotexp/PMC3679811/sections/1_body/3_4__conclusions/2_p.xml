<p>There are only a few reports concerning proteomic analysis for the investigation of clinical peritoneal dialysate. This may be due to difficulties with obtaining “healthy” control specimens of peritoneal dialysate. Thus, in this study, we utilized the peritoneal dialysate from CGN patients as control samples and compared them with the DM peritoneal dialysate. Experimental results showed that ten proteins were differentially expressed in DM peritoneal dialysate samples. Although the sample number was not large, most of the proteins with differential expression in peritoneal dialysate samples were also found in plasma or serum. These proteins may not be new biomarkers; however, they may indicate a situation for possible drug treatment or glycemic control. In this paper, we may not be able to provide a final decision for the function or presence of these proteins, but these data support the need to continue and expand proteomic analysis of total proteins in DM peritoneal dialysate. The results of these studies still need to be verified by larger clinical studies. In conclusion, these proteins are valuable for the identification of differentially expressed proteins involved in the proteomics database and screening biomarkers for further study of DM.</p>

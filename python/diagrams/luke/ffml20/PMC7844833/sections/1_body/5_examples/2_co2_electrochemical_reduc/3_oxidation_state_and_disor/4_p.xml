<p>To limit the effect of sample-averaging in the XAS spectra and enhance the contribution of surface species, studies of nanostructured samples, rather than of polycrystalline foils, may be helpful. In the recent study by Möller et al.,
 <sup>

 </sup> unsupported Cu NPs produced via a wet chemical synthesis with cubic shape and sizes ∼35 nm were investigated by 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS at the Cu K-edge under CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions. Similarly as in the former study,
 <sup>

 </sup> the as-prepared sample was in Cu(I) state according to XANES analysis, see

  <xref rid="fig25" ref-type="fig">25</xref>
 </xref>b, and with a clear Cu–O contribution evident in the EXAFS spectrum, see 
 <xref rid="fig25" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig25" ref-type="fig">25</xref>
 </xref>c. Under reaction conditions, the contribution of oxidized Cu species also decreased, as evidenced by linear combination analysis of XANES spectra and changes in the Cu–O and Cu–Cu coordination numbers, as extracted by conventional EXAFS data fitting (

 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions, complete reduction was not achieved.

 </sup> High selectivity toward ethylene was observed for this catalyst.

<p>As presented in 
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, a few proteins in this network have been reported in previous studies associated with KD, including complement C3 (C3) (
 <xref rid="b19-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), apolipoprotein A-I (
 <xref rid="b20-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and fibrinogen Î² chain (
 <xref rid="b21-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Accordingly, the focus of the present study was on significant proteins that have not been reported previously and served key roles in each cluster of the network. Thus, the five proteins, CFH, MBL2, KNG1, FN1 and SERPINC1 were selected as candidate proteins associated with CAD and CAA. The western blot results for the five proteins were consistent with those of the iTRAQ analyses. MBL2 and CFH were reduced in KD with CAD compared with controls. KNG1 and SERPINC1 were downregulated in KD with CAA. FN1 was differentially expressed in both diseases; FN1 decreased in CAA and CAD when compared with controls.

<p id="par0135">In summary, we examined protein profiles of CV-PTC, FV-PTC and benign thyroid tissues by mass spectrometry. Remarkably, we have found that actin cytoskeleton proteins are highly altered and reorganization of the cytoskeleton plays predominant role in the progression of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Additionally, although there was no clear distinction between and benign and FV-PTC samples, these less aggressive samples demonstrated changes in the energy metabolism. Finally, expressional change in IQGAP proteins in CV-PTC and FV-PTC samples needs to be further investigated to address the explicit roles of IQGAP proteins in thyroid pathology.</p>

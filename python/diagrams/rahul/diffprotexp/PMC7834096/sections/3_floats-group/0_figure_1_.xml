  <p>Genetic organization of the 
   <italic>aaf</italic>/I, III, IV and V operons and amino acid identities of the AggDCBA subunits. (a) Schematic representation of the genetic organization of 
   <italic>aaf</italic>/I, III, IV and V operons (not to scale). (b) Amino acid identities of the AggDCBA subunits of AAF/I, IV and V in respect to the subunits of AAF/III in percent. Overall, AAF/V is more closely and AAF/IV more distantly related to AAF/III than AAF/I is to AAF/III

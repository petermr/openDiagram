<p id="Par16">After exposure, cells were scraped and lysed with RLT lysis buffer containing beta-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates were homogenized using QIA shredders (Qiagen), and mRNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacture’s recommended protocol. RNA concentrations were determined with a Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at − 80 °C. RNA was transported on dry ice to the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core for further processing. Four independent experiments were performed. Each treatment group within a given experiment was performed in triplicate. RNA from triplicates were pooled according to the treatment group within the experiment. In total, RNA was analyzed from 24 cell samples: 4 replicates at 2 time points and 3 treatment groups.</p>

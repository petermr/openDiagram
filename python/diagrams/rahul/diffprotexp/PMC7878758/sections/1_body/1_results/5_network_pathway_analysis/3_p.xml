<p id="Par16">Cell morphology and Embryonic development network pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) was found to be associated with Akt, ANXA6, CD63, CDK4/6, Collagen type VI, Cytokeratin, DSC1, DSP, FERMT2, GPD1, GPI, Integrin alpha 4 beta 1, Kallikrein, Keratin, KRT1, KRT10, KRT14, KRT19, KRT23, KRT24, KRT4, KRT5, KRT7, LOC102724788/PRODH, MIR124, MYO16, NEDD8, PKP1, PLEC, PRKAA, RARRES1, RBM24, TRIM72, TUBB, VIM genes/proteins which were found differently expressed during the regeneration of tail tissue. Similarly Cellular assembly and organization network pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) was found associated with 60S ribosomal subunit, adenosine-tetraphosphatase, ADRM1, APOA1, ASPH, ATP synthase, ATP2A1, ATP5IF1, ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, ATP5PD, C1QBP, CAPNS1, chymotrypsin, cytochrome-c oxidase, F0 ATP synthase, FAM162A, FAN1, FYTTD1, glutathione peroxidase, LUC7L3, Mitochondrial complex 1, MRPL17, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, NFkB (complex), PLA2G1B, RPL18, RPL35A, Ryr, RYR1, SLC25A6, TMEM223, UBA52, UBB genes/proteins. Genes/proteins associated with cellular assembly and organization were also associated with mitochondrial protein synthesis, protein transport, signal transduction, and cytoskeleton remodelling.

<p>In many of these cases, the actual active species and the working mechanism of the catalysts remain actively debated. This is in part due to the coexistence of disordered species with different oxidation state and local environment, and because of the significant transformations of the materials electronic and atomistic structure that take place under reaction conditions. In fact, the most active OER catalysts are often those that are the least stable under reaction conditions.

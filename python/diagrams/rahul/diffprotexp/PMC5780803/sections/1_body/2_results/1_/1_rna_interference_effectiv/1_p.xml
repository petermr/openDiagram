<p>In order to decrease the expression of XIAP in Caki-1 cells, sequence-specific siRNA of XIAP was synthesized in the aforementioned manner. In order to generate stably transfected clones, the transfected cells were selected for 3â€“4 weeks. Three of the stably transfected cell clones were screened out and one was selected for further experiments. The interference efficiency of XIAP-knockdown cells was confirmed by western blot analysis. As demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="f1-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, XIAP shRNA transfection markedly reduced the expression of XIAP, while no significant difference was observed between XIAP expression in the Caki-1 control group and that in the pENTR/U6 group.

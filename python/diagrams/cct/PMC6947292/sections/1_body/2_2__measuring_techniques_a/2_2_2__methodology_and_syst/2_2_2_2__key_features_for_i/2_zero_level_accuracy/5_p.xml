<p>In terms of statistical validation, a sufficient number of experiments is required, and the exact number depends on the sample and the considered effect. Of course, the number of experiments is always a compromise between statistical validation and time effort, and this especially holds for slow, long-lasting measurements. For these, two to four experiments and one or two baseline runs are typically done, while for the faster experiments at least six samples and three baselines are generally measured.</p>

 <caption> Protein–metabolite–lipid multi-omics network. The network of analytes whose correlation has been converted identically in Cluster 1 vs. Cluster 2 and critical vs. severe. Nodes are colored and shaped based on the type of molecular and the size of nodes corresponds to their degree centrality. The color of edges represents the pattern of correlation changes. Crimson line +/++ in the upper legend of the networks indicates that correlation between two connected analytes pairs was positive (+) in critical group, and the correlation became even more strongly positive (++) in severe group samples, as defined by statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in correlation coefficients between the analytes pair across the two conditions. LightPink line 0/+: insignificant correlation in critical group → positive correlation in severe group. DeepPink line −/ + : negative correlation in critical group → positive correlation in severe group. HotPink line −/0: negative correlation in critical group → insignificant correlation in severe group. Blue line 0/−: insignificant correlation in critical group → negative correlation in severe group. SteelBlue line ± : positive in critical group → negative in severe group. LightSkyBlue line +/0: positive in critical group → insignificant in severe group. DeepSkyBlue line ++/+: more strongly positive in critical group → positive in severe group. DimGray line 0/0: insignificant correlation in critical group → insignificant correlation in severe group </caption>

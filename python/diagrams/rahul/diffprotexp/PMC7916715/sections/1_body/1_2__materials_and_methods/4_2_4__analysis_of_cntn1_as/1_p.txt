0: Fast Gene set enrichment analysis (FGSEA) on CNTN1-associated DEGs was performed using Galaxy ( https://usegalaxy.org/ accessed on 19 December 2020).
1: Gene expression in PC and normal prostate tissues was carried out using GEPIA2 database [ 40].
2: Analyses of gene expression in mPCs and primary PCs were determined with using R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform ( http://r2.amc.nlhttp://r2platform.com accessed on 19 December 2020).
3: A curated GEO dataset (GDS2546: GEO DataSet Browser ( nih.gov accessed on 19 December 2020)) was also used to analyze leading-edge (LE) gene expression following PC progression.

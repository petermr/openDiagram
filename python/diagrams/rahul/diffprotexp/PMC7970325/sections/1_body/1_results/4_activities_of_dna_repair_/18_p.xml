<p id="p0145">We then analyzed gene compositions of the reconstructed comparison-specific DNA repair networks and found statistically significantly differential genes (according to Wilcoxon test) that may represent the key regulated pathway nodes. We adjusted Wilcoxon 
 <italic>p</italic>-value by Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate test and obtained the differential gene set with 
 <italic>q</italic>-value less than 0.05 for each reconstructed pathway: totally 68, 73, and 91 genes for the three comparisons, respectively (Supplementary file 5). The gene compositions in these three lists were highly redundant and totally represented 96 individual genes. Top-10 of these differential genes sorted by the fold change value are shown on

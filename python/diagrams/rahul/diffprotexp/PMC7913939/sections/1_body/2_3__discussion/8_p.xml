<p>MCT4, another monocarboxylate proton-coupled transporter, showed slight but significant downregulation in the hippocampus of 
 <italic>Prnp
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> vs. WT mice, suggesting an impaired lactate export from astrocytes to neurons. Disrupting the expression of MCT1 or MCT4 (glial transporters), and/or MCT2 (neuronal transporter), in the rat hippocampus prevented learning and long-term memory formation. The latter deficiency could be rescued by exogenously provided lactate [

 <italic>Prnp
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice are cognitive deficits and memory impairment [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Astrocytes are known to export lactate either through MCT1 or MCT4 to power oxidative neurons expressing MCT2 [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although the role of the cerebellum in cognitive functions is still controversial, there is growing evidence of its contributions to cognitive functions, such as attention, language, working memory, and visuospatial navigation [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that all three brain structures cooperate in a compensatory way at the energetic level, and therefore show differential up-/downregulation of MCTs as compared to each other.

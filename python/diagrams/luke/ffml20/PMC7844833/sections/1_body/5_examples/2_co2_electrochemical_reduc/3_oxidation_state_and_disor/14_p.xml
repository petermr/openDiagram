<p>As is clear from the examples summarized in this section, the role of oxidized species in CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR selectivity remains controversial and is the topic of active research. Certainly, it is only one of several factors that affect the catalytic performance of CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR catalysts. The survival of oxidized species under reducing CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions seems to depend on many subtle details of the experimental system and precatalyst preparation. 
 <italic>Operando</italic> XAS studies will play a key role in the future to help link the catalyst performance to other parameters such as the catalyst composition, structure, and preparation.

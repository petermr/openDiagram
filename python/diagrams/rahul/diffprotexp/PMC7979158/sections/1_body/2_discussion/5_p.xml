<p>Our findings of disrupted cortical lamination following the acute MIA signature are consistent with, but not identical to previous studies showing cortical dysplasia associated with MIA-induced aberrant behavior in offspring (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Shin Yim et al., 2017</xref>). In those studies, dysplasia resolved at later postnatal stages but defects in lamination persisted into adulthood. Although we did not find evidence of aberrant cortical patches in the somatosensory cortex, secondary motor cortex or S1 and S1DZ, as previously reported, our results do show altered cortical lamination at E17.5. Our findings suggest that perturbation to neuronal migration, potentially due to differences in an early exit of pyramidal neuron precursors from the cell cycle that led to cells further along in their radial migration/lamination, developmental progression, at least in part contribute to MIA-associated lamination differences identified at E17.5 here. Thus, results from multiple studies using MIA models to date are consistent in showing a detrimental impact of MIA on cortical patterning; however, we also acknowledge that our and other studies may have differential variables, including onset of MIA, dose, mouse background, and endpoint measurements, which will be important factors to assess in future studies. Finally, bulk tissue RNA-seq is limited in cell type-specific resolution and signatures could additionally be in part driven by cortex-adjacent structures, such as primordial hippocampus, that may have also been captured at the youngest age. Future work using single-cell approaches is needed to resolve the impacted cell types and compare transcriptional pathology following MIA.

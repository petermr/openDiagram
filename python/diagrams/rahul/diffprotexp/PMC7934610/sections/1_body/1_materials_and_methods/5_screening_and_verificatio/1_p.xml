<p>After the alignment result passed QC, according to the significance of digital gene expression profiles which were reported on genome research by Audio [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], only genes with a value of FDR ≤ 0.001 and |log2 ratio| ≥ 1 were selected as DEGs. Since DEG analysis generated a large number of problems in which thousands of hypotheses (is gene 
 <italic>x</italic> differentially expressed between the two groups) were tested simultaneously, correction for false-positive (type I errors) and false-negative (type II) errors was performed using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We assumed that we picked out 
 <italic>R</italic> differentially expressed genes in which S genes actually showed differential expression and the other 
 <italic>V</italic> genes were false positives. As we decided that the error ratio “
 <italic>Q</italic> = 
 <italic>V</italic>/
 <italic>R</italic>” must stay below a cutoff, we preset the FDR to a number no larger than 0.001.

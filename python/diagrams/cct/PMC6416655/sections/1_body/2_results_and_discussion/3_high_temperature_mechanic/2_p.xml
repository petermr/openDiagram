<p id="p0085">There is a close relationship between the surface/inner cracking of continuous casting slab and the high-temperature mechanical properties of slab. Moreover, the high-temperature ductility of the slab is fundamental in configuring the secondary cooling system. Therefore, in order to avoid the surface/inner cracking and design a better secondary cooling process, it is necessary to study the high-temperature mechanical properties of slab. Unfortunately, there is rare report on the high-temperature ductility of high-alloy steel, which has a high carbon content, such as mould steel.</p>

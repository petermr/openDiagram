<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The involvement of potassium channels in the vasorelaxant effect was assessed following the experimental procedure previously detailed, with some variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium channels, TEA (10<sup>&#8722;2</sup>M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), the selective voltage-activated potassium channel (K<sub><italic>v</italic></sub>) blocker, 4-AP (10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), the selective inwardly-rectifying potassium channel blocker, BaCl<sub>2</sub> (10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), and the selective ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker, glybenclamide (10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) for 20&#160;min prior to contraction with Phen (1&#160;&#956;M), then, the cumulative concentration&#8211;response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.</p>

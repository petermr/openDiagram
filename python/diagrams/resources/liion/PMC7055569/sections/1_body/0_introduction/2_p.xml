<p>Globally, energy and environmental issues are rife and prominent.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Currently, the world is dealing with two great tasks: forthcoming reduction of hydrocarbon fuel resources aggravated by an increasing demand for energy due to the population and economic growths.[qv: 1c,2] In efforts to address those problems, the penetration of solar conversion technologies is the crucial target; which is today limited by the absence of a cheap battery technology. In that context, rechargeable batteries have been extensively studied for more efficient and environmentally benign energy‐storage systems.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Among all myriad rechargeable battery systems, lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are considered the most promising technology for energy storage applications and also as a key system to build low‐carbon, sustainable electricity platform. LIBs have huge applications in all portable electronic gadgets, electric and hybrid electric vehicles and grid‐scale energy storage systems.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> But its large‐scale production for grid application is uncertain since there is a controversial debate about lithium availability and cost because battery industry requires almost 50% of the available resources of lithium.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5f</xref> Additionally, limited Li‐ion conductivity in aprotic electrolytes and poor safety may also cause problems for its large‐scale utilization. Those drawbacks motivate researchers to find new energy storage technologies alternative to LIBs among which rechargeable metal–air batteries emerge as a new promising class of electrical storage (

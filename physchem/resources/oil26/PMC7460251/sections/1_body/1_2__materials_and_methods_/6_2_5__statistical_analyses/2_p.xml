<p>We analyzed the outcome variables using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) in SPSS v. 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). In the past, the aardvarksâ€™ behavioral patterns varied in different habitats [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To control for this variation, we used habitat as part of a random slope term that also included individual identity and either the seven specific enrichment items or the two stated goals of the enrichment (i.e., foraging or exploring). We then modeled each target variable twice to match the corresponding slope: once including fixed factors for enrichment item and once including fixed factors for stated goal. All model building was conducted in a top-down manner, removing non-significant fixed factors, and re-running the model until only significant fixed factors remained. However, we always retained either enrichment goal or specific enrichment item as fixed factors in the models because they pertained to our main study questions. We calculated degrees of freedom for all models using a Satterthwaite approximation.

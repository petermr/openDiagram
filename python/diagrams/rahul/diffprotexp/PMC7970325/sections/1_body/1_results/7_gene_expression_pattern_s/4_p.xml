<p id="p0180">The first group deals with response to topologically incorrect (misfolded and unfolded) proteins. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular process related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The information about the protein folding status is sensed in the ER lumen and transmitted to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. UPR signaling pathway includes transcriptional induction of UPR genes, global attenuation of translation, and ER-associated protein degradation. If the protein folding defect is not corrected, cells undergo apoptosis [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We found no previous references in the scientific literature to the association between the response to unfolded proteins and radioiodine resistance in thyroid cancer. However, induction of UPR was reported to promote radiosensibilization in radioresistant colorectal cancer cells [

<p>Highly complementary information about noble metal-based OER catalysts can be extracted from O K-edge XAS data. By comparing spectra for rutile-type IrO
 <sub>2</sub>, and those for more catalytically active amorphous and Ir-deficient IrO
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> samples, substantial differences were observed by Pfeifer et al. (

 </sup> By employing 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> simulations of XAS spectra, the additional feature at 529 eV was identified as originating from holes in O 2p-states resulting in formally a 1- oxidation state for the oxygen species. These species are believed to be highly active and directly involved in the formation of Oâ€“O bonds during OER. In a follow-up work, authors reported the formation of these species (and corresponding feature in the O K-edge XAS) also under an applied potential at the Ir electrode.

 </sup> An alternative interpretation was, however, proposed by Frati et al., who suggested that the observed changes in the O K-edge XANES can be rather attributed to the formation of Ir
 <sup>5+</sup> species in the presence of Ir vacancies.

<p>These questions regarding hippocampal contributions are interesting. Considering the dissection strategy of targeting pallium (due to challenge of isolating cortex), the primordial hippocampus was included and differences in this structure could contribute to our differential expression findings. While there may be some impact from structures such as early hippocampus (or alternatively ventral telencephalon as raised earlier), we believe the general findings do strongly implicate the pallium/cortex as the major source of DE signatures and importantly, our IHC results verified phenotypes in the developing cortex. Future studies examining region-specific differences across non-cortical structures are certainly of interest, though we believe they are outside the scope of our study. Nonetheless, we recognize the limits of manual dissection and bulk tissue strategies, and have added a clarifying sentence into the Discussion â€“ see [5b] response text.</p>

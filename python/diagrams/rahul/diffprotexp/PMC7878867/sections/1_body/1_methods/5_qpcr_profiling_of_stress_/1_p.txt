0: A total of eight stress-responsive miRNAs and 12 target genes were selected for qPCR analysis in DBA Artemis and DBA Aurora.
1: These candidates were selected for their predicted biological functions associated with stress response and plant growth, potentially contributing to the transgenerational effects.
2: cDNA was synthesised from treated total RNA samples with the MystiCq microRNA cDNA Synthesis Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described 27,  33. qPCR analysis was carried out on a ViiA7 Real-Time PCR machine using the PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix as previously described 27,  33.
3: The relative gene expression level was calculated using the durum wheat GAPDH gene as the reference gene.
4: Data was represented as mean  SE (three biological replicates).
5: The three biological replicates were randomly chosen from the six biological replicates used for pooling in next-generation sequencing libraries.
6: One-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance across treatment groups at  P < 0.05 with the l.s.d.
7: value (least significant difference).
8: Different letters (a  c) denote the statistical difference across the treatment groups.
9: Primer sequences are included in Supplementary Table  S3.

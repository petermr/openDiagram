<p>The former results demonstrate the complexity of the processes taking place at the surface of Pt electrodes. By following the time-dependency of the WL intensity, Pt–Pt and Pt–O coordination numbers (

  <xref rid="fig34" ref-type="fig">34</xref>
 </xref>a), it was observed that several seconds are needed until these parameters reach their stationary values after potential changes are applied, due to the final time needed for charge transfer, Pt–O bond formation and rearrangement of Pt atoms within the NPs. Moreover, the characteristic times (or, alternatively, rate constants 
 <italic>k</italic>) for these processes, corresponding to different elementary steps in ORR,

 </xref>b, were found to be different. In particular, it was found that the changes in the Pt–Pt coordination number are slower than those in the Pt–O CNs,

 </sup> By comparing the time-dependent results for different Pt-based catalysts, the characteristic times of the changes in the XAFS-derived coordination numbers were found to be linearly correlated with the specific activity and the durability of the catalysts (

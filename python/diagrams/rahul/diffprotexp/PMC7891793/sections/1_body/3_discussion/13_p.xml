<p>= RSV infection causes oxidative stress in lung tissue [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and potently induces activation of cytoplasmic mitogen- and stress-related kinase 1 (MSK1) by increased reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This oxidative stress itself is likely a strong regulator of gene expression, including upregulation of the TLR3 and NF-ÎºB-related genes [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our work is consistent with the concept of oxidative stress as a potent marker of the viral infection that leads to cytokine responses.

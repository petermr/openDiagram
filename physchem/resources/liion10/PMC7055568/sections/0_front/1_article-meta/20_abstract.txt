0: Herein, the advantages and ionic transport mechanisms of solid composite electrolyte (SCE) as well as the relationship between morphology of ceramic fillers and ionic conductivity of SCE are reviewed.
1: Recent progress and strategies to settle interfacial issues for highperformance allsolidstate lithium metal batteries with SCE are also concluded and future research directions of SCEs are proposed.

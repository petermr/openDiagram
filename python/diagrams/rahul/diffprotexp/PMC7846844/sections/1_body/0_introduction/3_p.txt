0: Long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) is defined as RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides 7.
1: Many studies have revealed the potential effects of lincRNA between different pig species on skeletal muscle development.
2: Zou et al 8. found that multiple lincRNAs in Yorkshire pigs and Wunahua pigs may cause differences in growth and meat quality between the two breeds in unknown ways.
3: Liang Zhou et al 9. found that Linc-YY1 can promote myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration by interacting with the transcription factor YY1.
4: However, the function of most lincRNAs in muscle is still unclear.
5: This study focuses on key lincRNAs and explores its possible effects on pig skeletal muscle development by analyzing the regulatory pathways it may participate in.

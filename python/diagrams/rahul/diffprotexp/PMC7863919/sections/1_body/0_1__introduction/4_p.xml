<p>The aim of this study was to compare the profiles of microRNA (miRNA) expression in corticotroph tumors stratified according to 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutational status and to determine the potential role of differential miRNA expression. Moreover, mutations of another deubiquitinase-encoding gene (
 <italic>USP48</italic>) contribute to pathogenesis of some 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors [

 <xref rid="B18-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mutations of both genes were determined and taken into account in data analysis.

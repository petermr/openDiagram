 <p>4) The correlation in Figure 3B is only slightly higher than the one in Figure 3A, while the finding of opposite correlations depending on the location of the PAS used is interesting, these data do not support the interpretation. I would recommend moving this section to the supplements (supplemental figures) and keeping in the main text only the results of the analysis focused on genes differential expressed between species. Even in this case the trends aren't supported by strong results, so the test should be careful as to not overinterpret suggestive patterns. I would recommend to use Spearman's correlation rather than Pearson's because it is less sensitive to outliers. I would also suggest that the authors consider a scenario where the location of the PAS influences the direction of gene expression change, thus using a logistic model to test this hypothesis. Similar considerations apply also to the analysis of differential APA and differential protein expression.</p>

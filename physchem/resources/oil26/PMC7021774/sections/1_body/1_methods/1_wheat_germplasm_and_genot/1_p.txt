0: Three sets of wheat germplasm were used to assess ToxB sensitivity and for genetic mapping.
1: (1) Parents of wheat genetic mapping populations: the eight founders of the NIAB Elite MAGIC population (Mackay et al.
2: 2014), eight founders of the BMW MAGIC population (Stadlmeier et al.
3: 2018), and 14 additional founders of various bi-parental populations and key germplasm stocks from hexaploid and tetraploid wheat (Table  1).
4: (2) A wheat association mapping (AM) panel consisting of 480 predominantly UK, French and German varieties drawn from historic collections and National Lists, encompassing varieties released between 1916 and 2007 (Downie et al.
5: 2018; Supplementary Table 1).
6: (3) The NIAB Elite MAGIC population: eight founders and 643 progeny.
7: The AM and NIAB Elite MAGIC populations were previously genotyped using an Illumina iSelect 90,000 feature single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) wheat array (Wang et al.
8: 2014).
9: The AM panel data matrix consisted of 22,237 polymorphic SNPs (minor allele frequency  6%) across 480 varieties (data available at  https://www.niab.com/pages/id/326/Resources), while the MAGIC data matrix consisted of 20,643 polymorphic SNPs across 643 progeny (Mackay et al.
10: 2014; Gardner et al.
11: 2016).

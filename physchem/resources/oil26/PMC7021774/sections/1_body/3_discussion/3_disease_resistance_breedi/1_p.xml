<p id="Par31">The eight 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> races identified are differentiated by their expression of one or a combination of the three known effectors (Lamari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). Thus, in the context of effector sensitivity, 
 <italic>Ptr</italic>â€“wheat interactions will depend on the allelic states at the respective loci in both the host and pathogen. It should be noted that it is likely that additional effectors remain to be discovered, and that other factors also contribute to host resistance to 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> infection. Furthermore, work in another necrotrophic fungal pathogen of wheat, 
 <italic>P. nodorum</italic>, has shown that the expression of one effector can suppress that of another (Phan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>). Therefore, a more complex genetic control may result from an otherwise seemingly simple underlying system. For example, while we find Chinese Spring to be insensitive to ToxB, this variety does show varying resistance/susceptibility to different 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> isolates. Indeed, Tadesse et al (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2006</xref>) used a 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> isolate found to be virulent on Chinese Spring to screen germplasm generated by crossing 100 synthetic hexaploid wheat accessions to Chinese Spring nullisomic lines, identifying several resistance loci on chromosome 3D. Ultimately, the best strategies for increasing resistance to the widest diversity of 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> strains will likely involve combined approaches, in which removal of effector sensitivity loci is complemented by genetic mapping of tan spot resistance QTL and use of linked markers for marker-assisted selection of favourable alleles.

<p>A significant improvement in ionic conductivity is achieved by chalcogenide-based material, which is 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for MgSc
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub> at ambient temperature. Despite the promising conductivity, its high electronic conductivity hinders its application as a suitable solid conductor. Further modifications are necessary to decrease the electronic conductivity and increase the ionic conductivity at the same time.

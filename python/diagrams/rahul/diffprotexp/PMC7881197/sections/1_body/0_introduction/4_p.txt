0: Two inorganic arsenic compoundsarsenic trioxide and arsenic hexoxide (AS 4O 6; hereafter, AS6)have already been used or developed as anticancer medications.
1: Arsenic trioxide (AS 2O 3) has been developed into a commercially available cancer drug to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with few and relatively mild adverse effects 15,   16.
2: It works by targeting diverse cellular pathways that lead to apoptosis and myeloid differentiation in APL, although its mechanisms have not been completely known 16.
3: Some studies suggest that arsenic trioxide treatment leads to apoptosis as a result of Jun N-terminal kinase suppression and collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials to activate caspase 3 17,  18.
4: Another study has proposed that arsenic trioxide at low concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 M promotes cell differentiation by degrading promyelocytic leukemia protein-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RAR) oncoprotein 19,  20 while inducing apoptosis at higher concentrations between1 and 2 M 21.
5: It is interesting that arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid exhibit synergic effects to cure APL 22.
6: For example, in one study, 2-year event-free survival rates were 97% for an arsenic trioxide-all-trans retinoic acid group and 86% for an all-trans retinoic acid/chemotherapy group 23.
7: In addition, arsenic trioxide eradicates latent human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by reactivating latent provirus in CD4 + T cells and increasing immune responses in HIV-1 patients 24.
8: This study showed that arsenic trioxide treatment downregulates CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors of CD4 + T cells that can interfere with viral infection and rebound 24.

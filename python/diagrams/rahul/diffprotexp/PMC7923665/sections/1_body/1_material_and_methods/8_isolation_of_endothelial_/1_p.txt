0: Endothelial cells were isolated from fresh human brain AVM tissues and control tissues.
1: Briefly, surgically excised fresh tissue samples were collected in ice cold PBS and finely minced with sterile scissors.
2: Finely chopped tissue was transferred to 5 ml of 1 mg/ml collagenase/dispase solution and allowed to stand at 37 C for 45 min.
3: Later, single-cell suspension was made by aspirating the digested tissue with a 5-ml pipette.
4: The cell suspension was passed through a 70-l cell strainer, and the strainer was washed with medium + FBS to stop the enzymatic action.
5: The cell suspension was then pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated.
6: The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 0.1% BSA in PBS and transferred to three 1 ml eppendoff tubes.
7: Subsequently, the cell suspension was incubated with 22.5 l of anti-CD31 conjugated dynabeads and tumbled at room temperature for 12 min.
8: After tumbling, the beads were kept in the magnetic particle separator, and the supernatant was removed.
9: Later, magnetic beads were washed five times in 0.1% BSA.
10: Finally, RNA was isolated from the enriched cells.

0: Paper towel treat tubes, slow feeders, and rubber toys filled with food were all chosen to decelerate consumption of food, because the animal had to manipulate the device with their tongue, nose, and front feet to ingest the food.
1: Slow feeders consisted of commercially available bowls with plastic obstructions.
2: Cricket containers provided the aardvarks with the opportunity to manipulate an object to gain access to live prey in a semi-naturalistic manner.
3: We chose the warthog ( Phacochoerus africanus) scent, as we thought this scent may be relevant to the aardvarks, as previously, warthogs were housed in the same building as the aardvarks, and warthogs and aardvarks share similar geographical ranges in the wild [ 24].
4: We chose to include perfume and Boomer balls  (Grayslake, IL, USA) as exploring enrichment because they were commonly used enrichment for the aardvarks.
5: The last exploring enrichment, a pool with water, was chosen because the female pair of aardvarks were observed playing in their water bowl and wading through shallow water when offered.
6: We thought access to a larger body of water might increase locomotion and investigation near the pool.
7: Aardvarks were provided with at least three identical items each day to avoid competition for enrichment items, with one exception.
8: The pool was large enough that one aardvark could not monopolize the use of the pool, so only a single pool was provided.
9: The number of enrichment items was consistent from week to week, and the amount of food provided was consistent among the foraging days.

2: The data were stored and maintained by the relational database management system (RDBMS) server, with the SQL language used for data management.
3: The search can be customized easily by the user, combining specific proteins with hosts or selecting a specific viral strain or geographic origin.
4: The database also provides step-by-step links to instruct the user how to search.

Sample solution contained 125&#160;&#956;L (1&#160;mM) DPPH, 375&#160;&#956;L ethanol and 500&#160;&#956;L of test-solution (essential oils or catechin with different concentrations). In the control solution the test-solution was replaced by ethanol. The absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 514&#160;nm.

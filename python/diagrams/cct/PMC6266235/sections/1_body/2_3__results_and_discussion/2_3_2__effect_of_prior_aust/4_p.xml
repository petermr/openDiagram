 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f006">Figure 6</xref> reveals the martensite transformation rate vs martensite transformed volume fraction. At the peak temperature of 1320 °C, the transformation rate from austenite to martensite was measured to be a maximum of 0.60, while at the peak temperature of 850 °C, the transformation rate from austenite to martensite was measured to be a maximum of 0.98. The transformation rate is closely related to the transformation start temperature and transformation temperature range. The higher start transformation temperature often leads to a relatively high transformation rate. Therefore, because the martensite transformation temperature was higher at the peak temperature of 850 °C than that at 1320 °C, as well as the grain size was smaller at the peak temperature of 850 °C than that at 1320 °C, FGHAZ expressed the relatively higher transformation rate.

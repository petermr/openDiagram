<p>pcDNA3.1-KPNA3, pcDNA3.1-KPNA4, and different 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic> truncates including pcDNA3.1-F2-del_1-40aa and pcDNA3.1-F2-del_61-114aa were constructed by a CloneExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme biotech, Nanjing, China). The primers used for these constructors were listed in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. pcDNA3.1-F1 and pcDNA3.1-F2 were stored in our laboratory. The sgRNAs targeting the FAdV-4 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>, and the KPNA3 and KPNA4 genes were designed using CRISPR guide RNA designing website (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.benchling.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.benchling.com</ext-link>) and cloned into the CRISPR/Cas9 vector lentiCRISPR v2. The sequences of the sgRNAs were listed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The donor plasmid with homologous arm (HA) at both ends flanking the truncated 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic> was constructed by PCR, then assembled as HAL-F2-HAR, and finally cloned into the pMD19 simple vector.

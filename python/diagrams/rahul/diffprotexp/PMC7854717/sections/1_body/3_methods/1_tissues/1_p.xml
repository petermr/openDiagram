<p id="Par49">Four adult (18–19 months, 32–34 g) male C57Bl/6j mice, purchased from Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Wilmington, MA, USA) were used to profile separately the myocardia transcriptomes of each heart chamber. The study was limited to only males because the female transcriptome depends on the estrogen level

 </sup> and changes during the estrous cycle

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, a complete study on females not only would quadruplicate the work to profile the heart chambers of animals synchronized in each of the cycle phases, but would be affected by the non uniform estrogen level.

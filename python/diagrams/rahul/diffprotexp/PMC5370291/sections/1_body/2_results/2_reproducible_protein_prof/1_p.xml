<p>First, we assessed whether the protein extraction results in consistent protein profile. Cells were incubated with TNFα at 10 μg/mL for 24 h, and then the crude proteins were extracted, separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and observed by CBB staining (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). The resulting protein bands showed similar pattern among the three independent experimental replicates, suggesting that profiles of extracted proteins were nonsignificantly changed among the three replicates of control and TNFα treatment. The gels were then subjected to in-gel digestion for peptide extraction and following LC-MS/MS analysis for protein identification and MS/MS spectra collection. The number of proteins identified in each experiment was presented in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B. These data suggested that each experimental replicate was performed in a highly reproducible manner. In addition, of the 1142 and 1042 proteins identified in control and TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B), only minor unique proteins (9 - 14) were identified in single experiment among the three replicates, implying that the protein identification for each replicate was highly reproducible and the subsequent spectra counting for semi-quantitation basing on statistical analysis could be confident. These results were consistent with the negligible change of protein patterns on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), showing that the protein expression profile among the experimental replicates was highly congenial. Combining the three experimental replicates, we observed that 852 proteins were identified in both control and TNFα treatment, with 290 and 190 exclusively identified in the control and the TNFα treatment group, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Collectively, our proteomic results showed that TNFα treatment contributed to a differential protein expression profile of HepG2 cell.

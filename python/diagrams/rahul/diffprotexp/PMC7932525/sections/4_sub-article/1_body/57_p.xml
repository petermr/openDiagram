<p>ï¿½ Nitrogenase oxidation is an interesting and important question, and we are also puzzled by the question. In the nonheterocystous cyanobacteria, the O2 evolved during photosynthesis and nitrogenase was confirmed to discrete in subcellular bodies identified as cyanophycin granules (Finzi-Hart et al., PNAS April 14, 2009,106 (15) 6345-6350;

In the heterocystous cyanobacteria, we believe that they have their similar or unique oxygen suppression mechanism under nitrogen deficiency. On the other hand, we observed that the filaments tend to float in liquid medium when nitrogen supply is sufficient (Figure A); in contrast, most of the filaments tend to sink in the culture solution, whereas some small particles were found to be suspended (Figure B). Thus, the increase of whole filaments density (which sink in the culture solution) should be benefit to prevent nitrogenase oxidation under the conditions of nitrogen deprivation. Our study results are consistent with the phenomenon of water bloom under eutrophication (Ekvall et al, 2013). Because oxygen suppression mechanism under nitrogen deficiency is only our own conjecture, and there is no systematic and credible experimental evidence, we did not write the above conjecture in the discussion.

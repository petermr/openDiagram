<p>As detailed in the preceding sections, ASIC3 is not only the most highly sensitive ASIC subunit to extracellular protons, but is also implicated in a plethora of physiological and pathophysiological conditions that in many cases are directly or indirectly associated with pain. Consequently, there has been significant interest in developing subunit selective ASIC modulators. To date, 49 endogenous and exogenous (
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) ASIC3 modulators have been identified that either cause a change in ASIC3 expression or function; excluding the numerous ligand-based screened synthetic Merck compounds, which are discussed in detail in the Amiloride Analogues section. For some of these modulators, the putative binding sites on ASIC3 have been suggested through in silico modeling and/or mutagenesis studies (

<p id="Par12">Mussels brought into captivity showed increased expression of transcripts coding for proteins involved in the stress response (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These included many molecular chaperones such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) in the HSP90, HSP70, and HSP10 families. Many of these transcripts were assigned the GO term “ATP binding”, which was significantly over-represented among up-regulated transcripts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Other GO terms included “integral component of membrane”, “nucleus”, and “mitochondrion” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Transcripts coding for antioxidant enzymes were also found to be up-regulated and included superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxiredoxin, and glutathione 
 <italic>S</italic>-transferase (although a transcript variant of the latter was also found to be down-regulated). Over-represented GO terms that included some of these transcripts included “oxidoreductase activity” and “transferase activity” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).

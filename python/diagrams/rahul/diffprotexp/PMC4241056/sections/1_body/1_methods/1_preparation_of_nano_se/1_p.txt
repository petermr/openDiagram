0: Nano-Se was prepared according to the previous method described by Zhang et al.
1: [ 21] through the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the redox system of selenite and glutathione (GSH).
2: In the present study, 2-mg BSA was dissolved in 4-ml 25-mM GSH and then 1-ml 25-mM sodium selenite was added.
3: The pH value was adjusted to 7.2 using sodium hydroxide.
4: The sizes of red elemental Se was determined using the Mastersizer particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK), with the average sizes being 22.19 nm as nano-Se.

<p>To investigate the TME status in patients with HNSCC and the underlying mechanism of prognostic influence, a series of analyses have been conducted around the relationship between TME and prognosis. In the present study, we used ESTIMATE software to analyze immune and stromal componentsâ€™ scores in tumor tissues. The relationships between microenvironment and tumor prognosis in HNSCC were further explored through prognostic-related Cox regression analysis and TME-associated protein interaction networks (PPI) to search for predictive hub genes significantly associated with TME. CIBERSORT software was used to analyze the relative fraction of 22 immune cells in tumor tissues. The relationships between the expression of hub genes and the fraction of these tumor-infiltrating immune cells were also further analyzed.</p>

0: A stock solution of  T. bovei essential oil was used to prepare stock solutions in methanol and Trolox, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.
1: Each of these stock solutions was diluted in methanol to prepare 12 working solutions with the following concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 100 g/ml.
2: A fresh solution of prepared DPPH (0.002%w/v) was mixed with methanol and with each of the above mentioned working solutions at 1:1:1 ratio.
3: In addition, a negative control solution was prepared by mixing the above mentioned DPPH solution with methanol in 1:1 ratio.
4: Then, all of these solutions were incubated at room temperature in a dark cabinet for 30 min.
5: The optical density of these solutions was determined by using spectrophotometer at a wave length of 517 nm using methanol as the blank solution.
6: The antioxidant activity of the essential oil and Trolox were determined using the following formula:

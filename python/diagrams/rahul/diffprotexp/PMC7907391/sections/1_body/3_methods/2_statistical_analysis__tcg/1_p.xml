 <sub>2</sub> transformed. The cohorts from GTEx and TCGA were matched based on anatomical site, in total there were 20 sites. Mean log
 <sub>2</sub> TPM expression of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> was calculated for each tissue for both databases. The tissues were then ranked using the R function rank, 1 being the highest expression, 20 the lowest. The ranks were visualized using ggplot2. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to compare 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> expression for tissues of interest, normal tissues (GTEx) compared to cancerous tissues (TCGA). Overall expression of 
 <italic>ACE, TMPRSS2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> was visualised for all tissues from TCGA and TARGET. Tukeys test was performed in R to determine significance.

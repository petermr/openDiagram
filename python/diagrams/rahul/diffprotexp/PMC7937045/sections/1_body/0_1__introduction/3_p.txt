0: Quantitative proteomics can determine relative changes in protein content.
1: Based on this technology, differences in protein abundance between healthy individuals and patients with cancer can be defined to identify disease markers.
2: Proteomics has been widely used in human disease research [ 21].
3: The postlabeling analysis of proteins using the iTRAQ8-plex technology, combined with Data Dependent Acquisition (DADA), is currently the standard labeling method used in quantitative proteomics [ 18,  22,  23].
4: The iTRAQ8-plex technology is also a commonly used quantitative method, which can be applied to quantitative analysis in proteomics research [ 24,  25].

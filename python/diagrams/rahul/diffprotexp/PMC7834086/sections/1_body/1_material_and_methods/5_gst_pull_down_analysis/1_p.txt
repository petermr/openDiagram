0: The technique of GST pull-down was used to determine the interaction between PirB and histone H4, as described previously [ 25].
1: First,  P. vannamei histone H4 (GenBank #: MH311299.1) was cloned with a His-tag and expressed in the pET-32a plasmid (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) as described in subsection 2.2.
2: Next, beads coupled with rGST-PirB were incubated for 0.5 h at room temperature with supernatant extracted from the pET-32a- Pvhistone H4 expressed in  E. coli BL21.
3: Samples were then centrifuged and washed.
4: Finally, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, as described in subsection 2.2, with mouse anti-His primary antibody (1:3000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China).

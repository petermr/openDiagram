0: Isobaric-tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technology is an isobaric labelling method used in quantitative proteomics by tandem mass spectrometry to determine the amount of proteins from different sources in a single experiment.
1: It uses stable isotope labelled molecules to perform accurate qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of sample proteins or peptide fragments.
2: It can make an absolute or relative content comparison of proteins from different samples to identify differential proteins and functions [ 10].
3: The iTRAQ method has good quantification and high reproducibility and can scientifically reveal the dynamic changes of intracellular proteins in different physiological states.
4: At present, studies on rice proteomics are rapidly emerging.
5: The expression pattern of various tissues, organs, and sub-cells have been studied to identify the specificity of each tissue and organ in various growth and developmental stages of rice [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
6: Mutant and hormone-induced proteomic studies have been conducted to unveil relevant genetic information and hormone signalling patterns [ 16, 17].
7: The adverse effects of stress on rice growth and rice recovery have also been identified over time.
8: The differentially expressed proteins have already been quantified and compared in response to environmental stress and adaptation processes [ 18, 19, 20].
9: However, limited studies can be found on the quality and nutritional aspects of rice.

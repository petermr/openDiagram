<p id="par0230">The developing grains of HD3086 showed prominent isoforms of amylases under HS. Though, minimum variations in the intensity of the bands were observed under HS (
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>b). BT-Schomburgk showed gradual appearance of multiple bands of amylases under differential HS treatments. The intensity of band was observed maximum in response to T
 <sub>2</sub>. The intensity of bands in harvested seeds showed maximum amylases activity in HD3086, as compared to BT-Schomburgk under HS (
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>c). The appearance and number of bands in response to treatment was observed more or less same in both the

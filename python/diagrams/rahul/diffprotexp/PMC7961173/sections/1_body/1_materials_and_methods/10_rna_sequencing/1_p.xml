<p id="Par18">At the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core, mRNA concentrations and quality were evaluated using a Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent; Santa Clara, CA, USA). Stranded sequencing libraries for RNA isolated from HTR-8/SVneo cells were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (lllumina; San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were sequenced (on one lane) using single-end 50 cycle reads on a HiSeq 4000 sequencer (lllumina). The average total number of reads per sample for HTR-8/SVneo cells was 26,515,09. Stranded sequencing libraries for RNA isolated from villous explants were prepared with the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Kit with RiboErase (Roche; Basel, Switzerland). Libraries were multiplexed (on two lanes) and sequenced using single-end 50 cycle reads on a HiSeq 4000 sequencer (lllumina). The average total number of reads per sample was 13,368,165.</p>

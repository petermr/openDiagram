<p>Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using agarose beads coupled to nanobodies recognizing the GFP (GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup>, ChromoTek), and following the protocol suggested by the provider. 500 µL of P3 membranes diluted to 2 mg/mL of total protein concentration were solubilized in solubilization buffer containing 10 mg/mL of DDM and 2 mg/mL CHS, during 1 h at 20°C. After incubation, membranes were ultra-centrifuged at 125,000 
 <italic>× g</italic> for 90 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was incubated for 1 h and 4°C with gentle rotation with 25 µL of GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads, previously equilibrated in washing buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg/mL DDM, 0.04 mg/mL CHS, 10% (v/v) glycerol). After incubation, the flow-through was removed by centrifuging the sample at 100 
 <italic>× g</italic> for 30 s. The beads were then washed by adding 500 µL of ice-cold washing buffer 1 followed by centrifugation at 100 
 <italic>× g</italic> for 30 sec. A second wash was done with 500 µL of washing buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg/mL DDM and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Proteins bound to the GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads were eluted by adding 50 µL of 0.2 M glycine buffer pH 2.5 followed by centrifugation at 100 
 <italic>× g</italic> for 30 sec. The low-pH of the elution was quickly neutralized by adding 5 µL of 1 M Tris-base pH 10.4. This elution step was repeated one more time and samples were analyzed by western blot.

0: A. borkumensis SK2 T is a model strain of a group of organisms known as obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB) which grow on a highly restricted spectrum of substrates, predominantly alkanes and their derivatives, with carbon chain length from  nC 9 to at least  nC 32 (Schneiker  et al.,2006; Yakimov  et al.,1998;  2007; Naether  et al.,2013).
1: Alcanivorax spp.
2: are found in low abundances in unpolluted marine environments but can multiply and grow rapidly in oilpolluted waters, where they can constitute 80%90% of the microbial community (Harayama  et al.,1999; Kasai  et al.,  2002; Syutsubo  et al.,2001).
3: Previous reports have also shown  Alcanivorax spp.
4: become abundant in field and mesocosm experiments involving the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to stimulate microbial degradation of oil (Cappello  et al.,2007; McKew  et al.,2007).

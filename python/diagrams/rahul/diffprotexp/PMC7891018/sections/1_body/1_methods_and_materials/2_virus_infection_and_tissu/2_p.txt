0: The virus was diluted tenfold with a virus dilution solution (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1%BSA) [ 14], and 100 L of virus solution was added to the cells, followed by a 1-h incubation period in a cell culture incubator at 37 C, with 5% CO 2 and saturated humidity.
1: After the virus and cells were incubated for 1 h, the virusserum mixture was replaced with 5 mL of viral growth medium.
2: After culture for 72 h [ 15], the median TCID (TCID 50) was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench [ 16].

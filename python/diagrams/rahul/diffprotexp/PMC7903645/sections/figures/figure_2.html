 <caption> Enriched Gene Ontology (GO) categories ( a–c) and KEGG pathways ( d) of genes in cervical insufficiency. GO comparison of biological processes ( a), cellular components ( b), and molecular functions ( c) enriched in genes differentially expressed in women with cervical insufficiency vs controls. Enriched Gene Ontology (GO) categories ( d-f) and KEGG pathways ( g) of genes among women with cervical insufficiency who delivered preterm (CI-preterm) vs term (CI-term). GO comparison of biological processes ( a), cellular components ( b), and molecular functions ( c) enriched in genes differentially expressed in CI-term group vs CI-preterm group. All represented GO terms are significantly enriched, with an adjusted P value &lt; 0.01. CI, cervical insufficiency </caption>

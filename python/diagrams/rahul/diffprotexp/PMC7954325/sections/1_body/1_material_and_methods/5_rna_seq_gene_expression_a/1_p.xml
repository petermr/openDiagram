<p>The reference genome sequence information of 
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> Group Phureja DM1-3 and the FPKM values of all the representative transcripts were retrieved from Spud DB. The FPKM values were calculated by Cufflinks (v1.3.0) using v3.4 in the Spud DB database representative models for complete annotation (

The relative intensity levels (heat map) and linkage hierarchical cluster analysis were performed using multiple experiments viewer (MeV 4.9.0) with differential gene expression of 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> under various stress conditions [

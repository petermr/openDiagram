<p>It should be stated that new methods need to be developed in the future to evaluate the kinetic data from DSC heating curves. All of the existing methods are based on the assumption that the transformed fraction of alloying elements is independent of the varying heating rates [

 <xref rid="B151-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. This basic assumption obviously does not hold, and this is particularly the case for heating rate variations over a wide dynamic range. This leads to the need for developing new methods in the future for the evaluation of kinetic parameters, a problem which could be solved by kinetic modelling. Some available models even use a combination of both precipitation and dissolution to model the whole DSC heating curve from room temperature up to the solvus temperature (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B156-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]). In the future, these models will need to implement the kinetic suppression of diffusion-controlled reactions.

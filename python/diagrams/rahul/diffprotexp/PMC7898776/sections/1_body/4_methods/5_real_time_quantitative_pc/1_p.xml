<p id="Par51">We searched the cDNA sequences from transcriptome data of mandarin fish, designed the primers with Primer 5.0 software (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The potential housekeeping gene according to the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], 
 <italic>beta-actin</italic>, 
 <italic>b2m</italic>, 
 <italic>rpl13a</italic>, and 
 <italic>hmbs</italic> were examined, and 
 <italic>Rpl13a</italic> gene was more stable and selected as the internal control. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with MyiQ™ 2 Two-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) as the methods described by Liang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The target gene expression relative to 
 <italic>rpl13a</italic> expression were calculated by the optimized comparative Ct (2
 <sup>-ΔΔCt</sup>) value method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Data with six biological replicates and three technical replicates were presented as mean ± S.E.M.

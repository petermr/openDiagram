 <caption> Identification of immune hub genes of PAAD. a Forest maps of single factor survival analysis of 11 modules of PAAD. b Dot plot showing top 10 KEGG terms in the blue module. The dot size and color intensity represent the gene count and enrichment level respectively. c Correlation between blue module feature vector and second principal component in immune landscape. d Dot plot showing enriched terms in green module. e Correlation between green module feature vector and second principal component in immune landscape. f Differential prognosis in blue module with high and low mean. g Differential prognosis in green module with high and low mean </caption>

<p>In addition to peptide toxins, certain neuropeptides have also been established as ASIC3 potentiators, but not direct activators. For example, the invertebrate abundant FMRF-amide and mammalian related neuropeptide (NP) FF (NPFF), slowed the inactivation time constant of the pH 4-evoked rASIC3 transient current, but increased the amplitude of the sustained current when applied at 50 µM [

 <sub>50</sub> of 4.23 µM (pH 6.3), as well as enhancing acid-induced pain [
 <xref rid="cit0209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. Through site-directed mutagenesis of ASIC3, RPRFa was shown to interact with the lower palm domain (the non-proton sensing domain) of ASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>] and extensive analysis identified numerous beta sheet regions of the palm domain to be involved in rASIC3 current kinetics: Leu77, Glu79, Gln269, Gln271, Arg376, Ala378, Glu380 and Glu423.

<p>From secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) conducted for the rod with a diameter of 20 mm (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), it is clear that the dendrites are Ti-rich, Cu– and Co-lean. The Be-signal in β-Ti is very week, suggesting that only a very small amount of Be is dissolved in β-Ti, a phenomenon commonly observed in Be-containing BMGCs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Since it is impossible to accurately determine the content of a light element like Be in the glass or the dendrites by microscopic techniques, we shall assume in the following that all Be is dissolved in the glassy matrix. This approximation of course has an impact on the estimated compositions of the glass and the Ti dendrites. But the SIMS results imply that this error in composition should be rather small and, after all, should not affect the concept of a quasi-equilibrium we want to put forward here. The other elements dissolved in the dendrites were measured by means of electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) with WDS for all samples excluding the 2 mm rod due to its small particle size. The values are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The composition of β-Ti in the rods with a diameter of 10 mm and 20 mm as well as in the 100 g ingot are almost identical. The concentration of Ti and Zr is higher and that of Cu and Co is lower compared with the composition of β-Ti in the ϕ6 mm rod.

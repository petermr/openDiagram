<p id="p0170">The practical viability of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode was further demonstrated with a prolonged cycling test based on a higher current density of 2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> in a 200 μL electrolyte of 2 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> and 0.2 M MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). A commercially applicable battery cycle life (80% of capacity retention) of 2,000 discharge-charge cycles is presented. Even after 5,000 cycles, the battery still shows decent capacity retention of approximately 63% (compared with the 10
 <sup>th</sup> discharge capacity). As mentioned in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Introduction</xref> section, as the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> additive is also active during cycling, it should also be considered for the evaluation of the overall capacity of the cathode. From the practical utility aspect, the final objective is to stabilize the battery performance with minimum additional Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>. Using a smaller electrolyte volume of 70 μL, we then investigate the capacity retention of batteries in 2 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> with five different concentrations of MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> additives (from 0 to 0.2 M as demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B) based on the total Mn compound mass (i.e., MnO
 <sub>2</sub> in the solid cathode and MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>·H
 <sub>2</sub>O added in the electrolyte). As indicated in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C, due to its good cathode recovery capability, the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode enabled a more stable operation of rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries. With a low MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> additive concentration of only 0.02 M (corresponding to an atomic percentage of 12% of the Mn additive in the electrolyte), an average capacity fading rate of 0.23% per cycle was achieved between the 7
 <sup>th</sup> and 100
 <sup>th</sup> cycles, much lower than that without MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> additive (0.35% per cycle, 1.5 times faster fading). We further demonstrate that batteries with a gel-polymer electrolyte and a cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode also presented decent performance and a similar trend of capacity increase during a 100-cycle stability test (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S19</xref>). This indicates that the cobalt-catalyzed deposition strategy can also be applied to a hydrogel electrolyte battery system.

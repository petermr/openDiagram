<italic>v</italic>) was incubated for 12&#8211;16 h in the dark at room temperature, and was diluted, before use, with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in order to obtain an absorbance at 734 nm of 0.7 &#177; 0.02. Fifty microliters (50 &#181;L) of sample solution (range 300&#8211;50 &#181;g/mL) was added to 1 mL of reaction mixture and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 6 min; the absorbance was then recorded at 734 nm using an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601). The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).

<p id="Par18">Proof of this concept comes from our observation that upregulated MKK3 protein expression, in turn, correlated with both p38 protein expression (p38) and activation (phospho-p38) indicating strong epigenetic reinforcement of the MKK3/p38 axis in CNFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Two expected results of p38 activation are activation of the MKK3/p38/EGR1 inflammatory cascade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and changes in chromatin conformation mediated through the SWI-SNF complex family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Relevant to the role of EGR1 in the pro-inflammatory response, it is intriguing that in our unbiased gene set enrichment analysis we identified inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels and phospholipase D signaling as the most significant altered signaling pathways related to DMRs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), granted EGR1, itself, was not found to be differentially methylated (data not shown). Pain is a constant feature of CNFs and PNFs leading to significant morbidity. Pain signaling in nerve tumors is not well understood and is difficult to manage. These data identify a potentially novel mechanism for epigenetic regulation of pain signaling in nerve tumors and a targetable signaling axis in MKK3/p38.

 <uri xlink:href="https://sarscovidb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://sarscovidb.org/</uri>), a public database containing all DEGs identified in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 samples, manually developed and checked, with a friendly interface that is easy to navigate. This database will help researchers worldwide, and general users, to speed up the research and understanding of the molecular impact of COVID-19 and possible clinical outcomes.

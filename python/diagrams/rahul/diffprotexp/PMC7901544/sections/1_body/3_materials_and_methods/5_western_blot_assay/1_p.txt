0: The LMH cells transfected with plasmids or infected with FAdV were collected and lysed in lysis buffer with PMSF, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors.
1: The lysates were boiled in the loading buffer, and was then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (GE Healthcare Life sciences, Freiburg, Germany).
2: After blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST for 2 h at room temperature (RT), the membranes were reacted with the corresponding antibodies at 4C overnight.
3: After being washed with PBST for three times, the membrane was incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT.
4: After another three washes, the membranes were developed with chemiluminescent reagents and imaged with an automatic imaging system (Tanon 5200).

<p>We focused on extensive validation of the RelA and IRF7 transcription factors, master regulators of the IIR [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Previous mechanistic and single-molecule work has shown that most components of the NFκB pathway are subject to alternative splicing and that these isoforms are induced by pathway activation (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). For example, an AS product of the IKKγ/NEMO signaling adapter of IKK skips exon 5, known as IKKγ∆. Expression of IKKγ∆ alters the signalsome, enabling it to couple viral replication to NFκB activation, but inhibits IRF3 activation, resulting in an impaired IFN response [

With regard to RelA, previous work has shown that mRNA encoding an alternative splice acceptor site located 30 nt into exon 8 encodes p65Δ, a protein lacking a component of the DNA-binding Rel homology domain, required for association with p50 and for DNA binding [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Although we do not observe p65∆ in our analysis, p65∆ appears to be a major transcript in pre-B cells and may be developmentally regulated [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Our data extend the understanding of inducible mRNA events to include processes of cryptic exon inclusion, exon occlusion, and intron retention of the RelA gene. Our work is foundational for leading to a deeper understanding of the effects of mRNA processing on RelA signaling in the IIR.

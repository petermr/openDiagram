0: After the optimized concentrations of the different parameters were determined as above, a topical 4-MU treatment application was formulated using the optimal concentrations of 4-MU, propylene glycol (PG), ethanol (EtOH), and deionized water as the vehicle.
1: Validation of this formulation on skin HAS1-3 and HYAL1-2 and KIAA1199 expression and HA inhibition was performed, with experimental groups consisting of topical 4-MU treatment application, topical sham treatment application, and control/untreated animals.
2: One day prior to treatment, the skin of the mice was shaved and NairTM (Church & Dwight, Ewing, NJ, USA) was used to defoliate the dorsum of mice.
3: On the day of treatment, skin was shaved and scrubbed with alternating betadine and 70% isopropyl alcohol three times.
4: 150 l of topical drug formulation was massaged into both flanks of experimental mice twice daily for 7 days and the area of application was covered with non-adhesive OpSite  film dressing.
5: These mice received normal chow  ad libitum ( n = 6 mice, 3 females and 3 males at 78 weeks were included).
6: The sham control set of mice underwent the same treatment using a mixture of only PG, EtOH, and water (without 4-MU) ( n = 6 mice, 3 females and 3 males at 78 weeks were included).
7: Following topical applications, animals were euthanized, and skin and serum were collected, and HAS1-3, HYAL1,2 and KIAA1199 and HA levels were determined.

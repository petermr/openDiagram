<p id="Par36">We used extractSplicingSummary and extractConsequenceSummary functions to quantify gain/loss of predicted splicing events (such as exon skipping and intron retention); and gain/loss (also sensitive/insensitive, shorter/longer and switch) of predicted functional consequences (such as coding potential and domain identified), respectively.</p>

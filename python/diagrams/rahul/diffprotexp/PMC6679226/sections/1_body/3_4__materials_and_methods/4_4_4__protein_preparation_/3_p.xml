<p>The 12 “super fractions” were then run on a Dionex U3000 nano flow system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer. Each fraction was subjected to a 90-min chromatographic method employing a gradient from 2–25% ACN in 0.1% formic acid (FA) over the course of 65 min, a gradient to 50% ACN/FA for an additional 10 min, a step to 90% ACN/FA for 5 min and a 10 min re-equilibration into 2% ACN/FA. Chromatography was carried out in a “trap-and-load” format using a PicoChip source (New Objective, Woburn, MA), with the trap column C18 PepMap 100 (5 μm, 100 Å) and the separation column PicoChip REPROSIL-Pur C18-AQ (3 μm, 120 Å, 105 mm). The flow rate for the entire run was at 0.3 μL/min, and electrospray was achieved at 2.6 kV.</p>

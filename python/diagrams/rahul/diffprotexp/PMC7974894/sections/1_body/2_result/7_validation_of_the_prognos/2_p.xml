<p>In addition, to explore the independent prognostic value of prognosis-related hub RBPs in tongue cancer, we performed the Kaplan Meier-plotter method to determine the relationship between these hub RBPs and OS. A total of four of the six hub RBPs (PGK1, CYP19A1, PFKM, and ZC3H12D) were identified by Kaplan Meier-plotter server. The results of log-rank test demonstrated that PGK1, CYP19A1, PFKM, and ZC3H12D were associated with the OS in tongue cancer patients (

<p>ERH, another cell cycle protein, showed decreased expression in response to 17Î±- meT. Although the function of the protein is not well known, it has been associated to cell cycle, RNA binding/splicing and cancer processes [

 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Specifically, ERH depletion results in the loss of the mitotic motor protein, CENP-E, of the kinetochore, increasing mitosis duration. This depletion downregulates other genes involved in DNA replication and repair, suggesting that ERH is essential for chromosomal segregation and cell cycle progression [

 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Other experiments suggest that ERH underexpression may constrain tumor aggressiveness, given that ERH knockdown reduces tumor cell viability through KRAS oncogene-dependent pathways [

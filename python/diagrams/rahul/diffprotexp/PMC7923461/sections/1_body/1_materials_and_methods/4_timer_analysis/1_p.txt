0: In this experiment, we used TIMER ( https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/) algorithm to comprehensively elucidate the correlation between different types of tumors and TIICs [ 16].
1: Moreover, we performed a series of analyses to determine the expression of TUBA1C in different types of cancer and to comprehend its correlation with the abundance of TIICs.
2: These TIICs were further classified as follows: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells.
3: By using the TIMER algorithm, we performed a correlation analysis between TUBA1C, its related genes, and the markers of immune cells [ 17].
4: The expression of TUBA1C gene was plotted on the x-axis, and the expression of its related marker genes was plotted on the y-axis.

<p>The relationship between the catalyst activity and stability was explored by Danilovic et al. for thin metallic Ru and Ir films deposited by magnetron sputtering on glassy carbon substrate.

 </sup> By using linear combination analysis of Ru K-edge and Ir L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge XANES data collected under an applied potential they demonstrated that the oxidation of Ru is faster at the same potential (

 </xref>a). Moreover, the appearance of signatures of high oxidation states (&gt;4+) in the XANES spectra was found to coincide with both the onset of OER activity and also the dissolution of the deposited metals.

 </sup> The discussion of the link between stability and activity was further extended to SrRuO
 <sub>X</sub> single crystal thin films with different orientation,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref560">560</xref>
 </sup> as well as sputtered Ruâ€“Ir alloy films with different compositions and annealing pretreatments.

 </sup> In all examples, the formation of Ru and Ir species with a high oxidation state was extracted from the Ir L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge and Ru K-edge XANES data, and an inverse correlation between catalyst activity and stability was established. Analysis of spectral features at Ru L
 <sub>3,2</sub> edges can also be instrumental for tracking the changes in the oxidation state of Ru.

 </sup>, with details as follows. Synovial samples were transported in serum free media, as described above. The synovial membrane was dissected from underlying tissue then trypsinised for 1 h. Tissue was then digested in 1 mg/ml Collagenase Blend H (Sigma Aldrich) in serum free media overnight at 37 °C on a flatbed shaker. The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 100 μm cell strainer (Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged at 400×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Subsequently, the cell pellet was washed twice in serum free media and centrifuged at 400×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in serum free media. Cells were counted using a haemocytometer and the viability checked using trypan blue exclusion (Invitrogen). The optimal cell number for spin column extraction from cells was between 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>. Cells were then pelleted and homogenised.

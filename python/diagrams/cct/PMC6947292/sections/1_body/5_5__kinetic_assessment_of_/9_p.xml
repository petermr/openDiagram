<p>This novel model thereby takes into consideration soft impingement for the diffusion fields around different quench-induced particles. The necessity of taking soft impingement into account is evident from the theory and analysis of transformation data [

 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The sample was cooled in air from solution treatment and subsequently artificially aged. The quench-induced B’ - particles are nucleated on Mn,Fe-rich dispersoids. The fine needle-shaped β’’ age-hardening precipitates clearly indicate the overlapping diffusion fields of the quench-induced B’-rods, as there are clear zones that are free of age-hardening β’’ precipitates (due to the severe depletion of solutes and potentially vacancies from overlapping diffusion fields of the quench-induced B’-rods).

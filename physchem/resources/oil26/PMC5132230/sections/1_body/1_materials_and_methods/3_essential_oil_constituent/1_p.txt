0: The identification of essential oil components was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using Shimadzu equipment, MEGCs QP-2010 Plus model.
1: Column DB-5 HT, Mark J & W Scientific, 30 m long, 0.32 mm diameter, 0.10 micron Indicated film thickness, and nitrogen as carrier gas.
2: The gas chromatograph operating conditions were: an Internal pressure of 56.7 kPa column, split ratio 1:20, the column gas flow of 1.0 mL / min.
3: (210C), injector temperature 220C, the temperature detector or the interface (GC-MS) 240C.
4: The initial column temperature was 60C, followed by an increase of 3C/min.
5: up to 240C and maintained constant for 30 min.
6: The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform readings in a range of 29400 Da 0.5s, intervals with ionization energy of 70 eV.
7: It was injected 1L of each sample at a concentration of 10,000 ppm dissolved in hexane.
8: The identification of the components was based on the comparison of their Kovats index (KI) and mass spectra of each substance with the literature data.

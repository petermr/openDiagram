<p>Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disorder and is the second most common hematological malignancy diagnosed in the United States. MM is characterized by primary etiologic events involving the gain of odd numbered chromosomes seen in 50% of patients and structural variants involving rearrangement to the immunoglobulin loci. These structural variants result in the relocation of a super-enhancer in proximity to an oncogene, resulting in its over-expression. These events subdivide non-hyperdiploid MM into 5 main groups: t(4;14) (12%), t(6;14) (1%), t(11;14) (15%), t(14;16) (3%) and t(14;20) (2%).

 </sup> Despite extensive work to characterize the myeloma genome, sequencing studies have only identified 63 key driver genes.

  <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 </sup> The median number of driver events per sample is five, but in a subset of samples none are detectable suggesting that we are missing drivers. Missing drivers may either be located in the non-coding genome or involve a mechanism that is difficult to demonstrate. Alternative splicing is one such mechanism that has the potential to be a significant driver of disease.

 </sup> It is estimated that 90% of protein-coding genes undergo alternative splicing to produce multiple transcripts.

 </sup> Disruption of the splicing mechanism has the potential to have a large impact on the transcriptome and ultimately key regulatory pathways.

0: Small RNAs (sRNA) are non-coding RNAs that classified into micro (mi)RNA and short interfering (si)RNA with the size of 2124 nucleotides and a preferential 5 terminal base [ 24].
1: The miRNAs have incomplete complementarity with their targets and are cleaved through incorporation of DCL1 and AGO1 [ 24,  27,  28].
2: The siRNAs are excised from dsRNA that have perfect base-pairing with their target and are processed by association of different DCL, AGO, and RDR components [ 21].
3: Natural antisense siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) are generated through cleavage of endogenous dsRNA into 21 or 22nt by DCL4 or DCL2, respectively [ 29].
4: Heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs) are comprised of 24nt dsRNA via cleavage of DCL3 and mediating of AGO 4/6/9.
5: Hc-siRNAs are involved in silencing of heterochromatic, repetitive regions, coding sequences, gene promoter regions, and transposable elements via RNA-directed (PolIV) DNA methylation and histone modification.
6: RDR2 is also recruited in the process to generate dsRNA to enhance siRNA biogenesis [ 24,  29 35].
7: Determination of differentially expressed miRNA and/or siRNA upon virus infection identifies major candidate small RNAs silencing viral genes.
8: These candidates in combination with transcriptome profiles provide a comprehensive source of genes, miRNAs, and siRNAs as potential targets for enhancing plants resistance against viruses.

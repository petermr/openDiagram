<p>The second jumpwise change in the curve is related to the degradation of the remaining amount of the drug. In the oxidizing atmosphere, the process ends at 680 Â°C when the mass of the samples reaches 0, in contrast to the decomposition under the nitrogen atmosphere, which is incomplete. The shift of the second stepwise mass loss on the curve of CNTs-DOX to lower temperatures results from greater susceptibility to oxidation of DOX deposited on the surface of CNTs, compared to that of the pure drug. Of note, the course of the second decrease of the TGA curve for MWCNT-DOX is not as smooth as in the case of pure DOX. It can be interpreted as a result of the development of covalent interactions between some DOX molecules and the modified MWCNTs. </p>

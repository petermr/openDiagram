<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The calculated binding energy
correlated well with the experimentally
determined ACE2 usage data; the ACE2 proteins that can be more effectively
used by SARS-CoV-2 achieved a relatively lower binding energy (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). A binding energy
cutoff of &#8722;47 EEU was able to discriminate the more efficient
ACE2 receptors from the less efficient ones (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>), with the maximum Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) of 1.0 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). Among all the experimental species, apes (Sumatran orangutan,
western gorilla, silvery gibbon, and chimpanzee) and Old-World monkeys
(olive baboon, crab-eating macaque, gelada, rhesus macaque, golden
snub-nosed monkey, and Ugandan red colobus) and humans achieved the
lowest binding energy ranging from &#8722;56.21 to &#8722;54.79
EEU (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). Besides,
a few rodents (golden hamster, Chinese hamster, jerboa, white-footed
mouse, and Arctic ground squirrel) and carnivores (sea lion, tiger,
puma, leopard, seal, ferret, dog, cat, lynx, and bear) also achieved
a relatively low binding energy varying from &#8722;53.84 to &#8722;50.62
EEU (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). Three
New-World monkeys (marmoset, black-capped squirrel monkey, and tufted
capuchin), rats, mice, ducks, and chickens achieved a higher binding
energy score (&gt; &#8722;47 EEU), consistent with the reports that
these animals are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup></p>

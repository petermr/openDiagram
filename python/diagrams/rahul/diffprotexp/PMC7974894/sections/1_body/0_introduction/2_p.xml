<p>RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are a class of proteins that interacting with a variety type of RNAs. To date, more than 3800 human RBPs were determined in diverse cell types 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. These RBPs establish highly dynamic interactions with other proteins, coding and/or noncoding RNAs, and influence a variety of physiological and pathological processes including cancer 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Several investigations have shown that RBPs are dysregulated in different cancer types, and can impact on the expression and function of oncoproteins and tumor-suppressor proteins

  <p>Relative expression of GluN2A, GluN2B and GluN2D in the SDH versus the DDH of males and female rats. Optical density of a given GluN2 signal per area for the SDH as well as for the DDH was normalized to background optical density per area (see box in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). Average SDH and DDH measures were derived from multiple spinal sections for each animal (shown as individual data points), followed by a paired comparison between the normalized SDH and DDH for each GluN2 subtype. (a) In males, there is significantly higher expression in the SDH (dark blue bars) versus the DDH (light blue bars) for all the three GluN2 subunits, but with more pronounced differential expression for GluN2B (middle) and GluN2D (right). (b) In females, the GluN2B isoform (middle) is the only GluN2 subunit that exhibits significantly greater expression in the SDH  (dark purple) versus the DDH  (light purple). *p &lt; 0.05

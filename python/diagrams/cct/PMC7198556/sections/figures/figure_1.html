 <caption> The phase transformation behaviour of the sample steel. ( a) Displays the time-temperature-austenitisation diagram. Note the shifted transformation temperatures Ac 1 and Ac 3 at high heating rates, as well as the split of Ac 1 into a beginning and an end temperature (Ac 1b and Ac 1e). The heating rate associated with the inductive surface hardening process is marked as K1000 and has a value of 81.67 Ks −1. ( b) Shows the continuous-cooling-transformation diagram evaluated for an austenitisation temperature of 1000 °C with 10 s hold time. A – Austenite, F – Ferrite, P – Pearlite, B – Bainite, M – Martensite, MS – Martensite start, RA – retained austenite, HV10 – Vickers hardness HV10, λ – time in seconds from 800 °C to 500 °C divided by 100, 3; 5; 8; … – percentages of final microstructure. </caption>

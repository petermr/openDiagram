<p>The maximum adsorption capacity of acid-treated MWCNTs was ca 3800 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, while that of pristine MWCNTs was ca 175 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The adsorption isotherms reach a plateau at

 <sup>−1</sup> and 150 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> for the modified and unmodified systems, respectively. The initial concentrations for which the isotherms were recorded were 0.53 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 0.3 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for the oxidized and unmodified systems, respectively. Interpretation of the results was performed assuming three models of isotherms.

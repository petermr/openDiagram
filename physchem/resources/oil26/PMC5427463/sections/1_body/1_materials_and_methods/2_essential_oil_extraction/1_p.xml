<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">SoEO has been extracted from air-dried leaves by hydrodistillation for 3.3 h, using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Five portions (40 g each) of the dried leaves were individually subjected to hydrodistillation. Oil yield was then estimated on the basis of the dry weight of plant material. For antioxidants, antimicrobial, insecticidal and phytotoxic activities, oil was recovered directly, from above the distilled water without adding any solvent; meanwhile for gas chromatography analysis oil was recovered from 1 mL of hexane added above the distilled water. SoEO was stored in opaque glass tubes at -20 &#176;C until use.</p>

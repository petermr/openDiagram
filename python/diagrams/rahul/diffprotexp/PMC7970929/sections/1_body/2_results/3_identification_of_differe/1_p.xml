<p id="Par17">DESeq normalized expression values were used to calculate fold change for a given transcript. The genes exhibiting a significant difference between treatment and control samples (at least two-fold changes with 
 <italic>P</italic>-value ≤ 0.05) were considered to be differentially expressed. The regulation for each transcript was assigned based on log2fold change. The transcripts with a log2fold change less than − 1 were down-regulated, those with values greater than 1 were up-regulated and those between − 1 to 1 were termed as neutrally regulated. Total 345,729 transcripts were differentially expressed between control and treated samples of 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic> with 120,231 trancsripts at EC 30 dS/m, 113,280 trancsripts at EC 40 dS/m and 112,218 at EC 50 dS/m w.r.t. control. Of the total transcripts expressed, 68,455 transcripts were up-regulated, 69,759 transcripts were down-regulated and 207,515 transcripts were neutrally regulated. The Venn diagram constructed using Venny 2.1 (

 <italic>Urochondra</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Similarly, 1234 transcripts (2.4%) were down-regulated at salinity levels of EC 30 and 40 dS/m, 18,151 transcripts (35.7%) at EC 40 and 50 dS/m and only 842 transcripts (1.7%) were commonly down-regulated at EC 30 and 50 dS/m. Heatmap was generated for top 20 up and down-regulated transcripts between control and treated 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic> samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) using Clustvis (

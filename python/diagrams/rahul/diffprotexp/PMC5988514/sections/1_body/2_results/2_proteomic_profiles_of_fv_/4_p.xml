<p id="par0090">Comparison of CV-PTC and benign proteomes resulted in 296 differentially expressed proteins (fc ≥ 2, FDR p-value &lt;0.0005). Additionally, comparison of FV-PTC with CV-PTC samples resulted in 27 differentially expressed proteins (FDR p-value &lt;0.0005) (

 <sub>10</sub> (p value) versus log
 <sub>2</sub> (fold change) was constructed (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Points above FDR-p &lt; 0.0005 shows significantly and differentially altered proteins in FV-PTC and CV-PTC. Interestingly, out of a total of 27 differentially expressed proteins in FV-PTC and CV-PTC, only 2 proteins were increased in FV-PTC while 25 proteins showed increased expression in CV-PTC.

<p>Unbiased discovery and the quantitative proteomic approach is a powerful tool for identifying novel biomarkers and regulatory signaling networks in lung diseases including ARDS [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The protein expression profile of the bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) directly reflects the pathological changes in the airspace milieu in ARDS. Differential BALF protein expression was observed at different time points following the onset of ARDS [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as with differing disease severity (mild vs. severe) [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technology, Bhargava and colleagues characterized BALF protein expression profiles of ARDS survivors and non-survivors at different stages of disease progression and found that non-survivors manifested decreased expression of proteins related to coagulation, iron homeostasis and immune activation, but increased expression of proteins related to glycolysis, collagen metabolism and the actin cytoskeleton [

By employing shotgun proteomics, Schnapp et al. identified a total of 870 proteins in BALF from three ARDS patients and further showed that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and IGF binding protein-3 expression levels in BALF correlated with ARDS progression [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The above BALF proteomic studies provided new insights into the pathogenesis of ARDS and also identified novel therapeutic targets for ARDS treatment. However, these studies did not differentiate between pulmonary and extra-pulmonary ARDS, and the differences in BALF protein expression profiles between these two ARDS sub-groups are unknown.

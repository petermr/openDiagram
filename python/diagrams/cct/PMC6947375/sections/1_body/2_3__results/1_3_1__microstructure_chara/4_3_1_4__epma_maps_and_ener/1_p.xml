 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows SEM images and EPMAmaps of C, Cr, Mn distributions in 0.10C-1.50Cr steels after cold rolling and cold drawing. The distributions of elements were obviously heterogeneous. Because Cr is a medium carbide forming element and Mn has high diffusivity and solubility in cementite, spheroidized carbides mainly consisted of (Fe, Cr) 
 <sub>3</sub>C, which was richened in Cr, Fe, and C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The size of the manganese atom is smaller than that of chromium atom, so the diffusivity of the chromium atom is smaller than that of manganese atom at a lower temperature. Thus, the manganese content in cementite was generally higher than that in the surrounding ferrite phase. Compared to cold rolling, the deformation degree of cold drawing was larger and faster, and the effect of thermal stress was obvious (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f006">Figure 6</xref> exhibits SEM image with the trace of the line scan and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of cementite in 0.10C-1.50Cr steels after cold rolling (a, b) and cold drawing (c, d). Six carbides were analyzed, which were labeled as C1, C2, and C3 in the cold rolled 0.10C-1.50Cr steel, while those in the cold drawn specimen were labeled as C4, C5, and C6. Because of the low solubility of carbon in ferrite, the interface between cementite and ferrite could be clearly distinguished by the distribution of carbon atoms. In addition, carbon enrichment in ferrite grain boundaries was evident, confirming that grain boundaries were important diffusion channels in the process of dissolution and coarsening of partial cementite caused by cold deformation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,c). The EDX line scanning illustrated that Mn content in large cementite was significantly higher than in small particles of cementite, and Cr content gradually increased from small to large cementite. Si content in cementite was lower than in surrounding ferrite, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,d. This suggested that carbide forming elements Mn and Cr in ferrite diffused into cementite, while Si in cementite diffused into ferrite. Therefore, the partition of the alloying element retarded the growth of cementite dynamically.

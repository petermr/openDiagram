<p>At last, the lithiation of FeNCN was followed experimentally by operando Fe K‐edge XAS in order to corroborate or falsify the theoretical findings.

 <xref rid="anie201914760-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> is very sensitive to the modification of the nearest‐neighbor shell of the Fe atoms and is hence used to validate the DFT‐predicted ternary intermediates. The complete operando data set depicting the evolution of Fe K‐edge XAS spectra acquired during the first electrochemical discharge of FeNCN vs. Li is presented as a contour plot in Figure

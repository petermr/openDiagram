 <xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The energy density of LIB is closely related to the lithium storage performance and voltage of the anode materials. The transition metal oxide Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> used as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries, first reported by Poizot [
 <xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in 2000, has attracted extensive interest of researchers with 890 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> theoretical capacity, which is much higher than commercial graphite (372 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Different from lithium intercalation mechanism of graphite, Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> is based on a conversion reaction as anode materials transforms into metallic cobalt, with great volume expansion and metal reunion during lithiation/deithiation [

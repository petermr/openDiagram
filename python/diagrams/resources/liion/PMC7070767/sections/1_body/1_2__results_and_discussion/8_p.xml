<p>Electrochemical measurements were performed using both the cyclic voltammetry (CV) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00891-f010">Figure 10</xref>) and galvanostatic cycling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00891-f011">Figure 11</xref>). The intercalation and extraction mechanism are followed by CV, which indicates, for sample BatS1, the absence of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion diffusion through anode material. On the contrary, initial sweep cycle of samples BatS2 and BatS3, shows cathodic peak (Li alloying), current increases sharply below 0.5 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>, which is related to intercalation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions resulting in the transformation of crystalline Si to a disordered phase [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the reverse (discharge) process, a broad anodic peak is due to the extraction of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion from Li
 <sub>x</sub>Si regenerating to Si. Two anode peaks at BatS2 and BatS3, characteristic for extraction of lithium ion from silicon anode, indicate that Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion is extracted from different crystalline phases. Sample BatS3 shows much higher charge values compared to samples BatS1 and BatS2. Moreover, the current values for sample BatS3 were higher for several orders of magnitude in comparison to samples BatS1 and BatS2.

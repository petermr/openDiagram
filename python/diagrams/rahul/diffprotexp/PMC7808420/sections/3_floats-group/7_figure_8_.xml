  <p>
   <bold>SLEV viral load and cytokine production is similar between the brains of IFNγ
    <sup>−/-</sup> and WT mice
   </bold>. WT and IFNγ
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice in the C57BL/6 background were inoculated intracranially with 10 PFU of SLEV and euthanized on day 7 p.i. Brain samples were processed and assessed for viral load, by plaque assay (a), for the expression of IFNγ, CCL5, CXCL1 and IL-1β, by ELISA (b-e). Results are expressed as PFU of SLEV per 100 mg of brain (A) or as picograms per 100 mg of brain homogenate (B-E). Data are representative of two independent experiments (n = 6–8). **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 compared to the respective mock-infected group. Mock = injected with saline

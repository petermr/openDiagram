0: Emerging high-throughput technologies open new avenues to identify the genetic defects and pathobiology of diseases at genome scale.
1: Using microarray, the differential gene expression analysis of AVM nidus has revealed that Ephrin A1 is a candidate gene for AVM pathogenesis [ 27].
2: The transcriptome analysis of AVM nidus structures is likely to reveal deregulated molecular pathways.
3: The RNA sequencing technology permits the study of differentially expressed genes in AVM nidus.
4: In an attempt to identify the differentially expressed genes in cerebral AVM tissues, we have performed RNA sequencing analyses with cerebral AVM nidus structures.
5: Since AVM nidus is heterogeneous structure, RNA sequencing was done with three independent AVM nidus samples to identify the potential changes in the pathways linked with cerebral AVM development.
6: We identified 38 differentially expressed genes in all the three cerebral AVM samples analyzed.
7: Among them, 35 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were downregulated.
8: A subset of commonly differentially expressed genes belongs to retinoic acid-responsive genes.
9: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of abnormal astrocytes in and around cerebral AVM structures.
10: Further, we observed upregulation of CYR61, a retinoic acid-responsive gene in the abnormal astrocytes in the neighboring tissues of cerebral AVM nidus.
11: Taken together, our study provides the results of a first in-depth transcriptome analysis of cerebral AVM nidus.
12: We have identified that retinoic signaling pathway-associated genes are dysregulated in the vascular structures of cerebral AVM nidus.

<p id="Par17">One of the first cellular events associated with regeneration is the dedifferentiation of the mesentery cells

 </sup>. Such dedifferentiation is usually associated with cellular reprogramming and the activation or inactivation of specific transcription factors (TFs). Thus, we identified the annotated TFs with expression changes (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S9</xref> online). The heatmap in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows five main expression patterns. Group 1 (grey) corresponds to factors with moderate-to-low expression in normal tissues that increase during regeneration with a peak at day 1. Group 2 (light blue) corresponds to factors with high expression in normal tissues that decrease slightly in day 1 and 3. Group 3 (green) corresponds to factors with regular expression in normal mesentery that increase during the first 3 days of regeneration. Group 4 (cyan) corresponds to factors that are moderately expressed in normal tissue and decrease their expression during regeneration days 1 and 3. Finally, Group 5 (blue) includes factors that are weakly expressed in normal mesentery but increase their expression during days 1 and 3 of regeneration.

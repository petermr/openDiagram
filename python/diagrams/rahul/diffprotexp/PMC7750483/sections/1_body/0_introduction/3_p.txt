0: 5-Methylcytosine modification is regulated by methyltransferases (writers, including  NSUN1-7 and  TRDMT1 [ tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1]) and binding protein (reader, i.e.,  ALYREF [ Aly/REF export factor]).
1: NSUN1-7 and  TRDMT1 are known writers for chemical RNA modifications ( Jacob et al., 2017).
2: NSUN1 (NOP2 nucleolar protein/rRNA MTase) plays an important role in maintaining cell proliferation capacity and is possibly involved in the regeneration of nervous tissue ( Kosi et al., 2015;  Hong et al., 2016).
3: NSUN2 ( NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2/mRNA and tRNA MTase) is a main RNA modification methyltransferase.
4: Its mechanism of action includes controlling cell division, growth arrest, and promoting premature senescence ( Xing et al., 2015;  Cai et al., 2016; W.  Wang, 2016;  Yang X. et al., 2017).
5: It has been reported that  NSUN2 mutations lead to intellectual disability in human diseases ( Abbasi-Moheb et al., 2012).
6: NSUN3 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 3/mt-tRNA MTase) and  NSUN4 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 4/mt-rRNA MTase) have important impacts on the mitochondria ( Metodiev et al., 2014;  Schosserer et al., 2015;  Nakano et al., 2016).
7: NSUN5 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 5/rRNA MTase) is a conserved rRNA methyltransferase ( Schosserer et al., 2015).
8: NSUN6 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 6/tRNA MTase) modifies tRNAs in their biogenesis ( Haag et al., 2015).
9: NSUN7 ( NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 7) gene product plays a role in sperm motility ( Khosronezhad et al., 2015).
10: TRDMT1 (also known as  DNMT2) was previously considered as a DNA MTase, but it is now primarily regarded as a tRNA MTase ( Schaefer and Lyko, 2010;  Squires et al., 2012;  Jeltsch et al., 2017).
11: Up to now, the m 5C eraser is still unknown, and the only known binding protein (reader) of m 5C is  ALYREF.
12: ALYREF as an m 5C reader can promote mRNA export ( Yang X. et al., 2017).
13: In general, m 5C methyltransferases are strongly associated with diseases.

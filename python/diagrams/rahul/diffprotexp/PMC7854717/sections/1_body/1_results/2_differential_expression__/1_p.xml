  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>) of selected pathways when comparing the two atria, the two ventricles and the ventricle and atrium of the same side. The scores of all quantified genes (ALL) were included for comparison. While significant differences between the atrium and the ventricle from the same side of the heart were expected, of note are the large differences between the two atria and the very small differences between the two ventricles. The high WPR scores for the CMC pathway when comparing the two atria and each atrium to the ventricle of the same side come from the very large expression levels of genes encoding contractile myofilaments. Interestingly, while genes such as: 
 <italic>Actc1, Tnnt2, Tpm1</italic> have very large expression in all chambers, others have significantly larger expression in atria (
 <italic>Myl4</italic>) or in ventricles (
 <italic>Myl2, Myl3</italic>). The average expression levels for these genes were: 
 <italic>Actc1</italic> (1685 in LA, 1089 in RA, 1541 in LV, 1310 in RV), 
 <italic>Tnnt2</italic> (1290, 732, 1132, 1118), 
 <italic>Tpm1</italic> (1255, 905, 1256, 1193), 
 <italic>Myl4</italic> (1963, 1127, 55, 46), 
 <italic>Myl2</italic> (108, 408, 1081, 1335) and 
 <italic>Myl3</italic> (314, 412, 1725, 1735).

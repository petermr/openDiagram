<p id="Par15">Focusing on all MRPGs expression in non-treated samples, the increment in the three-time points is evident in 61 genes (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast with the general trend reported for cytosolic RPGs (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>), the MRPGs expression in treated samples shows an increase also in the three stages. Indeed, an increment is reported in 66 genes comparing 120 to 45 min, and in 54 genes comparing 200 to 120 min (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This highlights a peculiar behavior of MRPGs during the exposures to acetic acid.

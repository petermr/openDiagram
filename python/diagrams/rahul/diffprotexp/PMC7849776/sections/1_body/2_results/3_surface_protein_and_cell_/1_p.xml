<p>To get insight into the mechanism of reduced virulence by YjbH, we sought to analyze the surface protein profiles. We found that the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> and the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> genes-disrupted mutants had reduced surface proteins compared to that of the wild-type, which was complemented by the introduction of the mutants with the 
 <italic>yjbIH</italic> operon and the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene but not the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(a</xref>)). Next, we performed spectroscopic fingerprinting using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tn, 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn, and the wild-type strains to investigate changes in the cell envelope glycopolymer structure. We found that both the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tn and 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn mutants clustered distinct from the wild-type, but they could not be discriminated from each other using the highly discriminatory polysaccharide spectral region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(b</xref>), upper). Disruption of the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> and the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> genes caused a large number of prominent spectral differences at wavenumbers between 1190–890 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which can be assigned to strong perturbations in the bacterial surface/cell wall-glycopolymer composition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(b</xref>), lower). Here, the absence of YjbH led to an alteration in surface protein and cell envelope glycopolymer composition that could likely contribute to the virulence of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [

<p id="Par44">We exposed male zebra finches to elevated prenatal T or a control and present data comparing adult aggressive behaviors and underlying neural gene expression and methylation patterns in two socially relevant brain regions. We found that adults from T-injected eggs showed increased aggressive behaviors along with enrichment of several aggression-related processes involving steroid, somatostatin, and glutamate signaling. Furthermore, there were two DEGs that were also differentially methylated, ADCY2 and PCSK2, that were identified as being highly connected genes within a subnetwork that showed enrichment for signaling pathways and hormone regulation. Thus, prenatal T may cause lasting changes in the methylation and expression of a few highly connected genes that have the potential to impact the expression of numerous aggression-related pathways. Collectively, these results highlight neurogenomic mechanisms that may play an important role in mediating the effects of prenatal T on long-term phenotypic outcomes.</p>

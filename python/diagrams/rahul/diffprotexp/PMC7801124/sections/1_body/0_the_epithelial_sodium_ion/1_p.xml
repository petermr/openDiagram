<p>Approximately 1.5% of the human genome encodes ion channels (&gt;400 in total) [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], proteins that are integral to cellular excitability in tissues throughout the body. The importance of ion channels is demonstrated by the fact that they account for 19% and 18% of human protein and small drug targets in the ChEMBL database, respectively [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This review will focus on an ion channel family that detects changes in extracellular pH: acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), and more specifically ASIC3.

0: The modified method of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assay described by Badmus et al., [ 27] was adapted to measure the inhibitory effect of the essential oil on lipid peroxidation using egg yolk homogenates as lipid rich source.
1: A volume of 125 L of 10% of the egg homogenate (in distilled water) was added to various concentrations ranged from 0.030.5 mg/mL of the plant extract prepared in methanol.
2: The volume was adjusted to 250 L with distilled water.
3: Afterward, 12.5 L of FeSO 4 (Iron (II) sulphate) was added to the solution and incubated at 25 C for 30 min.
4: A 375 L of 10% acetic acid (pH 3.50) adjusted with NaOH.
5: Then, 0.80% of 2-thiobarbituric acid (375 L) mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate 1.1% and 2% trichloroacetic acid (12.5 L) was added in the same micro centrifuge tubes, vortexed and heat at 65 C for 60 min.
6: After cooling, 975 L of butanol was added, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 600 s. The upper organic layer was then aspirated and the absorbance read at 532 nm.
7: Percentage inhibition of lipid by the EO was calculated using the formula previously stated above and all the assays were performed in triplicate.

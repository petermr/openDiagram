<p id="Par24">We identified master regulators of energy homeostasis, such as 
 <italic>FOXA3</italic>, 
 <italic>PPARA</italic>, and 
 <italic>SREBF2</italic>. Among the pathways important for energy homeostasis, we found MAPK, which acts as a PPAR regulator

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. The PPAR protein is suggested to have an adaptive role during tissue development in response to nutrient availability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. The transcriptional complex formed by PPARs and nuclear receptors, like RXRG, is the key activator of target genes involved with fatty acid oxidation, insulin secretion, and inflammation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. The relationship of PPAR-RXRG with energy imbalance underlies metabolic abnormalities, such as diabetes and chronic inflammation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, FOXA3 participates on the pathway maturity onset diabetes as well as carbohydrate and glucose homeostasis. In addition, SREBF2 plays a role in energy metabolism and also lipid storage, regulation of sterol and cholesterol transport, lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. The protein coded by this gene regulates the cholesterol biosynthesis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones and it plays a role in early fetal development by moderating nuclear receptors

<p>During the progression of cervical cancer, from normal cervical tissues to CIN 1, 2 and 3, the up‐regulated genes we confirmed were SYCP2, NEFH, CDKN2A and KRT17. KRT17 (Gene ID: 3872) is located on chromosome 17q21.2, encoding keratin, type I cytoskeleton 17 (Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 17, UniProtKB‐Q04695), expressed in the outer root sheath and medulla region of hair follicles, where it is involved in the formation and maintenance of various skin appendages.

 </xref> KRT17 is also associated with cell polarization and the recruitment of effector immune cells to lesion‐prone cervical epithelia. Escobar‐Hoyos et al. found KRT17 to be highly expressed in premalignant and malignant squamous lesions of the cervix,

 </xref> Our results are consistent with the results of those studies. Most importantly, we found that expression of KRT17 was stronger than that of Ki67 in cervical cancer, indicating that KRT17 is a more specific and suitable marker for cervical cancer.

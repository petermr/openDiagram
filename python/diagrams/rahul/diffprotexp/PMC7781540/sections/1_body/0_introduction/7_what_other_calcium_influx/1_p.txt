0: While K V1.3 blockade clearly reduced ATP-induced calcium influx through P2X4 receptors [ 40] and thus constitutes an important regulator of this calcium influx pathway in microglia ( Figure 2), this clearly is not the only K V1.3 or ATP dependent calcium signaling process in microglia.
1: In addition to P2X receptor channels microglia also express metabotropic P2Y purinergic receptors which following activation by ATP or UTP can induce calcium release from internal stores [ 47] and activate store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE) following depletion of the relatively small intracellular calcium stores in microglia [ 38].
2: It therefore is certainly possible that additional SOCE contributed to the ATP induced Ca 2+ signals we had imaged and that some of the K V1.3 blocker effects were mediated by additionally reducing SOCE.
3: This is a very likely hypothesis, since the classical molecular mechanism for K V1.3 blockers in T cells is reduction of SOCE through CRAC channels following T cell receptor activation and subsequently reduced transcription factor activation and cytokine production and release [ 29, 33, 36, 48].
4: Rat and mouse microglia have been repeatedly reported to exhibit currents with biophysical properties typical for CRAC currents [ 49, 50] and to express the molecular components of CRAC channels, Orai and STIM [ 51, 52].
5: There further is evidence that genetic deletion of Orai1, STIM1, and STIM2 reduces CRAC current and/or SOCE and inhibits migration and phagocytosis in cultured mouse microglia [ 52], while the small molecule CRAC channel blocker CM-EX-137 has recently been reported to decrease microglia activation and lesion size in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury [ 53].

0: TSA exposure courses were optimized at 1, 2, and 4M TSA for 8 hours after 48 hours growth prior to exposure and then exposed to 2 M for 18 hours after 72 hours growth prior to exposure.
1: For both exposure courses, trophozoites were grown without the addition of Mtz in MtzR lines, and only adherent trophozoites were used in exposure time courses.
2: Prior to TSA exposure, nonadhered trophozoites were discarded along with the old media; fresh media added containing either TSA in DMSO or DMSO only (control) was added.
3: Adherence was monitored throughout exposure time courses, with detachment indicating decreasing viability.
4: Trophozoites from exposure experiments had protein extracted and analyzed using anti-KAc as detailed previously, with 10g of protein run on the gels.

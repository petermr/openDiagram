<p>We next quantified and compared the relative total staining intensity (per area) for each GluN2 isoform in the SDH and DDH. In male rats, expression of GluN2A, GluN2B and GluN2D subunits were significantly higher in the CGRP+ SDH versus the DDH (p = 0.012, n = 6 for GluN2A; p = 0.014, n = 5 for GluN2B; and p = 0.039, n = 5 for GluN2D; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(a</xref>)). The SDH/DDH relative expression ratio was greater for GluN2B (1.28 ± 0.05, n = 5) and GluN2D (1.24 ± 0.06, n = 5) isoforms compared to GluN2A (1.14 ± 0.03, n = 6), further supporting our observations of preferential localization of GluN2B and GluN2D to the SDH. However, ANOVA analysis revealed no significant difference (p = 0.11) between groups. It should be noted that GluN2B expression was also pronounced in the inner region of lamina II (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a</xref>) middle), which is included as “DDH” as it is not part of the CGRP+ SDH (lamina I/II
 <sub>O</sub>) region, and so the quantified difference in SDH versus DDH expression for GluN2B would likely be even greater if lamina II
 <sub>i</sub> was included in the quantified SDH region.

0: Here, we provide the first report of transgenerational effects of water-deficit stress on the physiological traits, yield performance and grain quality in durum wheat.
1: Next-generation sequencing analysis was carried out to profile the miRNAome, transcriptome, and degradome with or without the effects of transgenerational stress.
2: Our data provide the first evidence in  T. turgidum on the transgenerational effects of reproductive-stage water-deficit stress.
3: New knowledge gained at the molecular level has revealed key miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules that are potential new candidates to enhance stress tolerance across generations in molecular breeding.

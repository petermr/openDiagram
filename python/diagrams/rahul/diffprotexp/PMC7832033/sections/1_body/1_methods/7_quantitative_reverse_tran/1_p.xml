<p>Two-step RT-qPCR was used to quantitatively validate gene expression. Total RNA from whole blood was converted into cDNA using the iScript
 <sup>TM</sup> cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The amplification was performed in duplicate in a total volume of 10 μl containing 5 μl of iTaq Universal SYBR Green (Bio-Rad), 2 μl of 4 ng cDNA, 0.4 μl of 10 mM forward primer, 0.4 μl of 10 mM reverse primer, 2.2 μl of distilled water. The cycle conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 95°C for 30s followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10s and 60°C for 30s. After amplification, melting curve analysis was carried out from 65°C to 95°C. Primers were designed using NCBI PrimerBlast (

 <sup>−ΔCt</sup> method, where ΔCt = mean Ct of target gene – mean Ct of the three reference genes.

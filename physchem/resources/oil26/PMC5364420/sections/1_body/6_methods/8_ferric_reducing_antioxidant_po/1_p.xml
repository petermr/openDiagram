<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The reducing ability was determined by using FRAP assay as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The absorption of the reaction mixture was measured at 593&#8201;nm after incubation for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Increased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated increased reducing power.</p>

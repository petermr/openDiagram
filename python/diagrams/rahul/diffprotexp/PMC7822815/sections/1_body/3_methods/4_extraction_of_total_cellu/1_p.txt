0: Total cellular proteins were extracted simultaneously with the RNeasy Mini Kit-based purification of RNA by precipitating the RNeasy flowthrough with 2 volumes of acetone 21.
1: Pelleted proteins were dissolved in urea buffer (9 M urea, 4% CHAPS (3-((3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate), 1% DTT) and protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay.

<p>However, pure aluminium has poor strength, and its application is largely limited to packaging and foil, electronic conductors, chemical process equipment and lithographic plates [

 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This strength increase, i.e., an increase in the resistance against plastic deformation, can be achieved by four physical mechanisms: (i) grain-boundaries; (ii) dislocations (work hardening); (iii) alloying elements in solid solution; and (iv) alloying elements precipitated in nano-sized particles [

 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To understand these mechanisms, it is essential to know that plastic deformation (at temperatures below 0.4 times the melting temperature in K, for aluminium below about 100 Â°C) involves the gliding of dislocations on certain lattice planes of the metallic matrix crystal. All four mechanisms that can increase the strength are therefore based on the effect of hindering dislocations from gliding. The mechanism of precipitation strengthening is typically used to achieve the highest strengths in Al-based products [

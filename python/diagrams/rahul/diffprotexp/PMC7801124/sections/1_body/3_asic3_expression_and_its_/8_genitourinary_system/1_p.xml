<p>One of the alternative names for ASIC3 is the testis sodium channel (TNaC), which came about due to its relatively high expression in the human testis and due to only showing 82% amino acid identity with rASIC3 was initially thought to be a distinct ion channel, however, it has since become clear that TNaC and hASIC3 are the same [

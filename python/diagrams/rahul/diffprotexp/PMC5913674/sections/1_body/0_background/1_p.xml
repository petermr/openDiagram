<p>Nitroheterocyclics (e.g., metronidazole [Mtz], nitazoxanide, and furazolidone) include “redox-active” pro-drugs that cross the cell membrane via passive diffusion and are enzymatically reduced to cytotoxic intermediates that oxidize biomolecules. This occurs specifically within highly reducing intracellular environments of microaerophilic protists (
 <italic>Giardia duodenalis, Trichomononas vaginalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Entameoba histolytica</italic>) as well as anaerobic bacteria (
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>) [

 <sub>2</sub> re-oxidizes reduced Mtz to the pro-drug form, termed “futile cycling.” The specificity of nitroheterocyclic toxicity for low dissolved oxygen biochemistry makes this drug class the chemotherapeutic backbone against multiple bacterial and protozoan pathogens. However, drug resistance within this compound class is collectively widespread across species [

 <p>A new design strategy for high-performance organic cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries is presented, which involves the assembly of redox-active organic molecules with a crystalline porous structure using mixed-stacked charge-transfer (CT) complexes. Hexahydroxytriphenylene was used as a donor molecule and 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacarbonitrile as an acceptor molecule to give a new porous CT complex (
  <bold>PCT-1</bold>) with a pseudo-hexagonal mixed columnar structure. X-ray diffraction measurements and sorption experiments demonstrated that the intercolumnar spaces in 
  <bold>PCT-1</bold> can incorporate various molecules accompanied by lattice expansion. A lithium metal battery containing 
  <bold>PCT-1</bold> as a cathode active material exhibited a high capacity of 288 mA h g
  <sup>–1</sup> at 500 mA g
  <sup>–1</sup>, and this performance was attributed to a combination of the redox-active units and the porous structure of 
  <bold>PCT-1</bold>.

<p>All 3 MtzR lines were generated at similar times at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research via long-term exposure to sublethal Mtz [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with intermittent drug treatment and ultraviolet radiation (WB and 713) also used to further induce resistance [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. WB-M3, BRIS/83/HEPU/106-2ID10, and BRIS/83/HEPU/713-M3 were further explored in subsequent studies [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The resistant lines used in the current study were selected in the presence of 30 μM Mtz [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and exhibited significantly higher Mtz IC
 <sub>50</sub> values than their respective parent lines, indicating increased drug tolerance (Table

0: In this study, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform on a large discovery cohort of CNFs and PNFs.
1: We demonstrate that CNFs and PNFs maintain epigenetically distinct profiles that are distinguishable based on both site-specific and chromosome-wide methylation differences.
2: This work stands in contrast to prior studies that failed to identify differential methylation at the  NF1 locus in peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and were underpowered to identify signaling impacts based on genome-wide methylation differences [ 12][ 12].
3: Our work confirms that broad and distinct patterns of methylation result in differential signaling between CNFs and PNFs, as well as in the regulation of tumor size.
4: Specifically, two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the  MAP2K3 and an upstream regulatory site for  MAPK14 were significantly altered between CNFs and PNFs leading to increased MKK3 and p38 expression.
5: This epigenetic reinforcement of MKK3 and p38 expression also led to activation of both p38 and ERK based on an arbitrary subset of CNF patient samples within the discovery cohort.
6: The MKK3/ p38 signaling axis is linked to both inflammation and pain signaling, as well as chromatin conformational changes through SWI/SNF complex regulation.
7: ERK activation is not a usual consequence of MKK3/p38 activation due to conserved inhibitory feedback pathways.
8: Taken together, our data confirm that epigenetic regulation of key RAS signaling genes results in disordered growth, inflammation and signaling in the context of NF1 deficiency.
9: These findings also confirm the importance of epigenetic regulation in CNF tumor initiation and progression, as well as a potentially druggable signaling axis in MKK3/p38/ERK.

0: Approximately 1 in 3000 live births are affected by the tumor predisposition condition, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) making it the most common single gene-inherited condition in humans.
1: One of the clinical hallmarks and diagnostic sine qua non of NF1 is the formation of benign peripheral nerve tumors called neurofibromas.
2: Neurofibromas are a major cause of disfigurement, pain, and morbidity in NF1.
3: These issues are predominantly attributable to two types of neurofibromas: dermal or cutaneous neurofibromas (CNFs) that develop in the skin, and plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) that arise from nerves situated in deeper anatomic compartments.
4: Even though CNFs and PNFs share similar histology, they are pathophysiologically distinct.
5: NF1-related PNFs are associated with the development of high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are the leading cause of death of NF1 patients [ 1].
6: In contrast, CNFs exhibit slower growth rates and do not have malignant potential [ 2 4].
7: Although CNFs do not become malignant, these benign tumors are often painful and disfiguring.
8: These critical distinctions between CNFs and PNFs are not explained by genomic and transcriptomic studies that failed to identify consistent alterations in these tumors [ 5].

 </sup>, cyclophosphamide was administered to one patient with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, one patient with plasma cell leukemia, and eight patients with multiple myeloma. Gene set enrichment analysis identified upregulation of 14 GO pathways including neutrophil activation and degranulation, as well as downregulation of two GO pathways related to viral replication and cell death, which were shared pathways stimulated by both chemotherapy and COVID-19 infection (Supplementary Table

Furthermore, functional analysis of all overlapping genes between chemotherapy treatment and COVID-19 further showed the shared upregulation of a number of pathways related to phagocytosis, innate viral defenses, type I IFN signaling, tumor-necrosis factor signaling, and innate cellular proliferation (Fig.

<p>In 2014, Higashi first reported Mg(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)(NH
 <sub>2</sub>) as a new class of solid-state Mg ion conductor (Higashi et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The diffusion of Mg ions in Mg(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)(NH
 <sub>2</sub>) was attributed to the Mg zigzag chain and tunneling structures in the 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic> planes. It showed the ionic conductivity of 10
 <sup>−6</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 150°C and the electrochemical window of ~3 V in estimation.

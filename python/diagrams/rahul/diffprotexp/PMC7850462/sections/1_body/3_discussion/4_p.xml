<p>The online bioinformatic database predicted the binding site between miR-34b-5p and AQP2, and vectors inserted with wild and mutated 3′UTR of AQP2 were constructed for dual-luciferase reporter assay. The experimental data indicated that miR-34b-5p could bind to the 3′UTR of AQP2 and therefore mediate the expression of AQP2. In cells with over-expressed or under-expressed miR-34b-5p, the expression of AQP2 was subsequently down-regulated or up-regulated. We then conducted experiments to verify the interaction of miR-34b-5p with AQP2 in HK-2 cells. AQP2 silencing reversed the suppression of apoptosis and inflammation by miR-34b-5p inhibitor in LPS-induced HK-2 cells, which was manifested by increased levels of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory molecules.</p>

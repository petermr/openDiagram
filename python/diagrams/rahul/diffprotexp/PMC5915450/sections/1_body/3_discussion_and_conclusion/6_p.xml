<p id="Par31">Limitations of this study include the perennial issue of the accuracy of the all-atom force field employed and the rapid translocation of the peptide through the exit tunnel in the simulations. The all-atom force field we used is among one of the most accurate and successful in terms of ribosome simulations

 </sup>. The rapid translocation of the peptide was necessary so as to obtain results in a realistic time frame. It is possible that the forces experienced by the peptide could change as the translocation speed is decreased. However, we have shown that even if this is the case, the qualitative differences we observed between ErmCL and H-NS (larger forces for ErmCL as compared to H-NS) are likely to persist. Thus, while the exact numbers may change, the trends and conclusions are not likely to.

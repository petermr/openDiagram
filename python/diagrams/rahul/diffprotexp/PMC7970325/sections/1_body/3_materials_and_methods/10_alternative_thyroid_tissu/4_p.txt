0: The proteome datasets from CPTAC [ 94] and corresponding transcriptome datasets from gdc-portal [ 29] were used to assess correlation between expression on transcriptome and proteome level for key genes in tumor and normal tissues.
1: We totally used 102 paired RNA sequencing and proteome profiles of breast, 53 - colon, 210  lung, 108  brain, 62  ovary, 151  head and neck tissues.

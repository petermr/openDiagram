<p>PrP
 <sup>c</sup>is associated with heterologous biological processes. In the last few years, various reports have indicated the involvement of PrP
 <sup>c</sup> in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis [

 <sup>c</sup> on glycolysis was suggested in several earlier studies [

 <sup>c</sup> loss of function.

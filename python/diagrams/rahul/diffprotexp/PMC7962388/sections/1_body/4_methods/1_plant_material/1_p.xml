<p id="Par78">The following 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> genotypes were used for this study: 
 <italic>i</italic>) Q4117, a tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40) natural obligate apomictic accession originated from Southern Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], and ii) C4-4x, an artificially generated completely sexual induced autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 40) genotype, obtained after chromosome duplication of a sexual diploid plant by colchicine treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Vegetative replicates of these plants are being maintained in experimental plots at Instituto de Botánica del Nordeste (IBONE), CONICET-UNNE, (Corrientes, Argentina) and Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Agrarias de Rosario (IICAR), CONICET-UNR (Rosario, Argentina). Q4117 and C4-4x flowering periods overlap (Q4117: November to April; C4-4x: January to April). Flowering conditions are the same for both genotypes. Voucher specimens of this material are kept at the Herbarium CTES-IBONE (publicly available), under deposition numbers: C4-4X (Quarin, C. L. 4260, barcode CTES0541627, cardboard No. 330064); Q4117 (Quarin, C. L. 4117, barcode CTES0541626, cardboard No. 233851).

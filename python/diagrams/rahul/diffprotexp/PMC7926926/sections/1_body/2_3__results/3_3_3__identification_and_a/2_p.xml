<p>Among the core Al responsive proteins, three proteins, 
 <italic>TRINITY_DN51434_c0_g1</italic>; chaperonin CPN60-2, 
 <italic>TRINITY_DN52787_c0_g1</italic>; phosphoglycerate kinase 1, and 
 <italic>TRINITY-DN50533-c0-g8</italic>; unknown protein, were up-regulated under CK-04 vs. CK-0, while their expression was down-regulated in LB-04 vs. LB-0. The other proteins showed a similar regulation pattern in both groups, demonstrating the conserved roles of these proteins under Al-stress conditions independently of SL inoculation.

 </sup>. The RPV should serve for 40 years under high-temperature, high-pressure, and neutron-irradiation conditions. Therefore, to ensure safe operation of the reactor, the RPV should be fabricated from material with high strength, high fracture toughness, and high resistance to irradiation embrittlement

<p>After stimulation with AC EFs for 24 h, hTCEpi cells were lysed in RTL Plus buffer, part of the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The whole RNA samples were quantified spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher, Darmstadt, Germany) and the integrity was controlled using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 with the RNA Nano chip kit (Agilent Genomics, Waldbronn, Germany). RNA integrity number values between 9.0 and 9.8 were achieved and 200 ng was used as the starting material. To perform the differential gene expression profiling, Affymetrix Clariom
 <sup>TM</sup> S Arrays were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix, St. Clara, CA, USA). The hybridization was carried out overnight at 45°C in the GeneChip
 <sup>®</sup> Hybridization Oven 645 (Affymetrix). The microarray was scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) at 0.7 micron resolution.

<p>It should be clear from this Review that despite the long history of XAS-based 
 <italic>operando</italic> catalyst research, many challenges still remain, making this an exciting field for the new generation of catalysis scientists and spectroscopists to jump in and contribute. The new developments in the field should encompass instrumentation improvements but also data analysis. The rich amount of information that can extracted from XAS data about the catalyst structure, composition, and dynamics under reaction conditions will make any effort in the advancement of new methods particularly rewarding. We envision that the most exciting contributions of 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS characterization to deciphering the working mechanisms of electrocatalysts are yet to come.

 <italic>USP8</italic> gene encodes for deubiquitinase enzyme involved in the regulation of proteasomal protein degradation. 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations are small, single codon deletions or missense variants that occur in the region involved in binding 14-3-3 proteins family members. Thus, these changes impair interactions between USP8 and 14-3-3 proteins, which normally suppress deubiquitinase activity [
 <xref rid="B16-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a result of mutation, USP8 activity is enhanced and leads to preventing proteasomal degradation of particular proteins and dysregulation of natural protein turnover. This was clearly shown in in vitro experiments, providing the explanation of the sustained EGFR signaling in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>-mutated corticotroph PitNETs [
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since USP8 deubiquitinase has many molecular substrates, its impaired functioning has potentially a wide effect on the protein level. The pleiotropic effect of the mutation is reflected by differences in gene expression between 
 <italic>USP8</italic>-mutated (
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut) and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>-wild type (
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt) tumors [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Accordingly, differences in expression of particular proteins related to corticotroph tumors growth were also found [
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The understanding of the biological difference between wild type and mutated tumors appears important, since 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutation may potentially serve as prognostic and predicting factor [
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

0: The BBB which is primarily constituted by the brain capillary endothelial cells interacts with neighboring cells, such as pericytes, astrocytes, and neurons to maintain the barrier integrity [ 14 16].
1: The human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) are a special type of cell that constitute the BBB [ 17].
2: Like poliovirus, EV71 transmitted by the fecal-oral route has an affinity for cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and manifests as poliomyelitis-like paralysis [ 18].
3: Proteomics analysis is currently considered to be a powerful tool for global evaluation of protein expression.
4: In this study, proteomics analyses of HBMEC after EV71 infection were performed.
5: First, we found EV71 could infect and replicate in HBMEC through detecting EV71 RNA [ 19].
6: Secondly, the changes progress of HBMEC proteome induced by EV71 was explored.
7: We found EV71-infected HBMEC can induce 28 differently expressed protein spots compared with control.
8: These proteins might affect BBB dysfunction and lead to the development of EV71 CNS disease.

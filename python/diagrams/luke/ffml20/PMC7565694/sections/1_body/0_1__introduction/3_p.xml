<p>Many researches reported that the gas permeability of polymers was greatly determined by their chemical structures, aggregation structures, and interchain cohesion [

In this case, structural modifications are considered as effective routes to enhance the barrier performances of PIs. In our previous work, a diamine (2,7-CPDA, see

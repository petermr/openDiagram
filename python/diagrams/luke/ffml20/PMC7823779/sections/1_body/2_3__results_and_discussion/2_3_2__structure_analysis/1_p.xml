<p>In the element analysis, the mass fraction of GO and NGO are 68.8/30.6/0.6 (C/O/H) and 57.6/8.0/33.9/0.5 (C/N/O/H) respectively. After simplifying to the chemical formula, the NGO is C
 <sub>48</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>21.2</sub>N
 <sub>5.7</sub> and GO is C
 <sub>47.8</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>15.9</sub>. In the GO sheet, the number ratio of O/C is about 0.33 and the value would increase to 0.44 after nitrification.

<p>WB-MtzR displayed the most prominent downregulation trend of proteins in the antioxidant network (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, panel A), with both PFOR proteins (114 609, 17 063) downregulated, as well as PDI5 (8064), thioredoxin reductase (9827), and a putative thioredoxin (3910). This indicates strong downregulation Mtz-activating genes in WB-MtzR and contrasts with upregulation of the transcripts encoding these proteins in 713-MtzR [

Although transcriptomics previously indicated downregulation of quinone reductase as a universal mechanism of Mtz activation, the protein was not among DEPs in 106- and WB-MtzR. In 106-MtzR, NR-1 (22 766) was the only downregulated oxidoreductase enzymes. By contrast, thioredoxin reductase and glutamate dehydrogenase (21 942) were upregulated in 106-MtzR, both of which have been previously implicated in Mtz resistance but usually as being downregulated [

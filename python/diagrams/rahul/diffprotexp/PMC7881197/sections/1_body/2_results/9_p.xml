<p id="Par43">A few genes that were differentially expressed in MCF7 cells are involved in the apoptotic pathway. These genes were 
 <italic>p53</italic>, 
 <italic>p21</italic>, 
 <italic>BUB1B</italic>, 
 <italic>CASP9</italic>, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (
 <italic>HIF1α</italic>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. Some of these genes, including 
 <italic>BUB1B</italic>, 
 <italic>p53</italic>, and 
 <italic>p21</italic>, are also regulators of the cell cycle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A–F). The apoptotic pathway was shown to be stimulated in AS6-treated MCF7 cells but to be downregulated in HUMEC (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The differential expression of these genes was validated through real-time PCR and Western blotting. mRNA expression of 
 <italic>CASP9</italic> was markedly increased in MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC upon AS6 treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). However, as discussed above, the expression of 
 <italic>p53</italic> was decreased in the AS6-treated MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A–C). It appears that the decrease in 
 <italic>p53</italic> could be anti-apoptotic
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
 </sup>. However, some studies indicate that a reduction or deficiency in p53 promotes genomic instability by compromising DNA double strand break repair and thus apoptosis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>
 </sup>, which suggests that the deregulation of p53, rather than an increase or decrease in expression, results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. As shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F, in spite of the decrease in p53, the induction of p21 could be indicative of DNA damage and the onset of apoptosis in AS6-treated MCF7 cells
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup>. The reduction in 
 <italic>BUB1B</italic> mRNA and protein levels also supports an increase in chromosomal instability and apoptosis in MCF7 cells treated with AS6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E,F). In addition, immunoblotting showed a dramatic increase in HIF1α expression upon the treatment with AS6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>H; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>C). HIF1α is activated by hypoxia and can trigger apoptosis for a prolonged hypoxic condition
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. HIF1α and heat-shock proteins have a close functional relationship. HIF1α induces the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 and these heat-shock proteins play an important role in stabilizing and degrading HIF1α
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, the induction of HSP70 and HSP90 expression can indicate the cellular stress
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, we monitored mRNA and protein levels of 
 <italic>HSP70</italic> and 
 <italic>HSP90</italic> in AS6-treated MCF7 cells using RNA-seq, real-time PCR, and immunoblotting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I–K). Gene expression of 
 <italic>HSP70</italic> and 
 <italic>HSP9</italic>0 was increased in MCF7 cells upon AS6 treatment. By contrast, the transcription of these genes was not induced in HUMEC at the same concentrations of AS6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I,J; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>D). These data suggested that AS6 increases the cellular stresses in MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC at a certain range of concentrations.

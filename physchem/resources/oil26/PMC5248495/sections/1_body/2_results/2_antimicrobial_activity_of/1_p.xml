<p>The present investigation revealed that Gram-positive bacteria tested were more sensitive to all three essential oils than Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Such tendency is also observed by other authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>O.</italic> x 
 <italic>citriodorum</italic> was quite active against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>St. aureus, with the</italic> MIC of 3.125 μL/mL. The same MIC was recorded for the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> against 
 <italic>St. aureus</italic>, and O
 <italic>. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. The MIC of 
 <italic>O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and MIC of 
 <italic>O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> against 
 <italic>St. aureus</italic> were twice as high, 6.25 μL/mL. The ampicillin-resistant 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria also displayed sensitivity against the essential oils tested: thus the MIC values of 
 <italic>O.</italic> x 
 <italic>citriodorum</italic> and 
 <italic>O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> against those bacteria were 6.25 μL/mL, while 
 <italic>O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> displayed MIC of 12.5 μL/mL. The action of the essential oils on the all bacteria in this study was evaluated as bactericidal.

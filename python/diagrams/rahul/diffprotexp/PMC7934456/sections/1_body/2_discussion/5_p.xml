<p id="Par34">In the phenomenon of cytoplasmic male sterility in higher plants, mitochondrial gene mutations lead to infertility. Several crop studies have found that both early and delayed degradation of tapetum cells can lead to infertility. As a staged tissue, the tapetum provides nutrients and energy for the maturation of microspore cells. In the omics studies of Chinese cabbage [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], it has been found that the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway has an essential function in the process of male sterility. Because the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway produces many carbohydrates and various enzymes, it is closely related to plants’ average growth and development. However, due to male sterility’s complex regulatory factors, this type of gene has not been verified by molecular biology for its specific effect on male sterility. However, through additional crop omics testing and analysis, the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway is closely related to male sterility.

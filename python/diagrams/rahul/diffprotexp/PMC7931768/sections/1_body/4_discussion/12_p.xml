<p>In this pilot study, we demonstrate the ability of IFN-associated and CLE-associated gene clusters to distinguish between CLE-A and CLE-U, and HV skin. These data indicate that tape-derived RNA is a potential tool to monitor biomarkers in longitudinal CLE studies, although a study with a larger sample size is warranted to confirm the validity of this approach in CLE.</p>

0: The amount of total phenols was determined by the FolinCiocalteu reagent method as described by Scalbert et al.
1: [ 18].
2: A 10 L volume of essential oil was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol, and 0.1 mL of methanol solution was then transferred into a volumetric flask and diluted with 0.4 mL of double distilled water and used for analysis.
3: A FolinCiocalteu reagent solution 1:10  v/ v in double distilled water (1 mL) was added to the diluted methanol/oil mixture (0.5 mL), which was then mixed thoroughly and leaved for 10 minutes at room temperature.
4: A 2 mL solution based on 15% sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 310H 2O) was added; after 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 740 nm with a UV-Vis 60 Cary spectrophotometer against a blank sample that was concomitantly prepared.
5: The blank sample contained 0.1 mL of methanol without oil, 0.4 mL of water, 1 mL of a FolinCiocalteu reagent solution, and 2 mL of a Na 2CO 310H 2O solution.
6: Gallic acid was used as the standard for the calibration curve, which was drawn using solutions of the gallic acid in methanol of different concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 1 mg/mL.
7: Based on the measured absorbance at 740 nm, the concentration of phenolics was read (mg/mL) from the calibration line, and the total phenolics values were then expressed as mgGAE/gDW.
8: Each determination was made in triplicate, and average values were reported.

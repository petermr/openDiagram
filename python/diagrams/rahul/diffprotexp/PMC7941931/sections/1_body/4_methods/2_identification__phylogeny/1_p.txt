0: The Tartary buckwheat genome information was downloaded from  http://www.mbkbase.org/Pinku1 [ 58].
1: All protein sequences from annotated genes were used to build a local protein blast database in BioEdit software (Version 7.0.9.0).
2: The protein sequences of  RDR1 6,  DCL1 4,  AGO1 10,  HEN1,  HYL1,  SE, and  HST genes from  Arabidopsis thaliana were used as queries to carry out local blastp with e-values<e  5 to identify orthologs in the Tartary buckwheat genome.
3: The conserved domain of all obtained non-redundant sequences were further examined in the Pfam ( http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk) [ 75], and the final orthologs were ensured.
4: The RDR, DCL, and AGO protein sequences from Tartary buckwheat,  Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and maize were used to construct the phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method in MEGA 7.0.21 software.
5: Expression analysis of these identified miRNA biosynthesis genes in Tartary buckwheat was performed using RNA-seq data from 4 organs (root, stem, leaf, and flower) [ 58] and three developmental-stage seeds [ 46].
6: The expression heatmaps of these genes were generated by using TBtools software [ 76].

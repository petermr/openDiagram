<p id="Par36">To better understand the functions of these DEMs, their predicted target genes were investigated and further subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. A total of 1534 target genes were identified for among 74 DEMs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). Of these target genes, 850, 765, and 735 genes were targeted by 44, 41, and 22 DEMs in the S1 vs. S2, S1 vs. S3, and S2 vs. S3 comparisons, respectively. GO analysis showed that 514, 448, and 419 targets were assigned to biological processes, cellular component, and molecular function categories for the S1 vs. S2, S1 vs. S3, and S2 vs. S3 comparisons, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). There were 18, 14, and 14 GO terms in biological processes, cellular component, and molecular function categories for each comparison, respectively. The “metabolic process”, “cell part”, and “catalytic activity” were the greatest abundance terms for these three categories (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). KEGG analysis displayed that a total of 332, 309, and 272 target genes were assigned to 61, 54, and 55 KEGG pathways for the S1 vs. S2, S1 vs. S3, and S2 vs. S3 comparisons (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S10), respectively. Most of these pathways were involved in the metabolism process, of which biosynthesis of “amino acids biosynthesis” (ko01230), “starch and sucrose metabolism” (ko00500) “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” (ko00940), “purine metabolism” (ko00230), and “amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism” (ko00520) were the major pathways. In addition, a high number target genes were assigned to “plant hormone signal transduction” (ko04075). The top 50 pathways for each comparison are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3.

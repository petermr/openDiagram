0: First, the flower bud sections were treated with 75, 85, and 95% alcohol in a water bath of 58 C each for 90 s each, followed by n-butanol and absolute ethanol at varying ratios 1:1 and 3:1 at 58 C twice for 90 s each.
1: Finally, the pre-embedding treatment of the micro-cut material was completed by treatment with n-butanol at 58 C for 90 s. Subsequently, the sample was immersed in paraffin at 65 C three times for 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min each, and then embedded in an embedding box.
2: Slides with glass slide membrane were treated with RNase and 75% alcohol.
3: The thickness of the sections was selected according to the depth of the treated material.

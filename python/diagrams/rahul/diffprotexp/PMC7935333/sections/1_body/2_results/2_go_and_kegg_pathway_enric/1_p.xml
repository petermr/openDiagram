<p>GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed to further explore the biological functions of the identified DEGs. The biological process category of the GO analysis results showed that up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, mammary gland alveolus development and cell adhesion. For the cellular component category, these DEGs were enriched in the extracellular matrix, basement membrane and extracellular exosome. Moreover, the DEGs were significantly enriched in platelet-derived growth factor binding and extracellular matrix structural constituent under the molecular function category (

In addition, the most significantly enriched GO terms for down-regulated genes were cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization (BP); plasma membrane and integrin complex (CC); T cell receptor binding and cell adhesion molecule binding (MF;

<p>In the process of charging and discharging, the concentration of the lithium ion in the solid phase of the electrode material is dynamic. According to

 <italic>S</italic> is a state function independent of the process, that is to say, it is not affected by the charging and discharging process and only changes with the concentration of the lithium ion. The relationship between them can be expressed by the entropy change curve. Currently, the entropy curves of many electrode materials and full-cells have been reported, including Li

<p id="Par38">To compare our findings with those from overexpression of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> in the human SVOG3e cell line [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], we intersected our list of 939 DEGs of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> vs. Vector with the corresponding published list of 471 DEGs, and identified 90 common genes (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S8). Among these genes, we found TGFB2, EGR1, NFKBIZ, SDC, and SDCBD which are homologues genes to the obtained ones in our previous analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, d). Chip-seq data were also compared to the DEGs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7B). Gene Ontology analysis of these 90 genes revealed cancer-related regulatory pathways (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S8C).

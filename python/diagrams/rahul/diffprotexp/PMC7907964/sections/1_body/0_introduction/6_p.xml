<p>Primary skin fibroblasts reflect genetic changes in patients, and are useful models to study PD (
 <xref rid="b20-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Previously, skin fibroblasts from patients with PD with heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants, as well as from healthy controls were analysed, and it was observed that the GBA-PD group showed slightly lower activities of the complexes II, IV and V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain than the PARK2-PD group (
 <xref rid="b21-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The present study investigated the GCase activity in primary skin fibroblasts of 4 patients with PD, including two heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants and two heterozygous 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants, and this was compared with 4 heathy controls. MS and label-free quantitative proteomic analysis were performed to identify potential target proteins associated with the disease.

<p>A total of 36 quinoa samples comprised of three varieties (
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), two harvest time-points, and three biological replicates were either inoculated with CMV or inoculation buffer. By 4 days after inoculation with CMV, chlorotic local lesions developed across all replicates of ‘QQ74’ and ‘Jessie’, whereas all replicates of the bitter variety ‘Red Head’ had local systemic chlorosis that was not spread throughout the plant (

<p>Platelet aggregation was performed using an aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA, USA). In a special tube containing 400 μl of washed platelets at 37 °C with continual stirring at 1000 rpm, the aggregation was stimulated with aggregating agents, thrombin (0.1 U/ml) and ADP (1 μM). For test studies, platelets were preincubated with different concentrations of AcEO (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml) for 1 min in the cuvette before the stimulation by the aggregating agents cited above. In all experiments, the platelet aggregation was then recorded during 5 min. AcEO was dissolved in 0.5% DMSO. Control experiments demonstrated that the concentrations of DMSO had no significant effect on the aggregatory effect.</p>

0: CLE diagnosis and follow-up is often supported by histological examination requiring a punch biopsy.
1: 26 Disadvantages with punch biopsy include pain, localised bleeding, infection and potential scarring.
2: 27 Consequently, this technique may impede patient recruitment into clinical trials and decrease patient compliance for follow-up visits.
3: Development of a non-invasive technique for CLE biomarker assessment would offer a significant advantage for patient well-being while permitting monitoring of lesions over time.

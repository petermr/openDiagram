 <caption> Characteristics of the curated human small-airway epithelial cell (hSAEC) transcriptome. ( A) Size distribution of transcripts for multi-exon and mono-exon genes. ( B) Number of isoforms per gene. ( C) Comparison of isoforms identified for annotated vs. novel genes. ( D) Percentage of reverse transcriptase (RT) switching. Note that full splice match (FSM) and incomplete splice match (ISM) switching is 0%. ( E) Distance of annotated reads to known transcription start sites (TSS). Note the high percentage of reads mapped within 20 nt of known TSS, indicating high-quality reverse transcription of the complementary DNA (cDNA) library. ( F) Distribution of transcripts to known polyadenylation (polyA) sites. The median location is within 18 nt of known polyA sites for all transcript categories. </caption>

<p>Adding a second metal in the transition metal-based OER catalyst can improve significantly its catalytic properties. In particular, bimetallic oxides have attracted significant attention by outperforming the corresponding monometallic counterparts.

 </sup> Among others, Niâ€“Fe oxide electrocatalysts are considered very promising catalysts for OER in alkaline conditions. While the performance of pure iron oxides for OER is poor (in part, because of their low electrical conductivity),

 </sup> the addition of iron to nickel oxides results in one of the most active catalysts among all nonprecious metal systems.

<p id="Par38">To further confirm these identified key miRNA-mRNA pairs related to Tartary buckwheat seed development, qRT-PCR and 5′-RLM-RACE were performed to analyze fta-miR156c-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG0000496000.01</italic>, fta-miR164a-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG0000240100.01</italic>, fta-miR166c-3p-FtPinG0008845600.01, fta-miR167c-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG0002560000.01</italic>, fta-miR396a-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG0000680700.01</italic>, and fta_novel_miR118-
 <italic>FtPinG0003617400.01</italic> pairs, which were involved in seed size, cell differentiation and proliferation, and auxin response, respectively. qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression of these miRNAs was obviously negatively correlated with their corresponding target genes expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). 5′-RLM-RACE results showed that these miRNAs could cleave their corresponding target genes (Fig.

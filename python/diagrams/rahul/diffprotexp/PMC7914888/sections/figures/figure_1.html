 <caption> Exposure to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU for 72 h in B16F1 cells generates a reduction in the number of cells and affects melanin concentration. ( a) Representative photographs of B16F1 cells exposed to 5 mM L-Tyr or 2.5 μg/mL 5-Brd-2′-dU after 72 h. ( b) Quantification of the number of viable cells by Trypan Blue exclusion assay. ( c) The number of cells in supernatants that incorporate Propidium Iodide (I.P.). ( d) Changes in B16F1 cell number by MTT assay and population doubling times. ( e) Frequency histograms of DNA content. Permeable cells incorporated PI; the cell cycle analysis corresponds to a univariate Gaussian distribution model. FlowJo algorithm function revealed phase S cells, ( f) Melanin concentration from B16F1 cells after exposure to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU by spectrophotometry fluorescence. The significance (*) using two-tailed multiple t-tests, and the differences were considered statistically significant for a p-value &lt; 0.05 using Welch’s correction. significant (*) with p &lt; 0.05, very significant (**) with p &lt; 0.01, highly significant (***) with p &lt; 0.001 and very highly significant (****) with p &lt; 0.0001. </caption>

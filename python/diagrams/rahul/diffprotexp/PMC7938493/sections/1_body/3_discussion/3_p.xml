<p id="Par61">The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed RBPs were significantly enriched for aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, methionine metabolism, lysine degradation, and 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism. A previous study reported that the faithful translation of genetic information from mRNA to protein is determined by two factors: the availability of aminoacyl-tRNAs composed of cognate amino acid-tRNAs pairs and the accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome. Therefore, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, which is mediated by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, is crucial for translational quality control [

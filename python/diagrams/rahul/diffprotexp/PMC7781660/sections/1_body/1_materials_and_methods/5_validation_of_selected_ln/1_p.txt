0: To validate the accuracy of the Illumina sequencing data, thirteen DE mRNAs, and eight DE lncRNAs were selected at random and examined by RT-qPCR assay with SYBR Green Master (Takara, Dalian, China) on a 7500 real-time PCR system (ABI, USA).
1: PCR primers were designed according to the target mRNAs and lncRNAs using Oligo 7.0 software, whose specificity was evaluated by BLAST analysis and smelting curve analysis of amplicons, and only the primers can be used until amplification efficiency reached 90110%.
2: The details of the specific primers used in this study are listed in  Table 1.
3: The -actin was used as an internal reference gene to normalize the expression of the selected target mRNAs and lncRNAs.
4: All qPCRs were performed in three technical replicates.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) or Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) were evaluated for each set of wells. For the MIC evaluation, a loopful of broth was collected from those wells where any growth was observed and then was further inoculated on sterile Mueller-Hinton medium broth for bacteria and Sabouraud medium for yeasts by streaking. The plates were then inoculated with microorganism and were incubated at 37&#176;C for 24&#8201;h. After incubation, the lowest concentration was considered as MBC (for bacteria) and MFC (for yeasts) and presented in <italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL, at which no visible growth was observed.</p>

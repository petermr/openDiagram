 <caption> Sets of miRNAs show coordinated expression patterns in the differential pigmentation model and reduced proliferation induced in melanoma B16F1 cells. Sets of over-and under-expressed miRNAs and their potential candidate genes associated with cell cycle and senescence control ( a) and melanogenesis ( b) using the TargetScanMouse tool version 7.1. ( c) Relative expression radius (rER) of miRNAs by RT-qPCR stem-loop for miRNAs 211-5p, 148b-3p, 470-5p, 129-5p, 27b-3p, 470-3p and 30d-5p ( n = 3). ( d) Co-expression networks from normalized Small RNA-Seq count of under-expressed miRNAs of B16F1 cells exposed to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2â€²-dU. The level of significance (*) using two-tailed multiple t-tests. The differences were considered statistically significant for a p-value &lt; 0.05, ns: not significant. Significant (*) with p &lt; 0.05, very significant (**) with p &lt; 0.01, highly significant (***) with p &lt; 0.001. </caption>

0: Two different martensite morphologies occurred in steel in the delivered state.
1: The first form was represented by lath martensite, and the second was the occurrence of plate martensite.
2: Lattice martensite occurs predominantly in steels that have a lower carbon content and medium content of additive alloying elements.
3: In contrast to steels with a medium carbon content, martensite morphology is formed with both types.
4: Small dimension of the lath martensite structure brings significant effect on the strengthening mechanism.

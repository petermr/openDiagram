<p>In the present study, firstly, RNA-sequence analysis showed that 46,934,632 reads were obtained in the CE-R group, 76.60% of which matched the reference genome. The number of unique match reads was 30,693,890, accounting for 65.40% of the total reads. Similarly, 47,203,918 reads were obtained in the CE-NR group, with 81.71% matching to the reference genome. The number of unique match reads was 27,695,773, accounting for 58.67% of the total. Detailed information is listed in

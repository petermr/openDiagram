<p>Imaging of precipitates of dimensions below about 1 Âµm is commonly done by TEM (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>,

 <xref rid="B143-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. In this work, bright-field TEM images and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) images from (scanning) TEM are used. In TEM, additional analysis with EDS allows conclusions to be drawn on the elemental composition of certain relevant particles, down to precipitate structures composed of just a few layers of atoms [

 <xref rid="B143-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. When using TEM, information on local crystal structures can be generated by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) or nanobeam diffraction (NBD).

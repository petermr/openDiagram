<p id="Par15">Phase I can be easily recognised in MD by ordering of the molecular centres on the hcp lattice, and disorder of the orientations. Although frequently referred to as a free-rotor phase, we find this to be true only at low pressures. As pressure is increased the angular momentum auto-correlation becomes shorter than a single rotation, and then acquires a negative component, indicating that the molecule is librating.</p>

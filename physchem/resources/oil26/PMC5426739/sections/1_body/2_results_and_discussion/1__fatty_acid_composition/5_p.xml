<p> Based on the high content of linolenic acid in flaxseed oil, which is about 50 times higher than olive and sesame oils (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), addition of flaxseed oil to sesame and olive oil mixtures caused an effective decrease in ω
 <sub>6</sub>:ω
 <sub>3</sub> ratio (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which is very important from nutritional prospective. Therefore, blending flaxseed oil with other vegetable oils which are low in ω
 <sub>3</sub> fatty acid can change their fatty acid composition and increase ω
 <sub>3</sub> fatty acid content. Samples containing 10% and 15% flaxseed have optimal levels of ω
 <sub>6</sub>:ω
 <sub>3</sub> ratio as stated in the literature for better health achievement (

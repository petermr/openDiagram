<p>The fragmentation spectra from the RP-nano-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis were searched against a nonredundant protein database by MASCOT. When a protein was identified by three or more unique peptides possessing MASCOT scores, no visual assessment of spectra was conducted and the protein was considered present in the sample. All Mascot results were manually confirmed by visual assessment of the MS/MS spectra for overall quality. In addition, the criterion for manual validation reported by Jaffe et al. was used [

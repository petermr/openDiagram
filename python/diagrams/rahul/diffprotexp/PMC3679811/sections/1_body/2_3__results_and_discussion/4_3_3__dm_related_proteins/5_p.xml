<p>HP is synthesized in the liver as a proprotein, processed by proteolytic cleavage into 
 <italic>α</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic> subunits, and released into the bloodstream as a tetrameric protein. The expression of the HP subunits has caught the attention of investigators because of their exceptionally high degree of stimulation by cytokines and dexamethasone [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, the expression of HP was downregulated in DM patients. HP is a defensive response protein, which may control the equilibrium between tolerance and immunity to nonself antigens. In addition, high blood glucose may cause chronic systemic inflammation. Thus, DM patients need to take medication to control blood glucose and inflammation, which may due to the downregulation of HP.

The DTG and DTA curves were recorded in terms of percentage weight loss per minute and temperature difference in mV (for DT). Powder sample (7.34&#160;mg) was heated in a platinum crucible under the furnace atmosphere at a heating rate of 20&#160;&#176;C/min up to the final temperature performed of 800&#160;&#176;C. The &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (6&#160;mg) was used as a reference material.</p>

<p>Western blot analysis was performed to ensure the reliability of the MAlDI-TOFâ€“TOF-MS/MS results. Selected differentially expressed proteins in cell samples were verified as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. HBMEC infection, protein extraction and protein concentrations were performed as previously described in this study. Rabbit anti-DJ-1, vimentin and heat shock proteins 27 polyclonal antibodies were primary antibodies for the immunodetection. HRP-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody (Santa, USA). Tubulin and GAPDH (Santa, USA) was used as a loading control. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence with ChemiDocXRC+ Imaging System (Bio-Rad, USA) using ECL detection reagents (GE Healthcare, USA). Quantification of the detected bands density value was performed using the version 4.6.2 Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, USA). All immunoblots were run at least in triplicate.

  <p>Comprehensive molecular profiling of m
   <sup>5</sup>C writers and reader in GI cancer. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The workflow of the study. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The regulation mechanism of m
   <sup>5</sup>C in GI cancers (esophageal cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer). m
   <sup>5</sup>C formation is catalyzed by writer and SAM (
   <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine). In addition, reader can recognize methylated mRNA and mediate its export from the nucleus. They work together on m
   <sup>5</sup>C RNA methylation modification.

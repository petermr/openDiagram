<p>The nature of the polymer-drug interactions was studied by electrical conductance measurements on various PC12: antibiotic aqueous solutions with different pH values. For these measurements, similar in principle to conductometric titrations, a starting 1 g polymers/dL solution was used, corresponding to the PC12 formulation, with pH values of 3 and 7.3. Antibiotic solutions of 0.20 g/L concentration, with the same pH values (3, respectively, 7.3) were added stepwise in aliquots of 100 Î¼L to 50 mL of the polymer solution. After each addition, the solutions were magnetically stirred at 100 rpm for 10 min, following the measuring of the electrical conductance (

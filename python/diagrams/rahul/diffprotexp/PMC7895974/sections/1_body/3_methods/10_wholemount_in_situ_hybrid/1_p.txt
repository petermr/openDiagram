0: Wholemount in situ hybridisation using DIG-UTP labelled antisense RNA probes for  MEOX1 (a gift from Baljinder Mankoo, Kings College London UK) and  TCF15 (a gift from Susanne Dietrich, University of Portsmouth UK) was carried out using standard methods.
1: Briefly, following fixation in 4% PFA embryos were treated with Proteinase K, hybridised over night at 65 C. After post-hybridisation washes and blocking with BMB (Roche), embryos were treated with anti-DIG antibody, coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche).
2: Signal was developed using NBT/BCIP.

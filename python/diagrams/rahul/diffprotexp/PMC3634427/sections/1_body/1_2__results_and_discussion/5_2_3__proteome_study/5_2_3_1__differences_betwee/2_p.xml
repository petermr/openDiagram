<p>In the present work, from the 94 identified proteins, 48 appear to be differentially expressed when we compared 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> control to Désirée control (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-14-04912">Table 1</xref>). Among those, 32 spots are more abundant in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic>, and 13 of those spots contain ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO). Although there is no evidence that the RuBisCO activity is different in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>, RuBisCO from 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> has been shown to be more stable during freeze-thaw cycles than 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijms-14-04912">39</xref>]. We observe that nine spots that contain RuBisCO decrease in abundance when Désirée plants are submitted to chilling temperatures, whereas, in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic>, their change is not significant, except for one spot that increases in abundance.

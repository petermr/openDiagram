<p>Tensile results for 0.10C-1.50Cr steels with different processing are summarized in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-04136-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Microhardness (
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>v</sub>) measurement results agreed reasonably well with the tensile data. In summary, the strength decreased, and the elongation increased after spheroidization annealing. This was mainly because of the spheroidization of lamellar cementite and the elimination of grain boundary network cementite. After cold rolling, the strength of 0.10C-1.50Cr steel increased, and the elongation decreased. The plasticity after cold drawing decreased because the average size and the ratio of larger cementite particles were larger than those after cold rolling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f003">Figure 3</xref>g), and the increasing strength was associated with the high dislocation density in the cold drawn steel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). Generally, cold deformation leads to work hardening, introducing a large number of low-angle grain boundaries, and some cementite particles are dissolved, coarsened, and combined. After the heat treatment, the size of cementite particles decreased and became uniform, but the ferrite grains became coarser.

<p>IFN-I can be produced by every cell in the CNS. It has been suggested that once the BBB integrity is compromised, type I IFNs produced by both infiltrating dendritic cells and CNS-resident cells would modulate the antiviral response and leukocyte trafficking to the brain [

 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> (or IFNAR
 <sup>−/-</sup>) mice are highly susceptible to SLEV infection, succumbing to the disease on day 3 p.i. whereas WT mice succumb on day 7 p.i. Increased viral load and deficient ISG expression were found in the brain of ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice but not in WT mice, congruent with the protective role of type I IFN described in several flaviviral diseases [
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The lack of type I IFN responses in ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice led to an early increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels in the brain as well as early caspase-3 cleavage. However, no significant differences in brain leukocyte infiltration or in brain histopathological features were found between WT and ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice, suggesting SLEV-infected ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice die before leukocyte recruitment to the CNS takes place in this model.

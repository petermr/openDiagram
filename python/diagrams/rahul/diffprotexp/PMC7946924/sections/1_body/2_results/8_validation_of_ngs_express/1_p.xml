<p id="Par35">Out of the differentially gene expressed (DGE) miRNAs, 9 were selected for validation in qRT-PCR studies mostly based on high read count, higher p values and fold change reversed from positive to negative and 
 <italic>vice-versa</italic> between different stages of grain development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These miRNAs were namely-miR398b, miR529b, miR530-5p, miR820C, miR2055, miR2106, miR2877, miR396h and miR166c-3p. Fold change values of DGE either positive or negative exhibited similar pattern of expression with that of qRT-PCR analysis. Of the nine selected, 42.3% of the qRT-PCR values had concordance with the fold change values obtained from the NGS analysis. The highest up-regulation of 3.1 fold in the Log
 <sub>10</sub> scale was detected in case of MIR398b in apical spikelets of SR-157 on day 5 post anthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). Whereas, highest down-regulation of − 0.96fold in the log 10 scale was detected in case of MIR820c in basal spikelet of SR-157 on 10 day after anthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d).

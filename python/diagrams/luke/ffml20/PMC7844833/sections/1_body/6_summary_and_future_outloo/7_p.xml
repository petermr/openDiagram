<p>On the data analysis part of the problem, an ongoing trend is the development of tools that allow the integration of the insight from theory (e.g., DFT modeling and molecular dynamics) into the XAS interpretation process. Recent progress in machine learning methods allows one to significantly simplify this process, and to employ artificial intelligence to identify the link between the theoretical models and features in the experimental data.

 </sup> Equally important is the development of model optimization approaches (such as reverse Monte Carlo modeling) that allow one to combine insights from different experimental techniques to construct a single structure model of the catalyst consistent with all available information.

<p>To further ascertain the ability of PirB protein to induce apoptosis in shrimp hemocytes, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were carried out. First, healthy laboratory acclimatized shrimp were divided into two groups (30 each). One group of shrimps was each injected at the third abdominal segment with 0.8 µM rPirB, while the other group of shrimps was each injected with an equal volume of PBS (negative control). Hemocytes collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-treatment were stained with the Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide apoptosis detection kit and analyzed by flow cytometry. Triplicate samples were analyzed per treatment for at least three independent experiments.

0: The nasal route represents a promising noninvasive alternative route of drug delivery for treatment of different conditions.
1: Rapid absorption of drugs into systemic circulation is permitted through the porous endothelial membrane of the lush vascular capillary layer beneath the nasal mucosa (Illum,  2002).
2: Moreover, nasal delivery improves poor bioavailability and avoid hepatic first pass metabolism and drug degradation in gastrointestinal tract (Khan et al.,  2018).
3: This route is adopted also for local drug delivery to avoid the systemic exposure to certain drugs and reduce the related side effects (Djupesland et al.,  2013).

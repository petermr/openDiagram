<p>Similar problems occur in the dilatometric measurement of quench-induced precipitation. Modern dilatometers have a very high resolution for length changes, which even allow the detection of early cluster formation in age-hardening Al alloys [

Nevertheless, the changes in the volume of a sample during cluster formation and precipitation are affected by the complex interplay between the volume changes in the matrix crystals and the volume changes due to the precipitated phase. That is, in some cases, precipitation can cause volumetric expansion of the sample, while precipitation of another phase can cause volumetric contraction [

 <xref rid="B84-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The latter aspect complicates the evaluation of dilatometric measurements of quench-induced precipitation, as different phases that precipitate during cooling can cause opposite changes in length.

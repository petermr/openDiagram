<p id="Par28">It should also be noted that the special topology of reaction networks makes model evaluation for REs in a strict statistical learning framework difficult. The reaction network Rad-6-RE contains most of the Rad-6 molecules. Computing the REs for this network is therefore not a pure prediction, as some molecules in each reaction may be in the training set. In principle, it would be desirable to evaluate the performance on a separate reaction network that contains no training molecules at all. However, this can only be achieved in two ways: Either the test network contains no small molecules like CO and OH, or these molecules are excluded from the training set. The former option leads to a very unnatural reaction network, that misses the most frequent classes of bond-breaking events. Meanwhile, the latter option leads to a very poor training set, and thus an overly pessimistic estimate of model performance.</p>

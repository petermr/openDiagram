<p id="Par9">To investigate the physiological and biochemical changes in COVID-19 patients, we collected longitudinal blood samples from 33 COVID-19 patients, including 18 severe patients, 11 critical non-survivors, and 4 critical survivors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In total, we assessed 113 whole blood samples and 85 serum samples collected over 2–7 longitudinal time-points from 0 to 55 days after hospital admission (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). There were no significant differences in age or sex between critical non-survivors and survivors, and the effects of age and sex were adjusted in our further analysis (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Basic demographic information stratified by disease severity is detailed in Additional file

<p id="Par48">The MS-dependent identification of serum biomarkers has recently emerged [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. SWATH-MS is a newly developed technology, which combines the advantages and characteristics of traditional “shotgun” proteomics and selective reaction monitoring/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SWATH-MS technology can obtain all fragment information of all ions in the sample without omission and difference, while PRM technology can achieve the absolute quantification of protein expression. The combination of the two strategies can be used for the efficient, comprehensive and accurate screening of potential biomarkers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this study, we performed SWATH-MS analysis to identify DEPs specific for LAC in patients with T2DM, and these potential biomarkers were validated by PRM-MS and ELISA analysis in the discovery and validation cohort.

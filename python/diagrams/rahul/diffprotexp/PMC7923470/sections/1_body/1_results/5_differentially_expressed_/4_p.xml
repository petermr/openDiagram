<p id="Par47">A probable carboxylesterase 18 was highly expressed in MT as compared to WT (92.9-fold increase in the expression). These genes have been functionally associated with plant height in maize through genome-wide association studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (
 <italic>Ma04_g38030</italic>) was highly expressed in MT. These are implicated in early seedling growth after germination and have shown significantly longer roots and shoots as compared to non-transformed plants [

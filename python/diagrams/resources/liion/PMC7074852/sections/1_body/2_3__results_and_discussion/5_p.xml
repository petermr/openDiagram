 <sup>−1</sup>, there are large specific capacity losses in the first charge/discharge cycle. We attribute them to some irreversible electrochemical reactions, including the SEI film formation, electrolyte decomposition, and so on. This phenomenon can be observed for most anode materials, which leads to the low coulombic efficiency in the first cycle and explains a large difference in the peak position of the reduction peak between the first and the second cycles in the CV test. The NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> electrode shows a specific discharge capacity of 743 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> in second cycle, and the specific capacity declines to 245 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 50 cycles. The CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> electrode shows a specific discharge capacity of 690 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at the second cycle, while the specific capacity is attenuated to 375 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 50 cycles. The Cu

 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, which can be regarded as a compound of CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance. The specific discharge capacity of Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> is maintained 880 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> from the second to the fiftieth cycle, and the coulombic efficiency close to 100%. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00191-f007">Figure 7</xref>b, the change of the specific capacity of the three samples with the number of cycles is clearly visible. The capacities of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> material go through a huge decay after 20 cycles, which is due to material pulverization. Meanwhile, Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>′s capacity has been well-maintained. The electrochemical stability is significantly improved because of better electronic conductivity of Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and the synergistic effect of the elements. Due to the various insertion voltages for the metal oxides, the other inactive metal oxides can be “volume-buffering reservoir” to release volume stress when the active metal oxide is in a lithiation/delithiation process at a certain voltage [
 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The capacity rate performance of Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> was also studied and the results are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00191-f007">Figure 7</xref>c. The charge/discharge current density gradually increases to 2000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> and then returns to 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The charge-discharge voltage platform was found to be almost kept same. The stable reversible discharge capacities decrease from 830 to 150 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> as the current density increases from 200 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> to 2000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, when the current density is restored to 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the discharge capacity is 780 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is ca. 88% of the initial discharge capacity. These results demonstrate that the Cu

 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> has a better rate performance and a higher cycling stability.

<p id="Par45">We next validated the protein abundance changes of PZP and IGFBP3 using commercially available antibodies and ELISA kits. The concentration-dependent standard curve is shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2. To evaluate the feasibility of developing an assay that could be more easily deployed in a clinical environment, we assessed the transferability of the PRM-MS-based results to ELISA. The levels of PZP and IGFBP3 were quantified by commercially available ELISA kits, and the correlation with the results obtained by PRM-MS was evaluated. The results showed a linear correlation for PZP but not IGFBP3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3). In addition, the level of PZP between the T2DM + LAC and T2DM groups was significantly different in the discovery set, the validation set and the whole set, and the ROC analysis indicated an AUC of 0.742 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b–e). However, no significant difference was observed in IGFBP3 levels between these two groups (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3). In summary, detection of PZP level provides enough sensitivity and specificity, and it merits further validation in larger cohort samples.

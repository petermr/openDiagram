 <caption> An example of the results of genetic analysis of ToxB sensitivity in the ‘NIAB Elite MAGIC’ population. Presented here are the outputs using composite interval mapping (CIM), covariates = 10. (A) QTLs found across all 21 wheat chromosomes with 1 (1A), 2 (1B), 3 (1D), 4 (2A) through to 21 (7D). (B) Chromosome 2B, showing the major ToxB sensitivity locus, Tsc2. (C) Chromosome 2A, showing the putative minor ToxB sensitivity QTL located at ~ 142 cM </caption>

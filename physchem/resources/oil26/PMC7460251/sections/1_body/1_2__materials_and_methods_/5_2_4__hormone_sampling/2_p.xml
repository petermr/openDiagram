<p>Fecal hormone metabolites were extracted and analyzed using methods reported in Allard et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, samples were lyophilized and sifted, and then, 0.2 ± 0.01 g fecal powder was extracted in 2.0 mL, 90% ethanol by shaking, centrifuging, and evaporating the supernatant under forced air at 35 °C. Samples were reconstituted in assay buffer, and FGM concentrations were measured using a commercial assay kit for corticosterone (#K014-H1, Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor MI) that was previously validated chemically and biologically for these aardvarks at the Detroit Zoo [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and samples with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 15% were reanalyzed. The average intra-assay CV was 1.76%. Internal controls were analyzed on each plate, and the average inter-assay CV was 2.82%. Based on the previous validation results [

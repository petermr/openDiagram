<p id="Par64">The biological functions predicted for proteins downregulated on P3 relative P14 and P30, as well as proteins exclusively expressed on P14 and P30 relative to P3, are associated with neurological disease as well as tissue development and morphology. This result suggests that these proteins may function in sensorineural hearing loss and that some development and maintenance continues after the onset of hearing. There were three proteins associated with neurological disease as well as tissue development, including ADP/ATP translocase 2 (Slc25a5), 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (Cnp), and sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (Atp1b1). Slc25a5 plays a role in ion transport and Cnp is a membrane-bound protein that serves as a regulator of tubulin polymerization and microtubule distribution [

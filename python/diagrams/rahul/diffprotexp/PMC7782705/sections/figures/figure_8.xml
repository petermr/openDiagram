  <title>Expression of AD risk/causal genes is mostly altered in the TL of patients.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold> Heatmap showing the expression of predicted AD risk/causal genes in different cell types of the adult human brain. DEGs and gDTUs in at least one dataset are highlighted in red. 
   <bold>B</bold> Venn diagram showing the number of AD risk/causal DEGs or gDTUs identified in the different datasets analyzed. The intersection between Mayo and MSBB TL is highlighted in yellow, and genes identified are shown in the yellow box. 
   <bold>C</bold> Representation of the 6 most significant BIN1 isoforms altered (left) and quantification of the differential isoform fraction (dIF) in AD brains compared to controls (right). Main protein domains are indicated with different colors. 
   <bold>D</bold> Similar representation for APP. * dIF &gt;0.05 and FDR &gt; 0.01.

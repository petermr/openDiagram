<p id="Par7">Time-series sampling of patients can capture the dynamic nature of disease over time and highlight the biological changes that occur as disease progresses. Previous longitudinal studies of COVID-19 have primarily focused on the immune response against pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At present, sequencing-based multiscale changes among critical COVID-19 patients and their potential correlation with clinical trajectory remain unknown. Exploration of these molecular changes could contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 and help uncover potential therapeutic targets. Many studies have shown that comorbidities impact the COVID-19 prognosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, we studied patients without selected comorbidities (see Methods).

<p>Apart from the proteins that change in quantity in all the studied conditions, other proteins vary their abundance only under osmotic stress. We found some proteins that decrease in abundance only in Désirée, like triose phosphate isomerase and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase. Triose phosphate isomerase has been found to decrease under stress conditions, such as ozone [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ijms-14-04912">64</xref>]. In the processes of glycolytic synthesis of ATP, triose phosphate isomerase catalyzed the isomerization of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The decrease in abundance of this and other proteins could lead to an inhibition of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, consequently, arrest mitochondrial metabolism under oxidative stress conditions, leading to the prevention of the deleterious production of reactive oxygen species [

<p>There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, this study calculated the TME score of tumor tissues based on mRNA expression data using the ESTIMATE algorithm and the fraction of the immune cells using the CIBERSORT algorithm. These algorithms are still in the exploratory stage. More optimization of the algorithms is needed in the future to be closer to the real world. Second, we found three hub genes, but it is unclear through what functions and pathways these genes affect TME and prognosis, and further studies are needed in the future. In addition, we included a limited number of patients for IHC validation. The sample size should be enlarged in future studies.</p>

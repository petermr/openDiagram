0: Western blot analysis was used to determine protein levels, as described previously 39.
1: Equal amounts of samples were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and were then blotted to a poly-vinylidine difluoride membrane.
2: Subsequently the membrane was blocked and then incubated overnight at 4 C with polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti--actin polyclonal antibodies (Beyotime) used as the internal reference antibody.
3: The membrane was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Millipore, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelynes, France).
4: Band densities were quantified using the LAS3000 apparatus (Fujifilm, Raytest, Courbevoie, France), and normalized to the total amount of -actin.

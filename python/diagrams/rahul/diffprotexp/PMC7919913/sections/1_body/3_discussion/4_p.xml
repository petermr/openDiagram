<p>Myocardial remodeling is an important pathological mechanism in the progression of heart failure, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is one of the characteristics of myocardial remodeling. Arginine binding protein 2 (SORBS2) and ENH are reported to be associated with myocardial hypertrophy [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. SORBS2 regulates the biological effects of cardiomyocytes, such as the assembly of myofibrils, and depletion of SORBS2 leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ENH mediates the phosphorylation of L-type calcium channel by protein kinase D (PKD) 1, and the over-activation of PKD results in myocardial hypertrophy. ENHâ€“deficient mice manifest as myocardial contractile dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. According to the prediction of Targetscan and results of previous studies, it is found that SORBS2 and ENH are the target genes of miR-21. Therefore, we examined the role of miR-21 contained in MVs on SORBS2 and ENH in the progression of myocardial hypertrophy. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> shows that the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH were inhibited by transfection of miR-21 mimic, while they were induced by miR-21 inhibitor, indicating that SORBS2 and ENH were the target genes of miR-21 in cardiomyocytes. Our further investigation found that miR-21 presented in MVs could induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy

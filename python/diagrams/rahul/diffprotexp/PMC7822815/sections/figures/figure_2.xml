   <bold>a</bold> Vulcano plot showing differential splicing of exons identified by limma/diffSplice algorithm. Orange rhombi indicated differentially used exon-exon junctions (diffEEJs) with more than 2-fold change and 
   <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.1. 
   <bold>b</bold> Venn diagramme showing the overlap between diffEEJs identified by limma/diffSplice and JunctionSeq algorithms. 
   <bold>c</bold> Venn diagramme showing overlap of genes with diffUEs identified by limma/diffSplice and JunctionSeq algorithms. 
   <bold>d</bold> Pie charts showing the classification of diffEEJs and non-differential exon-exon junctions (non-diffEEJs) according to the modes of alternative splicing. Numbers indicate the percentage of splicing events assigned to a particular mode of splicing. Complex splicing means several (two or more) alternative splicing events occurred simultaneously. 
   <bold>e</bold> Distribution of the splice sites with diffEEJs and non-diffEEJs among the various functional types of exons. P-values were calculated with 
   <italic>χ</italic>
   <sup>2</sup> test. Panels 
   <bold>a</bold> to 
   <bold>e</bold> are based on data from Kasumi-1 cells.

0: We used the standard procedures for the extraction of total RNAs from WT and MT pseudostems, which involved the use of Spin Column Plant total RNA Purification Kit (Tiandz, Beijing, China) [ 75].
1: Further, the RNAs purity was assessed, the extracted RNAs were quantified, and their integrity was checked.
2: Following these steps, sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) as reported earlier [ 76,  77].

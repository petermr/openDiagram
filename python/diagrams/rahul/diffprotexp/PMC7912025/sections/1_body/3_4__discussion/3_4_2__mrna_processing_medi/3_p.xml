<p>A focus of this work, both IFN signaling and IFN regulators, IRF/NFÎºB are known to be major components of the RSV-inducible genomic response. We and others have shown that RSV replication is a potent inducer of type I and III IFNs, proteins that play important roles in the local antiviral response, immune activation, and cell fate determination [

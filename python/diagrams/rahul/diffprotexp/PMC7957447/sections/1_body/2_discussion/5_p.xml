<p id="Par22">In summary, we identified many different characteristics between critical COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors by leveraging a multi-omics view on longitudinally collected samples. Notably, transcriptional transition may be associated with the mortality and survival in critically ill COVID-19 patients. As critical non-survivors showed elevated erythrocyte differentiation and decreased RBC, erythrocyte biomarkers may be a promising and sensitive approach for predicting patient prognosis, which has not been well explored in previous studies. Furthermore, the protein–metabolite–lipid network suggested that activation of tryptophan metabolism and melatonin function disorder may prompt metabolism impairment in patients with different outcomes.</p>

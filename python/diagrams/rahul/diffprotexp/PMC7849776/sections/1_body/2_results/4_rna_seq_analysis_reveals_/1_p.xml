<p>With the involvement of the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> and the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> genes in protease and pigment production, surface protein production and pathogenicity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we speculated YjbH might be involved in regulating the expression of various genes. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq analysis. We found that disruption of both the genes led to significant changes in the expression of the genes from diverse pathways. We found similar expression patterns among the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> and 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> genes- disrupted mutants with a common upregulation and downregulation of 70 and 79 genes, respectively. (

0: The essential oils of air-dried hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants (about 50 g of each) were obtained by hydrodistillation, using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 5 h. Chemical analysis of essential oils composition was performed by GC-MS method using a Trace GC Ultra apparatus (Thermo Electron Corporation, Milan, Italy) with FID and MS DSQ II detectors and MS-FID splitter (SGE, Analytical Science).
1: The analysis conditions (column, temperatures, etc.)
2: were as previously reported [ 14].
3: The identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their RIs and MS spectra with those stored in the NIST 98.1, Wiley 8th Ed., and MassFinder 4.1. computer libraries as well as literature data [ 15 17].

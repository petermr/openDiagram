<p>The kinetic curve of DOX adsorption on modified MWCNTs was determined as described above at 298 K. The initial concentration of DOX was chosen on the basis of the adsorption isotherm (the concentration at which the isotherm reached maximum). The obtained mixtures were shaken for 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 min, respectively. Next, the concentration of DOX was determined by the spectrophotometric standard curve method [

<p>Other chloride‐containing solutions with alkali metal ions such as Cs

 <sub>2</sub> and CsCl solutions shows that the influence of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> on the HB network is significantly more pronounced than CsCl. Therefore, the presence in solution of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> causes the observed, large perturbations to the water HB network; the distribution of HBs in the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> first hydration shell (Figure

 <sup>2+</sup> being mostly hydrogen‐bonded to only two other molecules. The inset of Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D compares the average number of HBs for the water molecules in the first and second hydration shell of the divalent cations Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, of the monovalent cations K
 <sup>+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup>, and Cs

 <sub>HB</sub> values is the lower than in the bulk but this effect is particularly strong for the water molecules directly coordinated to Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> (

 <sub>HB</sub>=2.25). This further confirms that the influence of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> on the water‐water HB network is due to the specific Mg‐water interaction. For all ions, the average number of HBs for the water molecules in the second hydration shell converges to the of „bulk” water (beyond the first and second shells). However, small differences can be observed between the values of „bulk” water and pure liquid water, which are likely due to finite size effects (size of the simulation box). In fact,

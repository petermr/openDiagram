<p>% scavenging = 100 - (Abs sample - Abs control)/Abs DPPH Ã— 100 %, where the Abs sample is the absorbance of the sample without DPPH. The oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from the plot of inhibition percentages against the oil concentrations. The assay was repeated three times.

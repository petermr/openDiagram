<p>This review focuses on the research and development of the SCEs applied in all‐solid‐state lithium batteries. Although the SCEs inherit the advantages of both SPEs and ICEs, there are still some crucial drawbacks for SCEs to overcome before practical application in all‐solid‐state lithium batteries, for example, unsatisfying ionic conductivity and knotty interfacial problems. The mechanism of Li ion migration in SCEs depends on the composition and structure of SCEs. Many researches have proved that the lithium ions move fast on the surface layer between ceramics and polymer host. Therefore, the ionic conductivity of SCEs could be greatly enhanced via adjusting the size and shape of ICEs. Among all the ceramics with different morphologies such as nanowires, nanoparticles, and 3D framework, the nanowires show great improvement on the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes. In addition, constructing continuous and aligned express way with ceramic nanowires or 3D ceramic framework could promote the migration of lithium ions; whereas, large number of voids in 3D framework SCEs may lead to incompatible and poorly contacted interfaces, which hinders the lithium‐ion transfer to some content. At present, the ionic conductivity of SCEs could reach around 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at room temperature, which is still much lower than that of liquid electrolytes (10
 <sup>−2</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and could not well meet the requirement of practical application in all‐solid‐state lithium battery at room temperature. Thus, in order to enable the application of SCEs at room temperature, their ionic conductivity still needs to be further improved by structure design of ceramic and composition tuning of polymer matrix.

<p>These feeds should be handled differently owing to the difference in their size, format, and electric power. More specifically, the LIBs in the first type of loads present a wide variety of types, sizes, and chemistries. Such bulk mixtures should be sorted by format, size, and chemistry prior to any treatment. The second type of loads include large assemblies of battery modules featuring steel or Al frames, and include plastic components, thermal insulation, electric cables, electronic printed circuits, and individual cells. Usually, these packs are carefully dismantled manually into modules or even individual cells prior to recycling [

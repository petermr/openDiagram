<p>Terahertz (THz) dielectric spectroscopy measures the dielectric response of material to applied electromagnetic fields. In the GHz‐THz frequency region, the dielectric response of water originates from the reorientation dynamics of the water dipole. From the contribution to the dielectric relaxation mode, the THz‐DR technique is capable of detecting the difference in dynamic behavior between tightly bound and bulk waters.[

 </xref>] The hydration number measured from THz‐DR spectroscopy is the average number of moles of water molecules per mole of dissolved salt that no longer participate in bulk‐like reorientation dynamics.

 </xref> This molecular definition of hydration number pertains to „irrotationally bound” waters (the ones tightly bound to the solute) and is consistent with the macroscopic hydration concept proposed by Zavitsas based on thermodynamic considerations.

<p>In addition to the formation of β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si and B’ precipitates, pure Si particles were found after relatively slow cooling, as shown by the particle in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f038">Figure 38</xref> for which EDS analysis revealed nearly pure Si (EDS results not shown here). Regarding the precipitation of pure Si in an AlMgSi alloy with excess Si relative to the stoichiometric composition of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si, it is reasonable to compare the DSC cooling curves of AlMgSi alloys with those of pure binary AlSi alloys. For the latter, it can be seen that both the HTR and the LTR occur within a temperature range of ≈460–300 °C at 0.01 K/s. When the same cooling rate for 6005 is compared in the same temperature range, only the HTR peak is seen. In terms of the overlapping reactions beneath the HTRs and LTRs, it can be assumed that the precipitation of Si adds a certain heat effect to the HTRs.

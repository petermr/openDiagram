1: 4 Comparison of cycling stability at 60C.
2: ( A  and B ) Capacity retention and DCR of the SEB cells versus the baseline LIB cell during cycling at 60C.
3: The cells are charged with CCCV protocol at 1 C to 4.2 V with a cutoff current of C/20 and then discharged at 1 C to 2.8 V. ( C  and D ) Discharge curves of the fresh SEB cell versus aged cell.

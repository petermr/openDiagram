<p>The flow SA-β-Galactosidase assay was adapted from [
 <xref rid="B8-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In brief, SY5Y-inducible cell lines were treated with 1 µg/mL doxycycline for the indicated time before being subjected to PI staining or flow SA-β-Gal assay. For the flow SA-β-Gal assay, sub-confluent cells were first treated with 100 nmol/L bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) for 1 h in fresh DMEM plus 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics medium at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. A final concentration of 33 μmol/L DDAOG (Setareh Biotech Eugene, OR, USA) was added to the medium for an extra 2 h of incubation. The cell monolayer was then washed twice with room-temperature PBS and harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation at 200×

 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL and run immediately on BDCalibar. Data were collected and analyzed using CellQuest following the instructions of the manufacturer’s manual.

<p>It is important to note that this study provides a first overview of variant gene expression in individual ookinetes but is limited in the fact that it contains descriptive data. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm the individual involvement of candidate genes. Nonetheless, this study gives good insight into ookinete biology and will prove valuable for the community.</p>

<p>The above-discussed chain packing and interaction will affect the free volumes formed in PI matrix, which play a vital role in the gas transport performances. PALS was utilized to study the free volume of the PI films. The positron lifetime curves of Kapton, 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI film are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f007">Figure 7</xref>. The slope of the decay curve for Kapton was lower than those of 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI, indicating the larger size of the free volume in Kapton [

The raw data obtained were resolved into two finite lifetime components using the PATFIT program which assumes a Gaussian distribution for the logarithm of the lifetime for each component. The obtained data of positron lifetime are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Table S1</xref>. Jean et al. have reported a relation between the second lifetime component

 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the relative fractional free volume (
 <italic>FFV</italic>) is also calculated according to our previous work [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The 
 <italic>FFV</italic> of the three PIs decreased in the order: Kapton ˃ 2,7-CPPI ˃ 2,7-CPI.

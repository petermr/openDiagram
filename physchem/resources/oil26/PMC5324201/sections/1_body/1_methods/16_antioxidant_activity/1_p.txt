0: The antioxidant activity of the root essential oil on the stable radical 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (0.2 Mmol) (Sigma-Aldrich) was determined by the Brand-Williams method [ 18] with some modifications.
1: The oil was dissolved in methanol and applied concentrations were 46.5 to 0.36328 mg/mL by serial dilution technique.
2: Ascorbic acid (ASA) and tert-butyl-1-hydroxytoluene (BHT) were used as positive control.
3: The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using an Analytic Jene Spekel 1300 UV spectrophotometer.
4: The per cent of inhibitions were calculated from the equation: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \%\ \mathrm{inhibition} = \left(1\hbox{-}\ {\mathrm{ABS}}_{\mathrm{sample}}/{\mathrm{ABS}}_{\mathrm{control}}\right)\times 100 $$\end{document}%inhibition=1ABSsample/ABScontrol100

 <caption> Significant miRNA-modules with antagonistic regulatory patterns, during transgenerational water stress, that are involved in KEGG ( https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html) pathways ko04075—Plant hormone signal transduction and ko00710—Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, respectively. miRNAs are shown in pink, mRNA targets are shown in blue. F-box protein GID2, an F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex. TIFY-domain protein, protein with conserved amino acid pattern (TIF[F/Y]XG). </caption>

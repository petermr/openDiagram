<p>Results of the functional analysis of genes that were differentially expressed exclusively in treatment group 5 (ibuprofen and FPI, day 5–10), showed only one statistically significant GO term: “positive regulation of potassium ion transport”. This function was apparently lower in lung tissue with lesion, because expression of both genes related to this function (FHL1, WNK1), was lower. FHL1 is a “four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 1”. It has been demonstrated that FHL1 is a major factor for replication of some viruses. This was suggested by the experimental results where FHL1 deficient cells are resistant to chikungunya virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. One of the FHL1 isoforms is expressed in fibroblasts and it is likely that lung fibroblasts were a major source of FHL1 mRNA in our samples. The mechanism of how this protein works for viral replication is not fully known, besides its interaction with nonstructural nsP3 protein of chikungunya virus; and it is not known whether FHL1 has a direct effect on BRSV replication and how the combination of FPI and ibuprofen may have suppressed FHL1 expression.

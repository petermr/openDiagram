0: In summary, hybrid Naair batteries have emerged as new types of energy storage devices with promising energy and power density.
1: They showed fundamental advantages over nonaqueous NaO 2 battery as well as better technical specifications.
2: However, for practical and largescale applications (such as electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and grid backups), more understanding and designs are required not only in the area of airelectrodes but also separators, anodes, and electrolytes.
3: The hybrid Naair battery technology is still in its nascent stage, but we believe that the collaborative work performed in this research community will lead to a new commercial battery technology.

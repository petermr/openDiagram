<p id="Par7">A total of 417 genes were found to be associated with regeneration of gecko tail tissue for having at least one log fold change in one of its regenerating time points significantly. 254 genes were selected for further analysis such as heat map and network pathway analysis for having their expression pattern in all their regenerating time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). 26, 38 and 29% of identified genes were found to be upregulated for having &gt; 1 log fold change in their expression during the regeneration process at 1, 2 and 5-dpa. Similarly, 54, 35 and 46% of genes were found to be downregulated by &gt; − 1 log fold during regeneration at their respective 1, 2 and 5-dpa time points.

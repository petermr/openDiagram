<p>In-solution tryptic-digestion was performed as described previously with certain modifications (
 <xref rid="b23-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Briefly, 10 µg protein from fibroblast lysates (pooled healthy controls and individual patient samples) was reduced in 10 mM DTT for 5 min at 95˚C and alkylated with 1/10 volume of 20 mM iodoacetamide, prior to incubation for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The alkylated proteins were in-solution digested overnight at 37˚C by adding 1:50 (trypsin: protein, w/w) of sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega Corporation). The digestion reaction was stopped by adding 1% formic acid. The tryptic-digested peptides were cleaned with HiPPR™ Detergent Removal Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) to remove the residual reagents, and then purified using a Ziptip C
 <sub>18</sub> micropipette tip (EMD Millipore). Finally, the peptides were dried completely using a speed vacuum (Labconco) and stored at -80˚C for further analysis.

<p>In conclusion, we found that type I IFN is essential for the control of SLEV replication whereas type II IFN was not associated with protection in this model. Induction of ISGs, notably RIG-I, is necessary for restriction of SLEV infection. Failed ISG induction lead to an early and increased expression of proinflammatory mediators and dictates disease severity. Antiviral immune responses against encephalitic flaviviruses are complex, therefore the relationship between type I IFN responses and inflammation in the context of brain is yet to be completely understood.</p>

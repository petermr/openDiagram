<p id="Par10">To identify molecular signatures associated with disease severity, we characterised gene expression and protein abundance differences between high-grade and low-grade cartilage in the largest sample set to date. We detected significant expression differences for 2557 genes and abundance differences for 2233 proteins at 5% false discovery rate (FDR) (Supplementary Figs.

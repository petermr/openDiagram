<p>The protein function most frequently identified among the differentially expressed spots is that of proteinase inhibitor. Numerous spots containing truncated sequences of this protein were found, but the biological significance of the observed cleavage events is unclear (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijms-14-04912-s003">Table S3</xref>). The clustering of the identified sequences reveals that the members of groups of proteinase inhibitors differentially accumulate during exposure to the treatments applied. The majority of those that increase in intensity were observed in plants exposed to osmotic stress (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijms-14-04912-s001">Table S4</xref>). The multitude of genes coding for the major proteinase inhibitors is known [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-ijms-14-04912">54</xref>]. Plant proteinase inhibitor proteins have been shown to have functions in various physiological and developmental processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-ijms-14-04912">55</xref>]. Reports on proteinase inhibitor II (PIN2), a serine-proteinase inhibitor, which occurs in Solanaceae, show that it could play a role in environmental responses and development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ijms-14-04912">56</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ijms-14-04912">57</xref>]. Proteinase inhibitor proteins of the Kunitz family were identified from salt-treated radish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-ijms-14-04912">58</xref>] and drought-stressed 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ijms-14-04912">59</xref>]. Also, some proteinase inhibitor genes were identified by Legay 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ijms-14-04912">60</xref>] in drought-stressed advanced clones of potato. Protease inhibitor induction during drought exposure or wounding is suggested to be part of a general mechanism of damage prevention against proteases that are activated by protein denaturation due to osmotic stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ijms-14-04912">61</xref>]. In native potato, proteinase inhibitor genes were rather induced in a drought susceptible clone than a tolerant clone, suggesting that the upregulation of these genes is more associated with a stress than a tolerance response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-ijms-14-04912">62</xref>]. Proteinase inhibitors could be acting as a signaling system and also as a protecting system. This, however, cannot be confirmed from our results, as we do not have enough information about the different function associated to different families. The majority of proteinase inhibitor proteins identified in the present work increased in abundance under osmotic stress induced by sorbitol. However, under high sucrose concentration and also under chilling temperatures, the response is distinct when comparing both species. In the case of the sucrose treatment, six spots containing proteinase inhibitors increase in abundance in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic>, whereas there is only one in the case of Désirée. Under chilling temperatures, proteinase inhibitors in Désirée increase, and in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic>, three of the spots are less abundant than in control conditions; only one increased in abundance. This suggests that at chilling temperature, a cold tolerant ecotype is not significantly affected by the stress application, so that it does not need a very important system of protection, as proteinase inhibitors.

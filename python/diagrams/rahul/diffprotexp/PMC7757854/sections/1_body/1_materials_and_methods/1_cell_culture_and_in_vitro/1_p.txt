0: MEFs cells were grown in 60-mm treated tissue culture dishes (Thermo Scientific).
1: Cells were maintained in growth media (GM) containing Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) (GibcoTM) supplemented with 10% by volume of foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Corning) and 1% by volume of Pen/Strep/Glutamine (GibcoTM) in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37C.
2: MEFs were seeded at 1  10 5 cells per well in six-well tissue culture plates (Corning).
3: At confluency, cells were induced into adipogenesis by incubating with differentiation media (DM) containing GM supplemented with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma), 10 g/mL insulin (Sigma), 1 M dexamethasone (Sigma) and 10 M rosiglitazone (Sigma).
4: Cells were treated for 3 days (D3), followed by replacement of DM with GM, and incubation for another 2 days (D5).

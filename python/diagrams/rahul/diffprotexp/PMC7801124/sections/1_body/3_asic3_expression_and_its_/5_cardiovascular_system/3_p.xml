<p>ASIC3-like currents have also been detected in mouse venoatrial junctions nodose neurons, which are low-pressure baroreceptors that detect alterations in central venous pressure and induce the release of atrial natriuretic peptide; in ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice when blood volume was increased, urine outflow did not increase, thus, blood volume homeostasis is impaired in the absence of ASIC3 [

<p>The most common chronic respiratory disease globally is chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) (3.95% prevalence), followed by asthma (3.6% prevalence) [
 <xref rid="cit0124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>], and whilst initial research centered around the involvement of muscarinic, tachykinin and bradykinin receptors, emerging data has implicated ASICs in disease pathology, with a drop in pH being associated with inflammatory airway diseases [
 <xref rid="cit0125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. A characteristic of asthma is reversible bronchoconstriction leading to a difficulty in breathing and coughing, symptoms which can be induced using citric acid in guinea pigs [

 <xref rid="cit0127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], which can be attributed to the characteristic hypoxia associated with the condition. In rats, three days after chronic hypoxia, the petrosal ganglion has been shown to express elevated levels of ASIC3 (no change in superior cervical or sensory nodose ganglion expression); additionally, chronic hypoxia induces an inflammatory cytokine response (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) which can also increase ASIC3 expression [
 <xref rid="cit0128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Interestingly, the cytokine-induced increase in ASIC3 was prevented by concomitant ibuprofen administration and although ibuprofen inhibits ASIC1a, it has no effect upon ASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], thus the effect of ibuprofen is most likely due to its disruption of cyclooxygenase mediated signaling pathways.

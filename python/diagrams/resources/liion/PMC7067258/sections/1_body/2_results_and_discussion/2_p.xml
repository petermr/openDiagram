<p>Although the donor HHTP and acceptor HAT-CN compounds are white and yellow powders, respectively, 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> was obtained as a deep green powder, suggesting CT-band formation. Indeed, UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> showed a wide absorption band at 700–800 nm (Fig. S3
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>), which represents the CT band between HHTP and HAT-CN. The electronic state of HAT-CN in 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> was then evaluated by FT-IR spectroscopy. It has been reported that the stretching vibration peaks of the nitrile group (
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>CN</sub>) of HAT-CN with neutral and anionic radicals appear at 2241 and 2210 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively.
 <xref rid="cit51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> In the FT-IR spectrum of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>CN</sub> was observed only at 2241 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (Fig. S4
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>), indicating that the HAT-CN molecules in 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> are neutral. The molecular orbital of an HHTP and HAT-CN dimer cut from the crystal structure of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> was obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP/6-31++G** level of theory under gas-phase conditions including dispersion forces with Grimme's D2 parameter. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) shown in Fig. S5
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref> confirm that the majority of the HOMO is localized on the HHTP molecule and the majority of the LUMO is localized on the HAT-CN molecule. This result indicates that 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> is a neutral CT complex, which is consistent with the FT-IR spectroscopy results. In addition, the electrostatic potentials (ESPs) of the HHTP and HAT-CN molecules were calculated along with the energy of the aromatic interactions (including dispersion forces) to evaluate the strong π–π interactions between HHTP and HAT-CN. The ESPs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref> demonstrate that the aromatic rings of HHTP and HAT-CN possess negatively and positively charged cores, respectively, suggesting that the mixed columnar structures are stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged aromatic cores. In addition, the energy of the π–π interactions between HHTP and HAT-CN was calculated using the cut dimeric structure, giving an estimated stack energy of –39.0 kcal mol
 <sup>–1</sup>, which indicates a greater stability than that provided by π–π interactions between HAT-CN (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, –13.8 kcal mol
 <sup>–1</sup>), as estimated from the reported crystal structure of HAT-CN (Table S1
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>).
 <xref rid="cit52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Furthermore, in the crystal structure of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold>, six DMF molecules form hydrogen bonds to the hydroxy groups of HHTP. The calculated π stack energy using the HHTP and HAT-CN dimer with six molecules of DMF was –66.9 kcal mol
 <sup>–1</sup> (Table S2
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). The strong π–π interactions can therefore be explained by the fact that hydrogen bonds increase the negative charge of the HHTP aromatic ring and therefore the electrostatic interactions between HAT-CN and HHTP become stronger.

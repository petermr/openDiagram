<p>Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECX400 (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer. Proton chemical shift values are reported in parts per million (ppm, 
 <italic>δ</italic> scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane, which was used as a reference (
 <italic>δ</italic> 0). X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra were recorded on a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer at 40 kV and 15 mA using a Cu target tube. Samples were measured without grinding and data were collected at 2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 3–30° using Cu-K
 <sub>α</sub> radiation. Indexing of the XRPD patterns was performed using the Rigaku PDXL XRD analysis software. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JCM-600Plus NeoScope microscope. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (IRAffinity-1S, Shimadzu). Elemental analysis was performed at A-Rabbit-Science Japan Co., Ltd. (an ultra-trace element analysis research center). Water and N
 <sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms for 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> were acquired using a MicrotracBEL BELSORP-max volumetric gas adsorption instrument at 298 and 77 K, respectively. The guest-free phases of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> were obtained by treatment under reduced pressure at 120 °C for 12 h. Ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600) at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 300–1200 nm with BaSO
 <sub>4</sub> as a standard. Further details regarding the computational methods and electrochemical measurements are given in the ESI.

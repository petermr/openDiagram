<p>All 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut patients suffering from Cushing’s disease were in clinical remission after surgery, while clinical remission was observed in 9/15 of 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt patients. Difference of proportions of patients with/without remission was significant (11/0 vs. 9/6; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0237). A trend towards lower tumor volume was observed in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut patients vs. 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt patients in both the Cushing’s disease group (median 445 mm
 <sup>3</sup> vs. 2730 mm
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0798) and SCA group (median 1844 mm
 <sup>3</sup> vs. 3893 mm
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1707), but no significant difference was observed. Patients suffering from Cushing’s disease stratified according to 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations status did not differ in terms of preoperative clinical parameters: morning serum ACTH level, morning serum cortisol level, or 24 h UFC.

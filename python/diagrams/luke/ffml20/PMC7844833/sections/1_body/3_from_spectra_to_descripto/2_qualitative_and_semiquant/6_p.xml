<p>The integration of the area under the XANES features is also a useful descriptor of the white line intensity. At the L-edge of transition metals, the area under the WL is related to the density of unoccupied 
 <italic>d</italic>-states and is thus sensitive to the oxidation state and changes in the electronic structure due to the chemical bonding or charge transfer phenomena. Clancy et al. suggested to use as a descriptor of the WL intensity the integral area under the absorption spectrum after subtracting an arctangent function centered on the inflection point at the absorption edge (

 </sup> Sham et al. used a similar approach to characterize the charge transfer in gold alloys, and integrated the difference between the XAS spectra of alloys and those of a gold foil, where the latter has no WL due to the completely filled 
 <italic>d</italic>-shell.

 </sup> Alternatively, to characterize the intensity of the WL, one can use the fact that the shape of the WL is usually close to a Lorentzian line, and the experimental data can be fitted with such line shape and its integral area considered as the WL intensity.

<p id="Par8">According to the manufacturer’s instructions and our established protocol, total RNA was extracted and then dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H
 <sub>2</sub>O (DEPC-H
 <sub>2</sub>O) for quality and quantity evaluation. Briefly, the isolated granulosa cell subpopulations were dispersed in RNAzol reagent (500 μL) (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA) for lysis through a pipette several times and then shaken vigorously 15 s and stored for 5–10 min at room temperature (4–25 °C). The extract was then centrifuged at 12,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 4-bromoanisole added (0.5% of the supernatant volume) (MRC, BN191). The resulting mixture was shaken and then subjected for centrifugation at 12,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the RNA-containing supernatant was then transferred to a new tube for precipitation with equal volume of isopropanol added (v/v). The mixtures were stored at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and air dried before solubilization in 10 μL DEPC-H
 <sub>2</sub>O and stored in − 80 °C freezer before further analyses.

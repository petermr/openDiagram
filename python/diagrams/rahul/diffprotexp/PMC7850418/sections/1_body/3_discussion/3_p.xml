<p>The normal rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported at about 2.5 mutations per month [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given that D34 variants had 1–3 SNP differences between consensus sequences of D34 variants collected between one week, a higher mutation rate than normal might be linked to adaptative mutations following the deletion. During the revisions of the manuscript, 3 novel sequences of the D34 variant sampled in May at the university hospital of Lyon (EPI_ISL_683361; EPI_ISL_683360; EPI_ISL_683354) and 1 sequence of the D26 variant sampled on April 23rd in a hospital located 75 km from Lyon (EPI_ISL_660432) were detected out of the 932 viruses sequenced to date in our laboratory. This suggests a relatively limited diffusion of these variants. Nevertheless, the importance of such genomic deletion variants by NGS investigation during the evolution of disease transmission and population prevalence should not be overlooked [

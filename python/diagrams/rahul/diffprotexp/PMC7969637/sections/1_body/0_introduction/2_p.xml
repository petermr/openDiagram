<p>Over the last decades, the management for pediatric sepsis has improved gradually (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The current therapies in clinic include resuscitation, prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, accurate fluid balance, blood glucose, as well as source control (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, we still lack a specific molecular therapy for this condition, except for antimicrobial therapy. Numerous trials of potential biological agents targeting different mediators of sepsis have failed (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite advances in intensive care and supportive technology, the mortality rate of sepsis in children still stay in a high position without going down (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The current recommendation for identifying sepsis is the SOFA score, which refers to Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment. SOFA is a simple system, which uses accessible parameters in daily clinical practice to identify dysfunction or failure of the key organs as a result of sepsis (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The European Medicines Agency has accepted that a change in the SOFA score of 2 or more is an acceptable surrogate marker for sepsis (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Unfortunately, the criteria still cannot confirm or refute the diagnosis of sepsis completely given the complexity of the sepsis response. Moreover, sepsis is a time critical emergency, as the disease may progress rapidly to organ failure, shock, and death, which require a prompt recognition.

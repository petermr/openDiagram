0: Wild type  D. melanogaster (Oregon K) was a gift from Jilin Agricultural University and was used throughout the experiment.
1: Single populations (200 flies each) of males were housed in a biochemical incubator with 12-h dark/light cycle at 25C, 60% humidity, and with free access to basal food (water, 1.2% agar, 2.2% sucrose, 1.8% yeast extra powder, 8% corn extract, and 6.25 L/L propionic acid).
2: For RGE treatment, basal food was supplemented with RGE at a final w/v concentration of 1 mg/mL optimized by our previous study (unpublished).
3: The food was changed every 23 d.

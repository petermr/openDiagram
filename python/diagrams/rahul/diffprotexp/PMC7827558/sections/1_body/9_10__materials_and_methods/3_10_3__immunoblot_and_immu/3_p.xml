<p>At 6 h post transient transfection of MCF-7 with pCMV-BirA constructs, Biotin was added to the cell culture for overnight labeling. At 24 h post-transfection, transfected cells were harvested for cell lysate preparation and immunoprecipitated by streptavidin beads (Amersham Little Chalfont, UK). The enriched biotinylated proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry performed by the Duke Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource.</p>

<p id="Par13">Moisture content of samples was determined by desiccation method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A clean platinum dish was dried in an oven and cooled in a desiccator and weighed. From each sample, 5 g was weighed and spread on the dish, the dish containing the sample was weighed. It was then transferred into the air oven at 105 °C to dry until a constant weight was obtained and the loss in mass was determined. In order to obtain the pH of the samples, 5 g of each sample was weighed and suspended in 10 ml of distilled water. The pH was determined with a digital pH-meter (HANNA HI 98129). Acidity of samples was determined by titration with 0.01 mol/L of sodium hydroxide solution, using phenolphthalein as indicator [

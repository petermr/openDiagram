  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> used RNA-seq data to demonstrate a continuous gradient of GE changes across the dorsal-ventral axis of CA1 field of the hippocampus. Other studies have suggested that both continuous and discrete GE changes are involved in the specification of neuronal subtypes from different hippocampal regions

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> to generate profiles of GE, AS, and APA. The integration of these layers using MOFA

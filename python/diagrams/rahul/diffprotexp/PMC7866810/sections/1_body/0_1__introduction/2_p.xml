<p>RaceID is an excellent tool developed by Grün and colleagues to perform different aspects of scRNA-seq data analysis, including preprocessing, sub-population identification by k-means clustering, outlier cells detection and assessing differences in gene expression across clusters [

 <xref rid="B20-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, TSCAN is a remarkable tool for in silico pseudo-time ordering implemented over cell clusters resulted mainly from model-based clustering [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Both RaceID and TSCAN do not handle external RNA controls consortium (ERCC) spike-in, which can be used for accounting for cell-to-cell technical differences [

The biomarker discovery approach enables researchers to find molecular markers and gene expression signatures for better diagnostic or prognostic techniques. Moreover, it could guide therapeutic decision-making [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, multiple research efforts have been directed towards biomarker discovery and a number of computational tools are available. For instance, STRING is an online resource for networking analysis with known and predicted protein–protein interactions and functional enrichment analysis [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. EnrichR is a prominent tool developed in the Ma’ayan lab for inferring knowledge about an input gene set by comparing it to annotated gene sets from over 160 libraries [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Decision trees have been extensively applied for the identification of biomarkers [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Decision trees are transparent and interpretable predictive models but they require considerable programming skills [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The RWeka package is a collection of machine learning algorithms, including decision tree analysis [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The rpart package is widely used for generating recursive partitioning trees [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For researchers with limited to no programming skills it can be very challenging to combine several of these tools to be able to perform a complete analysis. This is especially true for the designing of a complex computational pipeline that goes from single-cell sequencing read counts to biomarker discovery. Moreover, due to the required concatenation of heterogeneous programs and custom scripts via file-based inputs and outputs, as well as the program dependencies and version requirements, such a pipeline may suffer from reproducibility problems [

<p>Plants are regularly exposed to stress factors, and due to their sessile nature, they have developed sophisticated defense responses at a physiological, biochemical, and genetic level. It is well known that the environment and the genotype give the phenotype of an organism. This is partly due to the epigenetic phenomena, where modifications in DNA, RNA, and histones can alter the genetic expression patterns of genes. The environment determines these modifications; they are labile but can be stable and heritable [

<p>The adsorption process was very rapid; for the first 10 min, the adsorption capacity reached 3335 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. It may be attributed to contacts of drug molecules with available surface adsorption sites on the outermost layer of MWCNTs, while subsequent gradual adsorption may be attributed to uptake or incorporation of the drug molecules into the adsorbents as shown in MD calculations. The equilibrium was reached after 15–20 min.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f012">Figure 12</xref> illustrates the microstructure of the best LH sample (#9). In sample #9 the value of the ferrite phase was less than other samples. The ferrite phase caused a reduction of the hardness. Thus sample #9 with the lower ferrite percentage had higher hardness. The high pulse width and low LSS led to more heat energy and caused more martensite phase and more surface hardness. Due to the uncontrollable cooling rate, the presence of the retained austenite was possible. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f012">Figure 12</xref>, the ferrite phases were bright in the martensite phase, which formed by austenite during air cooling. In the hardened zone the martensite had fine grain (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f012">Figure 12</xref>). High cooling rates and lack of enough time for a solution led to incomplete ferrite, which remained in the hardened structure. This phenomenon caused low hardness [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-03136" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the LH zone, some ferrite phase with some retained austenite could be observed (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f012">Figure 12</xref>).

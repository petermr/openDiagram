0: The early and late response of the rabbit models after rhinitis induction and intranasal treatment was assessed on the first and fourteenth day of treatment by otorhinolaryngology specialist.
1: Allergic rhinitis was assessed concerning the severity of the classic clinical symptoms including nasal irritation, sneezing, nasal secretions and conjunctivitis and eye secretions.
2: The rhinitis sign scores were classified into a four-point scale, ranged from 0 to 3.
3: For motion of nasal itching: 0  =  no nose rubbing; 1  =  2 nose rubbing/min; 2  =  46 nose rubbing/min; while 3 = > 6 nose rubbing/min.
4: For sneezing: 0  =  none; 1  =  13/10  min; 2  =  49/10  min; while 3  =  more than 10 sneeze/10  min.
5: For nasal mucus: 0  =  no mucus; 1  =  mucus inside a nostril; 2  =  mucus outside a nostril; while 3  =  overflowing.
6: For eye secretions: 0  =  none; 1  =  inside eye; 2  =  outside eye; while 3  =  overflowing or change in color.
7: For conjunctivitis: 0  =  none; 1  =  mild; 2  =  moderate; while 3  =  severe.
8: On the last day of sensitization or day 1, the predominant signs including nasal rubbing, sneezing, and nasal secretion were scored to start treatment.
9: The allergic rhinitis model succeeded when the total sign score was more than 7 while the treatment succeeded when the total sign score was less than 4 ( Zhou et al.,  2009; Senturk et al.,  2018).

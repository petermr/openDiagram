<p id="Par41">We hypothesize that the transcriptomic differences among the chambers were accumulated during the evolution of the cardiovascular system, with the largest (between atria and ventricles) indicating first stage of heart evolution and the smallest (between the two ventricles) the last one. Indeed, the initial separation of the contracting vessel into one atrium and one ventricle, present since the beginning of the chordate phylum, was followed by the separation into right and left atria that started with amphibians. Separation into right and left ventricle started with the archosaurs (crocodilians, dinosaurs and pterosaurs)

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the right and the left ventricles have different embryogenetic origins. Thus, LV and part of the atria arise from the early heart tube developed from the first heart field, an area of anterior splanchnic mesoderm formed early during gastrulation. In turn, RV, the outflow tract and the main parts of atrial tissue arise from the second heart field that coalesces with the heart tube at its arterial and venous edges, being derived from the pharingeal mesoderm and dorsal mesocardium

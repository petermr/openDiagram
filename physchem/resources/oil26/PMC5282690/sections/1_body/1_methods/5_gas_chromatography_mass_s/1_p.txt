0: The GCMS analysis of AcEO was performed on an Agilent 5973 N GC-MS coupled to an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with an injector at 250 C (Splitless mode) and equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column coated with 5% phenyl-methylsiloxane (30 m length  0.25 mm internal diameter  0.25 m of film thickness, Agilent 19091S-433).
1: The column pressure was set to 51.6  10 3 Pa.
2: The oven temperature was held at 40 C for 2 min, and then programmed to 250 C at a rate of 8 C/min.
3: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min.
4: The mass spectra (MS) were operated in electron impact mode (70 eV) with the electron multiplier set at 1823.5 V, and the MS data were acquired in scan mode.
5: The peaks were quantified by calculating the percentage of the peak area of each component by comparison to the sum of the peaks of other compounds.
6: The identification of the components was performed on the basis of chromatographic comparison of the recorded retention time with computed mass-spectrum data libraries (Pal600K and Wiley275).

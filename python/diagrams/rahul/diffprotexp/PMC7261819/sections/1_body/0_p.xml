<p>Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is widely used for identification and quantification of proteins from complex biological samples (

Both quantitative approaches rely on a hierarchical data structure: PSMs are nested into peptides which are then nested into proteins. Protein level quantification is subsequently generated through summarizing peptide or PSM level information.

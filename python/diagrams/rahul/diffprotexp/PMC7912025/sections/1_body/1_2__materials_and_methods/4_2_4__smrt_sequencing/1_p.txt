0: RNA isolation was performed as above; the same RNA was used to generate SMRTbell libraries and prepare mRNAs for short-read sequencing.
1: For SMRT sequencing, Iso-SeqTM SMRTbell libraries containing circular templates were generated using an NEBNext Single Cell RT Enzyme Mix and recommendations by the manufacturers for long-read transcripts using the Iso-SeqTM Express Template (PN: 101-901-700) and indicated quality control (QC) steps.
2: Sequencing was performed using the Pac Bio Sequel II system with SMRT Cell 8M.

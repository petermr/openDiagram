<p>There are another 3 overlapping GO terms (GO:0097201, GO:0043620 and GO:0043618) that are not directly related to the immune system, but may be of great importance for the cell stress markers. All 3 terms are related to regulation of nucleic acid synthesis in response to stress. They are significantly enriched in samples from treatment groups 3 (placebo) and 6 (Day 3â€“10 FPI and Ibuprofen). DNAJB1 (DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B1) is the gene belonging to these GO terms and was differentially expressed (upregulated) in lesions of both treatment groups. Another gene TMBIM6 (transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 6) was differentially expressed (downregulated) only in lesion samples from group 3.</p>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Proteomic profiling is a rapidly developing technology that may provide clues to the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of these diseases. A variety of approaches are available for the analysis of proteomes, including 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and Differential Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) [

<p>Although both higher entropy and connectivity between pathways can be interpreted as a weakening of tight regulatory rules, improving tumour adaptability, they could also reflect higher cellular heterogeneity. This idea has been confirmed by Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B119-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], who assessed network entropy related to cellsâ€™ heterogeneity and the number of subclones, making use of single-cell data, tumour purity estimates and clonal evolution in xenograft models. Additionally, signalling entropy has been shown to be an estimate for tumour stemness [

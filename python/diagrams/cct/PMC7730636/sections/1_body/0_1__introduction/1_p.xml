<p>Deformation and dilatometric analysis are nowadays a widespread method for evaluating changes in the microstructure in steels, and at the same time they are associated with changes in the resulting mechanical properties [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Phase changes are the main goal of these measurements in the case of dilatometric examination. The influence of the heating rate on the austenitic temperature and its subsequent holding time plays a very important role in the dilatometry process [

 <xref rid="B4-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Low or medium alloy steels, which are classified as ferritic steels, are also investigated [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The investigated steel AISI 4340 is classified as a medium alloy steel, the main alloys are Ni, Cr, Mo, V. Due to its mechanical properties and high strength, the investigated steel belongs to special high-strength steels, which are used for manufacturing of military equipment. Steel is used mainly on tank barrels and other highly loaded parts in this technique due to good material fatigue resistance.

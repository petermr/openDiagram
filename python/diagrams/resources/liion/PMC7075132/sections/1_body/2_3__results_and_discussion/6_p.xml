<p>In addition, the long-term cycling performances of the B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes were appraised at 0.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). The B-SFO@C electrode can maintain a very stable and high capacity of 927 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> with a sustainable retention of 95.1% even after 100 cycles, indicating an exceptional cyclic lifetime. Note that, though the ICE of B-SFO@C is relatively low, the coulombic efficiency can rapidly increase to 92% in the second cycle and can remain over 98% in subsequent runs. However, both the B-SFO and B-SO@C electrodes only give the decaying cycling performance over 100 cycles with a capacity of 51 and 488 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, concomitant with a corresponding retention of merely 6% and 68.4%. The pure carbon matrix delivers a constant but low capacity of 232 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 50 cycles (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S8</xref>), whereas the carbon-free B-SFO sample abruptly deteriorates from roughly 800 to 200 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> during first 30 cycles, confirming that the carbon substrate does matter to the structural tolerance and thin/stable SEI layer during cycling. It must be accentuated that the reversible capacity and capacity retention of the B-SFO@C electrode significantly outnumber B-SO@C, which is due to the fact that the divergent electroactive potentials of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> in the B-SFO@C electrode can permit the Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanocrystals to not only act as active materials, but also to serve as structural stabilizers [
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and simultaneously enable the amelioration of the reversibility of the conversion reactions of Sn/SnO
 <sub>2</sub> in the B-SFO@C electrode to contribute an extra capacity. Specifically speaking, the large work function difference between SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> can make the lattice of the SnO
 <sub>2</sub>/Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> composite adapt suitably, inducing the construction of a relatively big internal electric field. Such an in-built electric field is able to introduce an additional electromotive force to augment the electronic mobility of the active materials and, finally, strikingly enhance reaction dynamics and ionic/electronic transportation/migration at the interior hetero-interfaces of SnO
 <sub>2</sub>/Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. Actually, TEM and HRTEM have clearly identified the intimately and uniformly packed metal oxide/metal oxide nanoparticles and typical carbon layers. Abundant robust hetero-junctions and -interface boundaries arising from a lattice adaptation between SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> phase must occur. When such heterostructures come into being between SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, the electrons will drift to the Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles possessing the greater work function from the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> (a lower work function), triggering off a positive space charge region on the Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> side and a negative space charge region on the SnO
 <sub>2</sub> side of the SnO
 <sub>2</sub>/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> hetero-interfaces. Thus, the built-in electric field takes place around the junction region and the direction is pointed from Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> to SnO
 <sub>2</sub>. This is the identical direction to the electric field of the initial battery, which underlies the gain of the electromotive force of the lithium battery. Furthermore, the long-term high-rate cycling test of the B-SFO@C electrode even at an extremely great current density of 1 and 3 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> can still sustain a nearly invariable lithium ion storage behavior, further showing an outstanding high-rate cyclic lifespan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f005">Figure 5</xref>d,e). Note that an activation at low current density of 0.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> was introduced to in advance complete the formation of the unvaried SEI film. The B-SFO@C electrode can afford a reversible capacity of 701 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 500 cycles at 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> and stores an ultra-stable capacity of 429 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> even after 1800 cycles at 3 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The electrochemical performances of the B-SFO@C electrode are compared to the SnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based anode materials published previously (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Table S2</xref>). It can be unequivocally disclosed that B-SFO@C can ascend into the first echelon of the cutting-edge SnO
 <sub>2</sub> based materials, showing that B-SFO@C can vie as the very promising anode material candidate for LIBs. Besides, considering that the (de)alloying reaction that incurs the volume change proceeds mainly below 1 V, the B-SFO@C electrode was purposely measured at 0.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the range of 0.005–1.0 V to trace the morphological variation and the corresponding results (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S9</xref>) demonstrate the superb cyclic durability with a steady capacity of 343 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 150 cycles. This confirms that capacity fading caused by volume change has been largely alleviated. The electrochemical lithiation must lead the interface boundaries between the Li-enriched Li
 <italic>
  <sub>x</sub>
 </italic>Sn and Sn phases to come into being and resultantly trigger off the stress reinforcement, whilst the gain in the strain energy induces the anisotropic dilation/expansion and abnormal topological evolutions, thus initiating the dramatic mechanical fracture and breakage [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The foregoing events can re-expose the fresh Sn surfaces to electrolytes, thereby resulting in an enhancement in the thickness of the SEI layer upon cycling, and a serious battery performance degeneration. Given that these issues are innately related to stress reinforcement, the endeavor towards the stress regulation approach for Sn-based electrode materials constitutes the paramount footing to enhance a cyclic durability. Seeing that the aggressive volume fluctuation inherently stems from the stress intensification over particle surface layers, such superior cycling stability unambiguously emphasizes that the assembly of the unique sandwich metal–carbon bulk structures with the binary small-sized metal oxides uniformly embedded inside carbon layers can effectively manage and relax the strain energy in the large-volume-variation SnO
 <sub>2</sub> anodes for the high-performance LIBs to fulfill the necessary, extraordinary morphological and structural stability requirements (as further supported by the TEM images after cycling in Figure 7). Without the supra mechanism, the material surface will become rather vulnerable to resisting the stress in the lithiation experience, so inducing a limited capacity retention. What’s worse, a high initial discharge capacity and excellent long-term cyclic durability always fall short of being satisfied synchronously thanks to the compromise nexus between the two of them resting with the surface layer thickness. Nevertheless, in spite of such compromise, B-SFO@C can still split the difference to attain a decent cyclability (with 95.1% capacity retention at 100 cycles) at an elevated capacity of 927 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>.

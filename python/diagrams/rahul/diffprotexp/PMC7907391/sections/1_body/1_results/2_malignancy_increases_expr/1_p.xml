<p id="Par7">Different cancer types were then examined for their association with expression of viral entry genes. RNA expression of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> were analyzed across 20 malignant tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
 <sup>

 </sup>. The top cancers expressing 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> were from the gastrointestinal (colon, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus), and genitourinary tracts (kidney) with each of these cancers having increased rank expression compared to their matched normal tissue counterparts (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The top cancers expressing 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> were also from the gastrointestinal (colon, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) and genitourinary (prostate) tracts. Four of these five cancer types were the same as the top expressing cancers for 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>. 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> expressing cancers had varied rank expression with skin, muscle, kidney, brain, and testis being the top expressing cancers. Of note, many of the top ranked normal tissues for 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> expression were among the bottom-ranked malignant tissues for 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> expression, and vice versa with cancer type having a large effect on 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> tissue expression rank.

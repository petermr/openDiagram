<p>The discovery of CARDS TX of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> challenged the previously held belief that mycoplasmas are devoid of exotoxins. CARDS TX was originally a membrane-associated, surfactant protein A (SP-A)-binding, ADP-ribosylating, and vacuolating toxin identified by Kannan and Baseman when studying the pathogenic factors that may be responsible for respiratory epithelial cell damage by 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is encoded by the 
 <italic>mpn372</italic> gene and is a protein of approximately 68-kDa, containing 591 amino acids. Among them, amino acids 1–239 are 27% homologous with pertussis toxin catalytic subunit S1 [

 <xref rid="cit0207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Three-dimensional structural analysis has revealed that CARDS TX is a triangular molecule with three domains (D1–D3) [
 <xref rid="cit0208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. D1 possesses ART activity, whereas D2 and D3 are involved in receptor recognition, cell surface binding, internalization, and vacuolization [
 <xref rid="cit0209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. Furthermore, Balasubramanian et al. had demonstrated that a disulfide bond is formed between cysteine C230 and C247 of CARDS TX, which is essential for ADP-ribosylating and vacuolating activities, for maintaining the conformational stability of the toxin, and for appropriately performing cytopathic effects, but does not affect the binding, internalization, and retrograde transport properties [

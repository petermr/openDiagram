<p>Up to now, the understanding of PrP
 <sup>c</sup>â€™s role in neuroenergetic processes has been limited. Therefore, we examined if a lack of PrP
 <sup>c</sup> may modulate the expression of genes known to be critically involved in supporting unobstructed glycolytic processes that are of utmost importance, especially under stress conditions when energy demand is high.

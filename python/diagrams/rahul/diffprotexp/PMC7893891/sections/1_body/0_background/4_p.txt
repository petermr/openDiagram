0: Genome-wide transcriptome studies provide in-depth knowledge of regulatory pathways that shape cellular morphology and function.
1: Such information is crucial for the design of novel neuron regenerative therapies and cell-based drug discovery platforms.
2: Previous studies based on single cell transcriptomics of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patient-derived iPSCs discovered the underlying mechanisms of disease pathology [ 9] and the regulatory dynamics of MN differentiation [ 10].
3: Others have investigated the iPSC-derived MN axonal transcriptome and found key regulatory pathways presenting potential drug targets for treatment of genetic disorders [ 11].
4: A detailed transcriptomics study by Burke et al.
5: proposed an influence of the genetic background of the iPSC donors on each pivotal step of iPSC-initiated corticogenesis [ 12].
6: Further, single cell RNA-seq analysis of iPSC-derived spinal MN demonstrated that in vitro differentiation does not produce a homogeneous MN population [ 8].

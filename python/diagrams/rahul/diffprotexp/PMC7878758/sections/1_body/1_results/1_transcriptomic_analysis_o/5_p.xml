<p id="Par10">Cluster hierarchical heat map analysis of DEGs revealed group of genes which were undergoing upregulation at 1-dpa where found to be downregulated at 2 and 5-dpa and vice versa with downregulated genes at 1-dpa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Genes with crucial biological functions were identified and found involved in the onset of blastemal formation or AEP during wound healing phase. Some major genes associated with growth, cellular proliferation &amp; biogenesis, immune response activation, multicellular organismal process, ion binding, transporter activity, cellular response to stimulus were identified on reference with Anole Lizard database are MYOD1, TNNI1, ASPH, TPT1, CD63, BIN1, NDRG1, CEBPD, POF1B, POSTN, TMBIM6, RPS25, CIBP, HERPUD1, UBA52, HINT1, FAN1, FAM162A, RNF20, LUC7L3 and SLC38A5. In this study, we observed mostly muscle contraction, signalling, structural molecule activity, anatomical morphogenesis and developmental genes. The analysis further reveals that 1-dpa expression is out rooted with clustered 2 and 5-dpa based on cluster analysis for the three regenerating time points against the control tissue expression.

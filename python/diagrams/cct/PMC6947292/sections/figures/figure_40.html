 <caption> Comparison of measured and predicted values for the specific precipitation enthalpies and hardness after artificial ageing as a function of cooling rate for four AlMgSi alloys. The specific precipitation enthalpy values are plotted for total reactions (black squares), high-temperature reactions (red triangle, tip upwards) and low-temperature reactions (blue triangle, tip downwards). ( A) 6063; ( B) 6005A; ( C) 6082 I; and ( D) 6082 V [ 118]. </caption>

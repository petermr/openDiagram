 <italic>Paspalum notatum</italic> Flüggé is a warm-season perennial grass widely distributed in the Western Hemisphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], where it occurs as a primary constituent of natural grasslands, particularly in southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and north-east Argentina [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The species form a multiploid complex in which the diploid cytotype (2n = 2x = 20) is self-sterile and sexual, while the tetraploid one (the common race) (2n = 4x = 40) is pseudogamous, aposporous apomictic and self-fertile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Other infrequent polyploid cytotypes (3x and 5x) are also apomicts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Moreover, numerous sexual tetraploid individuals were artificially synthetized from diploids by colchicine treatment, or obtained from experimental crosses involving facultative apomicts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Interestingly, although sexual seeds form the endosperm under a strict 2 maternal: 1 paternal genomic contribution, apomictic ones are more permissive and can develop under different maternal:paternal genomic ratios (e.g., 4:1; 8:1) [

 <italic>P. notatum</italic> has become a model system for apomixis research and breeding, mainly due to the existence of freely-crossable races of the same ploidy and different reproductive mode, a thoroughly-characterized living germplasm collection and advanced breeding programs exploiting apomixis for cultivar generation [

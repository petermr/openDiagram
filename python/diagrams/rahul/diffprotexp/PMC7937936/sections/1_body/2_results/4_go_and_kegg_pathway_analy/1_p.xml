<p>Since these 275 DEGs were significantly associated with TME status, we sought to explore these genes’ function through GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Results of GO enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched significantly in neutrophil activation, neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil-mediated immunity, leukocyte chemotaxis, regulation of inflammatory response, lymphocyte proliferation (

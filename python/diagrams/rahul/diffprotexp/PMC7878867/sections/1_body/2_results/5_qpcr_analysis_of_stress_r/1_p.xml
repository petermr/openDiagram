<p id="Par29">qPCR analysis was performed on eight stress-responsive miRNAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> for DBA Artemis, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref> for DBA Aurora) and 12 stress-responsive targets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> for DBA Artemis, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref> for DBA Aurora). Significant differential expression across treatment groups were observed for certain miRNAs and target mRNAs, with specific patterns subject to the progeny or parental treatment factor. In DBA Artemis, for example, in the flag leaf, some miRNAs (such as ata-miR167b-3p, bdi-miR394 and osa-miR398a_L + 1R-1) were significantly reduced under water-deficit stress in the progeny from the control parents, at the same time showing no statistical difference when compared with the progeny from the stressed parents (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, in the developing grains, the expression of ata-miR167b-3p and osa-miR398a_L + 1R-1 was only significantly increased under water-deficit stress in the progeny from the stressed parents, while their expression in the control progeny from the stressed parents showed no significant difference to the progeny from the control parents (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Different patterns could also be observed for mRNA target genes in DBA Artemis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Several genes showed the opposite responsive pattern to water-deficit stress in progeny with different parental sources. For example, in the developing grains, the expression of a cytidylate kinase (target of ata-miR167b-3p) and a member of the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis protein family (target of tae-miR408_L-1) were significantly increased under water-deficit stress in the progeny from the control parents, but significantly reduced under stress in the progeny from the stressed parents (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the flag leaf, many genes had the highest expression in the stress-treated progeny from the stress parents, with no statistical difference found across the other three treatment groups. These genes included the cytidylate kinase, a F-box protein (target of ata-miR528-5p), a poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase SRO1 (target of ata-miR528-5p) and a histone H4 gene (target of tae-miR398_L + 1R-1). Similarly, in DBA Aurora, different expression patterns can also be observed for miRNAs and their targets, depending on the progeny or parental treatment factor. For example, ttu-miR160 was significantly up-regulated under water-deficit stress in the progeny from the control parents, but was significantly down-regulated under stress in the progeny from the stressed parents (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). One target of tae-miR408_L-1, an enoyl-CoA hydralase gene, had significantly higher expression in the progeny from the control parents than the ones from the stressed parents (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

0: Figure 15Long cycling experiments performed at a constant charge/discharge current of C/10 between 1.5 and 3.5 V versus Li/Li   +.
1: Two PTCDA electrodes (40 mg), one composed of VGCFCOOH (), and the other of a mixture of VGCFSO   3H and CNTSO   3H (   ), are compared.
2: Full and empty characters represent the Coulombic efficiency (%) and discharge capacity, respectively.
3: Before the long cycling experiment, a formation rapidly occurs at 5 C.

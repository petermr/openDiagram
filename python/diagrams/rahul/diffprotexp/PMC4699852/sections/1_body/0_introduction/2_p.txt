0: Since the discovery of the ability of MSCS to differentiate into neuronal cells, a variety of protocols for neuronal differentiation have been proposed.
1: Although, neuronal differentiation after chemical stimulation for a few hours could be a misconception since the use of Triton, Tween-20, NaOH and NaCl can lead to similar results as induction using BME or DMSO/BHA [ 4].
2: Neuronal induction of MSCs into functional neuron-like cells has been generally achievable using cytokines.
3: According to the literature, the cytokines used for neuronal induction can be classified as: (1) growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), FGF-8, epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF); (2) substances that can raise the cellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) such as forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and dibutyryl cAMP; (3) neurotrophins such as NT-3, NT-5, BDNF, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); and (4) other factors such as retinoic acid (RA).
4: In addition to individual use, combinations of several classes of cytokines have also frequently been used for neuronal differentiation of MSCs [ 3,  5 12].

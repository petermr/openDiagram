<p>The RNAi mechanism induces gene silencing by targeting genes in a sequence-specific manner through chromatin modification, messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translation inhibition [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The RNAi mechanism is necessary to the host since it controls endogenous expression and translation and counteracts exogenous particles such as transposons and viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The mechanism of action in RNAi involves processing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into 21–24 nucleotides by Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Argonaute (AGO) family proteins cleave dsRNA into two single-stranded RNAs (guide and passenger RNAs), stabilize association of guide RNA onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and direct the RISC toward the target sequence, which ultimately leads to transcriptional or posttranscriptional gene silencing [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, gene silencing can be reinforced by incorporation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) enzyme activity through generation of secondary dsRNA that can result in systemic gene silencing [

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. During viral infection in plants, recruitment of AGO1-5 and RDR1,6 plays an important role in viral gene silencing [

<p id="Par34">To better characterize those targets differentially modified by FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>, we grouped the 717 DEGs in six subsets (labeled as Cat_1 to Cat_6) of upregulated and downregulated genes according to different patterns of expression in FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> conditions with respect to the vector, as depicted in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c. For example, category 1 (Cat_1) included genes, such as 
 <italic>ACTN1</italic> and 
 <italic>TGFB2,</italic> that were upregulated in both mutant and wild-type conditions, while category 2 (Cat_2) included genes, such as 
 <italic>SMARCA4, HSPG2</italic> and 
 <italic>BAZ2A</italic>, that were upregulated only in FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>.

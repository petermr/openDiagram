0: Six large well-defined spots were sequenced by LC/ESI-MS/MS as described previously [ 24].
1: The spots were excised from Coomassie blue-stained gels and digested with modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI).
2: Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in a 3200 QTRAP System (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source and a nanoflow LC system (Agilent 1100 Nano Pump, Waldbronn, Germany), coupled to an Acquity Ultra Performance LC system (Waters Corporations, Milford, MA).
3: For data interpretation and protein identification, MS/MS spectrum datasets were searched using the MASCOT search algorithm v.1.6b9, Matrix Science, London, UK, available at  http://www.matrixscience.com).
4: A search was conducted in the genome of  T.  solium (available on request [ 23]) and in the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant database (NCBInr).

<p>To assess the extent of differential splicing three tools were used each looking at different components of the splicing process. Comparing 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutants with the controls showed that 953 genes were significantly differentially spliced (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Tables S1-S5</italic>). The intersection of these three methods identified 18 genes that had differentially spliced exons or splice junctions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig003">Figure 3A</xref>). The change in proportion of spliced-in (PSI) events is the change in relative abundance between the groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig003">Figure 3B</xref>). It indicates the inclusion or exclusion of a particular splice junction or exon. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the normalized expression shows the use of an alternative exon or splice junction for the 18 genes in each sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig003">Figure 3C</xref>). The genes 
 <italic>MZB1, DYNLL1, TMEM14C, OXA1L, SESN1</italic>, and 
 <italic>UQCC1</italic> have been identified in MDS and CLL samples. These genes show no difference in total gene expression (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3</italic>).

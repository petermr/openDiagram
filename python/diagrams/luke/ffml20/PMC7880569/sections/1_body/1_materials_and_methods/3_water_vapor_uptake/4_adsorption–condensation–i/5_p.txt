0: Predictions of  internal water loadings ( wint) achieved by intercalation were treated using DubininAsthakhov theory 46 with 3Here, the binding strength of water (E) and the pore size distribution ( e.g.,  i = 2 for Gaussian) are adjustable parameters.
1: These two adjustable parameters account for the humidity-dependence shape of the water uptake curve.
2: 47 The water vapor pressure dependence on binding in  eq   3 is expressed through the adsorption potential ( A) 4where  p is the partial pressure of water vapor and  po is the saturation (dew point) pressure.
3: As the results from XRD will show, a maximum of only one water layer (1 W) is accommodated in each interlayer region of birnessite.

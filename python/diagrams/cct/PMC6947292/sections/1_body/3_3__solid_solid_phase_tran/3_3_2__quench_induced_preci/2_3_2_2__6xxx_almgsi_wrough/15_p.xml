 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f040">Figure 40</xref> compares the measured and predicted values of the specific precipitation enthalpy and hardness after ageing for four commercial AlMgSi wrought alloys. The prediction results are drawn from the model derived in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The basic ideas of the model setup are introduced in Chapter 0 below. As already seen for 6005A in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f030">Figure 30</xref>B, the specific precipitation enthalpy generally drops to zero at a certain cooling rate. For higher cooling rates, the hardness typically reaches a saturation level. In general, these model predictions are accurate, and a more detailed discussion is provided in [
 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The model considers precipitation of the phases β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si and B’-Mg
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>4</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub>. It is also notable that the predicted values for these separate phases show close agreement with the measured enthalpies of the HTR and LTR. This is particularly true for the LTR-quench-induced precipitates of B’-Mg
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>4</sub>Al
 <sub>2</sub> and industrially relevant cooling rates.

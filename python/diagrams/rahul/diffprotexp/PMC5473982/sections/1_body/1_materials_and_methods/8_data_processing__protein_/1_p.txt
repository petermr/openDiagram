0: Raw data were analysed using the Proteome Discoverer (v.1.4).
1: MS/MS spectra identification was performed by SEQUEST using the  Gallus gallus protein sequences obtained from Uniprot database.
2: Precursor and fragment mass tolerance were 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively.
3: Carbamidomethylation (C) and oxidation (M) were set as static and dynamic modifications, respectively.
4: Dimethylation (N-term and K) was set as static modification in the label-based analysis.
5: Only peptides with a false discovery rate FDR  5% were used for protein identification.

<p id="Par32">The cDNA libraries were constructed from W and X groups of mandarin fish, and sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq2000 system. High quality reads were assembled. After removing the partial overlapping sequences, a total of 77,312 distinct sequences were obtained (All-Unigene, mean size: 1138 bp, N50: 2334 bp). In these unigene, 49.06% (37,927) were less than 500 bp, 50.94% (39,385) were longer than 500 bp, in which 34.38% (26,578) were longer than 1000 bp. We found 54 genes to be differential expressed among the two groups, 29 and 25 genes are up-regulated and down-regulated in mandarin fish of Group X, respectively. The metabolic pathway showed the most differential expressed genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and b), in which lipid metabolism, signal transduction and global overview maps showed 10, 6 and 13 genes to be differentially expressed, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). And the rich factor of steroid biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism is largest of all (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The details of the differential expressed genes between the two groups were presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The sequencing data in this study have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (accession number: PRJNA613186).

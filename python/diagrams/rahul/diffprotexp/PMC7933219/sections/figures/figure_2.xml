  <p>GO analysis of 504 differentially expressed mRNAs in TCâ€“EC interaction, in which gland development, DNA replication, urogenital system development, morphogenesis of a branching epithelium, morphogenesis of a branching structure, branching morphogenesis of an epithelial tube, mesenchymal cell development, nuclear DNA replication, telomere maintenance via semi-conservative replication, and negative regulation of inclusion body assemble are the top 10 biological process 
   <bold>(A)</bold>; mitochondrial inner membrane, transferase complex (transferring phosphorus-containing groups), replication fork, and desmosome are main cell components 
   <bold>(B)</bold>; ATPase activity, catalytic activity acting on DNA, DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and helicase activity are the enriched molecular functions 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

0: The Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) or Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) were evaluated for each set of wells.
1: For the MIC evaluation, a loopful of broth was collected from those wells where any growth was observed and then was further inoculated on sterile Mueller-Hinton medium broth for bacteria and Sabouraud medium for yeasts by streaking.
2: The plates were then inoculated with microorganism and were incubated at 37C for 24 h. After incubation, the lowest concentration was considered as MBC (for bacteria) and MFC (for yeasts) and presented in  g/mL, at which no visible growth was observed.

<p>As discussed for AlMgSi alloys, it also holds for AlZnMgCu alloys that a lower concentrated AlZnMgCu alloy can achieve higher hardness values if cooling is restricted to medium cooling rates. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f056">Figure 56</xref> compares 7075I, 7085 and 7085lowCu. Of these three variants, 7085lowCu, has the lowest Mg content, despite its low Cu content. The age-hardening potential of 7085lowCu that remains after cooling at 1 K/s results in a hardness of almost 150 HV1. At this cooling rate, the age-hardening potential of 7075I has already dropped to just 100 HV1. Under these conditions, the lower concentrated alloy would achieve ≈150 % of the strength of the highly concentrated alloy (i.e., 7085lowCu is less quench sensitive than both 7075I and 7085). Considering the concentrations of alloying elements, it can be assumed that the concentration of Mg predominantly drives the precipitation kinetics. This fits with the finding in [
 <xref rid="B119-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] that the main quench-induced precipitate phase that causes quench sensitivity is η-Mg(Zn,Cu,Al)
 <sub>2</sub> for these types of alloys.

0: Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic measurements and spectral evaluation were performed as previously reported [ 31].
1: Briefly, wild-type,  yjbI::Tn, and  yjbH::Tn strains were grown at TSA, 37C for 24 h and were subsequently analyzed by whole-cell FTIR spectroscopy.
2: Measurements were conducted on a Tensor 27/HTS-XT microplate adapter FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany).
3: Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA, average linkage clustering) was performed on the second derivative, and vector normalized spectra using the highly discriminatory spectral region between 1200800 cm 1, which is dominated by vibrations of various oligo- and poly-saccharides and their specific type of glycosidic linkages.

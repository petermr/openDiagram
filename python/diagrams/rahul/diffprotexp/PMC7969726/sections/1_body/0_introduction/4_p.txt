0: In the present study, we investigated the clinical significance and biological function of CPSF1 in HCC.
1: We found that CPSF1 was significantly upregulated in HCC.
2: As a critical regulator of APA in HCC, CPSF1 accelerated cell proliferation and was correlated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with HCC.
3: Our findings describe the oncogenic role of CPSF1 in HCC and suggest its potential role as a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC.

<p>Macrophages and heterophils represent professional phagocytes acting as effectors and modulators of innate immunity as well as orchestrators of adaptive immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Heterophils, the avian counterparts of mammalian neutrophils, belong among the first responders to bacterial infections and sensing of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) stimulates heterophils for phagocytosis as well as release of bactericidal proteins stored in heterophil granules into the extracellular environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In agreement with their general function in host protection against pathogens, heterophils play a crucial role in the protection of chickens against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and chickens with heterophil depletion are not protected against colonization of systemic sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, although there are several reports on specific heterophil functions during infection of chickens with 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, their genome-wide response to infection has not been characterized so far.

<p>To build the PcATP2 model, a divide and conquer strategy was taken. TOPCONS algorithm [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was used to infer membrane protein topology, resulting in 10 TMs. The large intracellular domains (ICD) between TM2 and TM3 (ICD1) and TM4 and TM5 (ICD2) were aligned using MAFFT [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and modeled independently in MODELLER [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. ICD1 was modeled against templates 6KG7, 6ROH, and 1IWO. ICD2 was modeled against templates 6K7G, 6ROH, 1IWO, 4HQJ, and 5MPM. All TMs were modeled by carbon alpha molecular replacement in UCSF Chimera [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] using 6K7G and 6ROH as templates. The whole PcATP2 sequence was realigned using MAFFT and manually refined against the ICD1, ICD2, and the TMs. This alignment was used as template to build the overall PcATP2 model in MODELLER. PcATP2 model was embedded in an POPC bilayer, energy minimized, and equilibrated for 10â€…ns using the CHARMM36F [

<p>Another interesting aspect can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f042">Figure 42</xref>D, in which the hardness after cooling and ageing for pure Al0.6Mg0.8Si shows a maximum at the UCCR determined by DSC, and unlike all other alloys studied in this work, the hardness drops with faster cooling rates. Similar results have been reported for high-purity AlZnMg alloys [
 <xref rid="B188-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. It is possible that small quench-induced precipitates forming around the UCCR contribute a hardening effect.

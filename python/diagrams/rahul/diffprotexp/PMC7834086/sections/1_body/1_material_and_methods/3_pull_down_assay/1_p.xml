<p>The proteins that potentially interact with the PirB protein in shrimp hemocytes were analyzed using pull-down experiments, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. First, recombinant GST-tagged PirB protein (designated GST-rPirB) was cloned, expressed in the pEGX-6p-1 plasmid (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) before being puriﬁed using glutathione sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, CT, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, shrimp hemocytes harvested as described in subsection 2.2, were thoroughly washed three times with 0.01 M PBS before being lysed at 4°Cfor 30 min with lysis buffer (containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA-Na
 <sub>2</sub> · 2H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 1% Triton X-100 and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche, Switzerland), and then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4°C to collect the supernatant. Finally, lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with glutathione sepharose beads (to which GST-rPirB or rGST has been coupled to) and then centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. After discarding the supernatant, samples were washed five times with 1% Triton X-100 in 0.01 M PBS, and then incubated with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare, CT, USA) for 16 h at 4°C, before being centrifuged at 1,000 g at 4°C for 2 min. Supernatants were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

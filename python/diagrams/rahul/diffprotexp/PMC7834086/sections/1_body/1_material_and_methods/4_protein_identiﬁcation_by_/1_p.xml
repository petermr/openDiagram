<p>The SDS-PAGE diﬀerential gel bands on the experimental samples from the pull-down assay were excised and submitted to a commercial company, Shanghai Applied Protein Technology (Shanghai, China), for LC-MS/MS analysis as described previously [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Briefly, the excised gel pieces were washed and de-stained at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were dehydrated and incubated with 10 mM DTT at 56°C for 30 min. Following this, samples were incubated with alkylation solution (10 mM IAA) at room temperature for 20 min, dehydrated followed by enzymatic digestion with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA). Next, the samples were loaded onto a C18 nanoLC trap column and washed with Nano-RPLC Buffer A. An elution gradient of 5–40% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid, 95% acetonitrile/water) in 60 mins gradient was used on an analytical ChromXP C18 column with spray tip. Data were acquired with a Triple TOF 5600 System (AB SCIEX, MA, USA), and the generated LC-MS/MS spectra searched against the NCBI database (

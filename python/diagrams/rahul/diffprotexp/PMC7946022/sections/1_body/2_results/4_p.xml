  <italic>C. albicans</italic> modulates expression of 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm regulators in mixed-species biofilms
 </bold>. Transcriptomic analysis of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> recovered from explanted catheters revealed that 134 genes were differentially expressed between the multi-species biofilms and the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> alone biofilms. These included 43 genes with higher expression in the multi-species biofilm and 91 genes with lower expression in the multi-species biofilm (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and S1). The most notable modulations were in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> key-regulatory genes involved in biofilm formation, including sarU, icaB, icaC, lrgA, lrgB and nuc (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While the ica genes involved in the production of PIA (polysaccharide intercellular adhesin) were upregulated, the anti-holin like repressors of cell autolysis (lrgA and B) and the DNA nuclease (nuc) were downregulated. An overall downregulation of toxins and hemolysins was seen in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> from mixed-biofilms including genes for gamma-hemolysins, alpha-hemolysin, leucocidin and staphylokinase; similarly, immunomodulatory and adhesion genes were also found to be down-regulated in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in mixed biofilms. In contrast, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis was significantly induced by the presence of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Although 114Â 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> genes were found to be differentially-expressed between 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> alone and mixed-species biofilms (Table S2), Gene Ontology Analysis (GO) did not detect significant enrichment among the differentially-expressed genes. Therefore, we focused our downstream analyses on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> genes that were significantly regulated in the mixed-species biofilms.

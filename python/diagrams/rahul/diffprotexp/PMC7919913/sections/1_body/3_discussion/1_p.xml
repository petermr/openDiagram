<p>Studies have shown that MV is an important carrier to mediate non-contact cell-to-cell information communication [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, cells can produce a small amount of MVs, while such production is significantly increased under some pathophysiological conditions [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Interestingly, miR-21 is highly expressed in the heart and kidneys and specifically involved in all types of CRS. Additionally, elevated levels of miR-21 related with a poor outcome. In the present study, we reported that the secreted miR-21 could serve as the molecule mediating kidney and heart communication. It may provide valuable insights into the mechanism underlying the progression of CKD-related CVD.

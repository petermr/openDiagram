<p id="Par48">It was worth noting that the differentially expressed 3′ UTR (MSTRG.2270.1), despite showing higher expression in salivary gland sporozoites, the peptide spectrum-match that maps to the 3′-end of the canonical gene (gene identifier: PF3D7_1013400) was only present in oocyst sporozoites. This is in line with the RNA-seq data, where the 3′-end is clearly expressed in oocyst sporozoites but almost undetectable in salivary gland sporozoite. Even though there were only two PSMs from this nORF before normalization in oocyst sporozoites, the 3′ UTR was still captured at such low expression, it is unlikely that the absence of peptide from 3′ UTR in salivary gland sporozoites is due to chance or physical chemistry of the peptide ion. It is possible that the protein with 3′UTR is an isoform specific to the oocyst sporozoite stage.</p>

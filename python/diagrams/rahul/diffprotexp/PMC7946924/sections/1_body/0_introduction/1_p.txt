0: For food calories, nearly half of the seven billion people on earth depend on rice 1.
1: Majority of the rice consumers live in the low income countries of tropical Asia and for them rice accounts for more than 76% of caloric intake 2.
2: Improvement of yield potential of the irrigated IR8-parented semi-dwarf rice has accounted for the food grain surplus in the rice growing nations and ensured food security since 1960s.
3: However, the yield potential has almost stagnated in the last 23 decades and on farm yield seldom has gone beyond 10 t ha 13 in spite of improved management practices.
4: Currently speculation is ripe for a shortage of food in the absence of another quantum jump of yield potential in near future 4.
5: For gain in yield potential, breeders have targeted on improvement of panicle grain number.
6: Using advanced technologies and accessing improved breeding populations, several new large panicle rice cultivars bearing numerous spikelets, such as, hybrid rice, super rice, new plant type rice have been developed 3,  5,  6 but the intended matching benefit of grain yield is not accrued.
7: The increase of spikelet/grain number without corresponding increase of size makes the panicle compact/dense, where a trade off between grain number and filling derides commensurate advancement of yield benefit 10.
8: Consequently the failing spikelets located especially on the proximal part of panicle become barren or poorly filled 7,  8.
9: Spikelets compromised for accommodation within crammed space of panicle rachis produce high concentration of ethylene at anthesis to the detriment of starch synthesis and filling of the developing grains 9,  10.

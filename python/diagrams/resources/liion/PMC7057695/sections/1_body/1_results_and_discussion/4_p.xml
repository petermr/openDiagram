 </xref>a–c shows the open-circuit voltage versus time curves measured at 60, 50, and 20% SOD, respectively. Although the open-circuit voltage fluctuates slightly at the same temperature, the change in trend can be seen. As the temperature increases along 0, 10, 20, and 30 °C, the open-circuit voltage decreases in turn. The open-circuit voltage at the same temperature is taken as the middle value of the stable stage, and the obtained temperature versus open-circuit voltage curve (

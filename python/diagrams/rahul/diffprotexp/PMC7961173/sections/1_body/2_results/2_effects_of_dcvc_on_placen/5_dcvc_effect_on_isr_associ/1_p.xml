<p id="Par39">Because ATF4-driven transcriptional activity is a key indicator of UPR/ISR activation, ATF4 gene targets, previously determined elsewhere (Bao et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>; Shpilka and Haynes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2018</xref>), were tested for overrepresentation among DCVC-induced differentially expressed genes using a statistical enrichment test. Of the 301 differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) resulting from exposure to 20 µM DCVC for 12 h, 15.6% (47 genes) were identified as ATF4 gene targets, reflecting a statistically significant overrepresentation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.52 × 10
 <sup>–22</sup>). Of the 47 ATF4 gene targets, 44 were upregulated and 3 were downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]). These results support ISR activation as a major response in HTR-8/SVneo cells to DCVC exposure.

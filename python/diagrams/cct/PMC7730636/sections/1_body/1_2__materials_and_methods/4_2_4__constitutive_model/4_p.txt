0: By differentiating Equation (13) at constant temperature,  (14)1n=lnsinhln  where the parameter n can again be determined as the reciprocal value of the average slopes of the linear fitting between  ln[sinh and  ln .
1: Moreover, from this dependence, parameter, A is determined from the intercept of the linear fitting according to  (15)lnA=QRT+C n where  C represents the intercept of the linear fitting for each temperature.
2: From Equation (12) it is possible to determine for each strain rate the dependence between  ln[sinh and 1000/ T. Average value of the linear fitting slopes from this plot expresses the  Q/ Rn, and thus, the hot deformation activation energy  Q.
3: Then the flow stress based on the mathematical model will be  (16)=1lnZA1n+ZA2n+112

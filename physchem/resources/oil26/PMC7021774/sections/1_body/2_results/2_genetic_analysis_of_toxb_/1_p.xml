<p id="Par17">ToxB sensitivity in the MAGIC population (
 <italic>n</italic> = 643) was found to be highly heritable (
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.95). Mean ToxB sensitivity in the progeny ranged between 0 (insensitive) and 2.25, with 503 lines = 0, 70 lines &gt; 0 ≤ 1 and 67 lines &gt; 1. QTL mapping of ToxB sensitivity in the MAGIC population using log
 <sub>10</sub> transformed phenotypic data and four genetic mapping approaches (SMA, IBD, IM, CIM) all identified a major QTL on the short arm of chromosome 2B (e.g. for IM analysis, −log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> = 109.19, accounting for 41% of the phenotypic variation) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Supplementary Table 1). To help determine the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> interval, CIM using 5 and 10 covariates and an empirical 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01 significance threshold (−log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.29) identified a 15.11 cM region (from SNPs BS00034887_51 to BS00053520_51). Within this region, via systematic comparison of the 
 <italic>P</italic> values along with the genetic and physical map positions of the markers, we define the peak of this QTL to be located in a 1.094 Mbp interval from 24.092 Mbp (BS00070051_51) to 25.186 Mbp (BS00002660_51), which includes all markers with −log

 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 90 from the IM and CIM analyses. This locus corresponds to be the major ToxB sensitivity locus 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> (Friesen and Farris 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>), based on the position of the MAGIC SNPs identified here and the previously identified 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic>-linked flanking markers 
 <italic>TC339813</italic> and 
 <italic>BE444541</italic> (Abeysekara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>), which we find to be located on chromosome 2B at 22.230 and 24.100 Mb, respectively. Additionally, a putative minor QTL was identified on the long arm of chromosome 2A, identified using CIM-cov10 (−log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.70) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This QTL is located between 132.174 and 146.829 cM with the QTL peak defined by SNP markers Kukri_c24064_2095 and BS00022641_51 and explained 1.4% of the phenotypic variation. Given the locations of the 2A and 2B QTLs on the long and short chromosomal arms, respectively, these are not assumed to be homoeologous loci. Note that for the minor 2A QTL, while the CIM-cov10 result was above the empirical 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 (–log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> = 4.36) and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01 (−log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.29) significance thresholds, using CIM-cov5 it was found to be insignificant (−log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.68).

0: To better understand the selective pressure, a series of evolutionary models were compared in the likelihood.
1: We first use the M0 model (Model A), which assumed that all branches in the phylogenetic tree has a common value, and compare it with the null hypothesis (Model B), which assumed that the common value in the phylogenetic tree is 1.
2: To further understand whether the selective pressure on the lineages leading to pseudogenes was relaxed, we constructed Model C, which assumed that the branches with pseudogene had their own selection pressure  2, while the background branches without pseudogenization was  1, and then compared Model C with Model A.
3: To further confirm whether the selective pressure on the lineages leading to pseudogenes was completely relaxed, we build the Model D, which assumed that the branches with pseudogene had their own selection pressure  2 = 1, while the selective pressure of background branches was  1, and then compared Model C with Model D.

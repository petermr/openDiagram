0: Despite the above described well documented ameliorative effects of K V1.3 blockers on neuroinflammation  in vivo and on microglial signaling cascades and inflammatory mediator expression and secretion  in vitro, the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how K V1.3 blockers affect microglial functions was long unclear.
1: Many investigators, our own laboratory included, simply assumed that K V1.3 was serving the same function in microglia that it was fulfilling in T cells, namely regulating membrane potential and calcium influx [ 29, 32, 33].
2: In T cells, K V1.3 inhibition leads to membrane depolarization and reduces calcium influx through calcium release-activated calcium channels (CRAC) following T cell receptor stimulation [ 33, 35, 36].
3: Calcium influx via CRAC channels is critically required for dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent transcription factor NFAT [ 29], which triggers transcription of the cytokine IL-2 [ 29, 33].
4: IL-2 is released from activated T cells upon synthesis and stimulates T cell clonal expansion in an autocrine and a paracrine manner.
5: By inhibiting the counterbalancing potassium efflux that is necessary to sustain calcium influx through CRAC channels K V1.3 blockers disrupt T cells activation, prevent NFAT dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation [ 32] leading to reduced T cell proliferation and reduced inflammatory cytokine production and secretion at 48 hours [ 5, 33, 35, 36].
6: However, it had never been tested in microglia, which unlike T cells also express the inward rectifier K ir2.1 [ 17, 37, 38] and the two-pore potassium channel THIK-1 (K 2P13.1) [ 39], whether K V1.3 blockers would have the same molecular effects or if the role of K V1.3 was taken over by these other potassium channels.
7: In a recent study our group accordingly addressed this question by first reexamining the fundamental significance of K V1.3 in maintaining resting membrane potential and resisting depolarization [ 40].
8: As expected, overexpression of K V1.3 in CHO cells lowered the typically very depolarized resting membrane potential of these cells from 20 mV to 50 mV, while K V1.3 inhibition with ShK-223 depolarized microglia, which inherently maintain a more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, which in our hands averaged around 90 mV in undifferentiated microglia predominantly expressing K ir2.1 and around 65 mV in LPS stimulated microglia expressing higher K V1.3 and lower K ir2.1 current densities [ 40].

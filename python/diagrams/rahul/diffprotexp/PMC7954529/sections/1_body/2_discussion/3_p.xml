<p>We characterized APA in human and chimpanzee LCLs to begin to understand the role that co-transcriptional mechanisms play in the evolution of gene regulation in primates. Our group has previously studied a variety of other gene regulatory phenotypes in primate LCLs (

 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that gene regulatory phenotypes in these cell lines recapitulate many regulatory patterns seen in primary tissues (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Çalışkan et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Khaitovich et al., 2006</xref>). Not only did our use of primate LCLs allow us to circumvent many of the practical and ethical issues associated with primate research, but it also allowed us to integrate 3' Seq and gene expression data from this study in the context of previously collected ribosome occupancy and protein expression data from primate LCLs (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). Together, these data allowed us to study the contribution of APA to inter-species differences in transcript and protein expression levels. We recognize the limitations of this study with respect to physiologically interesting phenotypes. The genome-wide map of APA events in human and chimpanzee has allowed us to infer global mechanisms connecting APA to other gene regulatory processes. By expanding the study of primate APA into other cell types and dynamic processes, future studies will be able to connect the mechanisms described here to primate phenotypes of interest.

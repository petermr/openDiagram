0: An important step in many cryopreservation protocols is the exposure of  in vitro cultivated plants to stresses similar to drought, salinity and frost prior to the cryopreservation.
1: Therefore, it is expected that studies on the mechanisms by which plants respond to dehydration stresses can be used for the improvement of cryopreservation methods, currently with often low and unpredictable results [ 8].
2: Moreover, one of the most common acclimation mechanisms related to freezing tolerance is the accumulation of osmo-active compounds, a mechanism that is induced by drought and cold exposure.
3: Soluble sugars form an important part of these osmo-active molecules and are furthermore involved in various metabolic events and can act as signal molecules regulating gene expression and protein activity, especially those involved in photosynthesis, sucrose metabolism and osmolyte synthesis [ 9].

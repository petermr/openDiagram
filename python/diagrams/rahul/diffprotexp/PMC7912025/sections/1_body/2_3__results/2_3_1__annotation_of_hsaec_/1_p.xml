<p>The structural and quality annotation of novel transcript isoforms (SQANTI) analysis pipeline was used for a systematic characterization and curation of the full-length transcriptome [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the curated transcriptome, 113,082 unique isoforms were identified, encoded by 13,038 genes (12,013 annotated and 1025 novel). Characterization of the transcripts by canonical splice junctions included 28,561 represented full splice matches (FSMs), and 35,495 were incomplete splice matches (ISM) (
 <xref rid="viruses-13-00218-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For the purposes of this analysis, canonical splice junctions correspond to those with the dinucleotide GT at the beginning of an intron, followed by AG at the end, as well as GC-AG and AT-AC; these combinations are present in more than 99.9% of all human introns [

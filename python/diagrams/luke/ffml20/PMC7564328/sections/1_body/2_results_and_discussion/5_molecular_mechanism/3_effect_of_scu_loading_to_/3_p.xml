<p id="p0200">The results of surface relaxation showed that the surface structure with the double-cyclodextrin was the most stable one which was at least 1.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> kcal/mol lower than other surfaces. Based on this surface structure, the models of the glucose rings in SCU inside and outside the CD-MOF surface were constructed and simulated respectively (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B and C). The results showed that the structure of the glucose ring inside the CD-MOF surface (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B) was more stable (129 kcal/mol lower than the other case), which was also the maximum possibility in the realistic circumstances. The energy of the more stable surface was 34 kcal/mol lower than the blank surface, which lead to a lower possibility of agglomeration or great flowability between particles. In these two primary typical statuses, the difference of surface free energy of SCU@CD-MOF meant that the three-dimensional orientation of SCU inside CD-MOF would affect the surface properties of the powders, which possibly contributed to its laryngeal deposition.

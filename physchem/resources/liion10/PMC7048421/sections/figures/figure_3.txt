1: 3Temperature dependence of cell power performance.
2: (   A and    B) DCRs of discharge and charge, respectively, at 50% SOC for SEB cells versus the baseline LIB cell.
3: (   C) Relative discharge power (DCR   baseline@RT/DCR) of a SEB cell versus the baseline LIB cell.
4: (   D) Relative reactivity (   Rct,baseline@RT/   Rct) of a SEB cell versus the baseline LIB cell, showing that SEB cells operated at appropriate elevated temperatures, e.g., SEB-3 at 50C, can deliver sufficient power at all ambient temperatures (labeled as line a), that SEB cells are 5 safer and less aging at room temperature (labeled as line b), and that SEB cells are 2.6 less prone to thermal runaway at 60C (labeled as line c).

<p id="Par47">The potential of apomixis for fixing heterosis has long been recognized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, the use of this trait in combination with sexuality can dramatically accelerate the development of new hybrid varieties and reduce the costs associated with seed-production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Among other advantages, the transference of apomixis to species of agricultural interest will allow the perpetuation of genetic resources including wide-cross hybrids, the rapid generation of adapted crops, the avoidance of monocultures and the development of maternal seeds from vegetatively propagated cultivars, like potatoes or strawberries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The apomixis breeding technology impact in global agriculture could be comparable to that produced by the green revolution, initiated in USA, Mexico, India and further spread to other countries in the middle ‘70s [

  <p>Autophagic-lysosomal pathway in VD. Autophagic and lysosomal markers were determined in 
   <italic>post-mortem</italic> human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of VD patients and controls. The levels of LC3II, p62, Beclin1, Lamp2A, Lamp1 and CatD were determined in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) SNpc; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Hippocampus and (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Densitometric analysis of the levels of LC3II, p62, Beclin1, Lamp2A, Lamp1 and CatD. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5–6, *p &lt; 0.05, versus SNpc control subjects and 
   <sup>&amp;</sup>p &lt; 0.05, versus cortex control subjects). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information.

<p>We used paired transcriptomic and neuroanatomical analyses to map changes in the fetal brain following MIA in a poly(I:C) mouse model (

 <italic>vs.</italic> 6 samples at E17.5, and 10

For transcriptomic analysis, we used a strategy of first defining DE genes at each time-point using the general linear model (GLM) approach implemented in edgeR, followed by mapping DE signatures to systems-level expression patterns via module assignment using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).

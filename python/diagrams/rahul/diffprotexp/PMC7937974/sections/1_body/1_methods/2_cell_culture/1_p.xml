<p>Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Before performing subsequent experiments, cells were treated with DMEM/F12 supplemented with 15% sera from KD patients or HC for 4 h. THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells at passages 4–6 were used for the following experiments

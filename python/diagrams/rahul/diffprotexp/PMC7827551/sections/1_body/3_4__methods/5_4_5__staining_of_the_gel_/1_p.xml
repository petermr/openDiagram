<p>Silver stain was used to stain the gels (2D-Silver Stain Reagent II, Cosmobio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For gel imaging, the 2-DE protein patterns were recorded as digitalized images using a high-resolution scanner. Images were captured at 800 dpi as TIEF file for comparison. Scanned TIEF images were compared using Progenesis SameSpots software (Totallab, Newcastle, UK) to detect the significantly different spots between gel images. Briefly, SameSpot overlaid images and grouped them according to the predefined settings. Next, the landmark spots were automatically defined and confirmed manually. We selected a reference image where other images were normalized on it (usually the one contains the maximum number of spots). In a final step, the software calculated the intensities of all sots of the reference image and normalized other images based on that one. Significant spots were selected with ANOVA with 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and cutoff spots ≥2-fold different. These spots were then cut out for mass spectrometric exploration.

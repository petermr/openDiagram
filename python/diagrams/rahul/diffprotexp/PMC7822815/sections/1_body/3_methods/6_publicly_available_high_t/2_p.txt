1: Datasets comprised RNA-Seq data on primary samples from 20 patients each with either t(8;21)-positive AML, karyotypically normal AML (KN), inv(16)-positive AML and different rearrangements of the MLL gene (MLLr).
2: Furthermore, they comprised 20 samples each of normal bone marrow-derived CD34-positive cells (BM), umbilical cord blood-derived CD34-positive cells (CB) and mobilized normal peripheral blood-derived CD34-positive cells (PB) (Supplementary Data  1).

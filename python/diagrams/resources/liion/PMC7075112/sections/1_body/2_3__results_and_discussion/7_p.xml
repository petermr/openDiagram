It can be seen that the electrochemical performance of the HPC anode is superior to most of reported biomass-based carbon materials. The outstanding electrochemical property can be ascribed to the following aspects. Firstly, the HPC with high specific surface area can make the electrolyteâ€“electrode interface large enough to accumulate rich charges and ions. In addition, it also can provide large contact area and mutual interactions between the electrolyte and active materials. Secondly, the first-class pores in the hierarchically porous structure can relieve the volume change during the cycling procedure while the second-class pores can provide rich and fast paths for the transfer of ions and electrons. Thirdly, the value of I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> is 1.0, indicating that the materials contain both defects and good electrical conductivity. The defects are good for electron transfer, and the great electrical conductivity is beneficial to improve the rate property of the battery. Based on the above discussions, we can conclude that the HPC synthesized from biomass material in this study has great potential as anodes for LIBs. Moreover, this paper also provides us a new proposal for the fabrication of low-cost carbon-based anode materials, and the route is expected to be extended and applied to various biomasses in future.

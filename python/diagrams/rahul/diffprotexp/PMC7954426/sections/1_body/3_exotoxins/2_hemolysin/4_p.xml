<p>Recently, an hlyC-related sequence has been found in the genome of 
 <italic>M. hyorhinis</italic> strain HUB-1. After mutation by the oriC-plasmids, the hemolytic ability of the culture supernatant on mouse erythrocytes was shown to be significantly decreased. This is the first time that a particular gene was associated with a hemolytic phenotype [
 <xref rid="cit0229" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]; however, further investigations are warranted to verify the pathogenic role of 
 <italic>M. hyorhinis</italic>. Nevertheless, there are three hemolysin genes (
 <italic>hlyA, hlyB</italic>, and 
 <italic>hlyC</italic>) present in the genomes of 
 <italic>M. conjunctivae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0230" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Although these hemolysins are not as important as those in other pathogenic mycoplasmas, it cannot be ruled out that these hemolysins contribute to the pathogenicity of these mycoplasmas. Hemolytic activity has also been found in some 
 <italic>M. arginini</italic> camel isolates [
 <xref rid="cit0156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], but the mechanism is not yet understood.

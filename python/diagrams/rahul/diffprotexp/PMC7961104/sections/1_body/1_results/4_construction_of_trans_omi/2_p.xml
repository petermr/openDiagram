<p id="p0115">For liver, the resulting network included 673 metabolic reactions that were differentially regulated in fasted 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice and that had regulatory inputs from the Enzyme Protein layer and the Metabolite layer (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A, left). Of these 673 metabolic reactions, 364 reactions had opposing regulatory input from those two layers, thus we classified these as “controversial” (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, upper). For all differential regulations except those involving allosteric regulation, the number of activating regulations exceeded the number of inhibiting regulations and the number of differentially expressed molecules that increased exceeded those that decreased except in the TF layer, which had equivalent numbers of DRTFs with increased and decreased activity.

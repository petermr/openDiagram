0: In this experiment, the angle of repose of SCU@CD-MOF was determined by the fixed cone method 45,  46,  47.
1: Two funnels with a diameter of 7.0 cm were taken in series on an iron stand.
2: A watch glass with a diameter of 3.2 cm on a horizontal table was placed at a distance of 5.0 cm from the bottom of the funnel.
3: The center of the watch glass was directly opposite the funnel outlet.
4: An appropriate amount of SCU@CD-MOF was poured slowly into the funnel, and let it flow naturally through the two funnels under the gravity until the powders formed a cone and started to overflow from the edge of the watch glass.
5: The height  H of the powder cone was measured, and the measurement was repeated for three times.
6: The angle of repose was calculated as Eq.
7: (2): (2)Angle of repose=Arctan(2HD)

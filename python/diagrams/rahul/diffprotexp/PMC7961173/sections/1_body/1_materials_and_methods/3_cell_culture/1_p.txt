0: HTR-8/SVneo cells, a gift from Dr. Charles H. Graham (Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada), were cultured as previously described (Graham et al.
1: 1993; Hassan et al.
2: 2016; Tetz et al.
3: 2013).
4: Briefly, cells were cultured between passages 7884 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator.
5: Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium with 10% FBS and 1% P/S prior to and during experiments to ensure optimal cell growth as previously described by Graham et al.
6: (Graham et al.
7: 1993).
8: Cells were grown to 7090% confluence at least 24 h after plating prior to use in any experiments.
9: For gene expression experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 800,000 cells per well in 6-well cell culture plates.
10: 24 h later, cells were treated with RPMI 1640 complete medium alone (control) or complete medium plus DCVC diluted to a final concentration of 10 or 20 M for 6 or 12 h. Four independent biological replicate experiments were performed.

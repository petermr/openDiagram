<p>We have previously established a mouse model of SLEV-induced encephalitis in adult immunocompetent mice [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We observed that intracranial SLEV infection induces the expression of both type I and type II IFNs in the brain, together with a plethora of proinflammatory mediators and leukocyte recruitment, culminating in tissue damage and death. IFN responses are typically associated with protection in Flavivirus infections, being explored in the development of potential treatments [

 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and development of susceptible mouse models [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and studying disease pathogenesis [

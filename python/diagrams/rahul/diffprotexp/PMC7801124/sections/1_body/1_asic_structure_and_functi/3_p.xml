<p>In whole-cell recordings of rASIC3-transfected COS-7 cells, the current measured had a half-maximal pH (pH
 <sub>0.5</sub>) of activation at pH 6.7, a pH
 <sub>0.5</sub> steady-state inactivation of pH 7.1 and amiloride inhibited the current at micromolar levels (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 63 µM) [

Mouse ASIC3 (mASIC3) shows similar proton-sensitivity to rASIC3, but naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3), despite sharing &gt;80% amino acid identity with mASIC3 and rASIC3, respectively, is not activated by extracellular protons. Much like proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 is able to traffic to the cell membrane and modulate the properties of proton-sensitive ASIC subunits [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. There is an 84% amino acid identity between hASIC3 and rASIC3, the 16% difference accounting for some differences in channel activity, such as hASIC3 requiring only pH 6.0 for sustained current activation, whereas rASIC3 requires a more acidic pH 4.5 [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, hASIC3, but not rASIC3, has 3 splice variants resulting in differences in the C-terminal domain and one of these, hASIC3a, is activated (albeit to a lesser extent) by alkalinization [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, contrary to the function implied by the name 
 <italic>acid</italic>-sensing ion channel, it appears that activation is according to a change in pH, rather than acid-sensing per se. Residues Arg68 and Arg83 located within the base of the palm region of hASIC3a have been implicated in sensing alkalinization, such that if they are mutated the sustained current in high pH is significantly reduced; these residues are absent in rASIC3 which aligns with the fact that rASIC3 is activated only by pH&lt;7.0 [

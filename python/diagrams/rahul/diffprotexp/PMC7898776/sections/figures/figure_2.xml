   <bold>a</bold> PCA scores scatter plot in positive ion (left) and in negative ion (right) scan modes for the two groups. 
   <bold>b</bold> PLS-DA scores scatter plot in positive ion (left) and in negative ion (right) scan modes for the two groups. 
   <bold>c</bold> The heat map of differential metabolites from the related pathways between the two groups in both positive and negative mode. Each line represents a differential metabolite and each cross represents a plasma sample group. Different colors represent different abundance intensity, and the higher abundance intensity shows a gradual increase from dark color to red color

<p id="Par2">Tan spot, also known as yellow (leaf) spot, is a major fungal disease of wheat (
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.). It is caused by the necrotrophic fungus 
 <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> (Died.) Drechs. (abbreviated here as 
 <italic>Ptr</italic>; syn, 
 <italic>Dreschlera tritici-repentis</italic> [
 <italic>Dtr</italic>]) and typified by necrotic lesions as well as regions of chlorosis on infected leaves, which result in reduced leaf photosynthetic area. This typically results in a 5–10% reduction in grain yield, although losses can reach 50% under favourable conditions (De Wolf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). Tan spot is recognised as a major disease in a number of wheat-growing areas, including Europe, South America, Canada and Australia (Annone

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; Savary et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>). A complex 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> race structure has been defined, with screening against a differential set of wheat varieties allowing at least eight races to be described, termed race 1–8 (Lamari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). Necrotrophic effectors (previously termed ‘host-selective toxins’) mediate the interaction between a given 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> race and its susceptible differential host line. In contrast to the classical gene-for-gene model, whereby interaction of avirulence effectors with host resistance gene complexes confers resistance, the tan spot host–pathogen system appears to be largely governed in an inverse gene-for-gene manner, whereby effector sensitivity is conferred by a single dominant host gene (Tan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2010</xref>). The host genotype specificity of effectors makes them important factors in disease development, and the removal of host sensitivity genes is a priority for breeding efforts.

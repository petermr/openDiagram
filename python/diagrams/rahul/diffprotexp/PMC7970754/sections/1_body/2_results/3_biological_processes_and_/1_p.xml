<p>In order to further explore the biological process and KEGG pathway affected by RSV in the treatment of TNBC, a functional enrichment analysis was conducted for genes affected by RSV in the treatment of TNBC. The results showed (

 </xref>) that genes affected by RSV in TNBC cells were mainly involved in biological processes such as the regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition, regulation of cell cycle phase transition, chromosome segregation, DNA replication, and cell cycle DNA replication. Moreover, these genes were mainly involved in the KEGG pathways such as autophagy âˆ’ animal, MAPK signaling pathway, apoptosis, p53 signaling pathway, and the cell cycle (

 </xref>). Most genes affected by resveratrol were found to be enriched in apoptosis related pathways, suggesting that resveratrol can promote the apoptosis of TNBC cells.

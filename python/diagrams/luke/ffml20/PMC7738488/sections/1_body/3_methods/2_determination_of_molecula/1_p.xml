 </sup> and further studied for the estimation of various molecular dimensions. In the exploration of molecular simulations, the force field act as an essential key element. The force field proportionally studies the estimation of potential energy and computation of forces acting on the atom, of the system under assessment. In this work, the polymeric dendritic molecules were parameterized employing the UFF i.e. Universal Forcefield. This forcefield is a broad spectra and non-reactive approach towards introduction of weighted atom types and weighted bonds, used to update topologies and atom parameterizations at every time step of a simulation. Each molecular model was then subjected to an amalgamation of steepest descent and conjugate gradient energy minimization steps of 25,000 cycles, in order to relax close atomic distances. The minimization methods steepest descent and conjugate gradient were employed in combination for effective results, where, former is faster and latter productive. Moreover, the system was equilibrated by performing 8–12 ns MD simulations in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble. In the MD simulation, the atoms included in molecules move according to the Newtonian equation of motions. Subsequently, the 1 fs time step algorithm was employed to achieve the process of integrating the equation of motion, as integration method.

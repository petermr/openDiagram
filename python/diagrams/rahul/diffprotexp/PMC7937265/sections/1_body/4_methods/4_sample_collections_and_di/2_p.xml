<p id="Par49">Following euthanasia by rapid decapitation, trunk blood was collected and kept on ice until whole blood could be centrifuged to collect plasma which was stored at -20 °C for hormone analysis. Immediately after trunk blood was collected, brains were rapidly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C for later dissection. Euthanasia was performed without the use of anesthesia because decapitation is a very quick method of euthanasia for small animals [

Briefly, optimal cutting temperature compound was used to embed brains, 50 μm coronal sections were cut with a cryostat (Leica CM 3050S), and a sterile, disposable 1 mm biopsy punch (Integra, York, PA, USA) was used to make vertical punches to obtain the HYPO and TnA according to the songbird brain atlas [

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zebrafinchatlas.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.zebrafinchatlas.org</ext-link>) (Supplementary Fig. S3, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The HYPO was identified using the third ventricle, optic chiasm, and ventral supraoptic decussation as landmarks. TnA was identified by following the robust nucleus of the arcopallium in towards the medial surface of the telencephalic lobe adjacent to the cerebellum. Tissue punches were immediately placed on dry ice and stored at -80 °C until further processing.

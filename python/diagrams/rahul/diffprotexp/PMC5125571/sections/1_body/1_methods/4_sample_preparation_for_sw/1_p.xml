<p>Cell pellet (hemocytes) from each time point was resuspended with 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 3 M Urea, 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, Protease inhibitor cocktail (EDTA- free), 50 mM Tris-Hcl and 0.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> and homogenized on ice by sonication (Qsonica, Newtown, CT; 10 cycles of 10 s pulses) followed by incubation on a tube agitator at 4°C for 30 min. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 
 <italic>g</italic> and left at 4°C for 20 min. The pellet was discarded and protein supernatant was concentrated using 10 kDa Amicon filters (Millipore). Plasma proteins were directly concentrated using the same filters. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, USA). The concentrated protein was then stored at -80°C until use. Twenty μg of protein was applied onto a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Protein reduction, alkylation and 
 <italic>in gel</italic> digestion were performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Briefly, protein samples were reduced by addition of 0.5 M dithiothreitol at 65°C for 1 h, and then cysteine residues were alkylated with 0.5 M iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in darkness at 37°C for 45 min. Proteins were digested using trypsin (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37°C overnight. Prior to SWATH analysis, trypsin-digested samples from each time point were pooled and peptide amount normalized to 5 μg using a C18 Zip-Tip (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 1 μL of iRT Kit (Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) was added in order to normalize retention times.

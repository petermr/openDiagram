<p>Some differential proteins were selected to perform the mRNA expression level verification in order to validate the iTRAQ results. Total RNA was extracted in accordance with the Trizol kit’s operating manual procedures and system. 1 μg of total RNA was taken and reversely transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA was served as a template. Real-time PCR internal reference gene (actin primers) were used in Q-PCR amplification to verify the mass of cDNA. The reaction conditions were (95 °C, 1 min, 1 cycle); (95 °C, 15 s, 60 °C, 40 cycles). The experiment was repeated thrice, and the relative expression was calculated by 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>.

<p>Environmental constraints, like drought or low temperatures, can have adverse effects on plants and, as a consequence, can induce stress responses at the molecular and physiological level [

However, despite extensive research and the use of sophisticated and intensive crop-protection measures, losses due to dehydration stress amount to the billions of dollars annually.

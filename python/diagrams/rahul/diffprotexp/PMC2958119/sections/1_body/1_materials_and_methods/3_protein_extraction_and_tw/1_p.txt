0: Larval protein extractions were carried out according to our previously described method  [20].
1: Protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method.
2: BSA was used as standard and the absorption was measured at 595 nm (Beckman, spectrophotometer DU800).
3: The extracted protein (380 g from each sample with 3 replicates) were resuspended in lysis buffer (LB) [8M urea, 2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mM Tris-base, 30 mM DTT, 2% Bio-lyte pH 310] and then mixed with rehydration buffer [8M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.001% bromophenol blue, 45 mM DTT, 0.2% Bio-lyte pH 310].
4: The mixture was loaded onto a 17 cm IPG strip (immobilized pH gradient, pH 310, linear, Bio-Rad).
5: Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed at 18C according to manufacturer's instructions (Protean IEF Cell, Bio-Rad).
6: Before sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the IPG strips were first equilibrated for 15 minutes in equilibration buffer 1 [6M urea, 0.375M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% DTT] followed by equilibration in buffer 2 [6M urea, 0.375M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2.5% iodoacetoamide] for another 15 minutes.
7: Then, the strips were transferred onto 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel (1.00 mm).
8: Second dimension electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, was performed on a Protean II Xi Cell (Bio-Rad) at 25 mA/gel for 6 hours.

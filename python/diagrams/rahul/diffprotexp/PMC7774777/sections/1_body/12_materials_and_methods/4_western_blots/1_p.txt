0: Western blot analysis was performed using the Bio-Rad Criterion Cell Midi blot system.
1: Protein was collected as described above and quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye method (cat.
2: No.
3: 500-0006) before being separated on a 4% to 20% gradient TGXTM Precast Midi (Bio-Rad, cat.
4: No.
5: 5671094) polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose blotting membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; 1 M tris-HCl, 25% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and heated to 95C for 5 minutes before being resolved on the gel.
6: Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk suspended in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 45 to 60 minutes at room temperature and probed with primary antibodies against K48Ub ( 38) (EMD-Millilore, cat.
7: No.
8: 05-1307), actin ( 39) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat.
9: No.
10: sc-47778), 5 proteasome subunit ( 40) (Enzo life sciences cat No.
11: BML-PW8895-0025), or SOD1 ( 41) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# sc-11407, RRID:AB_2193779) overnight at 4C.
12: All primary antibodies were suspended in 2.5% milk TBST.
13: After a wash series in TBST, blots were then probed with horseradish peroxidase conjugated antimouse ( 42) (Kindle Biosciences Cat# R1005) or antirabbit ( 43) (Kindle Biosciences Cat# R1006) antibodies and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore or Kindle Biosciences).
14: Images of developed blots were captured either using film and then digitized with a flatbed scanner or captured using the KwikQuant Imager system (Kindle Biosciences, cat.
15: No.
16: D1001).
17: Band quantification was performed in ImageJ using the built-in densitometry tools.

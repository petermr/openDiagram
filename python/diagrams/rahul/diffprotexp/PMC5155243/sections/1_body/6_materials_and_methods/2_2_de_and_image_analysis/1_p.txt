0: Protein 2-DE was performed as previously described 3637.
1: Frozen kidney tissues were ground into powder under low-temperature conditions.
2: Protein lysis buffer was added at a 5  volume, and tissues were homogenized in an ice bath for 1 min using a homogenizer.
3: The resultant homogenates were ultra-sonicated 3 times using 58 bursts each time.
4: The samples were placed at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was collected and stored at 80 C for future use.
5: Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) colorimetry.

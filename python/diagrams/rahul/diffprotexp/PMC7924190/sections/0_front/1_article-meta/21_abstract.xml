 <p>In cells, intrinsic endogenous direct current (DC) electric fields (EFs) serve as morphogenetic cues and are necessary for several important cellular responses including activation of multiple signaling pathways, cell migration, tissue regeneration and wound healing. Endogenous DC EFs, generated spontaneously following injury in physiological conditions, directly correlate with wound healing rate, and different cell types respond to these EFs via directional orientation and migration. Application of external DC EFs results in electrode polarity and is known to activate intracellular signaling events in specific direction. In contrast, alternating current (AC) EFs are known to induce continuous bidirectional flow of charged particles without electrode polarity and also minimize electrode corrosion. In this context, the present study is designed to study effects of AC EFs on corneal epithelial cell gene and protein expression profiles in vitro. We performed gene and antibody arrays, analyzed the data to study specific influence of AC EFs, and report that AC EFs has no deleterious effect on epithelial cell function. Gene Ontology results, following gene and protein array data analysis, showed that AC EFs influence similar biological processes that are predominantly responsive to organic substance, chemical, or external stimuli. Both arrays activate cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK and IL-17 signaling pathways. Further, in comparison to the gene array data, the protein array data show enrichment of diverse activated signaling pathways through several interconnecting networks.</p>

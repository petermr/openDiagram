<p>16–48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 0.2 or 0.5 mL lysis buffer (120 mM Tris/Hepes, pH 7,4; 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 3 mM KCl; 1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Roche 1697498, Meylan, France). Samples were harvested and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein expression levels were assessed after normalizing and loading equal amounts of total protein for 7.5% SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotting with the antibodies of interest. For immunoprecipitation, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl; 0.5 mM EGTA; 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>; 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9; 5% (

 <italic>v</italic>) glycerol; 0.5% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) Nonidet P-40) and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics, Meylan France). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using the primary antibody of interest, and affinity purification using protein G-agarose beads (Dynal). After incubation with protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at room temperature, the immunocomplex was washed three times in PBS (Invitrogen). The protein samples were boiled in loading buffer, run on gradient 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, probed with primary antibodies of interest and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, according to standard procedures. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

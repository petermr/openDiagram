<p>LMH cells infected with FAdV-4 were harvested, washed, and lysed with lysis buffer (CST, MA, USA) on ice with PMSF (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), protease and phosphatase inhibitors (CST, MA, USA), the cell lysates were then incubated with mAb 3C2 against Fiber-2 for co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). The protein precipitated were further separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver stain according to the manufactureâ€™s instructions, the differential bands were excised from the gel and transferred to Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Company for mass spectrum analysis.</p>

<p>O-aminobiphenyl (4.231 g, 25 mmol) and concentrated sulfuric acid (50 mL) were added to a 100-mL three-necked flask under argon atmosphere. Then, KNO
 <sub>3</sub> (5.303 g, 52.5 mmol) was added with stirring at 0 °C for 4 h. After that, the reaction mixture was poured into ice water. NaOH was added to adjust the solution to neutral. Subsequently, the orange intermediate (DPNA) was obtained through filtration, which was vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The yield of the product was about 75 % (4.860 g). IR (KBr,

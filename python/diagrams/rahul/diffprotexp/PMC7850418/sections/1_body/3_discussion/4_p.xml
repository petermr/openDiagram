<p>As research on the SARS-CoV ORF6 has attributed this accessory protein (p6) with potential functions of intracellular membrane rearrangements, of interferon induction inhibition, and of replication stimulation [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41–43</xref>], we performed a global 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of the ORF6 variants. Firstly, no significant impact was noted on replication capacity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in comparison to a wild-type strain, in two different cell lineages. The comparable replication kinetics between wild-type and deletion variants determined 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> is supported by the congruent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication capacity with the latter being assessed by RT–PCR from diagnosis (Ct &lt; 20).

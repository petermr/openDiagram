<p>In this study, we found that the expression levels of three cathepsin subtypes L1, D, and B in the oncosphere were higher than those in adults. In consideration of the structural and functional characteristics of the three cathepsins, we inferred that during the host infection process of the oncosphere, cathepsin L1 is released into the cytoplasmic or interstitial spaces, degrading cellular components or intercellular matrix components, so that the oncosphere can pass intestinal epithelial cells and enter the capillaries to reach the blood circulatory system. Cathepsin D can not only use hydrolysis to degrade the extracellular matrix, but also activate cathepsin B. Cathepsin B can act on major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) related constant chains to produce an effect on antigen processing and delivery. The presentation process is blocked, which may reduce the level of host immune response to protect the parasite.</p>

<p id="p0260">Finally, we identified fusion transcripts for 
 <italic>ALK</italic> and 
 <italic>RET</italic> oncogenes. One of them represents a well-known 
 <italic>NCOA4-RET</italic> translocation, and another one is a new hybrid transcript of 
 <italic>ALK</italic> oncogene with a previously unknown upstream fusion partner 
 <italic>ARHGAP12</italic>. The latter can probably drive increased transcription of truncated 
 <italic>ALK</italic> downstream from the fusion site because its normalized expression is one-two orders of magnitude higher in the normal tissues than for the 
 <italic>ALK</italic> gene (UCSC Genome Browser,

 <italic>ARHGAP12</italic> expression was ~12-fold greater than the expression of 
 <italic>ALK</italic>.

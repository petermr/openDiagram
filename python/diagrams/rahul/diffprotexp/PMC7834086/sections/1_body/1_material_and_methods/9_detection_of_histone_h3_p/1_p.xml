<p>The phosphorylation of histone H3 by PirB was determined using Western blot analysis by treating primary shrimp hemocytes with rPirB. Briefly, hemocytes were collected and cultured, followed by treatment with different concentrations of His-rPirB or His-rPirA (0.2 µM or 0.8 µM) at 28°C for 2 h. Next, cells were lysed for 10 min at room temperature with lysis buffer (containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA-Na
 <sub>2</sub> · 2H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche, Switzerland) before being centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 15°C to collect the supernatant. The collected supernatant was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot, as described in subsection 2.2, with mouse anti-histone H3 antibody (1:1000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China), and rabbit anti-phospho histone H3 (Ser10) antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA).

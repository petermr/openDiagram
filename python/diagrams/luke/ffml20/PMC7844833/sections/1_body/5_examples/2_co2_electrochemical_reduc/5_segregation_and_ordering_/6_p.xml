<p>Regarding the CuAu system, it is also worth mentioning that AuCu random alloys and intermetallics are expected to have different catalytic properties, with the more ordered intermetallic material showing higher selectivity toward CO
 <sub>2</sub> conversion to CO.

 </sup> The possibility to distinguish by EXAFS between random alloys and ordered phases was demonstrated by Kim et al. in a study of AuCu NPs,

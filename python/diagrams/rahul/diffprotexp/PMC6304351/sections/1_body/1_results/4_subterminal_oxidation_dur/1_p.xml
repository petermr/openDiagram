 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub> (and not expressed during growth on Tween 80). Three additional proteins identified with a role in the subterminal oxidation of long chain alkanes were, however, specifically significantly upregulated during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The expression of an alcohol dehydrogenase (TOL_2772; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.029) was at least 2.5-fold greater during growth on 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>28</sub> compared to 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub> and Tween 80, and this was significantly upregulated together with a flavin-binding family monooxygenase (TOL_0709; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) that increased 18-fold. TOL_0709 has been identified as a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) class enzyme (BVMOs are known to catalyze the conversion of a ketone into an ester via the insertion of an oxygen in a ketone next to the carbonyl atom) due to the presence of two Rossmann fold motifs flanking two BVMO fingerprint sequence motifs (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Fraaije et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Riebel et al., 2013</xref>) and amino-acid sequence homology to known BVMOâ€™s (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">4</xref>). As well as expression of the BVMO, the use of a sub-terminal oxidation pathway is also supported by the expression of an esterase (TOL_0906; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) that was 17-fold upregulated during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub> compared to 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub> with no expression detected during growth on Tween 80 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). An esterase is required to hydrolyse the subsequent ester of a BVMO sub-terminal oxidation to generate an alcohol and a fatty acid. Metabolite analysis also confirmed that no primary (alcohol 1-octacosanol) was detected in any of the 7 days of growth tested.

<p id="Par30">Finally, we identified a group of DETFs that have been associated with oncogenesis. SOX4 and LMO2 show upregulation after day 1 while HNF4G is downregulated in the same period. These cancer-related TFs were recognized among the top considerable transcripts with differential expression. Similarities between regeneration and cancer-related events have been studied for their involvement in dedifferentiating mechanisms during cellular reprogramming

 </sup>. This compelling process of returning to an undifferentiated state during regeneration, confers high proliferative and migratory capacities to cells, without the loss of cell growth control distinctive of cancer

 </sup>. In the case of SOX4 and LMO2, their role has been established as regulators with aberrant expression leading to an oncogenic state

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. As for HNF4G, its upregulation has been correlated as a prognostic marker for cancer development by promoting cell proliferation

 </sup>, which is interesting considering the opposite expression trend in our results. Other transcripts related to THAP6 and BTF3L4 that show upregulation at day 1, have been associated with an apoptotic regulatory role

 </sup>. This contrasting expression portrays regulatory differences of cancer related mechanisms being activated for dedifferentiation in early stages.

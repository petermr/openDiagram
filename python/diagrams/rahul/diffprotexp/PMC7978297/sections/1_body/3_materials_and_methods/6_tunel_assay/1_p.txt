0: The stained ovarian sections were examined using a TUNEL BrightGreen Apoptosis Detection Kit (Vazyme, A112-03, Nanjing, China).
1: According to the instructions for usage, after incubation of the secondary antibody for MVH in histological staining workflow, the slides were washed twice with PBS and treated with proteinase K for 10 min.
2: Following two further washes with PBS, the slides were incubated with 1  Equilibration Buffer for 25 min at room temperature, and the BrightGreen Labeling Mix was applied at 37 C for 80 min.
3: Then, the samples were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 for cell nuclei and sealed for observation under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51, Japan).

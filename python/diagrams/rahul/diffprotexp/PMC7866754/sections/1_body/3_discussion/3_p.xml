<p id="Par58">By performing GO terms enrichment analysis on the canonical genes associated with the novel ORFs, it appears that they arise from functionally important loci that are critical to the parasite invasion and survival. While the gene set associated with novel ORFs identified in oocyst sporozoites was enriched in GO terms of motility and localization, the gene set for salivary gland sporozoites was more enriched in replisome-related GO terms (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). More importantly, both gene sets showed significant enrichment in the genes that form the actomyosin complex, which is part of the parasite invasion machinery, also known as the glideosome. It is therefore possible that these novel ORFs play a role in host invasion and could serve as a drug target well, especially given that attempt has already been made to target glideosome with small molecules as a potential malaria therapy [

0: LMH cells seeded in the 6-well plate were transfected with sgRNAs targeting the KPNA3 or KPNA4 genes.
1: 48 h post-transfection, 6 M of puromycin was added to the transfected LMH cells.
2: The LMH cells without sgRNA cassettes were then killed within 35 d. KPNA3-KO or KPNA4-KO LMH cells were then isolated by serial dilution, followed by an expansion period to establish a new clonal cell line.

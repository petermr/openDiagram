<p>In summary, through the transcriptome analyses, we inferred that ammonium and urea were both direct nitrogen sources for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> and played a crucial role in its energy supply. However, when urea was used as a nitrogen source, the inferred bacterial motility was the poorest in the three sets of our experimental conditions. Therefore, in the applications where the bacteria are required to undergo continuous mineralization in specific locations, choosing ammonium as a nitrogen source for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> would be more effective according to our findings. As it is known that the ideal compositions of culture medium should be in proportion to the bacterial requirements for each element. The choosing of cheap medium and mineralization conditions for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> needs to pay attention to the supply of ammonium or urea. Our study provides reliable references for the refined preparation of culture media in future large-scale applications, thus may save the application costs. The results of our study contribute to the understanding of the function of nitrogen nutrients to 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>, and they may also be used to regulate the urease activity or control the growth stages of the bacteria, 
 <italic>etc</italic>.

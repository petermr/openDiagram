<p id="Par53">The proteins from liver tissue were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto PVDF membrane. Tri-Methyl-Histone H3 (lys27) (C36B11) Rabbit mAb was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The protein level H3K27me3 were detected by western blotting with the antibody (1:1000–1:4000) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Blots were probed by second antibody labeled with IR-Dye 680 or 800 cw (1:2000–1:4000, Licor, Lincoln, NE, USA) and the membranes were visualized and quantified as the methods described by You et al.

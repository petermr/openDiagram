<p id="Par26">In other words, the large discrepancy between RE and AE for small extensive training sets is because small molecules are less likely to be included. This notion is further reinforced by considering the performance of the models based on random sampling. While the AE predictions of these models are of comparable accuracy with the FPS models (in particular for the smaller training sets), the performance for RE prediction is very poor, with MAEs above 1â€‰eV for small training sets (see SI). Even when the extensive kernel is trained on intensive sets, smaller molecules still offer less potential for improving the loss function and thus lead to a poorer performance for REs.</p>

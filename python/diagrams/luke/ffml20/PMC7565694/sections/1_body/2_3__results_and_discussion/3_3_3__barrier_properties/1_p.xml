<p>The barrier performances of 2,7-CPI film are compared with Kapton and 2,7-CPPI, as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The 2,7-CPI showed better barrier performances than Kapton and 2,7-CPPI. Its WVTR and OTR were low to 0.05 g·m

 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which reduced by three orders of magnitude in comparison with Kapton. Compared with 2,7-CPPI, the WVTR and OTR of 2,7-CPI showed reductions of 50% and 30%, respectively. The 2,7-CPI also showed superior barrier properties in comparison with most reported intrinsic polyimides [

<p id="Par13">Prior to each experiment, a DCVC stock solution aliquot was thawed in a 37 °C water bath and then diluted in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Anti-Anti (villous explants) or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S (HTR-8/SVneo) to final concentrations of 10 or 20 µM DCVC. PBS alone was used as the 0 µM DCVC negative control. These concentrations of DCVC were chosen because we previously demonstrated that they did not induce cytotoxicity at the time points used in the current study (Elkin et al.

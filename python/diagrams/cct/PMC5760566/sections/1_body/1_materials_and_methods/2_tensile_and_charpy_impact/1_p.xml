<p id="Par10">The mechanical properties were evaluated through uniaxial tensile testing (NCS GNT300) of ASTM-E8 standard specimens (diameter: 5 mm, gauge: 25 mm) at room temperature. Impact transition curves were obtained from Charpy impact testing of full-size (10 mm × 10 mm × 55 mm) specimens with a 2 mm-long 45° V-notch. The V-type impact test was carried out with a square having dimensions of 14 × 14 mm processing. The notched direction was perpendicular to the square bar. Testing was performed at temperatures ranging from −192 °C to 100 °C, on an NI-500 impact testing machine with a maximum capacity of 500 J.</p>

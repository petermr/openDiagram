0: Influenza virus induces caspase-dependent apoptosis by activating caspase-3 [ 7].
1: Apoptosis is divided into the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.
2: The intrinsic apoptotic pathway engages caspases via members of the BCL-2 protein family and mitochondria in response to severe cellular damage or stress [ 8].
3: Mitochondria also play a leading role in the release of many important apoptosis-inducing molecules due to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) [ 9].
4: According to a whole-cell proteomic study of A549 cells infected with avian influenza virus H7N9 and influenza virus H1N1, some differentially expressed proteins are localized to mitochondria [ 10].
5: Influenza virus is a high-risk virus that poses a great threat to human health and the economy.
6: According to their virulence level, IAVs are divided into LPAI and HPAI viruses.
7: Most avian influenza viruses are LPAI viruses, which can produce subclinical infections in poultry or occasionally cause mild respiratory diseases, reduced egg production and low mortality rates [ 11].
8: HA subtype H5 and H7 LPAI viruses can mutate into HPAI variants.
9: It is represented by H5N1 and H7N7, leading to severe progressive disease and high bird mortality [ 12].
10: HPAI viruses can seriously affect animal health and have an economic impact on the commercial poultry industry.
11: In addition, some strains can be transmitted to humans [ 13].

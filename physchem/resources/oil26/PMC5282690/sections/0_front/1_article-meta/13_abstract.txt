0: BackgroundArtemisia campestris L. (Asteraceae) is a medicinal herb traditionally used to treat hypertension and many other diseases.
1: Hence, this study is aimed to analyze the essential oil of    A. campestris L (AcEO) and to investigate the antiplatelet, antioxidant effects and the mechanisms of its vasorelaxant effect.
2: MethodsThe chemical composition of AcEO was elucidated using GC/MS analysis.
3: Then, the antioxidant effect was tested on DPPH radical scavenging and on the prevention of -carotene bleaching.
4: The antiplatelet effect was performed on the presence of the platelet agonists: thrombin and ADP.
5: The mechanism of action of the vasorelaxant effect was studied by using the cellular blockers specified to explore the involvement of NO/GC pathway and in the presence of calcium channels blockers and potassium channels blockers.ResultsAcEO is predominated by the volatiles: spathulenol, -eudesmol and p-cymene.
6: The maximal antioxidant effect was obtained with the dose 2 mg/ml of AcEO.
7: The dose 1 mg/ml of AcEO showed a maximum antiplatelet effect of, respectively 49.73% 9.54 and 48.20% 8.49 on thrombin and ADP.
8: The vasorelaxation seems not to be mediated via NOS/GC pathway neither via the potassium channels.
9: However, pretreatment with calcium channels blockers attenuated this effect, suggesting that the vasorelaxation is mediated via inhibition of L-type Ca   2+ channels and the activation of SERCA pumps of reticulum plasma.
10: ConclusionThis study confirms the antioxidant, antiplatelet and vasorelaxant effects of    A.campestris L essential oil.
11: However, the antihypertensive use of this oil should be further confirmed by the chemical fractionation and subsequent bio-guided assays.

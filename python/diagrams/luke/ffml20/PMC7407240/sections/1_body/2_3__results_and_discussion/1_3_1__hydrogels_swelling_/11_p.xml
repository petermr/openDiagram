<p>The data from 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-01544-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> implies that in the case of all hydrogels and respectively, all of the swelling media, the water diffusion is non-Fickian (0.5 &lt;

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2-polymers-12-01544">Section 3.2</xref>), proving of higher benefit for sustained, controlled delivery devices. Additionally, the interactions between the poly (vinyl alcohol) and ι-carrageenan are responsible for the decrease in the water uptake rates (κ) registered for the relaxation swelling step. The water diffusion coefficients increase with the addition of ι-carrageenan, with up to 17% for the PC12, in comparison with PVA. The water diffusion coefficients decrease exponentially with the increase of pH, due to intense molecular reorientation occurring at pH values of three and four.

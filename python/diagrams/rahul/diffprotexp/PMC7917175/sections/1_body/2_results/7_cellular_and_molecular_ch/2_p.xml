<p>To demonstrate the reliability of this immunotyping, we next explored the correlation between the five immune subtypes and previously reported six pan-cancer immune subtypes (C1-C6), of which PAAD was mostly clustered into C1, C2, C3 and C6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e, IS1 and IS3 mainly overlapped with C3, IS2 with C2 and C3, IS4 with C1 and C2, and IS5 with C1, C2 and C6. C3 and C6 were associated with better and inferior prognoses respectively, whilst C1 and C2 indicated intermediate prognoses. These results corresponded to prolonged survival observed in patients with IS1 and IS2 tumors compared to IS4 and IS5. Interestingly, IS1 patients with better prognosis and IS3 patients with poorest survival largely overlapped with C3. These findings not only demonstrate the reliability of our immunotyping method but also augment previous classification. We also evaluated the correlation between the immune subtypes and 56 previously defined molecular signatures, and identified 22 significantly associated immune-related signatures with FDR &lt; 0.01 as the threshold. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>f, IS2 had the highest scores for lymphocyte infiltration, leukocyte fraction, Th1 cells, B cells naïve and lymphocyte signatures, but scored low for stromal fraction and TGF-β response. Thus, IS2 was associated with an overall favorable immune-activated phenotype and characterized by a highly diverse immune signature. IS1 on the hand was characterized by moderate immune infiltration and highest Th17 cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells as well as low reactive stroma and TGF-β response signatures. In contrast, the low scores of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, lymphocyte and stromal fraction and TGF-β response signatures in IS4 are indicative of an immunologically cold phenotype. IS5 scored low for CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and lymphocytes but had high scores for stromal fraction and TGF-β response, suggesting immune-cold phenotype as well as an immunosuppressive microenvironment. IS3 demonstrated intermediate immune infiltration along with elevated reactive stroma and TGF-β response, which strongly point to an immunosuppressive phenotype. Taken together, the immune subtypes mirror the cellular and molecular signatures in PAAD patients, indicating their immune status. Hence, the immune subtypes are promising biomarkers for mRNA vaccine and patients with immunologically cold” IS4 and IS5 tumors with/out the immunosuppressive microenvironment are potentially suitable candidates for mRNA vaccination.

  <p>Distribution of identified proteins differentially expressed under the different stress conditions studied. The numbers represent the number of identified proteins that significantly change in abundance in 
   <italic>S. commersonii</italic> (
   <bold>left</bold>) and 
   <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> cv. Désirée (
   <bold>right</bold>); between brackets are represented the number of proteins that are significantly increased (↑) or decreased (↓) in abundance. Classification of proteins was done based on the GO annotation from Goanna [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijms-14-04912">33</xref>].

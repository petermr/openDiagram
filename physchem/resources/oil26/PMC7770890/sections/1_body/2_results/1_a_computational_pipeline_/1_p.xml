<p>Since SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 to invade host cells, ACE2 usage is considered to be an important determinant of infectivity and host range.

 </sup> To examine the ACE2 usage by SARS-CoV-2, we developed a pipeline to model the binding energy between S-RBD and host ACE2 (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>). We hypothesized that an effective ACE2 receptor should exhibit a low binding energy (or equivalently, a high affinity) while a poor receptor should have a high binding energy. A total of 321 ACE2 orthologs were collected from NCBI, and 285 of them were analyzed in detail after discarding 36 defective sequences (see

 </sup> to generate structure ensembles for binding energy calculation (see 
 <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>). The ACE2 that achieved a binding energy below a given cutoff was suggested to be an effective receptor for SARS-CoV-2. During structure modeling and binding energy calculation, the N-glycosylation on ACE2 and S-RBD was ignored because current methods are not well adapted for modeling glycosylated amino acids.

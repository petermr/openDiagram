0: Fecal hormone metabolites were extracted and analyzed using methods reported in Allard et al.
1: [ 22].
2: Briefly, samples were lyophilized and sifted, and then, 0.2  0.01 g fecal powder was extracted in 2.0 mL, 90% ethanol by shaking, centrifuging, and evaporating the supernatant under forced air at 35 C. Samples were reconstituted in assay buffer, and FGM concentrations were measured using a commercial assay kit for corticosterone (#K014-H1, Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor MI) that was previously validated chemically and biologically for these aardvarks at the Detroit Zoo [ 22].
3: All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and samples with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 15% were reanalyzed.
4: The average intra-assay CV was 1.76%.
5: Internal controls were analyzed on each plate, and the average inter-assay CV was 2.82%.
6: Based on the previous validation results [ 22], dates for FGM concentrations were adjusted backward by 24 h to account for lag time to hormone excretion when making comparisons to behavioral data.

0: Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is one of the water channels expressed by renal collecting duct principal cells and plays an essential role in maintaining body water homeostasis [ 12].
1: Deficiency of AQPs is observed in many renal diseases, including AKI, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, renal cell carcinoma, and renal fibrosis [ 13].
2: Urinary exosomal release of AQP2 was reduced in ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI [ 14].
3: AQP2 accumulation at the apical plasma membranes of the renal-collecting ducts was decreased in cisplatin-induced AKI [ 15].
4: Renal injury can be partially alleviated by restoring the renal expression of AQP2.
5: For instance, NF-B inhibition ameliorated sepsis-induced acute renal failure by promoting AQP2  via vasopressin V 2 receptor [ 16].
6: Moreover, pretreatment with continuous erythropoietin receptor activator restored tubular function and AQP2 expression in septic AKI [ 17].

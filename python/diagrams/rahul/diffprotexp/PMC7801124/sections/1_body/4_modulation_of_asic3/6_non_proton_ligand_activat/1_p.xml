<p>As its name indicates, the primary activator of ASIC3 is protons, but both endogenous and exogenous compounds have been identified that can modulate ASIC3 independently of protons. The first of these to be identified was 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7a</xref>), a small, nitrogen-rich compound, which activates homomeric rASIC3 at 100 µM at neutral pH 7.4 by binding to the non-proton ligand sensing domain encompassing Glu79 and Glu423 [
 <xref rid="cit0191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. GMQ has an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 680 µM (in rASIC3 at pH 7.4), compounds with related structures guanabenz and sephin1 having an EC
 <sub>50</sub> for activation at neutral pH of 67.5 µM and 1220 µM, respectively; in addition, GMQ and guanabenz enhanced transient and sustained phases of acid-activation of ASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. Another guanidine-based compound is 4-chlorophenylguanidine (4-CPG, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7b</xref>), which has been shown to increase the ASIC3 half-maximal pH activation from 6.79 to 7.12; but only at a very high concentration of 1 mM [
 <xref rid="cit0193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Lastly, a structure similar to GMQ, is chloroquine (CQ, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7c</xref>), which has also been shown to increase only the sustained rASIC3 currents at pH 7 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 435.2 µM), an effect largely abolished if Glu79 is mutated and completely abolished if Glu423 is mutated; excitingly, CQ-induced itching behavior in mice was ablated by the ASIC3 blocker APETx2 [

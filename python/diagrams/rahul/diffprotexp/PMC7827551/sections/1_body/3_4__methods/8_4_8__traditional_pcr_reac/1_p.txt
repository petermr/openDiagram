0: The 12 genes responsible for the production of the 12 differential proteins identified between the two phases were detected by PCR.
1: The amplified products were analyzed in a 2.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized in UV light.
2: PCR amplicon of each band was determined by comparison to the corresponding band in the low molecular weight ladder.
3: Primers for 12 genes were outlined using the publicly available Primer3 software, as shown in  Supplementary Table S1.

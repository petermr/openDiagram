 <caption> Differential expression and enrichment analyses. a Heatmaps depicting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hypothalamus (HYPO) and nucleus taenia of the amygdala (TnA). Each column is an individual and each row is a gene. Color indicates normalized counts scaled across rows (red, higher expression; blue, lower expression). Clustered with a correlation distance measure. b Gene Ontology analysis showing the top 2 most significant biological processes among the up- (red) and down-regulated (blue) DEGs in the HYPO, along with aggression-related processes. c GOChord plot of DEGs in aggression-related processes. Genes are linked to assigned processes via colored ribbons and ordered according to log 2 fold change (logFC), which is displayed next to genes. Descriptions of gene symbols can be found in Supplementary Table S1, Additional file 1 </caption>

<p>From an initial screening of the ternary systems, only mixtures of [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl with acetic acid were found to form biphasic systems, with all others remaining monophasic under the explored conditions. The screening results hint at three prerequisites for the formation of mixtures presenting variable hydrophilicity. Firstly, of the quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts tested [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl is the only one capable of self-assembly into distinct phases in aqueous solution [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Secondly, a comparison with [C
 <sub>14</sub>mim]Cl, which did not form any biphasic systems with the tested acids, indicates that IL self-assembly alone is not sufficient. Thirdly, acetic acid possesses a distinct apolar end section and a low deprotonation constant. The possible interactions between CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl yielding to a biphasic system formation are discussed further in the next sections. There are some structural similarities between the investigated [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and the previously-reported [N
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl + decanoic acid [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], with the long alkyl chain switched from the organic acid to the IL component. However, contrary to the poorly water-soluble decanoic acid, both [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl and acetic acid are water-miscible.

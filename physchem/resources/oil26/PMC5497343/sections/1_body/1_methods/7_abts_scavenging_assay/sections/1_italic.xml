<italic>v</italic>/v) ratio of potassium persulfate (2.45&#160;mM) and ABTS (7.0&#160;mM), incubated in a dark cupboard for 720&#160;min at ambient temperature. One microliter of ABTS+ solution was diluted by adding methanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.708&#160;&#177;&#160;0.002 unites when measured at 734&#160;nm with spectrophotometer. Briefly, 100&#160;&#956;L of the essential oil or standards prepared in methanol of various concentration ranging from 0.03&#8211;0.5&#160;mg/mL was added into all the wells of microtiter plate starting from (C-H) in triplicates except for A (A1-A12) and B (B1-B12). Thereafter, 100&#160;&#956;L of ABTS+ solution was then added to all the wells starting from C-H and the solution was incubated for 7&#160;min and absorbance was taken at 734&#160;nm using spectrophotometer. The percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula stated above.

0: Next, immunocytochemical staining was used to analyze the Pir toxin proteins ability to enter primary shrimp hemocytes using a previously described method with minor modifications [ 21].
1: Briefly, hemolymph was withdrawn from 10 randomly selected shrimp with a sterile needle and syringe into an equal volume of precooled anti-coagulant buffer (27 mM C 6H 5O 7Na 3  2 H 2O, 33 mM C 6H 8O 7, 110 mM C 6H 12O 6, 140 mM NaCl, pH 6.0).
2: Samples were centrifuged immediately at 500 g for 10 min at 4C to harvest the hemocytes, which were then resuspended in Insect-XPRESSTM (LONZA, Basel, Switzerland) media [ 22].
3: Next, 2  10 6 hemocytes were seeded onto glass-bottom plates, incubated at 28C for 2 h, before being treated with 0.1 M His-rPirA or His-rPirB at 28C for 2 h. Following this, cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min.
4: Cells were washed three times with 0.01 M PBS (137 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na 2HPO 4, 2 mM NaH 2PO 4, pH 7.4), followed by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.01 M PBS at room temperature for 20 min.
5: Samples were then washed and incubated with 5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) for 30 min, and then with mouse anti-His antibody (TransGen BioTech, Beijing, China, 1:100) overnight at 4C.
6: After being washed, samples were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor 488 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China, 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.
7: Samples were washed three times, stained with Hochest 33,342 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 10 min at room temperature protected from light, followed by washing six times, before being examined under a Confocal Microscope LSM800 (Carl ZEISS, Heidenheim, Germany).

<p id="Par70">In the final stage of MN maturation (D18-D28), we observed upregulation of gene groups activating Ca

 </sup> signaling through the cAMP-dependent pathway: 
 <italic>HTR7</italic> and 
 <italic>ADCY2</italic>. We also detected upregulated expression of the intracellular Ca
 <sup>
  <italic>2+</italic>
 </sup> ryanodine receptor 2 (
 <italic>RYR2</italic>), signifying cell readiness to release Ca
 <sup>
  <italic>2+</italic>
 </sup> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to adrenergic (sympathetic) stimulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). This finding was consistent with the upregulation of 
 <italic>ADRA1A</italic>, which encodes the adrenergic receptor alpha subunit 1α. Furthermore, gene activation of both ionotropic (
 <italic>GRIN1</italic> and 
 <italic>GRIN2D</italic>) and metabotropic (
 <italic>GRM1</italic>) glutamate receptors, together with the upregulation of neuromedin-K receptor (
 <italic>TACR3</italic>), accentuated the role of the IP3-Ca
 <sup>
  <italic>2+</italic>
 </sup> second messenger system to activate ERK1/2 as well as classical PKC signaling pathways [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We also detected higher levels of 
 <italic>PRKCB</italic> gene transcripts in MNs compared to eMNs (Table

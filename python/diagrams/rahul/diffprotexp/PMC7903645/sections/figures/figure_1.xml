  <p>Overall gene expression and differential expression analysis of whole blood transcriptomes. 
   <bold>a</bold> Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), denoting CI-term group, CI-preterm group, and normal controls. 
   <bold>b</bold> Volcano plot of overall gene-based differential expression results in women with cervical insufficiency vs controls. The x-axis corresponds to the log of the fold change difference between groups and the y-axis corresponds to the negative log of the adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> values. There were 30 differentially expressed genes (red dots) when using adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> value &lt;â€‰0.05. CI, cervical insufficiency

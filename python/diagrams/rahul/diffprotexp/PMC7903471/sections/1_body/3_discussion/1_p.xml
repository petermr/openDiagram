<p>lncRNAs do not encode proteins, but function at the RNA level, regulating gene expression and epigenetic modifications (

 <xref rid="b33-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, the potential targets and functions of lncRNAs associated with skeletal development and osteoarthritis are not fully understood. The present study systematically screened the lncRNA expression profiles of cartilage from normal control patients and patients with knee osteoarthritis to identify novel lncRNA targets involved in the mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis. The new lncRNA targets might aid in identifying the role of lncRNAs in the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

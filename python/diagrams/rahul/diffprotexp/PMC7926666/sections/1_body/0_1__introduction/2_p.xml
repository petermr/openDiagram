<p>Biomarkers play an important role in the implementation of personalized medicine in clinics with respect to defining subtype phenotypes, predicting clinical course and prognosis, and determining the appropriate therapeutic approach. In this respect, a comprehensive pool of molecular markers from different biological levels (hub proteins, receptors, miRNAs, mRNAs, reporter TFs, and metabolites) were presented from a systematic integrative biology perspective with the potential to provide in-depth knowledge into the disease mechanisms in RCC subtypes [

On the other hand, the limited diagnostic and prognostic performance of a molecular biomarker revealed the need for system biomarkers to be obtained with approaches that consider interactions between critical molecules such as the differential protein interactome [

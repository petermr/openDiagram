 <caption> Correlation of CCR8 expression with immune cell fraction in tumor tissues in TCGA-HNSC. (A) Patients were divided into high- and low-expression groups based on the median value of CCR8 gene expression. There were significant differences in the fraction of some immune cells in the tumor tissue ( P&lt;0.05). (B) Correlation analysis of CCR8 and immune cell content was used to validate the above differential analysis results. (C) Wayne plots showed that the expression of CCR4, CCR8, and P2RY14 was associated with the fraction of several immune cells, respectively. </caption>

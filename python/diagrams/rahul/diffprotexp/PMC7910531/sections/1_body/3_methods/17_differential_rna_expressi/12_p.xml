<p id="Par71">In each analysis design and method, we used a 5% FDR threshold to correct for multiple testing. As the final step, we applied a conservative approach and considered a gene ‘significantly differentially expressed' between low-grade and high-grade cartilage if it showed significant differential expression across all analysis designs and testing methods (2557 genes, including 2418 with uniquely corresponding Ensembl gene ID and gene name). As discussed in the Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, for each analysis design, the number of significant genes at 5% FDR was similar across all tests.

<p>miRNAs are small endogenous non-coding RNA molecules about 22 nucleotides in length that can inhibit the expression of encoded genes and lead to the renewal, conversion, or degradation of mRNA transcription by combining with complementary sequences in the 3’UTR of the target gene through miRNA reaction elements (MREs) (

In STK11 mutant lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H838), the miR124-3p-STAT3-PRKAA/AMPKa axis had been reported, which could regulate circHIPK3-induced cell autophagy (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Xiuyuan et al., 2020</xref>). In our present study, both bioinformatics analysis and qPCR results showed that PRKAA2 is significantly upregulated and its target miRNA miR-124-3p is downregulated in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M. Luciferase reporter analysis revealed the binding of miR-124-3p with PRKAA2. When the miR-124-3p of endothelial cells were knocked down by shRNA, a significant increase of PRKAA2 level was detected in HUVECs. This indicated that the expression of PRKAA2 is regulated by miR-124-3p. These results also suggest that miR-124-3p and PRKAA2 may play an important role in tumor–endothelial interaction.

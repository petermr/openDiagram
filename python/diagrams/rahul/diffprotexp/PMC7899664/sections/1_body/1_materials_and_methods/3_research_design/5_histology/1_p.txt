0: Skin tissue after different treatments were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and paraffin embedded.
1: 5 m thick sections were cut and mounted onto slides.
2: Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated to TBS following standard protocol.
3: Sections were blocked in TBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) + 1% BSA, followed by staining with biotinylated HABP with 0.4 l of (0.5 g/l stock) (EMD Millipore, 385911) HABP/100 l + 1% BSA in PBS applied overnight.
4: Slides were then developed with Streptavidin and DAB with Hematoxylin counterstaining and covered using Aquatex.
5: Parallel sections that went through the whole procedure, with the only exception of HABP application, served as no staining controls, while sections that were pretreated for an hour with 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Worthington Biochem, LS002594) at 37 C served as negative controls to demonstrate the specificity of the staining.

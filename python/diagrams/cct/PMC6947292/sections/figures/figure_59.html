 <caption> Results for 7150, showing ( A) the total enthalpy change at a cooling rate of 3 K/s measured by DFSC and DSC; ( B) the DSC curve at a cooling rate of 3 K/s, shown for comparison. The vertical red dashed lines indicate the precipitation start and end temperatures. ( C) Total enthalpy change at different interruption temperatures and different cooling rates. The enlarged dots indicate the transition temperatures for the various precipitation reactions [ 129]. </caption>

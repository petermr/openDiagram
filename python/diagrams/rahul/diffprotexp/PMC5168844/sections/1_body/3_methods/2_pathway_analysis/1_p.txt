0: From several studies, it has been found that approximately there are 140 genes that are responsible for selective growth advantage.
1: These genes are termed as driver genes.
2: As mentioned before in the  Background, mutations occur in a typical tumor due to two to eight such driver genes, while there are only twelve signaling pathways which allow selective growth advantage.
3: These twelve signaling pathways (target pathways) are:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathrm{T}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{F} - \upbeta $$\end{document}TGF-, MAPK, STAT, PI3K, RAS, Cell Cycle/Apoptosis, NOTCH, HH, APC, Chromatin modification, Transcriptional regulation and DNA damage control.
4: Among these,  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathrm{T}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{F}-\upbeta $$\end{document}TGF-, MAPK, STAT, PI3K, RAS and Cell Cycle/Apoptosis regulate cell survival; NOTCH, HH, APC, Chromatin modification and Transcriptional regulation regulate cell fate; while the DNA damage control signaling pathway regulates genome maintenance.
5: We have separately analyzed the protein profiles of the three cancer types using GO clustering tool [ 3,  4] and grouped the proteins according to their biological pathways.
6: As selective growth advantage can occur only through the target pathways, we have considered only the proteins included in the target pathways for our analysis.

<p id="Par44">To validate the significant DEGs in the RNA-Seq results, four genes (DEFA3, JUN, ELANE, and CD177) were selected and their differential expression between a separate sample-set of CI (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) and control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) groups was assessed by qRT-PCR. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Consistent with the RNA-Seq analysis, four genes displayed higher mRNA expression in the CI group than in the control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). We also validated the mRNA expression of the four genes (DEFA3, RNASE3, CRISP3, and CEACAM8) that differed between the CI-term and CI-preterm groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). These genes were significantly upregulated in the CI-term group compared to that in the CI-preterm group, and the results were consistent with those of RNA-Seq analysis.

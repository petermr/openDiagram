<p>According to a previously described method [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], MVs were separated from the conditioned medium by differential centrifugation. Briefly, cells were centrifuged at 300, 1200, 10,000, and 110,000 g for 5, 20, 30 min and 1 h (all at 4 °C). Then, MVs were collected and resuspended, then isolated total RNA of MVs for further characterization.

<p>Pseudovirus neutralization assay is an established model to study the mechanism of viral entry into host cells and has been widely used to assess the antiviral activity of viral entry/fusion inhibitors [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref>]. To test whether the antiviral effect of lactoferrins against SARS-CoV-2 is cell type dependent, BLF and HLF were tested in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay in three different types of cell lines: Vero E6 cell (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(A)</xref>), Calu-3 cell (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(B)</xref>), and 293T cell overexpressing ACE2 (293T-ACE2) (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(C)</xref>). Vero E6 and 293T-ACE2 cells express high levels of ACE2 on the apical membrane domain but minimal levels of transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), the host serine protease that cleaves viral spike protein [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As such, SARS-CoV-2 virus enters these cells through endocytosis and relies on endosomal cathepsin L for viral spike protein activation [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, Calu-3 is a human lung epithelial cell line with endogenous expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be activated at the cell surface by TMPRSS2, resulting in direct cell entry at the plasma cell membrane. Previously reported cathepsin L inhibitor E-64d and TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat mesylate were included as controls for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry assays. It was found that both BLF and HLF inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry in a dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 26.2 to 49.7 µg/ml and 34.4–163.5 µg/ml, respectively (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). BLF was more potent than HLF, which agrees with the antiviral assay results from the infectious HCoVs (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These results indicate that the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry by lactoferrins is cell type independent.

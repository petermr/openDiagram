   <bold>Validation of differentially expressed perfusate proteins in plasma.</bold> Beta-2-microglobulin (B2-M), Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF 21) and 14-3-3 protein α/β (Ywhab) were chosen for validation by Western blotting. The plasma was collected at three time-points from each model rat: on days 0, 6 and 12 (before the surgical inoculation and on the sixth and twelfth day after inoculation, respectively). Equal volumes of plasma were loaded into a gel and analyzed by Western blotting. The change direction in the relative abundance of 14-3-3 protein α/β in the perfusates was the same as in the plasma, whereas the change direction in the relative abundance of the B2-M and FGF 21 proteins was opposite to that in the plasma.

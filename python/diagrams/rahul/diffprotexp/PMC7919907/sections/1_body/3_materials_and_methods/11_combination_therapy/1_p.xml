<p>BLF was mixed with remdesivir at combination ratios of 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, separately. The mixture of each compound with remdesivir at each combination ratio was serially diluted into 7 different concentrations and applied in HCoV-OC43 CPE assay to determine EC
 <sub>50</sub> of BLF and remdesivir in the combination ratio. CIs plot was used to depict the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of each compound and remdesivir at different combination ratios. The red line indicates the additive effect, and above the red line indicates the antagonism, while below the red line indicates the synergy [

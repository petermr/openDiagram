<p>Our previous characterization of mixed 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrated that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> exhibits high affinity to the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphal form as these species co-adhere and interact synergistically, forming a dense and architecturally complex biofilm [

 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, using a mouse model of oral co-infection, we demonstrated that onset of oral candidiasis may lead to systemic staphylococcal infection, stemming from a thick matrix of mixed biofilm formed on tongue tissue [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our subsequent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies into the therapeutic implication of 
 <italic>C. albicans-S. aureus</italic> interactions in biofilm demonstrated that 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> secreted matrix polysaccharides, primarily Î²-1,3-glucan, confers 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with enhanced tolerance to antimicrobials by impeding drug penetration through the biofilm [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, findings from the study also indicated that other factors may also contribute to the enhanced 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> tolerance to antimicrobials, which we subsequently identified to be farnesol, a quorum-sensing molecule secreted by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Specifically, we demonstrated that farnesol indirectly confers 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> tolerance to vancomycin by elicitng a stress response 
 <italic>via</italic> activation of the thiol-based redox system.

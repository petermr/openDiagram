<p>To investigate the performance of DEqMS in a larger data set based on multiple TMT experiments, we used a data set where 18 different breast cancer cell lines were analyzed in triplicates (D5,

In total six TMT-10plex experiments were performed to analyze the 54 samples as detailed in Materials and Methods. Importantly, replicate samples from each cell line were placed in three different TMT experiments to avoid confounding biological effects with batch effects. As more than one TMT-experiment was performed we first investigated what PSM metric to use for each protein when performing the DEqMS analysis; minimum, mean, median, sum or maximum number of PSMs/protein for quantificaiton across TMT-experiments. In all cases, the variance showed a dependence on the number of PSMs (

To identify the metric generating the best fit for prior variance we calculated the residual sum of squares (RSS) as a measure of the deviation between the predicted and the actual variance. This analysis showed that the best fit (smallest RSS) was produced when the minimum number of PSMs across experiments was used (

 <italic>i.e.</italic> the one relying on the lowest number of PSMs, when performing DEqMS analysis in data sets consisting of multiple TMT experiments. As a comparison, RSS for Limma was also plotted, clearly indicating the bias in the estimated prior variance (

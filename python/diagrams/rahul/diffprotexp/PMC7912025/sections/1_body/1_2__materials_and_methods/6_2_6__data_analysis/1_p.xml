<p>Identification, polishing, and annotation of the transcriptome from SMRT sequencing was performed using the PacBio Iso-Seqâ„¢ bioinformatics pipeline [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Polished, annotated genes were analyzed by SQANTI [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. TappAS was used to identify functional annotations [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

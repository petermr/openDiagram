<p>We proceeded by focusing on genes with low isoform diversity, suggesting a single dominant PAS. We calculated a dominance metric for each gene as the difference in mean usage between the first and second most used PAS (we used different cutoffs to classify dominance; see 'Materials and methods'). We found that the classification dominant PAS is highly consistent across species, a result that is quite robust with respect to the approach used to classify PAS as dominant (

While the dominant PAS is the same for most genes in humans and chimpanzees, differences in the usage of a dominant PAS are likely to contribute more to differential APA that have functional consequences between species than differences in other PAS. Indeed, regardless of the specific cutoff we used to define dominant PAS, when the dominant PAS is not the same in humans and chimpanzees, the corresponding genes are more likely to be differentially expressed between the species compared with genes where the dominant PAS is the same in both species, (for cutoffs between 0.2 and 0.7, all [p&lt;0.005]), and even compared with genes in which only a non-dominant PAS is differentially used (p&gt;0.8 for all cutoffs;

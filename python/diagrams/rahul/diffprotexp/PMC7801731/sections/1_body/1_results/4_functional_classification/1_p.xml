<p id="Par15">GO terms obtained from DEGs with a p-value less than 0.05 and considerable relation between the number of genes associated with the term (Gene Ratio) are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Most terms obtained from upregulated genes at both day 1 and 3, correlate with processes involved in transcription of DNA information into RNA, as well as the translation of mRNA into proteins. Enriched terms of biological process (BP) include various protein transport mechanisms; cellular component (CC) terms are characterized for processes involving translation activity; molecular function (MF) terms comprise protein transport, translation, and RNA binding. Downregulated terms showed a wider variety of associations. In general, terms associated with signaling systems, cell adhesion, metabolic processes and the immune system were found. Similar terms were shown for CC, being the membrane components an enriched factor for downregulated genes. MF terms associated with downregulated genes in both days represented mostly cell signaling processes (see supplementary Tables

 <italic>ob</italic> mice, PEP was the only decreased DEM (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Although there were no significant changes in other metabolites in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, metabolites in the upstream of this pathway, such as G6P [FC (
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic>/WT) = 0.66, q value = 0.13], F6P [FC (
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic>/WT) = 0.53, q value = 0.12], and F1,6P [FC (
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic>/WT) = 0.79, q value = 0.14], slightly decreased in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, unlike in liver. Gapdh, Pgk1, and Pgam2 (phosphoglycerate mutase 2) were identified as decreased DEMEs in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>B), and the gene expression of 
 <italic>Pgk1</italic> and 
 <italic>Gapdh</italic> was regulated at the transcript level by the decreased DRTFs such as 
 <italic>Rxra</italic>, 
 <italic>Trp53</italic>, and 
 <italic>Xbp1</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Fbp2 was the only increased DEME in this pathway in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. The increase of Fbp2 in skeletal muscle may be involved in glycogenesis but not in gluconeogenesis because G6P is not converted to glucose because of lack of G6Pase expression (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gamberucci et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Schaftingen and Gerin, 2002</xref>), unlike in liver. The expression of Gapdh and Pgk1 increased in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, but decreased in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B), suggesting the possibility that the glycolysis pathway is potentially inhibited by decreased expression of some metabolic enzymes in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. Furthermore, succinate and PEP contributed inhibiting allosteric regulations in liver but activating regulations in skeletal muscle.

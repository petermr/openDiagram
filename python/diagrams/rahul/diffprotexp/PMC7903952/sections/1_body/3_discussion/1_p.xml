<p>LncRNAs are RNAs which include more than 200 nucleotides and lncRNAs lack open reading frames.
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In recent years lncRNAs have been reported participated in the development of tumors

 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The pathogenesis of glioma is complex, the prognosis is poor, the mortality is high, and the effect of operation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is poor for glioma. Although the pathogenesis of glioma is still unclear, more and more evidence shows that many lncRNAs and miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of glioma.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For our study, we proved that LINC00466 was highly expressed. LINC00466 could improve the activity of glioma cells. In addition, overexpression of LINC00466 could contribute to knockdown of miR-137 and regulate downstream gene PPP1R14B expression through sponging miR-137. We also proved that miR-137 could inhibit the progression of tumor by decreasing the expression of PPP1R14B. The results of nude mice study also proved that the tumor growth could be promoted when the expression of LINC00466 was elevated. Thus, the LINC00466/miR-137/PPP1R14B axis could increase the activity of glioma cells and sensitivity of glioma cell to TMZ, which implied these genes could be regarded as biomarkers and therapeutic target in the treatments of glioma.

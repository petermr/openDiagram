<p id="Par29">A previous study demonstrated that FTO promoted autophagy by m6A methylation of ATG5 and ATG7 at the mRNA level. CircRAB11FIP bound to the mRNA of FTO and promoted its expression. Ectopically expressed circRAB11FIP1 elevated the mRNA expression of ATG5 and ATG7, while silencing circRAB11FIP1 reduced the mRNA expression of ATG5 and ATG7. This regulation depended on FTO (Fig.

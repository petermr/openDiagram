<p>As a complementary approach, we adapted the BioID system [
 <xref rid="B27-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] by fusing FLp53 or p53β coding sequences with BirA, a bacterial promiscuous biotin ligase. BirA–FLp53 and BirA–p53β fusion proteins expressed in cells biotinylate proximate and interacting proteins in the presence of ATP and biotin, allowing for identification and quantification by MS. While the TRAP system or other co-IP approaches can be effective at identifying strongly interactive proteins, the BioID system serves as a complementary approach in that it can identify more transiently bound cofactors. Preliminary identification of the FLp53 and p53β interactomes identified 180 proteins that demonstrate greater binding to p53β than to FLp53. Confirming results from the GFP-TRAP system, the BioID system also showed that SMG5 and SMG7 preferentially bind to FLp53 relative to p53β (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-00251-f004">Figure 4</xref>). It is noted that the NMD regulator, SMG7, was recently shown to regulate p53β levels via modulation of nonsense-mediated RNA decay (27). Among the 180 potential interactors, CARF and RBM25 were validated as preferential p53β interactors. Thus, replacing the oligomerization domain of FLp53 with the short 10-amino-acid tail in p53β does alter the binding spectrum of the protein and may impart “new” functional properties (gain-of-function) to p53β. Interestingly, the pathway analysis to date on these differential binding partners suggests that p53β protein binds more than FLp53 to proteins functioning in RNA processing, especially spliceosome components.

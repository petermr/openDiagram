The essential oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the essential oil yields were calculated on the basis of the dry weight of plant material. The moisture contents of the samples were calculated after phase separation using a Dean&#8211;Stark trap (5 g, 60 min) using toluene as the solvent phase.</p>

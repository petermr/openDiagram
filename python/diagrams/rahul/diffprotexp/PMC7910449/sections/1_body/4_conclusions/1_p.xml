<p id="Par35">This study reported that circRAB11FIP1 expression increased in EOC. CircRAB11FIP1 promoted the autophagy and malignant behavior of EOC. CircRAB11FIP1 can serve as the possible marker for EOC diagnosis and treatment. CircRAB11FIP1 regulated the mechanism of autophagy through m6A modification and direct binding to mRNA (Fig.

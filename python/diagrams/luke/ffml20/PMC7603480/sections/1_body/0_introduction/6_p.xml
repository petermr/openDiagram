<p id="Par8">Specifically, we introduce a new DFT database of closed- and open-shell molecules that covers an extensive network of chemical reactions. We then develop ML models to predict atomization and REs. Finally, the models are used to explore the reaction network of methane combustion and identify the most relevant reaction steps and fragments out of a large initial database.</p>

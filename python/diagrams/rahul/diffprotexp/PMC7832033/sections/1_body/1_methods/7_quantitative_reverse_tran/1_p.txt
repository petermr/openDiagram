0: Two-step RT-qPCR was used to quantitatively validate gene expression.
1: Total RNA from whole blood was converted into cDNA using the iScript TM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad).
2: The amplification was performed in duplicate in a total volume of 10 l containing 5 l of iTaq Universal SYBR Green (Bio-Rad), 2 l of 4 ng cDNA, 0.4 l of 10 mM forward primer, 0.4 l of 10 mM reverse primer, 2.2 l of distilled water.
3: The cycle conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 95C for 30s followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 10s and 60C for 30s.
4: After amplification, melting curve analysis was carried out from 65C to 95C.
5: Primers were designed using NCBI PrimerBlast ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/).
6: All primer pairs are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
7: Peptidylprolyl isomerase A ( PPIA), Human large ribosomal protein P0 ( RPLP0), and Tata-box binding protein ( TBP) were used as reference genes for calculating the relative expression levels of other genes [ 16] The expression levels were calculated by using the 2 Ct method, where Ct = mean Ct of target gene  mean Ct of the three reference genes.

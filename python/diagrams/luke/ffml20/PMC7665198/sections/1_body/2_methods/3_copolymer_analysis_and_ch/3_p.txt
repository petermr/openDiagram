0: Tensile analysis was conducted using Instron Model 5500 R 1125.
1: Stressstrain curves were obtained for undamaged and air-cut/air-healed (3 h) and air-cut/water-healed (3 h) copolymers.
2: The gauge length and the strain rate were set to 1.0 cm and 40 mm/min, respectively.
3: The average thickness of the films was 0.5 mm.
4: To determine the self-repairing capability of p(MMA/nBA) copolymers, 3  1  0.025-cm films were damaged in air using a stainless-steel razorblade to obtain cuts with a width of 20 m and a depth of 50 m. These films were allowed to heal under ambient and aqueous conditions at 25 C for up to 150 min.
5: Tensile stressstrain properties of the damagedhealed films were recorded at 30-min intervals.

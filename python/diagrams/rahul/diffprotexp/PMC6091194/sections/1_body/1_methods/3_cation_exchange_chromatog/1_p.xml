<p id="Par40">Peptides were separated off-line on a 200 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm SCX column (Polysulfoethyl A, The Nest Group) using a gradient of 2–40% B over 50 min with a flow rate of 250 μL/min. Solvent A was 5 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.0 in 25% acetonitrile and 75% ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. Solvent B was 500 mM ammonium formate, pH 6.0 in 25% acetonitrile and 75% ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. The separation was monitored at 280 nm followed by collecting fractions every 4 min. Fractions were dried using a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 15 μL of 0.1% FA for MS analysis.

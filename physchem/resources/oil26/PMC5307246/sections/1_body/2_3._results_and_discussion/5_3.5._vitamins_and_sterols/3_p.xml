More than 40 phytosterols were identified; from them <italic>&#946;</italic>-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol account for more than 95% of total phytosterols dietary intake [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. They are of interest due to their antioxidant activity and beneficial impact on human health [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The sterol content of<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>. The total sterol content was 929.50&#8201;mg/kg of oil. <italic>&#946;</italic>-Sitosterol was the major form (93%), followed by campesterol (7%). The presence of high <italic>&#946;</italic>-sitosterol was found to limit TG polymer formation in triolein, refined canola, high oleic sunflower, and flaxseed oils heated at frying temperature [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This suggests that<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil could be used as frying oil.</p>

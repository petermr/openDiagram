0: In the present study, we aim to characterize the differential expression proteins involved in the development of  E. granulosus.
1: We provide the iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of proteins present in the three consecutive stages of  E. granulosus: oncosphere, adult, and protoscolex.
2: This work provides important information on  E. granulosus developmental biology, and also contributes to new strategies and targets to combat  E. granulosus infections in humans and animals.

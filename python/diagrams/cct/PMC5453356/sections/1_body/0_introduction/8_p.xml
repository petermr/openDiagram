<p>In this work, we will transfer the knowledge of the continuous cooling work to isothermal measurements of precipitation reactions in aluminum alloys using DSC. In particular, the aim is to perform the whole heat treatment and measurement cycle in a DSC without changing the device, in order to ensure the highest sensitivity, but also to avoid reductions in the measurable time range. A procedure for a reliable evaluation of isothermal time-temperature-precipitation diagrams will be suggested.</p>

0: After pooling and sample clean-up by solid phase extraction (SPE strata-X-C, Phenomenex), the sample pool were subjected to peptide IEF-IPG (isoelectric focusing by immobilized pH gradient) in pI range 310 (350 g).
1: Freeze dried peptide samples were dissolved in 250 l rehydration solution containing 8  m urea and 1% IPG pharmalyte pH 310 and allowed to adsorb to the 24 cm linear gradient IPG strip by swelling overnight.
2: Peptides were focused on the IPG strip as described in ( 21).
3: After focusing, the peptides were passively eluted into 72 contiguous fractions with MilliQ water using an in-house constructed IPG extractor robotics (GE Healthcare Bio- Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden, prototype instrument) into a 96-well plate (V-bottom, Corning, Hickory, North Carolina product #3894), which were then dried in a SpeedVac.
4: The resulting fractions were freeze dried and kept at 20 C.

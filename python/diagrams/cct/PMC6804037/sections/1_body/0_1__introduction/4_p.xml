<p>The laser surface transformation hardening process of steel is an encouraging industrial application considering the wide employment of steel in the industries. In fact, low alloy carbon steel (AISI 4130) is a heat treatable steel, which is used in several industries (i.e., petroleum, gas, petrochemicals, food, and pharmaceuticals) [

Especially, Nd:YAG laser surface transformation hardening of AISI 4130 is used for areas that require a low width of hardness and high precision. During the LSTH process, the phases transformation of ferrite and austenite to martensitic improves the surface hardness. In particular, because of the cooling, only the austenite phase transforms into martensite.

0: In the mesic grassland and the semi-arid savannah a quadrat with a surface area of 0.25 m 2 was placed over each microsite.
1: This quadrat size was chosen to accommodate measurements at the burrow entrances, which were mostly narrow.
2: All soil measurements were taken within this quadrat.
3: In the arid scrubland, a quadrat of 0.25 m 2 was also sampled at the burrow entrance.
4: However, as entire heuweltjies were sampled for both the control and the impacted areas in the arid scrubland, the sample area here differed between burrows.
5: Although, heuweltjies with and without burrows did not differ significantly in size (ANOVA: F = 0.005, p > 0.05), covering on average 62 m 2, the difference in sample area between the burrow entrance and the other two microsites meant that differences in species richness between microsites in the arid scrubland had to be interpreted cautiously (since species richness is an area-dependent metric, and is therefore underestimated in the burrow entrances relative to the other two microsites in the arid scrubland).
6: However, the soil and other vegetation characteristics are not dependent on sample area and still provide for robust comparisons between microsites in that study site.

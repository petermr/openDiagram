<p id="p0085">Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we measured the amount of 14 lipids in liver and skeletal muscle of fasted WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice and defined lipids that significantly changed in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice as the differentially expressed lipids (DELs) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). We identified three increased DELs in the liver and no decreased DELs. In contrast, skeletal muscle had one increased DEL and ten decreased DELs. Triacylglycerol (TAG) increased in both liver and skeletal muscle of fasted 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. The skeletal-muscle-specific decreased DELs included phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidyl choline (PC) in skeletal muscle (

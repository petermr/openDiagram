<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par5">Free radicals instigate oxidative damage and when this free radical in the body system is above the capacity of antioxidant, it results in oxidative stress which is implicated in many human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Antioxidant is substance that helps to prevent oxidative damage when found in small amounts and is equivalent to an oxidizable substrate. Antioxidants aid in averting of diseases by scavenging radicals including lipid peroxyl (LP &#8226;), superoxide (O<sub>2</sub> &#8226;), nitric oxide (NO &#8226;) and hydroxyl (HO &#8226;) formed during metabolic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The need for natural antioxidants is becoming imperative due to numerous health risk associated with synthetic antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several in vitro assays such as DPPH, ABTS, lipid peroxyl and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) radicals have been used in evaluating antioxidants capacity of plants extracts which are designed based on quenching stable free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Plants used traditionally are known to produce a wide range of compounds with therapeutic properties such as antioxidant, antibacterial, gastroprotective effects amongst others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>

<p id="p0045">The high-temperature mechanical properties of high-alloy mould steel slab were performed with a thermal simulation test (Gleeble2000, DSI, USA). The diameter of sample is 0.01m and the length is 0.11m. The slab sample was heated to 1623 K, and then cooling down after 5 min holding with a rate of 3 K/s. When temperature reached to the experimental temperature (973, 998, 1023, 1048, 1073, 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198, 1223, 1248, 1273, 1323, 1373, 1423, 1473, 1523, 1573, and 1623 K) and held for 2 min, the sample was going through a tensile test with a strain rate of 1×10
 <sup>−3</sup>/s. After the sample broken down, speciments were quenched with water to ensure an original microstructure and morphology state. The contraction of cross-sectional area was measured and analyzed with time and loads. The solidification characteristic curve was also figured out with the thermal simulation test, to investigate the mechanical property of steels from low to high temperature (573–1973 K) section. The average value was acquired by at least three samples.

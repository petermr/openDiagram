<p>The Gibbs free energy (driving force for γ to α transformation) for pure steel (without Al and Mn) at 400 °C is −1610 J/mol. When 1.6% of aluminum is added, the driving force increases by 331 J/mol. Yet, the addition of 4.7 % of manganese decreases the driving force by 1160 J/mol. This means that, in the case of this steel, manganese is a dominant element influencing the driving force. A similar conclusion was reported by Farahani et al. [

 <xref rid="B12-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] presented the results where the addition of 0.5 % manganese led to longer incubation time and a lower transformation rate. This explains why no bainitic or ferritic transformations occurred during heat treatment. Even the change in temperature, which influences the driving force, did not bring any changes [

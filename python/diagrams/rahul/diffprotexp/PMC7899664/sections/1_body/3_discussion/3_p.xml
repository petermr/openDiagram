<p>Currently, pressed chow is the gold standard for experimentally administering 4-MU to animals, but the need for a period of several weeks of “loading dose” to see an effect on HA levels in the serum—much less the skin—is a significant limiting factor (Kuipers et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This long transition period needed before the appearance of its effects may be secondary to the fact that mice historically find 4-MU chow objectionable at first, even losing weight in the first days of their change in diet. Conversely, our optimized topical 4-MU formulation showed rapid and significant skin-specific effects after only one week of noninvasive application. In addition, the topical formulation delivers an almost 100-fold lower dose of 4-MU than the pressed chow (0.021 µg versus 250 mg daily, respectively). Since 4-MU’s mechanism of action is not yet fully elucidated, and accordingly its side effect profile is as yet unknown, the tissue-specificity and the lower doses administered using our topical formulation are desirable in experimental studies and for future translational applications. Furthermore, while our genetic algorithm predicts the global optimal topical formulation for HA decrease based on the extrapolation of the results of the design of experiments, it is still somewhat based upon the concentration boundary parameters we predetermined and does not suggest a formulation that lies way outside of our predetermined range of concentrations. Thus, we conclude that a topical 4-MU formulation has experimental value, with an increased effect in females as shown by our innovative drug design schema, with a further need for optimization in a sex and possibly species-dependent manner.

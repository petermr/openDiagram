<p>We predicted the potential targets of lncRNAs in trans-regulatory relationships using co-expression analysis. A total of 6121 interaction relationships were found, including 3260 positive correlations and 2861 negative correlations between 3981 lncRNA transcripts and 1958 protein-coding transcripts that corresponded to 23366 protein-coding genes in the 
 <italic>Bos taurus</italic> reference genome. The enrichment analysis showed that the co-expressed genes were enriched in 53 GO terms, including 22 terms under biological process, 11 terms under molecular function, and 20 terms under cellular component (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(c</xref>)). Significantly, correlation-immune functions, such as MAP kinase activity (GO: 0004707), interleukin-12 binding (GO: 0019972), nuclease activity (GO: 0004518), and nucleotide transmembrane transporter activity (GO: 0015215), were included in some GO terms. In addition, the co-expressed genes were enriched in 225 KEGG pathways, including NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8(c</xref>)), indicating that lncRNAs can regulate trans-target genes. Since lncRNAs may exert their functions by regulating co-expressed genes, we identified a group of co-expressed lncRNAs/genes based on the results of the top 10 signal pathways in previous pathway enrichment, and mapped their interactions (

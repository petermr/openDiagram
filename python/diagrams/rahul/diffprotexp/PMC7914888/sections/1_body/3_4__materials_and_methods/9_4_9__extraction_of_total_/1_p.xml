<p>We followed the organic phase RNA extraction as the previously described protocol [
 <xref rid="B113-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In brief, B16F1 cells were lysed in the presence of TRIzol (Invitrogen) to solubilize the melanin. The lysate was collected in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and heated for 2 min at 65 °C [

By successive centrifugations with chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (Biomedical Inc.), and 75% ethanol (Merck), the pellet dried at room temperature for 10 min and was resuspended in H2O DEPC (diethyl pirocarbonate, Sigma-Aldrich) for subsequent RT-qPCR assays and quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific); or resuspended in transport buffer following the manufacturer’s recommendations, for subsequent sequencing. To obtain enriched fractions of small RNAs ≤ 200 nt, miRVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used following the manufacturer’s recommendations.

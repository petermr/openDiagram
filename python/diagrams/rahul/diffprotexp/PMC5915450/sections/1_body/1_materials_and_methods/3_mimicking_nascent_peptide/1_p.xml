<p id="Par11">In order to mimic the real situation in which a new amino acid is added to a nascent peptide we first generated five different starting structures of the nascent peptide using the Differential Evolution program. At the start of the simulation, only the non-bonded parameters of the first nascent peptide residue was turned on. Then, once the nascent peptide had been pulled a distance of 4 Å into the tunnel, the non-bonded interactions of the next residue were turned on. The structure of the system with the newly added residue was minimized by the steepest descent algorithm and equilibrated in the NVT ensemble for 20 ps and then in the NPT ensemble for 100 ps. This procedure was repeated until the interactions of the most C-terminal residue were turned on. After this, we continued the SMD simulations. A total of 10 trajectories were performed in this manner for ErmCL and H-NS.</p>

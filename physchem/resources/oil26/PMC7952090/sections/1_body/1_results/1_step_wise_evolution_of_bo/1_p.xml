<p>Similar to previous studies of Afrotherian body size (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Puttick and Thomas, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Elliot and Mooers, 2014</xref>), we found that the body mass of the Afrotherian ancestor was inferred to be small (0.26 kg, 95% CI: 0.31–3.01 kg) and that substantial accelerations in the rate of body mass evolution occurred coincident with a 67.36× increase in body mass in the stem-lineage of Pseudoungulata (17.33 kg); a 1.45× increase in body mass in the stem-lineage of Paenungulata (25.08 kg); a 11.82× increase in body mass in the stem-lineage of Tehthytheria (296.56 kg); a 1.39× increase in body mass in the stem-lineage of Proboscidea (412.5 kg); and a 2.69× increase in body mass in the stem-lineage of Elephantimorpha (4114.39 kg), which is the last common ancestor of elephants and mastodons using the fossil record (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The ancestral Hyracoidea was inferred to be relatively small (2.86–118.18kg), and rate accelerations were coincident with independent body mass increases in large hyraxes such as 
 <italic>Titanohyrax andrewsi</italic> (429.34 kg, 67.36× increase) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). While the body mass of the ancestral Sirenian was inferred to be large (61.7–955.51 kg), a rate acceleration occurred coincident with a 10.59× increase in body mass in Stellar’s sea cow (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Rate accelerations also occurred coincident with dramatic reductions in body mass (36.6× decrease) in the stem-lineage of the dwarf elephants 
 <italic>Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus falconeri</italic> and 
 <italic>Elephas cypriotes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). These data indicate that gigantism in Afrotherians evolved step-wise, from small to medium bodies in the Pseudoungulata stem-lineage, medium to large bodies in the Tehthytherian stem-lineage and extinct hyraxes, and from large to exceptionally large bodies independently in the Proboscidean stem-lineage and Stellar’s sea cow (

<p>To identify miRNAs, 20–24 nt smRNA sequences from each sample were processed using miRDeep‐P2 (Kuang et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). A total of 445 unique miRNAs were detected in all the samples. We found a high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82–0.93 except for S5 in Himchana 1 with a correlation value of 0.71) between the biological replicates of each sample (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). To remove low‐confidence miRNAs, we retained only the miRNAs represented by an average of at least 10 rpm (reads per million) in the biological replicates of each stage. Overall, a total of 356 high‐confidence miRNAs, including 113 known and 243 novel miRNAs were identified in all the samples (Figure

 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). The total number of miRNAs identified was 288 in Himchana 1 and 266 in JGK 3 (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Majority (88%) of known miRNAs were expressed commonly in both the cultivars at different stages of seed development (Figure

 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>a). However, majority (66% in JGK 3 and 58% in Himchana 1) of novel miRNAs were cultivar‐specific, largest being at the S5 stage (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>b). Further, expression profiles of all known and novel miRNAs revealed tissue/stage‐specific expression pattern of a large number of miRNAs within each cultivar (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>).

<p>Mittleman and colleagues have used 3' RNA-seq to study change in polyadenylation site usage between humans and chimpanzees. The results I suspect will be of greatest interest are that PAS change is associated with change in both RNA and protein level gene expression. This was a very interesting study, and something I hadn't considered before. The data collected seems to be a perfect fit for their study and the general analysis approach is solid.</p>

0: To study MMP2 and MMP9 functional activity, tissue extract were three fold-concentrated (VivaSpin) and pre-mixed with 5X Loading buffer under non-reducing conditions and incubated at 37 C over 30 min.
1: Normalized protein extracts (20 L/lane) were pre-incubated at 37 C over 30 min.
2: Samples were then fractioned on 710% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1% gelatin (1 mg/mL gelatin), under non-reducing condition (frontline/130 V).
3: Gels were washed in rinse-buffer (15 min; 50 mM TrisHCl, 10 mM CaCl 2 and 2.5% Triton X-100; pH 7.2) to promote recovery of protease activity and briefly rinsed with distilled water before incubating in substrate buffer (24 h/37 C; 50 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl 2, 1% Triton-X100; pH 7.2).
4: Gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie blue R-250 in 30% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min to 2 h and then de-stained in 10% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid until clear bands were visible.
5: Internal controls and size marker were run in parallel.
6: Molecular weights of the bands were estimated through the use of prestained molecular-weight markers MMP2 and MMP9 activity was identified as clear bands (white bands over a blue background) corresponding to degraded substrate.

<p>Starting at 8–10 weeks of age, mice were maintained on a chow diet (Teklad 7019) or started on a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% kcal%, D12492, Research Diet Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). Baseline body weights were recorded, and subsequent body weights determined every 1 week or every 4 weeks of diet feeding as indicated in figures. For HFD, 3–4 food pellets were maintained on the cage floor to encourage sustained weight gain. Diet and animal welfare were monitored every 48–72 hours, paying attention to diet levels and food availability. Body weights were tracked for 12–16 weeks of diet feeding.</p>

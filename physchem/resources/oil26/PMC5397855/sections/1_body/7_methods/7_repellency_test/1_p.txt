0: Four Petri dishes (12  1.5 cm) were used as an arena, connected to a central board with plastic tubes (diameter 2 cm) at an angle of 45.
1: The other dishes were distributed around them in equidistant distances and two plates were put together symmetrically opposed.
2: Two hundred and forty individuals (120 larvae and 120 adults) of  T. molitor were released in the central board and the control group received sugarcane and chayote.
3: A total of 5 uL of the estimated LC 90 lethal concentration of garlic essential oil and toxic compounds were applied on absorbent filter paper (2  2 cm) placed in two opposite plates used as treatment and two opposite ones with 5 uL of distilled water for absorbent filter paper represented the control.
4: Four replicates per treatment and control were evaluated by the number of individuals per plate after 24 hours calculating the repellency index (IR): RI =  2  G/( L +  P), where G is the percentage of insects in the treatment and P is the percentage of insects in control.
5: Treatments were classified as neutral if the index was equal to one (1); repellent, higher than one (1), and; attractive lower than one (1).

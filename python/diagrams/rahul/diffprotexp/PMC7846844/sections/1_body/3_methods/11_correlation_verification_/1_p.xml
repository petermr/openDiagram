<p id="Par27">We used the longissimus dorsi muscle from nine 55-day-old embryos of Yorkshire pigs and performed RT-qPCR to verify the expression correlation between DELs and PTGs. For quantitative verification, in the first step, total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, CA, USA) and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prevent the degradation of RNA, before cDNA synthesis, we measured the purity and concentration of total RNA at 260 and 280 nm with a microphotometer (Thermo, NanoDrop 2000, United States). At the same time, we conduct a gel electrophoresis test to detect whether the RNA is degraded. There are usually three frequency bands, of which 28S and 18S are clear, and the brightness ratio is about 2:1, indicating that there is no degradation. Next, cDNA synthesis was performed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo, Wuhan, Cat#k1622).According to the manufacturer's instructions, qPCR for DELs and PTGs detection in Roche LightCyler 480 system (Roche, Mannheinm, Germany) was performed using SYBR Green (CWBIO, Beijing, China, CW0957). Ten pairs of RT-qPCR primers were designed using the Primer 5 program (Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). 18S rRNA is used as an endogenous control gene. The RT-qPCR data were analyzed using the 2
 <sup>−△△CT</sup> method and R scripts were used to perform related linear regression analysis.

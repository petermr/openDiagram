<p id="par0025">PTC has many histological variants arising from different thyroid cells 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The classic variant of PTC (CV-PTC)—the most common variant—shows papillary structures with branching and are covered by cells with large nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the follicular variant of PTC (FV-PTC) papillary structure is absent and it forms follicles. However, cells that form these follicles have nuclear changes that are typical for papillary carcinoma. In these cases, the absence of papillary structures may obscure the definitive diagnosis of cytological examination of FV, since the core features of PTC are faint/unclear.

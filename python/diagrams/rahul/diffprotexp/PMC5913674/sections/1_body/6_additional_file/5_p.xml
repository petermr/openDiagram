<p>Supplementary Figure S2: Protein-RNA log
 <sup>2</sup> fold change correlations plots by genotype for all proteins quantified by TMT label ratios. Fold change was derived from ratios of MtzR replicated over their MtzS line, and then log
 <sup>2</sup> transformed. The corresponding RNA log
 <sup>2</sup> fold change was derived from transcript expression data from Ansell 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Correlation between protein and RNA abundance fold changes were calculated at r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.154 for WB, r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.105 for WB and r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.187 for WB (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) for genes identified in both datasets.

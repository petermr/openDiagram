<p>Detection of galactomannan in BAL samples has been described as a sensitive test for diagnosing of IPA [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], therefore the association between sTREM1 levels in BAL and galactomannan was analyzed. We categorized the patients into subgroups according to the galactomannan index (GMI): GMI &lt;0.5 (identifying controls), and high GMI ≥3.0 (associated with a diagnosis with 100% specificity) [
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We found that patients with higher levels of galactomannan (GMI ≥3.0) also displayed significantly elevated concentrations of sTREM1 compared to GMI-negative controls (GMI &lt;0.5) which increased the statistical significance to p &lt; 0.001 (p = 0.0006). Likewise, the statistical significance of AUCROC was also increased (AUCROC = 0.7545; 95% CI, 0.655–0.854; P &lt; 0.0001) (

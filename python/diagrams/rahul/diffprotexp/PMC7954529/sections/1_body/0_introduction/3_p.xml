<p>To gain insight into APA conservation in humans and chimpanzees and understand how differences in APA contribute to gene regulation, we performed 3' sequencing (3' Seq) of mRNA isolated from nuclei collected from human and chimpanzee lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We integrated PAS usage measurements with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data collected from the same cell lines to understand the relationship between APA and gene expression levels. Finally, we used ribosome profiling and protein measurements previously collected in the same panel of human and chimpanzee LCLs to explore the effects of APA on protein levels (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). We took this approach because an understanding of how APA isoform usage varies among primates could help explain why some human and chimpanzee genes are differentially expressed at either the mRNA or protein levels, but not both.

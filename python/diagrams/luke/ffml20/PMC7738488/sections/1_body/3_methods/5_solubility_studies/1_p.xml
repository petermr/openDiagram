 </sup>. In the experiment, 1 ml of 0.1 mg/ml each PAMAM dendrimers generations 1.0G, 1.5G, 2.0G, 2.5G, 3.0G, 3.5G and 4.0G along with solvents with varied solubility parameters were kept in test tubes. The test tubes were shaken at room temperature for 36 h in a shaker and allowed to stand to attain equilibrium. Visual inspections were conducted for the evaluation of solubility.

0: Blood samples were collected from 51 children (6 years old) who recruited to the present study ( Table I).
1: Written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of each participant and the present study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center [(2013)077; Guangdong, China] based on the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare criteria, and the American Heart Association ( 6, 11).
2: A total of 17 age- and sex-matched samples obtained from normal children, served as the controls; individuals were physically examined in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center.
3: The other 34 samples (17 CAA and 17 CAD) were obtained from patients who were diagnosed and excluded of other possible diseases by 2 pediatric cardiologists.
4: Blood samples were separated by centrifugation at 1,000  g for 10 min at 4C and aliquots of serum were collected and stored at 80C.
5: Serum samples were processed to remove albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) using a ProteoPrep Blue Albumin and IgG Depletion kit (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
6: The concentrations of these proteins were determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).
7: These protein samples were randomly combined into 17 comparison groups, each of which included 1 control sample, 1 CAA sample and 1 CAD sample.
8: Of the 17 comparison groups, 5 were randomly chosen and pooled together according to each type of sample; 3 pooled samples of the control, CAA and CAD groups were produced, and were subsequently analyzed by iTRAQ (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) experiments ( Table IA).
9: The other 12 groups out of the total 17 were analyzed via western blotting.
10: Information regarding the groups and diagnosis is presented in  Table IB.

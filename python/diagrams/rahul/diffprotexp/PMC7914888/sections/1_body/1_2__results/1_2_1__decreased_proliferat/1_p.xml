<p>The MTT assay and the exclusion of Trypan Blue revealed a reduction in cell B16F1 melanoma cells. Decrease in viable cells (to less than 50%) secondary to 72 h-long treatment with 5.0 mM amino acid L-Tyrosine (L-Tyr) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) or 2.5 μg/mL thymidine analog 5-Bromo-2′ deoxyuridine (5-Brd-2′-dU) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3); in both cases, exposure for 72 h to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU generated a statistically significant decrease in the number of B16F1 cells, from 3.6 × 10

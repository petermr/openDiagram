<p id="Par61">Finally, AltORFs and intergenic ORFs are surprisingly abundant, with AltORFs being the most common category in both stages as well as in differentially expressed novel ORFs. By correlating the nORF expression with their associated canonical genes, it was observed that most nORFs with significantly correlated expression are AltORFs showing positive correlation, except for two AltORFs that showed negative correlation. Structural analysis reveals that one of them is likely to form a protein structure that binds to nucleic acid, which provides a possible mechanism for this AltORF to regulate the expression of the associated gene by repressing its transcription or the translation of mRNA. On the other hand, intergenic ORFs were not only translated, some of them were even differentially expressed between oocyst and salivary gland sporozoites, suggesting that they might be involved in the stage-specific functions. An intriguing finding is that 12 out of 34 high-quality intergenic ORFs, and 99 out of 248 AltORFs were predicted with transmembrane domain, which may indicate that they have an important functional role in the membrane. Given that a similar scenario has been observed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, non-canonical transmembrane ORFs might be common in organisms with small genomes to expand the functional proteome.

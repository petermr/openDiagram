<p id="Par5">Here, we took advantage of three available RNAseq datasets, generated using samples from different brain regions, to systematically probe gene expression changes (DEG and DTU) in AD. In Mayoâ€™s clinic study, both the temporal cortex and cerebellum were used to obtain bulk RNAseq

 </sup>. We also added another level of complexity using an indirect approach to assign DEGs and gDTUs to unique cell types in order to identify AD gene expression signatures for neural cells, microglia, and endothelial cells. Finally, we linked these alterations with AD causal and risk genes, identifying novel isoform switches in BIN1 and APP genes of potential functional consequences for pathology progression.

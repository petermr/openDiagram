<p id="Par30">Comparison of altered gene expression in cells exposed to 10 versus 20 µM DCVC for 6 h was conducted by calculating pairwise correlation coefficients of logFC estimates. Differential changes in gene expression relative to control were strongly correlated for cells exposed to 10 µM DCVC versus 20 µM DCVC after a 6-h treatment [

Furthermore, for genes that met the FDR criterion for significant differential gene expression (FDR &lt; 0.05) and had a logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3], 20 µM DCVC treatment-induced larger magnitude altered gene expression compared with 10 µM DCVC, indicating a concentration-dependent response (Fig.

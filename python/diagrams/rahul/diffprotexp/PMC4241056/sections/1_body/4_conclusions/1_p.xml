<p>In conclusion, the differentially expressed proteins were determined in Caco-2 cells treated with/without Se (sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se) using the methods of 2D-PAGE and MS. Thirty spots represented reproducible upregulated or downregulated changes in different Se treatment groups were compared with those of the control, and finally, seven proteins were identified as E2, GS, TSP isomerase, TCPZ, lamin-B1, hnRNP F. and Cu, Zn-SOD. The present study provides the foundation for further understanding the mechanism of proteins associated with Se in Caco-2 cells. In addition, different results were observed in the groups treated with nano-Se, a novel form of Se particle, and thus the reasons and related mechanisms should be investigated in the future study.</p>

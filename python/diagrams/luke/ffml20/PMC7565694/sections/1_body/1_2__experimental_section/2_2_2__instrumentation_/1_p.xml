<p>All nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR) were recorded on a Bruker ARX400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Fallanden, Switzerland). Samples were prepared as solution of 5~10 mg of compound in 0.5 mL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. Mass spectra were measured on a AcquityUPLC/UPC2/Xevo G2-XS QTOFMS (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Elemental analysis was carried out on a Vario EL cube Elemental Analyzer (Elementar Corporation, Langenselbold, Germany). Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS10 Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The molecular mass of the poly(amic acid) (PAA) was estimated by gel permeation chromatography on multi-angle laser light scattering (GPC-MALLS) system (Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). DMF is the eluent with flow rate of 1 mL/min and test temperature of 50 °C. Wide angle X-ray diffractograms (WAXD) were recorded by a Rigaku, Ultema III X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) using a Cu Kα radiation. Density was obtained with an ALFA MIRAGE SD-200L electronic density balance (Alfa Mirage Corporation, Osaka, Japan).</p>

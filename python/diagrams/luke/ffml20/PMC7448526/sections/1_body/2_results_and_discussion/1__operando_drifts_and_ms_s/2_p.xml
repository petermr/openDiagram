<p>Similar spectroscopic features are observed for zeolites with methanol loadings of 4 and 2 molecules per Brønsted acidic site, although the overall intensity of the spectra is reduced by decreasing methanol loading from 8 to 2 molecules per acidic site. However, striking differences in the consumption of hydroxyls (above 3600 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) and low frequency methoxy bands (below 1500 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) are evident from the zeolite with the lowest methanol loading of 1 molecule per acidic site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) as compared to that with the highest methanol loaded zeolite (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Examining the DRIFTS spectra of the lowest methanol loading in more detail, we note first that the signature infrared profile of the lowest methanol loaded zeolite in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> matches precisely that of hydrogen bonded methanol with a neutral geometry,
 <xref rid="cit32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> which is different from the highest methanol loaded zeolite profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) that reflect the protonated methanol geometry.

 <xref rid="cit32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The C–H stretching modes of the neutral geometry appear at 2958 and 2850 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> which can be attributed to

 <sub>s</sub>(C–H) modes, respectively, of hydrogen bonded methanol with the neutral geometry.
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The position of the bands is at slightly higher wavenumbers as compared to that of the protonated geometry which shows up at 2950 and 2843 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), in line with previous studies.
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The band at 3550 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is also characteristic of the hydrogen bonded methanol with a neutral geometry
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and the band intensity increases with increasing hydrogen bonded methanol triplet and with a growing negative band at 3610 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, which is indicative of the involvement of Brønsted acidic sites. Moreover, the absence of multiple hydrogen bonded methanol molecules in the form of dimers or oligomers is evident when we compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> from the missing absorbance centred at 3260 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>.
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Even more significantly, only one negative band at 3611 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is present, unlike four negative bands for the highest methanol loaded zeolite, and bands assignable to low frequency methoxy bands are completely missing. Instead, a broad band between 1000 and 850 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is observed, which could be a combination of different bands. For example, a contribution from the Si–O–Si asymmetric stretch at around 880 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and hydrogen bonded methanol bands (assignable to C–O stretch and methyl rock) could also contribute between 900 and 1100 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. Accordingly, the negative band at 3610 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is attributed to involvement of Brønsted acidic hydroxyls in hydrogen bonding with methanol indicating that the Brønsted acidic hydroxyls are more reactive than other hydroxyls such as hydrolysed extra-framework Al–OH and silanol groups (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It is noteworthy that the methyl rock of methoxy band at around 1180 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is not present and hence a contribution from the C–O stretch of the methoxy species to the broad band between 1100 and 850 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> can be ruled out, which is further indicated by the signature C–H stretching modes of the methoxy and hydrogen bonded methanol. To this end, the C–H stretching region is magnified and four different methanol loading experiments are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>.

<p id="Par26">In the GSEA results for the No-LCOS group, pre-operative and post-operative comparison revealed no changes in inflammatory gene regulation, whereas up-regulation of genes controlling metabolic pathways (TCA cycle, metabolism of proteins, mitochondrial protein import) was observed. On the contrary, comparison of pre-operative and post-operative samples for the patients who developed LCOS revealed an up-regulation of genes controlling inflammatory pathways and a downregulation of genes controlling metabolic pathways (Fig.Â

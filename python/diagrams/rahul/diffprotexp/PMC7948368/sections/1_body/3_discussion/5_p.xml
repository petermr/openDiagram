<p id="Par46">This study benefited from the use of a stringent sample selection process including good-responders in clinical remission with absence of anti-drug antibody or inadequate adherence explaining non-response. In addition, the use of a longitudinal approach has allowed the identification of transcripts and pathways that change in response to successful treatment. The signatures were observed in whole blood which requires fewer sample processing steps. However, this may dilute subtle changes that occur in cell types of low abundance that would otherwise be apparent in cell-specific studies. This is most likely pertinent to B and T cells, which this study has highlighted as important contributors to the transcriptomic response in good-responders. Whilst it would be interesting to identify the cell types in which these gene expression changes occur, to our knowledge, the reference datasets required to resolve cell subtypes from whole blood are not currently available for the array type used in this investigation.</p>

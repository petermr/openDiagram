<p>According to the ceRNA hypothesis, lncRNAs act as an “miRNA sponge” to moderate miRNA expression and consequently affect mRNA level, forming networks of “lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA” interactions and regulating downstream pathways. Recently, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2019)</xref> knocked down lncRNA H19, and they found that cell proliferation and invasion in the ectopic endometrium is inhibited through miR-124-3p targeted suppression of the ITGB3. Therefore, we deduced that it is possible there are several lncRNAs in endothelial cells could regulate the “miR-124-3p/PRKAA2” axis in endothelial cells when it is adhered by tumor cells.

<p>Why might it be that ASIC3 appears to be particularly important in mediating muscle pain? One reason could be that there is a higher expression of ASIC3 in muscle than cutaneous afferents, as has been reported in rats, for example, 83% of ASIC3-expressing muscle afferents also expressed the vasodilatory peptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) leading to the hypothesis that these afferents may act as muscle metaboreceptors, triggering pain during insufficient oxygen supply to the muscle, such as might occur during exercise [

This hypothesis is supported by femoral occlusion induced by arterial ligation of rat hindlimb muscles (i.e. vascular insufficiency) leading to a significant increase in ASIC3 expression in the surrounding muscle-innervating sensory neurones, suggesting that ASIC3 might contribute to the exaggerated sympathetic and pressor responses observed during arterial occlusion due to lactic acid build up [

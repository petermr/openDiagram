<p>With the continuous sequencing of more mycoplasma whole genomes, gene annotation has provided more convenient pathways for elucidating the pathogenic functions of these organisms. Although these hypothetical genes predicted using BLAST or other bioinformatic methods may narrow the scope of research to a certain extent, cognitive limitations exist in comparison to the actual situation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, the final confirmation of the proposed virulence gene still depends on the knockout of the target gene in living mycoplasmas. Unfortunately, genetic manipulation of mycoplasmas remains challenging. Although novel techniques have been reported to manipulate target genes, the physiological characteristics of mycoplasmas make it impossible to knock out the target genes as easily as in eukaryotic bacteria, such as by RNA interference and CRISPR technology. Hence, several challenges remain before the exploration of mycoplasma-applicable gene editing technology. Our prediction of the molecular structure and function of pathogenic proteins, based on the progress of comparative genomics of homology analysis and crystal analysis technology, has become more accurate, providing favorable conditions for the study of putative genes. In recent years, the characterization of the function and structure of proteins by frozen electron microscopy has become a hot topic, while the high cost makes the general laboratory flinch.

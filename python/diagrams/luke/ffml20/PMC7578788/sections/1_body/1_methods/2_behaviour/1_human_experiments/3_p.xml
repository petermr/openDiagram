<p id="Par10">In the human study there were three trial blocks each of 200 individual reach trials. The first block consisted of ‘baseline’ trials in which the participants performed the joystick task as normal. The second block induced visuomotor adaptation by implementing a clockwise 35° rotation transformation of the on-screen joystick (green) cursor, requiring participants to modify their outward movement to overcome this perturbation. The final block, identical to the first, was used to probe the participants’ behavioural adaptation to the transformation through the presence of an aftereffect. Participants were not informed of the rotation transformation or the ordering of each block, and none reported explicit awareness of the rotation transform other than that their performance had worsened. Participants did not report the use of an explicit aiming strategy.</p>

<p>LINC00466 was found to play an active role in tumorigenesis based on its expression in clinical tissues and cells of glioma. Therefore, we reasoned that up-regulation of LINC00466 could promote the activity of glioma cells. To validate the possibility, we examined the effects of overexpressing LINC00466 on glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. T98G and A172 cell lines were used for subsequent cell experiments. Oe-LINC00466 and negative control were transfected into T98G and A172 cells, respectively. Transfection efficiency was detected to be well in cells transfected with oe-LINC00466, as suggested by qRT-PCR plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2A</xref>. CCK8 assay and colony formation assay showed that up-regulation of LINC00466 considerably facilitated the viability of T98G and A172 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">C</xref>). We further evaluated the effect of LINC00466 on migration and invasion abilities of glioma cells by transwell assays, finding that their abilities were remarkably increased after overexpression of LINC00466 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">E</xref>). These findings validated that LINC00466 could act as an oncogene to promote proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. We then investigated the effects of TMZ on T98G and A172 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2F</xref>, using CCK8 assays, treatment with LINC00466 significantly attenuated TMZ cytotoxicity in T98G and A172 cells. These results implied that LINC00466 could promote glioma cell activity and cell resistance to TMZ.

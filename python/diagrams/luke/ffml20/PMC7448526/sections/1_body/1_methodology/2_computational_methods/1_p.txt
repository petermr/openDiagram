0: Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) embedded calculations were employed to model zeolite H-ZSM-5.
1: The ChemShell software 37 was used to optimise zeolite geometries and determine vibrational frequencies of adsorbed species.
2: For H-ZSM-5 models, the tetrahedral T12 site of the siliceous MFI was substituted with, Al which is located at the intersection of the sinusoidal channel.
3: To form the Brnsted acidic site, a charge-compensating proton is bonded to the framework oxygen atom adjacent to T12 site 38 and oriented towards the center of the super cage; this configuration presents the highest deprotonation energy  i.e.
4: most stable.
5: 39

0: Lamins, evolutionarily conserved nuclear envelope proteins, are important for maintaining normal cell functions, including DNA replication, gene expression, chromatin organization, mitosis regulation, nuclear stability, and signal transduction [ 1].
1: Lamins, existing in the form of dimers, include three types type A, type B, and type C. In the lamin family, lamins A and C are encoded by the LMNA gene originated from the same transcription by alternative splicing [ 2].
2: Mutations of LMNA gene can cause a wide array of heart diseases, such as atrial arrhythmia, atrioventricular block, sinus bradycardia, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
3: DCM is a severe cardiac heterogeneous pathology characterized by ventricular dilatation and systolic impairment, which is accompanied by thromboembolism, arrhythmia, and even sudden death [ 3].
4: DCM is also a leading cause of heart failure [ 4].
5: LMNA mutations can cause autosomal dominant inheritable cardiomyopathy, accounting for 10% of DCM.
6: In comparison with other etiologies of DCM, LMNA mutation-associated DCM not only has high incidences and faster progress, but also is more malignant even when the ventricular impairment is mild [ 1].
7: At present, there are certain insights into the pathogenesis of LMNA mutation-associated DCM.
8: However, due to the complexity of LMNA mutations, patients with the same mutation have different clinical characteristics.
9: The phenotype-genotype correlation also increases the difficulty of LMNA mutation-associated DCM understanding.
10: Therefore, our knowledge about the DCM mechanisms caused by LMNA mutation is vague and incomplete.

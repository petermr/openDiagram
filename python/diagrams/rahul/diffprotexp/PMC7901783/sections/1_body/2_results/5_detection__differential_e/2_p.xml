<p>Determination of RISC factors involved in miRNA biogenesis is possible through nucleotide size distribution and 5’ base enrichment analyses of miRNAs. The dominant size and the enriched 5’ terminal base of known miRNAs were cleaved sequences with the size of 21 nucleotides and 5’ Uracil (U) (

To characterize differential expressed miRNA (DEmiRNA), read counts of known and novel miRNAs were used in DESeq2, and DEmiRNAs were determined between CMV-inoculated and mock-inoculated samples based on the threshold

Within the varieties, in ‘Jessie’ two UR- and four DR-miRNAs (including miR166, miR399) were detected, in ‘QQ74’ five DEmiRNAs (5 DR) were identified, and in ‘Red Head’ no DEmiRNA was detected. TargetFinder analysis of miRNAs detected a total of 126 candidate target genes that four (3 UR, 1 DR) belonged to the full-model design and 122 (19 UR, 103 DR) belonged to individual-variety design (

In ‘Jessie’, targeted genes were enriched in ether lipid/glycerophospholipid metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and endocytosis functions. In ‘QQ74’ and ‘Red Head’, no biological pathways were enriched (

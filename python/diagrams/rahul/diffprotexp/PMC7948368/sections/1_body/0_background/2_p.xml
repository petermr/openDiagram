<p id="Par28">Currently, non-responder patients can be identified and switched to an alternative therapy at 3â€‰months, but many remain on an ineffective therapy for much longer periods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Whilst clinical markers explain some of the variability in response, alone they offer insufficient predictive capability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Ideally, a reliable biological biomarker or panel of biomarkers would be measured in newly diagnosed patients and throughout the treatment time-course to predict and monitor response to therapy. This would aid timely therapeutic switching in patients in whom the treatment is unlikely to be effective but requires the identification of reliable biomarkers and development of a statistical classifier of treatment response.

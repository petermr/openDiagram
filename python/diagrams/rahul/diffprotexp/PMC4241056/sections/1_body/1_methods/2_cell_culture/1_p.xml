<p>The cells of Caco-2 were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U ml
 <sup>-1</sup> penicillin, and 100 μg ml
 <sup>-1</sup> streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air. When the cells approximately covered all the bottom of the tissue culture flask, Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS, pH7.4) was used to wash the cells three times. Then trypsin digestion followed to detach the cells from the culture flask. The reseeded density was 30,000 cells per cm

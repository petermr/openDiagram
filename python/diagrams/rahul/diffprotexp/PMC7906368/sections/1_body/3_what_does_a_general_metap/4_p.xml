<p>Each metaproteomics run will generate tens to hundreds of thousands of mass spectra of peptides and their fragments that are then used for peptide and protein identification. For identification, mass spectra are computationally matched to theoretical mass spectra derived from a protein sequence database. Development of efficient search algorithms is a very active research field providing a great diversity of commercial and open-access software. As discussed in question 2, the choice of nano-LC system, MS instrumentation, and reference database will determine the power of protein identification and the ability to discriminate homologous proteins from different organisms.</p>

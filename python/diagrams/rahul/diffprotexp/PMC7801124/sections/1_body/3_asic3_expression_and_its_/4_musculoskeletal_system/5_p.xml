<p>One potential limitation of ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> models is the potential for compensatory upregulation of expression of other acid sensors (e.g. TRPV1 or other ASIC subunits). To address this, a study was conducted employing an artificial miRNA construct (miR-ASIC3) to knock down ASIC3 in a carrageenan-induced muscle inflammation in mice. Using this approach, it was shown that miR-ASIC3 treated mice displayed a reduction in neuronal ASIC3 expression and developed a reduced level of mechanical hyperalgesia compared to WT mice [

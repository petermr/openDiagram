<p>To confirm titin and FKH 5–3 protein expression in congenital cholesteatomas, tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were sectioned into 5 μm thick slices and fixed with a chilled 1:1 mixture of methanol:acetone for 5 minutes after pretreatment with 0.3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 20 minutes at room temperature. Slides were treated with 1:600 normal rabbit serum for 20 minutes to block nonspecific reactions and then incubated with a polyclonal antibody against target human proteins, including titin (1:200, HPA007042, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and forkhead transcription activator homolog (1:200, clone FKH 5–3, human (fragment), AHP933, AbD Serotec, Kidlington, England). Slides were then incubated with biotinylated antihuman rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). For negative controls, the step in which samples were reacted with primary antibodies (titin and clone FKH 5–3) was skipped. Peroxidase was attached to the secondary antibody by avidin-biotin peroxidase complex formation. Specimens were incubated in diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride to detect primary antibody binding sites.

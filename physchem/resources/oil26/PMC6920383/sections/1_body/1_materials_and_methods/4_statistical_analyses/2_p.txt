0: Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordination and Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance 58 were used to test for differences in species composition between burrow entrances, impacted areas and controls (implemented using the vegan package 59).
1: The effect of the interaction between microsite and burrow age was tested, but was never significant and is therefore not reported.
2: Chi 2 tests were used to determine whether common species (occurring > 3 times in a dataset) were non-randomly distributed across the different microsites.
3: In the arid site burrow entrances were excluded from Chi 2 tests due to differences in sample area.

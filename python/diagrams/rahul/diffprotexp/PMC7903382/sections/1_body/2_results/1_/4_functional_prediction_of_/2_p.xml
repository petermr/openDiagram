<p>To identify major biochemical metabolic pathways and signal transduction pathways for differential gene enrichment, KEGG pathway analysis (
 <xref rid="f3-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) was conducted. Using the KEGG pathway analysis, it was found that differential genes were mainly enriched in the ‘PI3K/Akt signaling pathway’, ‘protein digestion and uptake’, ‘p53 signaling pathway’ and ‘neuroactive ligand-dependent body interaction’ (

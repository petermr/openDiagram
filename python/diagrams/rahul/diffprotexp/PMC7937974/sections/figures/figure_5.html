 <caption> Oxidative phosphorylation was involved in the expression of E-selectin and monocyte–endothelial cell interaction. (A–E) Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were treated with medium containing 15% sera from Kawasaki disease without coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL–; n = 6) and Kawasaki disease with coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL+; n = 6) subjects plus oligomycin (50 μg/ml) or DMSO (same volume) for 4 h. The E-selectin mRNA levels were measured by qPCR (A), and protein levels were measured by Western blot (B). (C) Statistical analysis of immunoblots. (E) HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from KD-CAL– ( n = 6) and KD-CAL+ ( n = 6) subjects plus oligomycin (50 μg/ml) or DMSO (same volume) for 4 h then co-incubated with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM)-labeled THP-1 cells for 1 h. Representative images used quantification of THP-1 cells (green) attached to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). (D) Quantitative analysis of adherent THP-1 cells lysate fluorescence at 490-nm excitation and 530-nm emission. All samples were normalized to HCAECs with CAL serum treatment. The bar graphs are mean ± SEM. ** P &lt; 0.01 compared with the indicated group. </caption>

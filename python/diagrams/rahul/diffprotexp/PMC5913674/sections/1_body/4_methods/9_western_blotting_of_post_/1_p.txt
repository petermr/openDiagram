0: Adhered trophozoites grown to confluence from all MtzR and MtzS isogenic isolates, as well as 106-MtzR and 713-MtzR P0, P8, and P16 revertant cultures, had protein extracted in 2.5% SDS in 100 mM Tris containing 5 mM Trichostatin A (BioAustralis) and HALT  protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies).
1: The protein concentration was determined via BCA assay (Pierce), and then samples were reduced with 15 mM dithiothreitol at 90C.
2: A total of 15 g of proteins were resolved on 412% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen) in 1  3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid running buffer (Invitrogen) and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma).
3: All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signalling Technologies and included antibodies were directed to KAc, K-MMe, phosphorylated tyrosine (pY), the 143-3 binding motif (including phosphorylated serine) (143-3), and ubiquitin.
4: Anti-H3 and anti-H4 antibodies were obtained from Abcam.
5: Consistent protein loading was verified after transfer using Ponceau S staining (Sigma).
6: Proteinantibody interaction was detected with an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated immunoglobulin G secondary antibody using enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (LumiGLO , Cell Signalling Technologies) on a BioRad ChemiDoc MP imaging system with exposure times optimized for each antibody; images were collected up to 200 seconds and selected based on resolution and absence of oversaturation.

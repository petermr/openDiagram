<p>The 264, 126, and 76 total DEPs in WB-MtzR, 106-MtzR, and 713-MtzR (relative to their isogenic susceptible parental control), respectively, were DAVID for functional clustering analysis. A nonredundant total of 6 functional clusters (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>, panel B), including “AAA ATPase,” 2 “Electron Carrier Activity” clusters, and “EGF-like,” “Kinase,” and “Ribosome” clusters, with the “EGF-like” cluster the most consistent in terms of gene families and numbers between MtzR lines. Overall, although DEP identifications and their directionality diverged between MtzR isolates, there was some convergence between MtzR lines at the level of protein function, with different members of the same gene or functional families detected among differentially regulated clusters of DEPs for each isolate. Functional annotation including gene ontology (GO) and Interpro annotations for DEPs can be found in

Some of the clusters identified in the GSEA were mirrored in results from STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes) software, in particular, protein–protein interactions surrounding ribosomal function, ABC transporters, antioxidant and glycolysis, and phosphorylation (

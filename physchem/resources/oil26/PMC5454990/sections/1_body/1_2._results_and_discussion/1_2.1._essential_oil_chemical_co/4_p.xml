The EO of leaves of <italic>Endlicheria arenosa</italic> was dominated by bicyclogermacrene (42.2%), germacrene D (12.5%), and &#946;-caryophyllene (10.1%) [<xref rid="B23-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, the EO of <italic>Nectandra leucantha</italic> showed as the main compounds bicyclogermacrene (28.4%), germacrene A (7.3%), &#945;-pinene (6.6%), and &#946;-pinene (4.6%) [<xref rid="B24-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The sesquiterpene &#948;-cadinene identified in the EO of branches was detected as the main compound in EOs of leaf and bark of <italic>Beilschmiedia madang</italic> (17.0% and 20.5%, respectively) and was associated with germacrene D in the oil of barks of <italic>Beilschmiedia glabra</italic> [<xref rid="B25-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

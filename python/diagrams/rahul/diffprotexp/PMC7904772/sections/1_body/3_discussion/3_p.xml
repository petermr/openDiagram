<p id="Par27">Our proteomics and bioinformatics analyses suggested affected pathways in the prefrontal cortex specifically correlated to CMS-induced behavioral phenotypes of resilience, depression, and anxiety. The pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were significantly enriched for signaling, secretion, and synapse dysfunctions in the depression-susceptible group, metabolism and neuropsychiatric disease-associated dysregulations in the anxiety-susceptible group, and metabolism, synapse, and signaling repercussions in the insusceptible group. Subsequently, the network analysis unraveled the protein dysregulation systems corresponding to these significantly enriched pathways and potentially provided some valuable information for the pathophysiological basis of the three stress-induced behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, we further explore the drug relevance of these differential proteins through the use of phenotype-target-drug network analysis. As a result, the 52 phenotype-associated proteins were identified to be correlated with the antidepression/anxiety drugs. It can be assumed that the drugs may act on the potential primary targets to affect expressions of the correlated differential proteins, thereby ameliorating depression and anxiety symptoms in stress-susceptible subjects or enabling them to resist stress. Accordingly, these 52 differential proteins may represent new important secondary targets that are worthy of further study for the drug development in depression and anxiety disorders.</p>

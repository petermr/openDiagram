 <caption> Illustration of the Rad-6 chemical space as an interpolated height profile. a kPCA as in Fig.Â  3 showing the DFT reference intensive atomization energies AE/ N (in eV). b Prediction from the ML model using an intensive kernel and a small intensively selected training set of only 1000 molecules with UFF geometries. c Respective differences (DFT-ML). Here, the range of the colorbar is shifted but the scale is the same. </caption>

<p id="Par7">The adapter-ligated fragments were enriched through amplification of adapter-ligated cDNA using Indexing-PCR (37 °C for 15mins, denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s followed by 15 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 75 s and 65 °C for 5mins. The final PCR product (sequencing library) was purified with HighPrep beads, quality was checked on Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and fragment size distribution was analysed on Agilent 2200 Tapestation.</p>

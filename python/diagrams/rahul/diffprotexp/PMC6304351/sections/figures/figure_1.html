 <caption> (Aâ€“C) Volcano plots of normalized LC-MS/MS spectral counts comparing T. oleivorans protein biosynthesis during growth on a medium-chain alkane ( n-C 14), a long-chain alkane ( n-C 28) and a non-hydrocarbon control (Tween 80). Data points above horizontal dashed line represent P-values below 0.05. Vertical dashed lines represent a twofold change. Specific proteins involved in the oxidation of alkanes significantly differentially expressed during growth on n-C 14 and n-C 28 are highlighted. AM, alkane monooxygenase; F, ferredoxin; FR, ferredoxin reductase; AD, alcohol dehydrogenase; ALD, aldehyde dehydrogenase; BVMO, Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase; E, esterase. (D) Principal component analysis of replicate T. oleivorans proteomes on growth substrates n-C 14, n-C 28, and Tween 80. </caption>

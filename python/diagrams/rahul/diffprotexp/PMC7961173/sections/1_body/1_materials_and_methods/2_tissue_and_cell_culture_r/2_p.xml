<p id="Par9">The TCE metabolite 
 <italic>S</italic>-(1, 2-dichlorovinyl)-
 <sc>l</sc>-cysteine (DCVC) was synthesized as a powder by the University of Michigan Medicinal Chemistry Core according to published procedures (McKinney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1959</xref>). Purity of 98.7% was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. A stock solution of 1 mM DCVC was prepared by dissolving DCVC powder in PBS. The chemical structure was confirmed periodically by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis MI 1640 culture medium with 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine performed at the University of Michigan Biochemical Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Core. The DCVC stock solution was stored in aliquots at − 20 °C until use.

  <p>CNTN1 enhances LNCaP cell proliferation. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis for CNTN1 and Actin expression in the indicated stable lines. (
   <bold>B</bold>) LNCaP empty vector (EV) and LNCaP CNTN1 cells were seeded at 10
   <sup>4</sup>/well in 6-well plate. Cell numbers were counted every two days. Experiments were repeated three times. Mean ± SD (standard deviation) was graphed; 2-way ANOVA was used to analyze the two growth curves. (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) LNCaP EV and LNCaP CNTN1 cells were seeded in 60 mm plates at the indicated densities for colony formation. Experiments were repeated three times. Typical images from a single repeat are presented (
   <bold>C</bold>); quantifications were graphed using Mean ± SD. **

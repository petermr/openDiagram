 </sup>. Briefly, tissues were dissociated with Dispase at 37 °C for 15 min with intermittent pipetting to attain a single cell suspension with 0.05% Trypsin at 37 °C for a final 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped, and cells were re-suspended in Hanks buffer (1X HBSS, 0.25% BSA, 10 mM HEPES pH8). Cells were centrifuged at 500 ×

 </sup>. Briefly, cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, Ph7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal) and tagmentation performed using Illumina Nextera DNA kit (FC-121-1030) for 30 min at 37 °C on a shaking thermomixer. Tagmented DNA was purified using Qiagen MinElute kit (Cat no. 28004) and amplified using NEB Next High-Fidelity 2X PCR Mast Mix (Cat no. M0543S) for 11 cycles as follows: 72 °C, 5 min; 98 °C, 30 s; 98 °C, 10 s; 63 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min. Library preparation was complete after further clean up using Qiagen PCR MinElute kit (Cat no. 28004) and Beckman Coulter XP AMPpure beads (A63880). Tagmentation size was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. Libraries were quantified with Qubit 2.0 (Life Technologies) and sequenced using paired-end 150 bp reads on the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform at Novogene UK. Three biological replicates for each stage were used for analysis.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As discussed in Point 5, the absence of a gene duplicate in ancient genomes would result in our maximum likelihood method assigning the gene duplication event to the daughter lineages, in this case either Elephantidae or Sirenia. While this would underrepresent the number of genes duplicated in the Tethytheria stem lineage, we expect that this artifact would affect any duplicated gene in general, and not any particular gene or pathway; as a result, we do not expect that this would bias our outcomes in a particular direction with regards to tumor suppressor pathway enrichments.</p>

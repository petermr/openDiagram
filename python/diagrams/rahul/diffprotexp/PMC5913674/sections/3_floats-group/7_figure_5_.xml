  <p>Western blots of post-translational protein modifications in MtzS and MtzR lines. Total protein lysate from trophozoites (15 μg) from WB, 713, and 106 MtzS and MtzR lines was probed with antibodies against acetylated lysine (KAc), mono-methylated lysine (K-MMe), ubiquitin (Ubi), phosphorylated tyrosine (pY), and the 14–3-3 binding motif (including phosphorylated serine) (14–3-3). Protein loading was verified after transfer using Ponceau S staining (first row, left). MtzS and MtzR lanes are designated by “S” and “R,” respectively. Altered protein features detected in 3/3 MtzR lines are designated with a solid red arrow, while protein features changed in 2/3 lines are designated with a broken red arrow.</p>

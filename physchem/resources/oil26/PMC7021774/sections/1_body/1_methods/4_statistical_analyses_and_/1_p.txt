0: Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation and variance) were calculated using the software GenStat (VSN International, 16th edition).
1: Best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) were calculated using a linear mixed approach in REML using GenStat (VSN International  2015).
2: Heritability was calculated using GenStat: Broad sense heritability of line means was calculated from the estimate of the variance components in REML, taking into account all features of the experimental designs.
3: Heritability was then estimated as  h2 =  2G/ ( 2G +  2e) where  2G is the genetic variance of line means and  2e is the residual variance.

 <caption> (a) Simulated XRPD pattern of PCT-1·DMF (black) and experimental XRPD patterns of PCT-1·DMF (red), PCT-1 (green), and PCT-1·H 2O (blue). The green asterisk indicates the background signal from the Kapton film that shields the sample from ambient air. (b) Electrostatic potentials (ESPs) of HHTP (left) and HAT-CN (right) in the crystal structure of PCT-1·DMF. SEM images of (c) PCT-1·DMF and (d) PCT-1. (e) Adsorption (open symbols) and desorption (solid symbols) isotherms for H 2O at 298 K (circles) and N 2 at 77 K (triangles). (f) SEM image of PCT-1 after water adsorption. </caption>

<p>The LCV in the 
 <italic>Legionella</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. polyphaga</italic> has been reported to remain intact for up to 8 hr post-infection (hr pi), disrupted by 12 hr pi, and eventually lysed to release the intracellular pathogens into the cytoplasm of the amoeba by 18 to 24 hr pi [
 <xref rid="b13-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection incurred the lysis of more than 80% of 
 <italic>A. polyphaga</italic> at 24 hr pi, and it has also been suggested that the intracellular condition may significantly differ between 12â€“18 hr pi and 24 hr pi [
 <xref rid="b13-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Contrary to the previous findings, 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> in the present study remained intact even at 24 hr pi. Therefore, gene expression patterns at 12 hr pi and 24 hr pi were compared to confirm whether drastic differences were present in 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> at these 2 time points.

0: We set up camera traps (MMS wireless scouting camera, LTL-6210MC HD series, Ltl Acorn, China) outside aardvark burrows to determine the exact time of emergence from and return to a burrow after foraging (if the aardvark returned to the same burrow from which it had emerged).
1: Between July 2013 and September 2015, we located each aardvark inside its burrow several times per month using VHF tracking, and placed camera traps at burrow entrances, either behind the burrow entrance or downwind of the burrow to minimise disturbance of the aardvark inside.
2: Because each aardvark changed burrows frequently, we could not use a fixed camera trap system.
3: In total, we obtained recordings of 387 emergences and 109 returns of an aardvark to a burrow (see  Supplementary Table S4 for details).
4: We analysed all camera trap footage manually to determine time of emergence and return to burrows.

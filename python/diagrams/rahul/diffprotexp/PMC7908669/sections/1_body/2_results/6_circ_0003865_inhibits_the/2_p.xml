<p id="Par28">To further explore the roles of miR-3653-3p in regulating BMSC osteogenic differentiation, we then overexpressed miR-3653-3p in human BMSCs by transfection with specific mimics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e). The overexpression of miR-3653-3p resulted in a significant reduction of GAS1 expression and a marked elevation of ALP, RUNX2, and OPN expression in human BMSCs, but no changes in circ_0003865 expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e). A concomitant decrease in GAS1 protein levels and an increase in ALP, RUNX2, and OPN protein levels were also detected in BMSCs transfected with the miR-3653-3p mimics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f). Furthermore, we showed by CCK-8 assay that miR-3653-3p mimics had no effect on proliferation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>g), and we also showed by ALP staining that the in situ expression of the ALP gene in human BMSCs was significantly enhanced by the miR-3653-3p mimics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>h). Additionally, Alizarin Red staining showed that the osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs were promoted by the miR-3653-3p mimics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>i). These results indicate that miR-3653-3p can suppress GAS1 gene expression to promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

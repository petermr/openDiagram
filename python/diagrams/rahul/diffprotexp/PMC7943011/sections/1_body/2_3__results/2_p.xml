<p>Compared to untreated control cells, metformin-treated cells differentially expressed 47 proteins (with |log

 <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.05), of which 15 proteins were exclusively changed by the biguanide drug and not during hyperinsulinemia (

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 15 out of 47 proteins met both of the above-mentioned criteria (log

 <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.05) and thus were significantly differential expressed in comparison to untreated control samples (

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and 17 proteins were differentially expressed after metformin administration when compared to an hyperinsulinemic environment (CCND2, CD2, CD63, CD81, CDCP1, CTGF, F3, FGF2, GFAP, GUSB, HAVCR1, IRF4, PI3, PLAUR, PPIA, UBE2T, VTCN1). A total of 3 proteins were differentially expressed in all 3 considered groups (HGF, IL5, TFRC) (

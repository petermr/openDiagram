<p>Embryonated eggs of 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> were obtained from the faeces of naturally infected cats by sedimentation technique [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Briefly, the faeces were mixed with PBS and strained though meshes of different sizes. Samples were sedimented and washed several times with PBS until clear supernatant was obtained, and were kept at room temperature (28±3°C) for 1 week to enable full development. Prior to experimental infection, the eggs were examined under light microscopy to determine full maturation by detecting active movement of the miracidium within the egg shell [

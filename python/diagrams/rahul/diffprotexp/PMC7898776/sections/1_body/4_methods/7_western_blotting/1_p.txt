0: The proteins from liver tissue were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto PVDF membrane.
1: Tri-Methyl-Histone H3 (lys27) (C36B11) Rabbit mAb was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).
2: The protein level H3K27me3 were detected by western blotting with the antibody (1:10001:4000) according to manufacturers instructions.
3: Blots were probed by second antibody labeled with IR-Dye 680 or 800 cw (1:20001:4000, Licor, Lincoln, NE, USA) and the membranes were visualized and quantified as the methods described by You et al.
4: [ 28].
5: (six biological replicates for each group).

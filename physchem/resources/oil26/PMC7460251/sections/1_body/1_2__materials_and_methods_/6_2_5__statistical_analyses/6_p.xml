<p>Next, we modeled the effects of enrichment on welfare indicators using data aggregated by night. For these models, we used time (two-week period of the study) as a continuous predictor. We modeled log-transformed FGM concentrations using a normal distribution and identity link function. These models included the aforementioned random slope terms and a variance components covariance structure. To assess how FGM concentrations varied in response to enrichment characteristics, we included the following fixed factors: continuous time, enrichment (stated goal or specific item), total time of enrichment use (seconds), and counts of enrichment events. To explore alternative explanations for FGM variations, we also included the following fixed factors in models: sample collection time, total time pacing (seconds), counts of pacing events, and counts of total agonistic and affiliative interactions. These models would not support an interaction between time and enrichment. We also modeled behavioral diversity (H) using a normal distribution and identity link function, with the same random slope terms; however, this model used an AR1 covariance structure. Fixed factors for behavioral diversity included time and enrichment (specific or goal); we did not use behaviors as predictors in the behavioral diversity models because those behaviors were used to calculate H scores. </p>

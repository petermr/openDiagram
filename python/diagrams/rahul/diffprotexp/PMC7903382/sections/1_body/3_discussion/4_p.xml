<p>To further investigate the roles of these differentially expressed lncRNAs in the development of MIRI, GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed. Based on the GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of these lncRNAs, the results suggested that the significantly enriched biologic processes and molecular functions of the upregulated genes after MIRI were associated with gene sets termed as follows: ‘PI3K/Akt signaling pathway’, ‘protein digestion and absorption’, ‘p53 signaling pathway’ and ‘neuroactive ligand-dependent body interaction’.</p>

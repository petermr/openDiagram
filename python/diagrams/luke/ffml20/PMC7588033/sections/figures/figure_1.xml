  <p>Typical simulation setup of our system. The system consists of a lipid bilayer (green), water (blue), and one of the compounds (orange and green). The zero of the axis in the 
   <italic>z</italic> direction is positioned at the center of the lipid bilayer. The SMD force that pulls the dummy atom through the bilayer in the 
   <italic>z</italic> direction is indicated with a red arrow.

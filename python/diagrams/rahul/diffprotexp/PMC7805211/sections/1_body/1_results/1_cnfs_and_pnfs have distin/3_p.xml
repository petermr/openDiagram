 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We determined neurofibroma methylation profiles using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array in a discovery cohort of 61 CNF and PNF samples from a total of 39 patients (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S1). The MethylationEPIC array is a targeted approach to interrogate approximately 850,000 methylation sites throughout the genome, including coding and regulatory space (e.g., FANTOM5 annotated enhancers) in addition to CpG islands, shores, and shelves. We applied a hierarchical generalized linear mixed effects model to identify differentially methylated loci between CNFs and PNFs, controlling for age and sex differences with a nested random effect to control for partially repeated measures. In total, we identified 31,201 significant differentially methylated probes (DMP; 
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05). By examining differentially methylated loci with an absolute odds ratio greater than 4 and clustering using a semi-supervised hierarchical approach, we establish a distinct, base-pair resolution epigenetic signature for CNF and PNFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). This probe-based analysis confirms that individual CpG-based methylation events are highly consistent within CNF and PNF tumor types, yet between CNFs and PNFs there are clearly definable, distinct global methylation profiles with minimal overlap. Comparison of beta-values within clustered methylation sites revealed striking differences across large portions of the genome suggesting that chromatin architecture is also distinct between tumor types.

0: The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were evaluated using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA).
1: The procedure was performed according to the previous study [ 21].
2: The astrocytes were seeded in 96-well plate, incubated only with LPS (1  g/mL) or stimulated with LPS (1  g/mL), and treated with HR and SGR essential oils (100  g/mL) for 24 hours.
3: Then, the cells were lysed, centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min, and incubated with 5  M H 2DCF-DA at 37C for 30 min.
4: ROS fluorescence (DCF) was measured in microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm.
5: The experiments were repeated three times.

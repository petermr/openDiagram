<p>Supplementary Figure S6: Dose-response curves for MtzS lines (dark colors, solid line) and MtzR lines (light colors, dotted lines) for chemical inhibitors of protein post-translational modification networks. Experiments performed in biological triplicate. Error bars represent Â± 1 standard deviation. Table below dose response curves show the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration for each line, and the resistance factor is calculated for MtzR lines relative to their MtzS parent. Trichostatin A (grey fill) had a significantly increased IC
 <sub>50</sub> in all MtzR lines relative to their MtzS parents. Due to the high IC
 <sub>50</sub> in Chaetocin, and the limits of solubility, it was difficult to plot the dose response curve for this compound and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was approximately estimated in some lines.

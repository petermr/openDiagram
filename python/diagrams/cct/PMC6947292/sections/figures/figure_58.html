 <caption> ( A) Specific precipitation enthalpy after cooling from solution annealing of alloy 7150, as a function of cooling rate measured by DFSC. ( B) Specific precipitation enthalpy after cooling from solution annealing and Vickers hardness after subsequent ageing (120 Â°C 24 h) of alloy 7150, as a function of cooling rate. The enthalpy values obtained by DFSC are shown as average values and standard deviation for six samples. The solid lines are model predictions from Ref. [ 119]. The DSC and hardness data tested on large samples were published in Ref. [ 133]. Hardness was tested for samples at the millimetre scale at the same cooling rates, obtained using a quenching dilatometer [ 129]. </caption>

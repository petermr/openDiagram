<p>We found that 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors differ in miRNA expression; however, the differences are less pronounced than previously reported differences in mRNA expression [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We did not observe a clear distinction of 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors in overall analysis, including PCA or hierarchical clustering based on the entire set of miRNA sequencing data, while a pronounced difference in mRNA expression profiles between 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt was reported previously [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

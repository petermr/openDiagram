 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most common human fungal pathogen causing diseases ranging from superficial mucosal to life-threatening systemic infections [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>]. The majority of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections are associated with its ability to form biofilms where adhesion of yeast cells to the substrate is followed by proliferation and formation of hyphae, resulting in a network of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm matrix is complex, with major polysaccharide constituents being α-mannan, β-1,6-glucan, and β-1,3-glucan which has been linked to resistance of biofilm to antifungals [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14–17</xref>]. However, in various niches in the host, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> coexists with numerous bacterial species, most notably 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> a major human bacterial pathogen that causes a wide variety of diseases [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18–24</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> alone is a poor former of biofilms, however, together with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, this species forms a substantial biofilm where the fungus creates a scaffold for the bacteria [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The growing use of implanted medical devices is another reason why the incidence of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> and staphylococcal infections has steadily increased, since the majority of these infections are emerging from biofilms formed on medical implants [
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,

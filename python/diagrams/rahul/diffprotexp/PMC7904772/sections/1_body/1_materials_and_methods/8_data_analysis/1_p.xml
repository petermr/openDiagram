<p id="Par12">Proteome Discoverer (v2.1, ThermoFisher) software and the Sequest HT search engine were used to identify and quantify peptides and proteins based on the UniProt_Rat release 2017_12 database. The search parameters allowed for trypsin missed cleavages of two, 10 p.p.m. precursor fragment mass tolerance, and 0.05 Da fragment mass tolerance. Fixed modifications were set for iTRAQ 8-plex on N-term and Lys and Carbamidomethylation on Cys. Variable modification settings included oxidation on Met, acetylation on protein N-term, deamidation on Asn and Gln, and Pyro-Glu. For identification of proteins and peptides, the peptide-spectrum-match false discovery rate was controlled &lt;1.0% with the Percolator module, as previously described

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered to be significantly differentially expressed. The raw data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (

<p>We also conducted KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis using the KOBAS online search tool (v. 2.0) to further characterize the proteins with expression change in response to TNFα treatment. As shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, the KEGG analysis summarized the pathways in which the identified proteins with significant change involved. We observed that TNFα treatment significantly regulated the pathways (Fisher's Exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤0.1) involving in the ribosome, spliceosome, antigen processing and presentation, proteasome, glycoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and metabolism of amino acids. Accordingly, we suggested that TNFα treatment may enhance RNA processing, protein degradation, and fatty acid oxidation in HepG2 cells.

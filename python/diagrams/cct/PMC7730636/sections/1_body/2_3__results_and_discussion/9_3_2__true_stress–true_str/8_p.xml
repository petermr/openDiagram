<p>Overall dependence of peak stress on temperature for individual strain rates is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f014">Figure 14</xref>a. The peak stress values were obtained as the highest values of flow stresses from the dependences in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f012">Figure 12</xref>. The peak stress decreases linearly in relation to the deformation temperature. Similar results were obtained also by the authors [
 <xref rid="B45-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Results clearly shows that the increasing temperature significantly affects deformation resistance of the material. When the material is heated to high temperatures in stable austenite area close to melting point, the interatomic distance increases. Distance between atoms in the crystal lattice increases, and consequently, strength of the material is reduced. Therefore, less force is required to deform the material. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f014">Figure 14</xref>b indicates the relationship between the peak stress and the logarithmic strain rate. The peak stress increases linearly in relation to the deformation rate. As with dependence on temperature in previous chapter, results clearly shows that the increasing deformation rate significantly affects deformation resistance of the material.

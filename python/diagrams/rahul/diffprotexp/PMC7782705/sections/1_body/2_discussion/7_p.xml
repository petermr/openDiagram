<p id="Par25">Particularly interesting, several genes encoding for proteins involved in the control of alternative splicing in neurons are differently expressed in the TL of AD brains. For instance, RBFOX1 and 2 are downregulated in the MSBB BM36 and could contribute to the altered rate of exon skipping observed in this region

 </sup>. Noteworthy, reduced expression of RBFOX1 has been associated with increased inclusion of exon 7 in the APP gene, leading to an enhanced expression of APP isoforms 770 and 751 containing the KPI domain

 </sup>. A similar switch in the APP isoforms has also been associated with somatic gene recombination in AD

 </sup>, indicating that increased ratios of APP isoforms containing the KPI domain could be detrimental to neurons. Considering these findings and the well-established associations between KPI(+)APP expression levels, amyloid plaque deposition, and AD pathology progression

 </sup>, it is tempting to speculate that controlling APP isoform switches by manipulating RBFOX family proteins could be a potential therapeutic strategy to hamper disease progression.

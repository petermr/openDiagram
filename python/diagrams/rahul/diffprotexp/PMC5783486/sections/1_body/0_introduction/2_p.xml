<p>Without routine therapy, ~25% of patients with KD develop coronary artery dilation or aneurysms (CAD or CAA, respectively) (

 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b7-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) reported that patients with coronary artery sizes of ≤5.0 mm exhibited regression to the normal state, while patients with coronary artery sizes of &gt;5.0 mm exhibited persistence or even increases in size. CAA with a diameter of ≥8.0 mm is strongly associated with the development of coronary artery stenosis and myocardial infarction (

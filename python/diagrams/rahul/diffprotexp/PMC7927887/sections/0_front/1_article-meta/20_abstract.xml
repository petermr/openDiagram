 <p>Disruption of the normal splicing patterns of RNA is a major factor in the path o genesis of a number of diseases. Increasingl y research has shown the strong influence that splicing patterns can have on cancer progression. Multiple myeloma is a molecularly heterogeneous disease classified by the presence of key translocations, gene expression profiles and mutations but the splicing patterns in MM remains largely unexplored. We take a multifaceted approach to define the extent and impact of alternative splicing in MM. We looked at the spliceosome component, 
  <italic>SF3B1</italic>, with hotspot mutations (K700E and K666T/Q) shown to result in an increase in alternative splicing in other cancers. We discovered a number of differentially spliced genes in comparison of the 
  <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant and wild type samples that included, 
  <italic>MZB1, DYNLL1, TMEM14C</italic> and splicing related genes 
  <italic>DHX9, CLASRP</italic>, and 
  <italic>SNRPE</italic>. We identified a broader role for abnormal splicing showing clear differences in the extent of novel splice variants in the different translocation groups. We show that a high number of novel splice loci is associated with adverse survival and an ultra-high risk group. The enumeration of patterns of alternative splicing has the potential to refine MM classification and to aid in the risk stratification of patients.

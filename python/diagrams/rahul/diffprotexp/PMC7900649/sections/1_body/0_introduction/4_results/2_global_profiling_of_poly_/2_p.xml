<p id="Par21">To study whether the global pattern of alternative polyadenylation is affected during PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, we profiled poly(A) sites in infected and mock-infected cells. A total of 403 million raw reads were generated by Illumina Hiseq 2500 sequencing. After mapping to the porcine genome and conducting internal priming filtering, about 188 million reads were obtained for further poly(A) sites analysis. Among the filtered reads, only 71% of reads were annotated 3′ UTR (mapped to 3′ UTR and ucsc database), and 7% were located within 1 kb downstream of gene’s 3′ UTR. The remaining reads were located in the coding regions (4%), and intergenic regions (18%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). After clustering the filtered reads, only 23% of poly(A) sites were mapped to annotated 3′ UTR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Based on our dataset, 22% and 6% of poly(A) sites were located in intron and CDS regions, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Moreover, 40% and 9% of poly(A) sites were located in intergenic regions and within 1 kb downstream of the beginning of annotated 3′ UTR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).

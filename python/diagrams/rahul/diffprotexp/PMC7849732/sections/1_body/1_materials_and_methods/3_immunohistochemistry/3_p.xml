<p>The next day, spinal cord sections were rinsed in PBS (3 times x 5 min) and incubated in secondary antibodies, diluted in the blocking solution, for 2 h. The mixture of secondary antibodies used was the following: goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor647 (1:1000; Invitrogen, A21235) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) H + L (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washes in PBS, a tyramide signal amplification (TSA) reaction was performed using the signal amplification fluorescent kit conjugated with the fluorophore cyanine 3 (cy3) (TSA plus cyanine 3 system, Perkin Elmer, Inc., NEL744001KT). A dilution factor of 1:50 in the TSA amplification buffer was used. The amplification time was 2.5 min (GluN2A) or 7.5 min (GluN2B and GluN2D). The resultant enzymatic reaction allows for cy3 to be deposited and thus, the optimal detection and visualization of labeled NMDAR subunits [

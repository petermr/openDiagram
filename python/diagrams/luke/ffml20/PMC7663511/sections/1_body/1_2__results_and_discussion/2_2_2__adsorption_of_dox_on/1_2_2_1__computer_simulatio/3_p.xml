 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-08230-f007">Figure 7</xref>, we present the visualization from MD simulation for four simulation time values: (a) 0.5 ns, (b) 1 ns, (c) 5 ns, and (d) 20 ns. We can see that over time, clusters of freely aggregating DOX molecules merge into larger structures with both DOX and DOX-SWCNTs aggregates. Finally, after the time about t = 7.5 ns, we observe four aggregates, one of which is DOX-SWCNTs, while the other three are made of pure DOX (

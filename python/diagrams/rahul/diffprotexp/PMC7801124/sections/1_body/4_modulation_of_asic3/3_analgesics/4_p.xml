<p>Unlike NSAIDs, opioids are primarily prescribed to control pain, having a very limited role on inflammation. Whereas NSAIDs inhibit ASIC3, tetrahydropapaveroline (THP,

 <sub>50</sub> of 24.86 mM) and rASIC3 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 17.23 mM), with another precursor, reticuline (

 <sub>50</sub> of 0.56 mM), all at pH 5.5 [

The effect of THP on the transient component was much larger in hASIC3 vs rASIC3 (5.5-fold at pH 5.5), such interspecies variation may be due to a baseline difference in the half-maximal pH for activation of the transient current, rASIC3 = pH 7.20 and hASIC3 = pH 7.67 [

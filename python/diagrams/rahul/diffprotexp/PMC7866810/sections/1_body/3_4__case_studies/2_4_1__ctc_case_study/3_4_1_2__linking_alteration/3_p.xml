<p>Both pseudo-time ordering (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01399-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) and the heatmap portrayal of cell-to-cell distances, where cluster centers were ordered by hierarchic clustering (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01399-f004">Figure 4</xref>c), show a clear separation between Clusters 3 and 4. Based on the binomial differential expression, cells in Cluster 3 express significantly less 
 <italic>DGKD</italic> and 
 <italic>PTCRA</italic> but significantly more 
 <italic>KRT18</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01399-f004">Figure 4</xref>d,f). Interestingly, silencing the diacylglycerol kinase, delta (
 <italic>DGKD</italic>) has been validated to cause a condensed Golgi phenotype (Chia et al., 2012). The Pre T Cell Antigen Receptor Alpha (
 <italic>PTCRA</italic>) has recently been nominated as a biomarker in breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Keratin 18 (
 <italic>KRT18</italic>) was reported as significantly less expressed in all basal-like cell lines, which are highly aggressive compared with luminal cell lines [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Low 
 <italic>KRT18</italic> expression in breast cancer has been suggested to correlate with poor prognosis and to be a marker for epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT) [
 <xref rid="B86-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Elucidating the biological significance of these findings requires further experiments. However, we might speculate that the high 
 <italic>KRT18</italic> in Cluster 3 could indicate that cells in this cluster are at earlier stages of EMT and that these cells have a compact Golgi due to low 
 <italic>DGKD</italic>.

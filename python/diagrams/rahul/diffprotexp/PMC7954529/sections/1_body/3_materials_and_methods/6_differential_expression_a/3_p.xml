<p>We mapped on average 18.6 million reads to orthologous exons. We collapsed orthologous exons to quantify raw gene expression for each gene in each individual. We standardized counts and filtered out genes that did not pass the criteria of log
 <sub>2</sub>(CPM) values greater than 1 in 8 of the 12 individuals. To prepare counts for differential expression modeling, we used the Voom function with the quantile normalization method in the limma R package (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.98) (

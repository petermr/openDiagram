<p>KAc derives from acetyl-CoA, a substrate for protein acetylation, and is thus closely linked to central metabolism. In 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>, acetyl-CoA production is downstream of PFOR and the ferredoxin-based electron transport metabolism [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The PFOR metabolic node is perturbed by multiple mechanisms in MtzR lines (Fig.Â 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), which may influence acetyl-CoA availability and, in turn, KAc modifications [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As such, MtzR phenotypes with either increased production or decreased metabolism of acetyl-CoA may have more substrate available for higher rates of KAc in MtzR lines [
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Metabolite-linked increases in KAc rates and substrates have been observed in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, where addition of acetate increased the intracellular acetyl-CoA pool and downstream protein acetylation in rates of site occupancy, including for transcription factors and on histone variants [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. As such, our observed increase of KAc in MtzR lines could trace back to both redox-regulated enzymatic (Sir2) as well as altered metabolic (acetyl-CoA) sources. Measuring acetyl-CoA levels in MtzS and MtzR lines would provide insight into metabolic disruptions downstream of PFOR and pyruvate metabolism. However, additional information on KAc substrates is still required, as these may also occur on, and influence activity of, key redox proteins in MtzR.

<p>Natural killer cells are responsible for activating the cytotoxic killing effect in infections, mainly to defend against early infections by viruses [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], bacteria [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and parasites [
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The killing effect of NK cells on target cells depends on intracellular interaction of activated and inhibitory receptors on the cell surface [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. NKG7 (Natural killer cell granule protein 7) serves as an activating receptor for NK cells, which is associated with inflammatory diseases, since it could augment the production of inflammatory factors, including IFN-Î³, responsible for type I immune responses [
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, the expression of 
 <italic>NKG7</italic> was significantly higher in the CE-R group than in the CE-NR group, with a fold change of 7.65 (
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.38E-211, FDR: 1.04E-209). A current study by Ng (personal communication) showed that 
 <italic>NKG7</italic> was one of the most upregulated genes from the livers of mice infected with 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. Results indicated that NKG7 regulated the proinflammatory responses effectively, and the survival of the parasite was obviously affected [
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Given these reports, and the results of our study, we inferred that the high expression of 
 <italic>NKG7</italic> in CE-R sheep is beneficial for the host to activate NK cells and kill parasites, which is beneficial for CE resistance.

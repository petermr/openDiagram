 <caption> AS6 regulates DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis in MCF7 cells. ( A) Key DNA repair genes affected by AS6. RNA-seq data showing a markedly reduced expression of ATM, p53, and BRCA1 in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. Light grey, untreated control; light pink, 0.5 μM AS6-treated cells. n = 3; **P &lt; 0.005; ***P &lt; 0.0005. ( B) Real-time PCR data showing the expression of ATM, p53, and BRCA1 in AS6-treated HUMEC and MCF7 cells. ACTIN was used as a reference gene for a normalization. From left to right bars, untreated control HUMEC, 0.5 μM AS6-treated HUMEC, untreated control MCF7 cells, 0.5 μM AS6-treated MCF7 cells. n = 3; error bars show s.d.; **P &lt; 0.005; ***P &lt; 0.0001. ( C) Immunoblotting results showing a markedly reduced protein expression of ATM, p53, and BRCA1 in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. ACTIN was used as a loading control. Left, immunoblots; right, quantitative presentations of the signals, normalized with the control. AS6 concentrations in μM. Signal intensity of immunoblotting results throughout this manuscript was measured by Image J. Full-length blots were presented in Supplementary Fig.  S4A. ( D) Key cell cycle regulators affected by AS6. RNA-seq data showing a significantly reduced expression of CDC20, BUB1B, PLK1, CHEK1, CDK1, MCM4, and CDC25A in AS6-treated MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC. White, untreated control HUMEC; purple, 0.5 μM AS6-treated HUMEC; Light grey, untreated control MCF7 cells; light pink, 0.5 μM AS6-treated MCF7 cells. n = 3; *P &lt; 0.01; **P &lt; 0.001; ***P &lt; 0.0001; ****P &lt; 0.00001. ( E) Real-time PCR results confirming the reduced mRNA expression of CDC20, BUB1B, CHEK1, CDK1, and MCM4 in AS6-treated MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC. ACTIN was used as a reference gene for a normalization. From left to right bars, untreated control HUMEC, 0.5 μM AS6-treated HUMEC, untreated control MCF7 cells, 0.5 μM AS6-treated MCF7 cells. n = 3; error bars show s.d.; *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.005; ***P &lt; 0.0001. ( F) Immunoblotting results demonstrating a dramatically disrupted protein expression of critical cell cycle regulators CDC20, BUB1B, PLK1, CHEK1, MCM4, CDC25A, cyclin B1, and p21 in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. ACTIN was used as a loading control. Left, immunoblots; right, quantitative presentations of the immunoblotting signals, normalized with the loading control. AS6 concentrations in μM. Full-length blots were presented in Supplementary Fig.  S4B. ( G) Key apoptotic factors affected by AS6. Real-time PCR results of CASP9 showing its increased mRNA expression in MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC. ACTIN was used as a reference gene for a normalization. From left to right bars, untreated control HUMEC, 0.5 μM AS6-treated HUMEC, untreated control MCF7 cells, 0.5 μM AS6-treated MCF7 cells. n = 3; error bars show s.d.; *P &lt; 0.05. ( H) Immunoblotting showing a marked increase of HIF1α protein expression (left) and the quantification of the signal intensity (right) in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. ACTIN was used as a loading control. Full-length blots were presented in Supplementary Fig.  S4C. ( I) RNA-seq data of HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA expression in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. Light grey, untreated control; light pink, 0.5 μM AS6-treated cells. n = 3; **P &lt; 0.001; ***P &lt; 0.0001. ( J) Real-time PCR results validating the increased HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA expression in AS6-treated MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC. From left to right bars, untreated control HUMEC, 0.5 μM AS6-treated HUMEC, untreated control MCF7 cells, 0.5 μM AS6-treated MCF7 cells. n = 3; error bars show s.d.; **P &lt; 0.005; ***P &lt; 0.0001. ( K) Immunoblotting showing increased HSP70 and HSP90 protein expression (left) and the quantification of the signal intensity (right) in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. ACTIN was used as a loading control. Full-length blots were presented in Supplementary Fig. 4D. </caption>

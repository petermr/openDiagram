<p>IHC assay was performed as Ho et al recommended.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In brief, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and treated with ethanol in gradient concentration. The endogenous peroxidase was inactivated using PBS with 1% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 10 min, after which the sections were washed with PBS three times and incubated with 5% skim milk/PBS for 30 min to decrease non-specific binding. The sections were subsequently diluted with 5% skim milk/PBS and incubated with anti-PPP1R14B and Ki-67 antibodies for 16 h at 4°C. After being washed with PBS twice, the sections were detected by IHC detection system. 3, 3ʹ-diaminobenzidine liquid substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used for observation of specific immunostaining, followed by hematoxylin for counterstaining. Non-immune IgG in the same concentration was used as negative control. The information of all antibodies in the experiment was shown in

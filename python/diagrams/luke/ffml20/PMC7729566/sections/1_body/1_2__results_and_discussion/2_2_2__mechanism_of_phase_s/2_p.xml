 <sub>3</sub>COOH system in the absence of water, shown in

 <sub>3</sub> carboxylic dimer as the predominant short-range interactions (≤0.3 nm), stabilized by longer-range IL cation-anion electrostatic interactions. The shielded nature of the [P

 <sup>+</sup> phosphorus charge center liberates the chloride anion to closely interact with the carboxylic acid and limits short-range Coulombic contributions. Furthermore, significant dispersive interaction between acetic acid and the butyl chains of the [P

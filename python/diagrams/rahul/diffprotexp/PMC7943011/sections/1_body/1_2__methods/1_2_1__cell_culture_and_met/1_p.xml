 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] was cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM, 5.5 mmol/L glucose, equivalent to 100 mg/dL; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin G (Gibco) at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were subcultured by detachment with 0.25% (v/v) trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Gibco) once a week and the medium was changed every 2–3 days. Experiments were carried out in 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks (Greiner, Kremsmünster, Austria) with a seeding density of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells in 5 mL medium in duplicates. After seeding, cells were allowed to attach and grow for 24 h before treatment.

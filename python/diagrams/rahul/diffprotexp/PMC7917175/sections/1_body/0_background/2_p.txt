0: Prototypical cancer vaccines consist of a tumor antigen with/without an adjuvant, which reprograms the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells.
1: They have the advantages of relative non-toxicity, minimal non-specific effects, broad therapeutic window and induction of persistent immunological memory [ 13,  14].
2: Therefore, cancer vaccines can overcome the drug resistance, adverse reactions, limited therapeutic efficacy and high costs associated with standard chemo- and immunotherapies [ 13].
3: Based on the antigen form, cancer vaccines are classified into the peptide, tumor cell, dendritic cell, DNA and RNA types [ 15,  16].
4: However, the first four types have several disadvantages that limit their clinical potential.
5: For instance, development of personalized peptide vaccines require genetic analysis of the tumor, which is not possible for inoperable pancreatic cancer and may postpone the treatment [ 14,  15].
6: In addition, development of DC vaccines is time and resource consuming, and although they can trigger Th and CTL cells responses, the therapeutic efficacy is poor [ 15].
7: Tumor cell vaccines showed promising outcomes in preclinical models but failed in clinical trials [ 15].
8: Finally, DNA sequences can integrate into the tumor cell genome and cause insertional mutations, eventually neutralizing the therapeutic effect [ 17,  18].
9: In contrast, messenger RNA (mRNA) does not pose any risk of insertional mutagenesis since it cannot integrate into the genome.
10: It is also degraded by cellular RNases and therefore has a short and regulatable half-life in vivo, indicating good safety profile [ 16,  18,  19].
11: Furthermore, advances in sequence modification and carrier strategies have increased the in vivo stability, cellular uptake and expression of mRNA molecules [ 20 22].
12: In the context of clinical applications, mRNA vaccines can be manufactured in a cost-effective manner due to development of rapid in vitro transcription reactions.
13: Finally, mRNA sequences can be designed and modified to encode any pathological antigen [ 23], which is highly significant during a pandemic or for individualized therapies [ 18].
14: Therefore, mRNA vaccines are highly suitable for targeting tumor-specific antigens [ 14], and multiple preclinical and clinical trials have been initiated [ 18,  19].
15: For example, Sebastian et al.
16: reported that the RNActive vaccine CV9201 induced antigen-specific immune response in 65% (30/46) of stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer patients, and achieved stable disease in 31% evaluable patients and treatment-free survival of 5 stage IV patients for more than 1 year [ 17].
17: Likewise, Kubler et al.
18: demonstrated that CV9103 triggered an immune response in advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer patients and prolonged overall survival (OS) in a phase I/IIa study, and remained well-tolerated and immunogenic [ 24].
19: However, no mRNA vaccine against pancreatic cancer antigens has been developed so far, and no patient sub-population suitable for vaccination has been identified.

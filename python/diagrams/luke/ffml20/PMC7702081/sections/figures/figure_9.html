 <caption> Retardation factor of each water subpopulation. (A) Retardation factor for the reorientation relaxation time of the water subpopulations in the 2.81 mol kg −1 solution. Standard errors computed from the variations of block averages, each lasting 5 ps, using four different time origins. Inset: statistical approach used to classify bulk‐like and hydration water based on the Empirical Rule (68‐95‐99.7 rule): if the population of a statistical data set has a normal distribution with population mean and standard deviation ( σ), than about 99.7 % of the values lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. (B) Representation of the slow relaxation dynamics (red area) for the subpopulations of molecules in the first‐ or second shell of Mg 2+ and in first coordination shell of Cl −. </caption>

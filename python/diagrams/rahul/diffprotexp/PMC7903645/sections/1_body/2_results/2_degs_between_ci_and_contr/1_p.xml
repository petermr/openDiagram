<p id="Par42">The genome-wide transcriptome in blood samples was analyzed using RNA-Seq for 11 CI and 4 control samples. MDS was performed on gene expression data to determine the similarity pattern between the CI and control groups. The MDS plot showed that control samples were clearly distinguished from the CI samples and that the CI samples presented greater variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Thirty genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed between the CI and control groups (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05, fold-change ≥2) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Among these, 26 were significantly upregulated and 4 were downregulated in the CI group compared to those in the control group. The upregulated DEGs included neutrophil-mediated immunity-associated genes [DEFA3, CD177, JUN, ELANE, BPI (bactericidal permeability increasing protein), MMP8 (matrix metallopeptidase 8), and CEACAM8)], and bicarbonate transport-related genes [(CA1 (carbonic anhydrase 1), HBA1 (hemoglobin subunit alpha 1), SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4 member 1)]. To understand the underlying biological pathways that were differentially regulated between the two groups, we performed functional enrichment analysis. The DEGs were enriched in 23 terms in the category of biological processes, and bicarbonate transport, myeloid leukocyte activation, oxygen transport, neutrophil degranulation, and neutrophil activation were the most significantly enriched for the DEGs. Similarly, the DEGs were enriched in 23 terms in the cellular component category and 5 in the molecular function category (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–c). KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the most enriched pathways were malaria and African trypanosomiasis (Fig.

<p>In recent years, flexible displays have attracted considerable attention because of the low weight, high mobility, and their portable, wearable, and even foldable applications [

 <xref rid="B2-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Flexible active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) display is widely accepted as the most promising development trend for flexible displays technology, because they show low power consumption, faster response, and are more power efficient [

 <xref rid="B4-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nowadays, plastic films are widely used as substrates for flexible AMOLED, owing to their light weight, good flexibility, and excellent robustness [

 <xref rid="B6-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With the wide use of top-emitting architectures in flexible AMOLED, transparency is not a prerequisite for the substrates [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, to realize the application of plastic substrates in AMOLED, two key requirements should first be satisfied for the plastic films. One is the high gas barrier properties (WVTR &lt; 10
 <sup>−6</sup> g·m
 <sup>−2</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup> and OTR &lt; 10
 <sup>−5</sup> cm
 <sup>3</sup>·m
 <sup>−2</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup>), which can prevent the degradation of organic materials in the devices caused by the penetration of moisture and oxygen through the substrates [

 <xref rid="B9-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The other is the high thermal and dimensional stability. As the driven device, high-performance thin-film transistors (TFTs) are crucial for AMOLED displays. High processing temperature is significantly important for the performance improvement of TFTs [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The widely used low-temperature-poly-silicon (LTPS) TFTs require the plastic substrates to withstand process temperature of higher than 400 °C [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, high dimensional stability can prevent the substrates to shrink during the temperature cycles associated with the TFT fabrication, and guarantee good overlay alignment in the TFT array [
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, the plastic substrates are required to possess excellent thermal and dimensional stability (

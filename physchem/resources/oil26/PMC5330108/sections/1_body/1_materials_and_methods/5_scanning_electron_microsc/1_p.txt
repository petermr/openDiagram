0: The 24 h old fungal culture on PDB treated with MPE at varied concentrations of control, MIC and MFC were used for scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation.
1: The  F. sporotrichioides cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 30 min, washed with 0.1 M PBS, and dehydrated by immersing in ice-cold ethanol for 10 min.
2: The dehydrated samples were smeared on silver stub like a thin film and were coated by cathodic spraying (Polaron gold).
3: The SEM observations were made using a ZEISS Instrument (EHT = 15.00 kV, signal A = VPSE G3).

<p>Cells were harvested for RNA isolation using an RNeasy kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). Synthesis of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) was done using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect the presence of 8 alternative exons were developed using gene- and exon-specific PCR primers. Sequences, location of hybridization, and anticipated sizes of tested AS events are shown in 
 <xref rid="viruses-13-00218-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. After quantitation by SYBR Green, PCR products were size-fractionated in 2% agarose gel. The gel contained GelRed dye (10,000Ã— dilution) from Biotium (41003). The ladder was a 1 kb plus DNA ladder from Invitrogen (10787018). After photography, DNA bands were extracted using a Qiagen kit (28706). Purified DNA was subjected to Sanger sequencing for splice site validation.

<p id="Par14">A reverse coverage pattern was observed for TFs involved in somite differentiation. For PAX3, an important TF that regulates the myogenic programme and highly expressed during somite development, HINT-ATAC revealed an increase in the number of PAX3 footprints in ES open chromatin when compared to PSM. The number of PAX3 footprints increased further in MS and DS when compared to PSM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a–d</xref>) suggesting there is a greater coverage of bound sites in maturing and differentiating somites consistent with the role of PAX3 in myogenic progenitors in the dermomyotome. Another key somite TF, TWIST2 (also known as DERMO1), is important for EMT during somitogenesis. 
 <italic>TWIST2</italic> was highly expressed in the paraxial mesoderm and expression increased as somites differentiate (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>). The number of genome-wide TWIST2 footprints were very similar in PSM and ES (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref>), however, the number of footprints increased in MS and DS when compared to PSM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2g, h</xref>). Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) is a nuclear receptor, which acts as a transcriptional repressor in absence of ligand but a transcriptional activator when RA is present (see

 </sup> for review). RARA is highly expressed in somites (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3i</xref>). HINT-ATAC identified fewer RARA footprints in PSM compared to MS and DS (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3k, l</xref>).

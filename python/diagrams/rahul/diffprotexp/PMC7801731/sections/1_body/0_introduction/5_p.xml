 </sup>. The increasing number of cells in the distal part of the mesentery together with the possible deposition of new extracellular matrix (ECM), contribute to the rudiment growth. Therefore, about a week after evisceration, the intestinal rudiment can be clearly observed as a solid rod at the free margin of the mesentery. In histological sections the rudiment appears as an elongated thickening of the mesentery with many mesenchymal cells in the inner connective tissue surrounded by a dedifferentiated coelomic epithelium. Within two weeks, the lumen forms and the reconstitution of mucosal epithelium is achieved by the intrusion of tubular projections of the mucosal epithelium that migrate from anterior and posterior ends. It is important to highlight the role of the mesentery during all the intestinal regeneration process, since new cells originate from this structure as well as the extracellular signals that modulate the whole process

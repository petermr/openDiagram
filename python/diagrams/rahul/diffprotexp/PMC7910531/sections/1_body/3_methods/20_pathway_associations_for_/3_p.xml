 </sup>, separately for genes with higher or lower expression in high-grade compared to low-grade cartilage. We accounted for gene length (pwf function options ‘hg19' and ‘geneSymbol'). Significance was defined as a threshold of 5% FDR in each analysis. The results showed broad agreement with the results of the SPIA analysis (see Supplementary Note

<p id="Par11">A total of 128 proteins were found to be differentially regulated during the early stage of regeneration of gecko tail tissues for having a minimum of one log fold changes significantly (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). 36 and 33% of proteins were found to be upregulated for having &gt; 1 log fold change at 1 and 2-dpa with less than 10% proteins to be downregulated in the same points. Whereas 67% of proteins were found to be downregulated for the regeneration mechanism at 5-dpa with only one protein upregulated in the same time point. Haemoglobin subunit-β (HBB)

 </sup>, Annexin A2, Cathepsin B, Mimecan (OGN), galectin (LGALS3) were few of the proteins upregulated at 1-dpa and subsequently downregulated at 2 and 5-dpa. Polyubiquitin-C (UBC), MYLPF, PVALB, LAP3 and MYH are few of the proteins upregulated at 2-dpa and MYH7 found to be upregulated at 5-dpa. A total of 37 proteins which were differentially regulated at the proteome level were also found to be differentially regulated at gene level based on the transcriptomics analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b,d). Like transcriptome expression pattern, proteome expressions were also found to be associated with regeneration by clustering of 2 and 5-dpa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). DES and NEB were the 2 genes/proteins which was identified from the transcriptomics and proteomic analysis were validated involving RTPCR analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). All the proteins which were upregulated at 1-dpa were found to be downregulated either at 2 or 5-dpa. Similarly, all the 1-dpa downregulated proteins were found to be upregulated at 2 or 5-dpa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e).

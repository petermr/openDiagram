  <title>Clustered heatmap of proteins with a significantly regulated expression profile in the plasma of 
   <italic>Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos</italic> snails after infection with 
   <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>The relative expression of plasma proteins at 24, 48 and 96 hpi of infected snails were compared against the control group (uninfected snails). Proteins were grouped into 7 different categories based on GO annotation and clustering was performed using Euclidean distances based on the expression patterns. Color intensity reflects the corresponding log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change and significant up-regulation shown in red, significant down-regulation is shown in blue, and no statistically significant change in abundance is shown in gray.

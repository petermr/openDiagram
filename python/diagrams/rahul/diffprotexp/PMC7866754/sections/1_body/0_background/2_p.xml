<p id="Par6">Unfortunately, both vaccines and treatment options with drugs are limited due to the biological complexity of the Apicomplexan parasites [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The complexity arises from the highly regulated life cycles that allow them to inhabit different hosts and intracellular niches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To tackle this challenge, multi-omics data including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets have been produced to understand the biological processes underlying infection and disease causation, which can potentially be targeted with drug design [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, these studies are often conducted in silos and, therefore, their insights are limited due to the lack of consistency [

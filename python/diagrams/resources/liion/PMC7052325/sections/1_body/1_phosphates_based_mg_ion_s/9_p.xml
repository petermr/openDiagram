<p>Despite the effort devoted to the development of phosphate-based Mg ion conductors, the progress is very limited and the ionic conductivity of Mg solid electrolyte based on MZP is never above 10
 <sup>−6</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at moderate temperature of 300°C. The aim to function well at room temperature is still far for phosphate-based ionic conductors. It seems that phosphate-based materials are not ideal candidates of solid Mg ion conductors and it is necessary to turn to novel Mg ion conductors.

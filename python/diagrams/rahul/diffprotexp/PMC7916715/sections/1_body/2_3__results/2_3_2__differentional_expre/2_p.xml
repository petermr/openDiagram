<p>By using the GEPIA2 database [
 <xref rid="B40-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], we demonstrated TMEM45B upregulation in all three iCluster PCs compared to prostate tissues, C1orf106 downregulation in iCluster 1 and iCluster 2 PCs compared to prostate tissues, NANS increase in iCluster 1 PCs, and SRD5A3 upregulation in iCluster 2 PCs compared to prostate tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). PCs within iCluster 1 are featured with ETV1 and ETV4 fusion, SHOP mutations, FOXA1 mutations, and CHD1 deletion, but lack ERG fusion [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. iCluster 2 PCs are enriched with ERG fusion and PTEN deletion [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. iCluster 3 PCs contain ERG fusion [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. TP53 hetero-deficiency and RB1 deletion occur more frequently in iCluster 1 and iCluster 2 PCs [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Advanced PCs (GS â‰¥ 8) are much more common in iCluster 1 and iCluster 2 compared to iCluster 3 [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], suggesting that PCs in iClusters 1 and 2 are more aggressive than those in iCluster 3. This concept indicates an association of the 10 LE genes with PC progression.

 <p>This study provides deep insight into the adsorption process of doxorubicin onto different types of carbon nanotubes that have been proved to show attractive properties as a drug delivery system. The main aim of the work was to propose probable adsorption mechanisms and interactions between the anticancer drug and surface of modified and pristine carbon nanotubes at blood pH. The carbon nanotubes were oxidized to optimize the absorbance efficiency relative to that of pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The adsorption isotherm of the modified system was well described by the Temkin equation. It confirms that the adsorption in the system studied involves also hydrogen and covalent bonding and is exothermic in nature. The experimental kinetic curves of adsorption were fitted to different mathematical models to check if the kinetics of doxorubicin adsorption onto the modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes follows a pseudo-second-order model and the chemical sorption is bound to be the rate-limiting. On the basis of the molecular dynamics simulation, it was shown that 
  <italic>in vacuo</italic> the aggregation tendency of doxorubicin molecules is far more favorable than their adsorption on pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs). It suggests that only functionalization of the nanotube surface can affect the interaction between doxorubicin and functional groups of the carriers and increases the efficiency of the drug loading process.

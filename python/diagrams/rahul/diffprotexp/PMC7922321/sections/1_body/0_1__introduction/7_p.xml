<p>Gliomas can be broadly classified as diffuse and non-diffuse (circumscribed) gliomas. Diffuse gliomas, namely oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, exhibit similarities to glial precursors, and are identified and categorized based on the WHO classification of CNS tumors [

Due to their rather heterogeneous nature, the reproducibility in diagnosis of low-grade (WHO grade II/III) diffuse gliomas can be a challenge. Several molecular markers, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations or telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations, which create ETS binding sites [

Previously, ETS gene status in clinical prostate tumor samples has been determined, and ERG+ and ETV1/4/5+ cases were found to be associated with worse prognosis, indicating that ETS status may act as a prognostic biomarker and be used in combination with other existing molecular determinants [
 <xref rid="B29-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we have analyzed microarray data from patients with different grades of glioma for relative expression of ETS genes, and identified different ETS genes that are upregulated at different glioma grades. We show that, while ETV1 is expressed at high levels in grade 2 glioma, its expression gradually decreases with glioma stage, and on the other hand, ELK3 and ETV4 expressions are increased with progression of the glioma stage. Furthermore, both ELF4 and ETV6 expressions are downregulated at grade 2 glioma, but upregulated at increasing levels in grades 3 and 4, indicating that these genes can also be utilized as additional molecular determinants to distinguish glioma grades. We further compare these data to microarray results from Elk-1-VP16 or PEA3-VP16 overexpression SH-SY5Y cells in order to narrow down transcriptional regulons, and identify common and unique transcriptional regulatory networks for these ETS proteins.

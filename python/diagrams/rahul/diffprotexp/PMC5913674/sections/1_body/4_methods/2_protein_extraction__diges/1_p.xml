<p>Trophozoite cultures for protein extraction were generated as previously described [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, trophozoites were seeded at a number normalized to growth rate in order to achieve equivalent final cell numbers in t25 flasks (Falcon), followed by decanting of media and unattached and nonviable trophozoites. Adherent trophozoites were then harvested by chilling trophozoites in fresh, complete TYI-S33 media on wet ice before collection by centrifugation. Total protein, RNA [

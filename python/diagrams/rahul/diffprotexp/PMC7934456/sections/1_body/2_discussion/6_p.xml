<p id="Par35">Similarly, the electron transport respiratory chain disorder and disrupted ATP synthase complex function have been found in the Petunia CMS Connett, wild G-CMS beets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and sunflower CMS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. These previous findings showed an association between the CMS protein and the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex. For example, in rice CMS lines, the sterility genes 
 <italic>orf79</italic> and 
 <italic>orfH79</italic> caused decreased ATP/ADP ratio and increased reactive oxygen species in anthers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We found that the rapid division of mitochondrial genes during anther development may lead to mitochondrial function defects, leading to insufficient energy supply for male organ development and triggering abortion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. All the above information indicates that extreme energy insufficiency in mitochondria is the only possible cause of CMS, but the mechanism that triggers unfunctional pollen is still not entirely understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Researchers cogitated that the CMS protein binds to specific mitochondrial proteins in some way to achieve this effect, but no relevant candidate proteins have been found. Among our differential candidate genes, we also found electron transfer chain-related proteins and energy transfer-related proteins that interact with restorer genes, which may cause CMS and restorer of fertility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; however, further research and more scientific evidence are needed to confirm the current hypothesis.

0: The gas chromatography (GC) mass selective (MS) analysis of the essential oils was performed using a HewlettPackard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph, fitted with a fused silica HP  5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, in thickness 0.25 m).
1: The oven temperature varied from 40250 C with the scanning rate of 3 C/min.
2: Helium (purity 5.6) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3: The GC was equipped with HewlettPackard 5972 Series MS detector.
4: The MS operating parameters were ionization voltage 70 eV and ion source temperature 250 C. The diluted samples of essential oils (1/100, v/v in HPLC methanol) of 1 L had been injected manually.
5: To avoid overloading the GC column, the essential oils were diluted 1:100 (v/v) in methanol.
6: The identification of peaks was tentatively carried out based on library search using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-2013.
7: Relative Retention Index (RRI) was calculated for HP-5MS column.
8: For RRI calculation a mixture of homologues  n-alkanes (C9-C18) was used under the same chromatographic conditions as for analysis of the essential oils.

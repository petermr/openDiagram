<p>In order to accurately compare spot quantities of the two samples, the volume of each protein spot was normalized and automatically calculated by the software as a single spot volume. After normalization and background subtraction, the matched sets were created for all the samples. A quantitative table with all the normalized optical spot volumes was generated in this software for subsequent statistic analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA, Version 6.12, SAS Institute), Duncan parametric test, was employed to test the statistic significance of the differentially expressed proteins (2 fold changes) in all gels. A probability of

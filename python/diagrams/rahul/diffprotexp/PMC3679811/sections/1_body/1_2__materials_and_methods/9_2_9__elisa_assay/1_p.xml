<p>Each peritoneal dialysate sample was analyzed for the concentrations of APOA1 (E-80AP1, Immunology Consultants Laboratory), alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin preproprotein (AMBP) (E90217Hu, Uscn Life Science Inc.), mutant retinol-binding protein (RBP4) (E90929Hu, Uscn Life Science Inc.), and haptoglobin (HP) (E-80HPT, Immunology Consultants Laboratory) in duplicate, using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The protein concentrations were tested by standard protocols, according to the suggestion of the manufacturers. The model of ELISA reader was Multiskan EX, which was made by Thermo Scientific (Vantaa, Finland). Statistical significance was determined by using the two-tailed Fisher exact test at

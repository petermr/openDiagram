0: Garlic essential oil efficacy was determined by calculating the lethal concentrations (LC 50, and LC 90) values under laboratory conditions and conducted in triplicate.
1: Six concentrations of garlic essential oil besides the control (acetone) were adjusted in 1 mL of stock solution (essential oil and acetone): 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32% (w/v).
2: Aliquots were taken from the stock solution and mixed with acetone in 5 mL glass vials.
3: Different concentrations of the garlic essential oil were applied in 1 uL solution on the thorax of larva, pupa and adult of  T. molitor, using a micropipette.
4: For each developmental stage, fifty insects were used per concentration and were placed individually in Petri dishes ( 90 mm  15 mm) with an absorbent paper, fed with chayote and sugarcane  ad libitum (larvae and adults) and maintained in the dark.
5: The number of dead insects was in each cage was counted after essential oil exposure for 48 h after application.
6: Rates were calculated with a correction for natural mortality 57.

<p id="Par13">Regarding the liver, we identified 2,989 DC pairs (2319 unique genes) that included 56 DEGs and 23 TFs (
 <italic>q</italic> ≤ 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The top five hub genes among the 27 identified included: 
 <italic>PGAP3, B3GNT4, MARVELD1, BCAM</italic>, and 
 <italic>NIT1</italic>. The 
 <italic>PGAP3</italic> gene stood out as the main DC gene with 11 DEGs. These pairs were classified as positively correlated in the RES group and negative or not significant in the CON group (−/+ or 0/+) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Additionally, the 
 <italic>ZNF175, HSF1, and HSF2</italic> TFs were among the hubs.

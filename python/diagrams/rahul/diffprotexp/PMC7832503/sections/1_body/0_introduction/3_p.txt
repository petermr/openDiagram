0: Multiple immunity-related candidate genes have been identified to be risk factors of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, including  CCR5,  KIR,  IFTIM3,  IGHG2 [ 13].
1: The most widely studied is the  IFITM3 gene, which has been shown to play a role in restricting influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo experiments [ 14, 15].
2: Polymorphisms on  IL-6,  TLR3,  SFTPB,  TNF,  ST3GAL1 and  GLDC genes have also been found to be associated with increased risk of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease severity [ 1621].
3: In addition, several small-scale genome wide association studies have reported a number of novel susceptibility genes of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outcomes [ 12, 2224].
4: Unfortunately, most of these results of the association between specific genetic loci and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease severity are yet to be validated with enough power or repeatable evidences [ 25].
5: In general, an understanding of the host genetic contributions on severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is still limited.
6: A more comprehensive efficient study about host genetic background is required to detect the severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

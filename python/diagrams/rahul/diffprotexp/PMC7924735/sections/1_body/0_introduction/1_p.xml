<p>Cysticercosis is a parasitic disease that affects humans and swine. It is caused by the establishment of the larval form of 
 <italic>Taenia solium</italic> in skeletal muscle and brain tissues. When cysticerci are established in the central nervous system of the host, they cause neurocysticercosis (NC). This potentially life-threatening disease is endemic in rural areas of Latin America, Southeast Asia (India, China, and Nepal) and sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty prevails and hygiene is poor [

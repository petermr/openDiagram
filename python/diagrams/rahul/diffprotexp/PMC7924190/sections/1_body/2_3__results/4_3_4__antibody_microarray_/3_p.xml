<p>Further, we also performed ShinyGO [
 <xref rid="B34-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using differentially expressed up- and downregulated genes and proteins based on the data from both arrays. Graphical representations of enriched biological processes and pathways are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00299-f006">Figure 6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00299-f007">Figure 7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00299-f008">Figure 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00299-f009">Figure 9</xref>. We observed enrichment of 9 similar biological processes and 9 similar pathways in both arrays, confirming activation of similar cellular events at both the gene and protein levels following AC EF stimulation. Further, in comparison to the gene array data, protein array data showed enrichment of more activated pathways through several interconnecting networks.

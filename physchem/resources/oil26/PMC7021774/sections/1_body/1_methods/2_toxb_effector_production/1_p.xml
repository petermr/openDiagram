<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par8">ToxB protein was heterologously expressed via an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> SHuffle strain and purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) as described in See et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). Briefly, the DNA sequence that encodes the mature ToxB protein (GenBank accession PZD27634) (Martinez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>) was cloned into the pET21a(+) (Novagen) vector using the primers ToxB-sigP_F (5&#8242;-GGAATTC<underline>CATATG</underline>AACTGCGTCGCCAATAT-3&#8242;) and ToxB_R (5&#8242;-CCG<underline>CTCGAG</underline>ACAACGTCCTCCACTTTGCA-3&#8242;) that included the engineered <italic>NdeI</italic> and <italic>XhoI</italic> sites (underlined), respectively. The resulting construct contained the predicted ToxB protein fused to a poly-histidine tag at the C-terminal, and was used to transform the <italic>E. coli</italic> SHuffle strain. The SHuffle strain harbouring the ToxB expression construct was grown in Terrific Broth medium and induced with &#946;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 100&#160;&#181;M for the expression of ToxB. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 5&#160;ml binding buffer (20&#160;mM sodium phosphate, 40&#160;mM imidazole, 500&#160;mM NaCl, pH 7.4) for the purpose of downstream his-tag purification. Cells were then lysed using sonication of 10-s pulses with 10-s intervals for 1&#160;min (Sonoplus HD 3100, Bandelin, Germany). The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the ToxB protein was purified from the cell extract using HisPur Ni-NTA purification spin columns (Thermo Scientific) by gravity flow according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Purified protein was dialysed in 20&#160;mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, quantified via the bicinchoninic acid assay (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1985</xref>) and stored in freeze-dried form at &#8722;&#160;80&#160;&#176;C. Prior to infiltration, protein was resuspended in sterile water to a concentration of 200&#160;&#181;g/ml.</p>

<p>Skin tissue were lysed in 350 ml Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 5 ng of RNA by using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Bio- systems, Foster City, CA, USA) following manufacturer protocols. SYBR green assays were designed to span intron/exon boundaries. Oligonucleotides were aligned against the mouse genome by Primer-BLAST (

Gene expression was assayed in triplicate using 1/40 of the cDNA template and 300 nM of forward and reverse primers in a 20 l Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reaction in a StepOne-Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to mouse GAPDH gene expression. Relative expression values were calculated using the DDC

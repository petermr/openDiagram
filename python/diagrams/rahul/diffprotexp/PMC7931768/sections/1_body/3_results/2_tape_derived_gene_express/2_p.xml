<p>To visualise a summary of gene expression of a panel of 94 candidate immune genes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S7</xref>) for each participant, we plotted tape-derived gene expression along the first two principal components (PCs; PC1, x-axis; PC2, y-axis) representing the largest variance in the dataset. Each component is a linear combination of 94 immune genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). Compared with samples from CLE-U and HVs, CLE-A were shifted forward on the x-axis of PC1, accounting for 60% of the total variance in the dataset. Within disease groups, CLE-A and CLE-U were separated from one another (

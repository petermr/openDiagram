<p>For 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS studies of electrochemical processes, the catalyst is usually deposited on conducting carbon-based electrodes, which do not interfere with the data acquisition. The background from the carbon support to the XAS data is practically negligible, especially in the experiments within the hard X-ray regime. This constitutes an important advantage of the XAS method in comparison to other spectroscopies employed for studies of electrocatalysts. At the same time, the presence of an electrolyte layer in direct contact with the catalyst surface cannot be ignored. For example, a larger volume of the experimental cell may be beneficial for ensuring realistic experimental conditions, pH levels, distributions of reactants, and reaction products. A thick layer of electrolyte will, however, attenuate and scatter a significant fraction of the X-rays, hindering the XAS data acquisition. Moreover, bubble formation in the electrolyte in the case of electrochemical reactions at electrodes can result in significant noise problems in the experimental data.

<p id="p0010">About 300 000 new cases of thyroid cancer are recorded globally each year [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thyroid cancer is also the fifth most common cancer in women [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and it can move to the fourth place during the next decade [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thyroid cancer is a common term for several heterogenous malignancies of thyroid gland, and its clinical manifestation, treatment and prognosis are generally defined by specific tumor subtypes. There are three main types of cells from which thyroid cancers are derived: follicular thyroid cells, Hurthle cells, and parafollicular C cells [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The most common subtypes of thyroid cancer are follicular thyroid cell-derived tumors, including papillary thyroid cancer (PC), follicular thyroid cancer (FC), and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, a small proportion of thyroid malignancies belongs to parafollicular C cell-derived medullary thyroid cancer (MC) [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Molecular characterization of thyroid cancer subtypes can partially solve the problem of understanding specific carcinogenesis mechanisms and selecting appropriate treatments.

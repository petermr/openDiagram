<p>Three pooled samples of the control, CAA and CAD groups, were subjected to iTRAQ. As presented in 
 <xref rid="f2-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, MS analysis was performed twice using the iTRAQ technique to ensure that reliable results were obtained; 392 and 389 proteins were identified as a result of the two independent experiments. In total, 301 proteins overlapped in the two experiments and were considered the final accurate detected, high-quality proteins for the differential expression analysis. A threshold change of 1.5-fold was established to identify differentially expressed proteins in comparisons between CAD and control samples or CAA and control samples. For comparisons between CAD and control samples, 37 upregulated proteins and 50 downregulated proteins were identified as differentially expressed. For comparisons between CAA and control samples, the numbers of upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed proteins were 33 and 32, respectively (

<p id="Par67">Other key components of MAPK-signaling showed oscillatory patterns of gene expression throughout MN formation and maturation. Gene transcripts of 
 <italic>KIT</italic> and its ligand, 
 <italic>KITLG</italic>, which function in stem cell maintenance, were upregulated in NSCs (D7) and downregulated during the transition from MNP to eMN (D13-D18). 
 <italic>KITLG</italic> transcription was again upregulated in MNs (D18â€“28). KIT signaling promotes cell survival through the activation of PIK3, PLC, and AKT1 pathways and we detected upregulation of 
 <italic>KITLG</italic> gene expression in MNs which may be a response to the addition of IGF-1 in the culture media. Upregulation of various genes regulating cell survival and proliferation in the post-mitotic MN, such as 
 <italic>KDR</italic>, 
 <italic>PTPRR</italic>, 
 <italic>PTPN5</italic>, and 
 <italic>PRKCB</italic>, further exemplifies the MN response to IGF-1 pro-survival stimulus.

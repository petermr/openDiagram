0: Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) represent about 1020% of all intracranial neoplasms in adults.
1: They may arise from various kinds of secretory cells of pituitary gland, including corticotroph cells, which produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
2: Corticotroph PitNETs commonly cause ACTH-dependent Cushings disease (CD); however, a notable proportion of tumors originated from corticotropic pituitary cells are endocrinologically non-functioning and classified as silent corticotroph tumors commonly referred to as silent corticotroph adenomas (SCA).
3: Both active and silent corticotroph PitNETs share a similar molecular profile [ 1, 2].

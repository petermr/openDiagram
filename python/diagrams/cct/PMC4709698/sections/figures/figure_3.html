 <caption> Schematic illustrations of the two-phase quasi-equilibrium. ( a) Schematic binary phase diagram. The green solid lines represent the equilibrium liquidus line, the solution limit of β-Ti and the eutectic line. The left two red dashed lines describe the beginning stage at which β-Ti or other crystalline phases begin to precipitate in the undercooled melt at the cooling rate representing the ingot with a weight of 100 g. β-Ti begins to precipitate as the melt is cooled down and intersects the red dashed lines, and the composition of β-Ti is . It is slightly richer in solute (Cu and Co) than its equilibrium composition (the far right green line). For higher cooling rates, the degree of undercooling increases 39 and thus the red dashed lines shift to lower temperatures. As the fraction of β-Ti increase, the compositions of both phases change from to . When the quasi-equilibrium is established between the (undercooled) liquid and β-Ti, the compositions of both phases change along the liquidus and the solution limit of β-Ti (green lines) from to . ( b) Schematic continuous cooling transformation curves (CCT) for BT48. The β-Ti begin curve ( T n –line), the two-phase quasi-equilibrium curve ( T e –line), and the crystallization TTT curve of BT0 are drawn between their T l and T g , respectively. ( ) are DSC measured times before crystallization of BT0 plus (2000 K-990 K)/(1 K s −1). The cooling curves starting from 2000 K are indicated by the different sample diameters (calculated from equation (2)). Phases in regions with different colours are: I, liquid; II, liquid + β-Ti (non-equilibrium compositions, changeable microstructure); III, liquid + β-Ti (equilibrium compositions, changeable microstructure); IV, supercooled liquid + β-Ti (non-equilibrium compositions, unchangeable microstructure); V, supercooled liquid + β-Ti (quasi-equilibrium compositions, unchangeable microstructure); VI, non-equilibrium BMGCs; VII, quasi-equilibrium BMGCs; VIII, crystallized matrix + β-Ti. If cooling curves intersect T e –line (not crystallization curve of BT0), quasi-equilibrium BMGCs will be achieved, otherwise, non-equilibrium BMGCs will be obtained. The sketches of thermodynamic views are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. </caption>

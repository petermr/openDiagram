<p id="Par26">HTR-8/SVneo cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a black clear-bottomed 96-well plate and allowed to acclimate for 24 h. Cells were treated with medium alone (control) or DCVC (10 or 20 µM) for 6 or 12 h. Protein synthesis was measured with a Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacture’s recommended protocols. This assay utilizes cell-permeable O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP), which halts the translation of polypeptide chains by incorporating into the C-terminus. Briefly, cells were incubated with OPP solution for 2 h at 37 °C, fixed, and incubated with FAM-Azide solution (FAM-Azide, copper sulfate and ascorbic acid) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. After incubation, protein synthesis was measured fluorescently (excitation: 485 nm; emission 535 nm) using a SpectraMax M2e Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA, USA).</p>

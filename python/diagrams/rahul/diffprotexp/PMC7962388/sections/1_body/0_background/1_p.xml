<p id="Par46">Apomixis (i. e., agamospermy) is an asexual mode of plant reproduction via seeds, which generates progenies consisting of exact genetic replicas of the mother plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This puzzling trait occurs in at least 326 angiosperm genera, with no clear tendency to any specific group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The apomictic and sexual developmental pathways are strongly related, since both take place within the ovule and involve common developmental features [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Traditionally, the asexual route was considered to be a deviation from the sexual one, repeatedly emerging during evolution from genetic or epigenetic mutations derived from polyploidization and/or hybridization events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. More recently, apomixis and sexuality were hypothetically classified as ancient polyphenic traits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. According to the latter view, the switching from one phenism to the other would be environmentally triggered by epigenetic mechanisms, with full sexual genera/species having lost the capacity to carry on this transition due to deleterious (epi)mutations affecting the molecular switch that connects both pathways [

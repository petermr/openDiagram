<p>In the differentially expressed mRNAs, there were 470 genes that exhibited an FC that was &gt;1. The number of downregulated mRNAs was 239, whereas the number of upregulated mRNAs was 231. The most upregulated mRNAs were Tfdp1, Map2, Cep19, Aurkaip1, Tpbg, Myef2, Ap2m1, Tgfbr1, Fgf12 and Mef2c. The most downregulated mRNAs were Frs3, Zfp523, Tpm4, Apold1, Ctnnb1, Lss, Psen2, Dnajc6, Nedd4l and Tep1. Detailed information regarding the differentially expressed mRNAs is listed in

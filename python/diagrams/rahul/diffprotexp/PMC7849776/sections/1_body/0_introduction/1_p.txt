0: Staphylococcus aureus expresses a plethora of virulence factors to invade, thrive, and multiply within the host  1, 2.
1: As a human-commensal and an opportunistic pathogen, it is responsible for several infectious diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening endocarditis [ 3].
2: Moreover, the spread of multi-drug resistant  S. aureus strains has challenged the treatments, thus warranting novel therapeutic options [ 410].
3: It is crucial to understand the pathogen, its weapons, and host-pathogen interactions to develop novel therapeutics.
4: One way of combating infections is to disarm the pathogen from its virulence factors, rendering it less pathogenic, which helps the host immunity expel the pathogen quickly.
5: In this sense, exploring the mechanism of virulence regulation will enhance the understanding of pathogenesis and host-pathogen interaction.
6: To identify the  S. aureus virulence factors and the genes responsible for pathogenicity, we performed screening using a silkworm infection model.
7: Over the past years, we have identified several  S. aureus virulence factors that are involved in both the silkworm and mice virulence [ 1114].

 <caption> GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes for glioma grades. Each glioma grade was clustered as up- and downregulated gene clusters. ( A). GO and ( B). KEGG analysis were performed by clusterProfiler with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. The gene ratio indicates the number of genes enriched with a corresponding GO or KEGG term among the total gene number introduced into the enrichme.nt analysis. </caption>

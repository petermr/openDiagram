 <caption>
  <p>An illustration of a starting simulation structure. The ribosome (transparent cartoon), ERY (red), and nascent chain (cyan) are shown. The black arrow indicates the pulling direction applied to the N-terminal residue of the nascent chain in the SMD simulations. The arrow also lies along the long axis of the ribosome exit tunnel. “Exit” denotes the exit side of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Proteomics is the science of studying protein composition and alterations in cells, tissues, and organisms. Proteomics is widely used in basic and clinical medical research [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] for the identification of biomarkers [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], posttranslational protein modifications [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the regulation of signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Proteomics research of lung cancer has focused on the classification of lung cancer [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the correlation between protein and gene expressions [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], identification of new molecular targets [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the development of new drugs [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Early diagnostic markers for lung cancer [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have been identified, but the markers still lack accuracy and sensitivity. Therefore, exploration and discovery of reliable and sensitive markers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer are a research priority.

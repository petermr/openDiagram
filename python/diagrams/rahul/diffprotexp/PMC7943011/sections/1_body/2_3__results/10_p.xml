<p>Likewise, analysis of cellular components after insulin treatment revealed that most regulated proteins belonged to extracellular space/regions (16–25) and were mainly constituents of the plasma membrane (5–11) or endosomes (8) (
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Molecular functions of the affected proteins included protein binding (30), growth-related functions (7–8), and adhesion (5). The biological processes of the regulated proteins were related to cell proliferation (11), particularly of B cells (5), and with involvement of the MAPK cascade (7) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling (5), cell adhesion, migration as well as angiogenesis (5–7), signal transduction (11), and immune responses (7). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis revealed a link to PI3K/AKT signaling (9), proteoglycans (8), focal adhesion (7), hematopoiesis (5), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) signaling in a hyperinsulinemic environment.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Phylogenetic analyses utilizing both molecular and morphological data indicate that large bodies independently evolved in hyraxes, sea cows, and elephants (Paenungulata). Unfortunately, without genomes from the largest hyrax and sirenian species (such as <italic>Titanohyrax</italic> and Stellar&#8217;s sea cow) we cannot know whether gene duplications in these lineages are also enriched for tumor suppressor functions. Thus, our use of available genomes and duplication inference methods cannot address the question of convergent molecular changes underlying convergence in large bodies.</p>

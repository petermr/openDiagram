 <xref rid="Sch2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the new method of Li-ion electrode fabrication. An adequate volume of the aqueous solution that contains cellulose fibers (1 g FB/L) is placed in a beaker; typically, a volume that corresponds to 30 mg of FB is employed. Thereafter, 10 mg of VGCF, VGCF–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H, or VGCF–COOH is dispersed into the solution. They are all stirred using an ultrasonic rod. The modified VGCF powders are instantly solubilized in water, whereas at least 10 min is necessary to disperse the commercial VGCF. After a homogeneous solution is obtained, the content is vacuum-filtered on a 47-mm diameter size nylon membrane with a 0.22-μm pore to form the carbon current collector; a typical carbon current collector is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The film where a mass of electrode active material (LFP, PTCDA, graphite, or LTO) in the range 40–70 mg is dispersed in deionized water is allowed to dry for 10 min. This is followed by the addition of 10 mg of carbon, which could be modified or unmodified VGCF, Denka, CNT, or a mixture of these three. In all cases, the modified LFP and carbons are easily and more rapidly dispersed in water, thus leading to a better film appearance. After mixing, the solution is gently poured on the as-prepared carbon current collector to form the electrode. The film is peeled off the filter to obtain the self-standing Li-ion electrode. The electrode is thereafter calendered at room temperature, i.e., 50 or 80 °C. The produced film is placed in a vacuum oven and heated at 130 °C for at least 1 day before it is utilized in the battery. Figure

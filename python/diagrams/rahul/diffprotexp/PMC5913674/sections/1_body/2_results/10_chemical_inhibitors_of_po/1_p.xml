<p>Four broad-spectrum chemical inhibitors of PTM networks were compared in MtzS and MtzR lines: deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), broad-spectrum methyltransferase inhibitor chaetocin, kinase inhibitor staurosporine, and phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A. In addition to chaetocin, all other inhibitors have been previously verified for activity in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The dose–response curves, IC
 <sub>50</sub>, and resistance factors in MtzR lines for the 4 inhibitors are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>. Staurosporine, calyculin A, and TSA were all highly effective against 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>, with wild-type parent IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;1μM. Chaetocin, however, was only slightly effective against 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>. Of the 4 inhibitors, all MtzR lines had significant increases in IC
 <sub>50</sub> to TSA compared to their MtzS parents (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, panel A), indicating Mtz resistance correlated with cross-resistance to TSA [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, panel A), with TSA resistance factors ranging from +4.8 to +7.5 in MtzR lines compared to MtzS parents.

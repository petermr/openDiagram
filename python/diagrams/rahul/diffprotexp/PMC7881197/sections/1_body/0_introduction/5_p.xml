 </sup>. Two recent studies indicated that AS6 induces apoptosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and autophagy in colon cancers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Using targeted approaches, the studies suggested that AS6 induces cell death through effects on the p38 MAPK pathways in a colon cancer cell line, SW620 cells
 <sup>

 </sup>. Another study reported that AS6 inhibits NF-κB to stimulate TNF-α-induced cell death in MCF7 cells

 </sup>. In spite of these efforts, the effects and anticancer mechanisms of AS6 on human cells are not completely understood and require unbiased approaches to identify them. In addition, it is important to determine whether AS6 differentially affects normal and cancerous cells and to what extent.

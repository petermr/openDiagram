<p>To explore whether miRNAs participate in LINC00466-mediated glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and sensitivity to TMZ treatment, we conducted a differential analysis using the miRNA expression profile from TCGA-GBM/LGG and used miRcode database to predict the miRNAs regulated by LINC00466. The target miRNA of miR-137 was obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3A</xref>). miR-137 expression was significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">C</xref>). Dual-luciferase Reporter gene assay showed that miR-137-mimic inhibited the luciferase activity of LINC00466-WT, while had no influence on LINC00466-MUT, suggesting there was a targeted relationship between miR-137 and LINC00466 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, we detected the effects of LINC00466 overexpression on the expression level of miR-137 in T98G and A172 cell lines, showing that miR-137 was significantly decreased in cells upon overexpression of LINC00466 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3F</xref>). Taken together, these findings displayed that LINC00466 could serve as a sponge to bind with miR-137.

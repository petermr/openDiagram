<p>We agree that it was somewhat surprising that the P0 DE signatures were weaker at the gene level compared to the other time-points. This result does not appear to be due to our experimental approach, since the P0 time-point was based on similar sample numbers, sex distribution, batch complexity similar, sequencing depth, and general quality metrics as for the other time-points in our study. In our original manuscript, we speculated that the reduced signature at P0 supports that the significant DE signatures at the earlier time-points reflect transient perturbation at the transcriptional level. As we found strong reproducible relationships between DE signatures at E12.5 and E14.5 and between E14.5 and E17.5, we believe that the MIA signatures of these time-points are unlikely to be false positives. As noted in the review, we agree with the possibility that some unknown technical issue or that general increased biological variability could both reduce the power to detect P0 DE in our experiments. Pursuing the time course approach beyond P0 in future work will be useful to understand the continuing effects, but such further investigation is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We updated the relevant sentence in the Discussion to incorporate suggestions made in the reviewer critique:</p>

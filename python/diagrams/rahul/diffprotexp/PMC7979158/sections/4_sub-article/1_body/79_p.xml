<p>“For cell counting, boxes were drawn on specific areas of the neocortex for progenitor and mitosis markers; SOX2, SOX9 and PH3. This box was 300 x 300 pixels on an image of the neocortex obtained using a 20x objective. To be consistent, the ventral aspect of the box was drawn along the VZ and one corner touched the medial aspect of the VZ. The same strategy was used to draw boxes from Ki67 images except the box was increased in size to 500 x 500 pixels to account for the additional Ki67+ cells seen in neocortical areas above the SVZ. SOX9 boxes were drawn along the dorsal border edge (600 pixels in width) of the neocortex and extended ventrally two thirds the length of the neocortex in order to avoid the VZ/SVZ region. For laminar zone counts, a box spanning 300 pixels was drawn along the VZ and the dorsal/ventral proportions were equally divided into 3 zones. These box sizes allowed for a sufficient number of cells to be counted from each tissue. Laminar thickness analyses were performed by measuring the spread of all positive cells within the cortical plate per individual marker. For all quantification analyses, 1-3 sections per brain utilizing the developing hippocampus as a landmark for positioning were used.”</p>

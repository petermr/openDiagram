 <attrib>(A) Schematic diagram illustrating experimental workflow of MEFs undergoing adipocyte differentiation in-vitro. Conditions include treated (+) condition with differentiation media (DM) and non-treated condition (-) in growth media (GM) from day 0 (D0) till day 3 (D3). Cells were further grown two more days (D5) following treatments. (B) ORO staining of represented timepoints; scales bar = 100 μm). (C) Quantitation of lipid accumulation based fold induction OD (514 nm) readings from ORO stains, illustrating MEFs at the binding timepoints D3(-)/D3(-) as well as D3(+)/D3(-) and later timepoints D5(-)/D5(-) as well as D5(+)D5(-) (n = 4; **P-Value&lt;0.01, ***P-Value&lt;0.001). (D) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 
  <italic>aP2</italic> (left chart), 
  <italic>Lpl</italic> (middle chart), and 
  <italic>Adipoq</italic> gene during corresponding timepoints based on mRNA fold induction level and represented in log2 scaled form (n = 4; **P-Value&lt;0.01, ***P-Value&lt;0.001, ****P-Value&lt;0.0001).

<p>In the next step, microstructural cross sections of the previously built wall structures with varied CTWD of 12 mm and 44 mm were taken from the middle of the 1st, 35th and 70th layer. Herein, microstructural evolution of low-alloyed steel G4Si1/SG3 is shown in dependence on differing cooling conditions during WAAM. The cross sections are shown in

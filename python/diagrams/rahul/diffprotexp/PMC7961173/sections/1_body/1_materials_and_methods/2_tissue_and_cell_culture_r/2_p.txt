0: The TCE metabolite  S-(1, 2-dichlorovinyl)- l-cysteine (DCVC) was synthesized as a powder by the University of Michigan Medicinal Chemistry Core according to published procedures (McKinney et al.
1: 1959).
2: Purity of 98.7% was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.
3: A stock solution of 1 mM DCVC was prepared by dissolving DCVC powder in PBS.
4: The chemical structure was confirmed periodically by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis MI 1640 culture medium with  l-glutamine performed at the University of Michigan Biochemical Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Core.
5: The DCVC stock solution was stored in aliquots at  20 C until use.

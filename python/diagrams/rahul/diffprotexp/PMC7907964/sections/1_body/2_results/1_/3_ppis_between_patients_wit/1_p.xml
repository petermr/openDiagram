<p>The PPIs of the top 25 proteins with differentially altered expression in skin fibroblasts of patients with PD identified by quantitative proteomic analysis were mapped by STRING analysis (
 <xref rid="f2-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). According to the biological processes and GO analysis, in the GBA-fibroblasts of patients with PD, 12 proteins were involved in the negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic processes (GO:0010605, FDR=0.0143, yellow), 7 proteins were involved in an mRNA metabolic process (GO:0016071, FDR=0.0143, purple) and 4 proteins acted in targeting to the membrane (GO:0006612, FDR=0.0143, cyan) (
 <xref rid="f2-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Of note, 4 proteins categorized in GO:0010605 were upregulated by &gt;1.5-fold in the GBA-fibroblasts of patients with PD (red circles in 
 <xref rid="f2-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In the PARK2-fibroblasts of patients with PD, 16 proteins were involved in the regulation of biological quality (GO:0065008, FDR=0.0008, red), 4 proteins participated in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolic process (GO:0019674, FDR=0.0013, green) and 8 proteins were involved in cytoskeleton organization (GO:0007010, FDR=0.0042, blue) (

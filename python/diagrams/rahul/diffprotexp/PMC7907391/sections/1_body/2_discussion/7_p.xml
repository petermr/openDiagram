<p id="Par26">Furthermore, both radiotherapy and chemotherapy targeted pathways of innate immunity that are also deregulated in COVID-19. Mechanisms of resistance against viral infection include early non-specific responses, and late cell-mediated and humoral immune responses during the stage two acute disease (pneumonia) phase to allow recovery in COVID-19 patients

 </sup>. In patients with active co-morbidities that induce an immunodeficient state however, their impaired immune system does not effectively combat the acute viral pneumonia, thereby predisposing progression into the stage three severe or critical COVID-19

 </sup>. In this study, radiotherapy appears to be suppressing expression of some type I IFN response genes (Supplementary Fig.Â

 </sup>. Understanding how to modify the timing of radiation and chemotherapy to avoid exacerbating the innate immunity dysregulation observed with COVID-19 may be important to guide clinical management of cancer patients requiring treatment during active infection.

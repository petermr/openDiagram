<p>MicroRNAs are widely expressed at various stages of development of cells, tissue and organs, with their expression characterized by profiles called spatio-temporal or time-dependent patterns associated with specific developmental stages [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Such patterns indicate that they are required for tissue morphogenesis and cell differentiation in development and apoptosis. The expression pattern of miRNAs obtained throughout the murine mammary developmental stages including juvenile, puberty, mature virgin, pregnancy and lactation indicated that miRNAs are functionally involved in mammary gland development [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although our observation of differential expression of miRNAs in this study did not relate to spatio-temporal expression patterns, the upregulation of the miR-133 family is consistent with the report of Wang and Li [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that miR-133 and miR-133a-133b are up-regulated during pregnancy and lactation, which corresponds to the point of sampling in the current experiment.

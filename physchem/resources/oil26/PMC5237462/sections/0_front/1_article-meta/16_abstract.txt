0: The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and the identification and quantification of components were achieved with the use of GC-MS analysis.
1: The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the method of sequestration of DPPH.
2: Essential oils were used for study the cytotoxic front larvae of   Artemia salina.
3: In the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, we employed the disk-diffusion method.
4: The potential larvicide in mosquito larvae of the third stage of development of   Aedes aegypti to different concentrations of essential oils was evaluated.
5: The major compounds found in the essential oils of   M. piperita were linalool (51.8%) and epoxyocimene (19.3%).
6: The percentage of antioxidant activity was 79.9  1.6%.
7: The essential oil showed LC  50 = 414.6   g/mL front of   A. saline and is considered highly toxic.
8: It shows sensitivity and halos significant inhibition against   E. coli.
9: The essential possessed partial larvicidal efficiency against   A. aegypti.

<p id="par0290">To conclude, terminal HS drastically reduces the yield and grain-quality of wheat. Plants has inherited network of signaling cascade in order to protect itself from the biotic and abiotic stresses. MAPK signaling cascade regulate the tolerance and other biological mechanisms. We identified 21 novel transcripts of MAPK and cloned two putative heat-responsive MAPK genes of 1.3 kb (
 <italic>MAPK</italic>) and 1.6 kb (
 <italic>MAPK-1</italic>) from wheat under HS. A recombinant MAPK protein of âˆ¼40.3 kDa was purified, isolated and characterized to have very high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity under HS. The expression of 
 <italic>MAPK</italic> was observed maximum in HD3086 with lower protein kinases activity under HS; reason being the inhibition and tight regulation of translational processes. Expression and activity of MAPK was observed to have positive correlation with biochemical traits linked with thermotolerance and negative correlation with traits linked with carbon flux. Developing grains showed very high amylolytic activity predicted to be regulated by MAPK under HS, which indirectly affect the starch quality. The heat-induced MAPK can be used as potential thermo-sensor for analyzing the stress level of the plant. MAPK can be recommended as molecular marker for evaluating diverse germplasm of wheat for HS-tolerance. We can also use this gene to manipulate the stress signaling cascade in plants having amplified impact on over-all tolerance level - a targeted kinase based approach to develop heat tolerant wheat.

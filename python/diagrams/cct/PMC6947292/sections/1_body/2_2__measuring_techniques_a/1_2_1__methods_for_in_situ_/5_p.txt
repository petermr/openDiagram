0: Similar problems occur in the dilatometric measurement of quench-induced precipitation.
1: Modern dilatometers have a very high resolution for length changes, which even allow the detection of early cluster formation in age-hardening Al alloys [ 64, 65, 92].
2: It has been shown that dilatometry is also able to detect quench-induced precipitation in Al alloys over a wide range of cooling rates [ 93, 94].
3: Nevertheless, the changes in the volume of a sample during cluster formation and precipitation are affected by the complex interplay between the volume changes in the matrix crystals and the volume changes due to the precipitated phase.
4: That is, in some cases, precipitation can cause volumetric expansion of the sample, while precipitation of another phase can cause volumetric contraction [ 64, 84, 94].
5: The latter aspect complicates the evaluation of dilatometric measurements of quench-induced precipitation, as different phases that precipitate during cooling can cause opposite changes in length.

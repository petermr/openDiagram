<p id="Par53">Although individual differential gene expression results differed between the models, the collective impact of differentially expressed genes—analyzed by GSEA—yielded multiple upregulated biological processes and signaling pathways that were positively enriched with DCVC treatment in both models. Moreover, two of the commonly enriched pathways, TNFα and p53, were previously reported to be upregulated by DCVC treatment in HTR-8/SVneo cells (Elkin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). Perhaps most strikingly, the commonly enriched pathways in both models contained enrichment of genes regulated by the transcription factor ATF4. These results were supported by the moderate correlation between differential gene expression of ATF4 gene targets in tissues and cells; a correlation that was nearly twice the magnitude of that between all differential gene expression in tissues and cells. Moreover, the consistent enrichment of ATF4 gene targets across both models is indicative of ISR activation with 12-h DCVC treatment. As such, the presence of multiple cell types may hinder the ability to accurately detect differential gene expression ascribed to extravillous trophoblasts in the tissue model. Moreover, because villous explants preserve the intact villi structure, there is more variability in the underlying physiology of the two models. For example, explants retain elements of functional paracrine regulation between cells types through release of secreted signaling molecules. Therefore, explants more closely mimic in vivo conditions, than cell lines (Mannelli et al.

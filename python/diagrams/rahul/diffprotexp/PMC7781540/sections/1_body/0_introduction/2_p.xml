<p>The disease-associated increased K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 expression seems to translate to humans since strong K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 expression has also been found in postmortem human brains on microglia in infarcted areas following ischemic stroke [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], on microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and on microglia in the prefrontal cortex and substantia nigra in Parkinson’s disease [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Taken together, these encouraging findings in humans and animal models strongly suggest microglial K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 channels as a therapeutic target for reducing detrimental inflammatory responses in the brain. But how do K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers work? How does blocking a voltage-gated potassium channel in microglia, and presumably also brain infiltrating monocyte derived macrophages reduce inflammatory cytokine production and inflammation mediated tissue damage?

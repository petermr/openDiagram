<p>Some proteins, exhibiting an increased relative abundance in the model perfusate, have been already reported to be associated with cancer metastasis, such as Rpl21 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Emilin1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], Eif3s2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], Echs1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and CtsD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The relative abundance of CtsD was 5.6-fold elevated in the perfusates from the livers metastasized by Walker-256 tumor cells. CtsD is a lysosomal enzyme, which was reported to be secreted by the breast cancer cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It was also involved in the metastasis of breast cancer and was an independent prognostic biomarker for the cancer [

<p>In conclusion, we successfully synthesized a new neutral charge-transfer (CT) complex, 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, composed of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) as a donor molecule and 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) as an acceptor molecule. X-ray powder diffraction and sorption experiments revealed that the intercolumnar voids can incorporate various molecules 
 <italic>via</italic> lattice expansion. A lithium metal battery with 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> as a cathode active material exhibited a high capacity and fast charge–discharge properties, which were attributed to the combination of redox-active units and the porous structure of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>. In addition, CT complex formation stabilized the organic molecules in the electrolyte and is a new method for suppressing the elution of organic compounds into the electrolyte, which is one of the problems associated with organic active materials. As various donor–acceptor pairs can form mixed columnar structures with hexagonal packing, it is apparent that our strategy of using CT complexes has the potential to be applied to porous electrode active materials. However, as 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> requires a relatively high amount of carbon additive, new CT complexes with higher conductivities need to be developed for future applications. We expect that this concept can be extended to other compounds; hence, our potentially universal design strategy for porous redox-active assembled structures opens up a new class of porous material, namely, CT complexes with high electrical conductivities and high stabilities, for use in appropriate electrolytes. A study into the cathode active material properties of various CT complexes with mixed columnar structures is currently underway in our laboratory and the results will be presented in due course.

<p>Intracranial inoculation of SLEV BeH 355964 in adult wild-type (WT) mice leads to infection and development of a severe neurological disease characterized by encephalitis and death [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To investigate the roles of IFNs in experimental SLEV infection, we infected ABR-/- or IFNγ-/- and the respective strains of WT mice (SV129 and C57BL/6) with SLEV BeH 355964, henceforth referred to as SLEV. We observed that infection of ABR-/- and IFNγ-/- mice resulted in distinct phenotypes when compared to their respective WT controls (

 <sup>2</sup> PFU (

ABR-/- mice presented increased and anticipated mortality when compared to the respective WT group, which presented a mortality rate of 20% approximately 7 days after infection, indicating that ABR-/- mice are very susceptible to SLEV infection. WT C57BL/6 and IFNγ-/- mice were inoculated with 10
 <sup>1</sup> PFU (

IFNγ-/- mice presented a 50% mortality rate after inoculation with SLEV, in comparison to 80% mortality presented by the infected WT group, indicating that IFNγ-/- mice were moderately resistant. These data indicate that deficiency in type I IFN response is deleterious in experimental SLEV infection, whereas deficiency in type II IFN is slightly protective.

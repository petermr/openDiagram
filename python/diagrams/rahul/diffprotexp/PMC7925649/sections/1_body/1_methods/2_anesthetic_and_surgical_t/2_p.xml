<p id="Par7">Bypass flow rates of 150 cc/kg/min were utilized, and pH–stat blood gas management was used for all cases. For aortic arch reconstruction, regional cerebral perfusion (RCP) was utilized at 18 °C, along with deep hypothermic cardiac arrest for brief periods, and never for more than 20 min. Hematocrit was maintained at 30–35% during cooling and hypothermic periods and increased to 40–45% during rewarming. Regional oxygen saturations of the brain (rSO
 <sub>2</sub>) were monitored throughout the perioperative period with a protocol that attempted to maintain rSO
 <sub>2</sub> &gt; 50% before and after bypass and &gt; 90% while on bypass (INVOS 5100B; Somanetics, Inc., Troy, MI, USA).

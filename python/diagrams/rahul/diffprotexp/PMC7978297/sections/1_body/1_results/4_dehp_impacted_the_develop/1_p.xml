<p>It is already known that pre-granulosa (PG) cells are required for PF formation. PG cells were clustered based on UMAP (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Given that the occurrence of two waves of ovarian follicles is supported by two distinct pathways of PG cells 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, the PG cells in this study were divided into bipotential (BPG) and epithelial (EPG) types (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). There were seven clusters of PG cells that showed a high expression of 
 <italic>Amhr2</italic> in the study, which were distinguished by 
 <italic>Foxl2</italic> and 
 <italic>Lgr5</italic>, the marker genes of BPG and EPG cells, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, right panel). Further, the clustering of BPG and EPG cells were separated, and six cell clusters for BPG and five for EPG were produced (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C-D); their expression patterns were consistent with previous research (

<p id="Par65">A similar study was conducted with the stage-specific DETs and DEATs. Clustering graphs are presented in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref> (S3 and S4, respectively). In all cases (premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis and anthesis), transcripts were organized into 6 different clusters with contrasting behaviour. Expression heterochronicity is clearly visible in clusters like DETs Postmeiosis 5 and DETs Anthesis 5.

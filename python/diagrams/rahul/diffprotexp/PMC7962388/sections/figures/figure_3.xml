  <p>Venn diagrams displaying differential expression overlapping across developmental stages. 
   <bold>a</bold> DETs occurring at different developmental stages. A total of 5268 DETs are differentially represented at all developmental stages. The developmental stage with the largest amount of stage-specific DETs is anthesis (7500). The developmental step with a largest amount of total DETs is premeiosis (23,651). 
   <bold>b</bold> DEATs occurring at different developmental stages. A total of 32 DEATs are differentially represented at all developmental stages. The developmental step with a largest amount of stage-specific DEATs is anthesis (396). The developmental step with a largest amount of total DEATs is anthesis (495)

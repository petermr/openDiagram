<p>Although large-scale changes in the DNA methylation status, and either a wide number of genes stress-related within the genes with DmC and DEG were not found, some changes in the protein-coding regions with DmCs identified in the study. In our case, there was a low coincidence with the transcriptomic data due to the different depth coverage of the omics data obtained in each profile. Further studies will be carried out to confirm the expression of some of these genes in the transgenic plant, to validate the data obtained by WGBS.</p>

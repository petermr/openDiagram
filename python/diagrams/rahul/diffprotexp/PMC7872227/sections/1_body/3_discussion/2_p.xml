<p>Although in this paper we pointed out that ammonium and urea were nitrogen sources for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>, it could be seen that the metabolism of large molecules, such as proteins and peptides, were also enhanced in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> in the absence of the above two substances. It was conceivable that amino acids could be directly absorbed and utilized by bacteria. Since 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> couldnâ€™t utilize glucose, then amino acids were likely to be taken up and utilized as a carbon source, as was shown by Farrell and Yang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [

 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Yang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. noted that amino acids could be ammonized by soil bacteria on the cell surface, which was then taken up and utilized [
 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, our experiment showed that no such metabolic pathway seemed to exist in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>. Instead, in the process of protein synthesis in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>, it was believed that most of the amino acids absorbed externally could be used directly, and ammonium or urea might be used to synthesize other nitrogenous substances or individual amino acids as a nitrogen source.

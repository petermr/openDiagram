<p>In our study, we found that calmodulin did not express differentially between the oncosphere and adults, but the expression level in adults was higher than that in the protoscolex with a fold of 3.779. In consideration of its structure and function, we speculate that the high expression of this protein can promote the motility of the oncosphere so as to cross the intestinal mucosa faster and enhance its infiltration ability. During the development of adults, it promoted the maturation of the pregnant section and the formation of eggs. The mature protoscolex mainly exists in the cysts of the hostâ€™s liver and other organs, and the parasitic environment is relatively stable, which may cause the down-regulation of calmodulin expression. This finding is similar to that in a study on the function of calmodulin in

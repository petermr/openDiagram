<p id="Par58">Next, we established a Gene Ontology (GO) classification for all sense transcripts expressed at each developmental stage (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Based on this catalogue, we carried out a KEGG pathways prediction to identify specifically-modulated molecular routes (i.e., upregulated or downregulated in apomictic plants) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Homologous recombination, endocytosis, thiamine metabolism, monobactam biosynthesis, lysine biosynthesis, protein export, RNA polymerase, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, mismatch repair, mRNA surveillance pathway, fructose and mannose metabolism, various types of N − glycan biosynthesis, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism pathways are regulated (by upregulation or repression) only at premeiosis, a clear turning point in which the onset of apospory initials occurs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). In the rest of the developmental stages these routes are similarly expressed in flowers of apomictic and sexual plants. Besides, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and galactose, pyrimidine, sphingolipid and biotin metabolisms are modulated exclusively during meiosis. Moreover, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, ABC transporters, circadian rhythms, autophagy, plant-pathogen interaction, fatty acid metabolism, aliphatic and aromatic aminoacid biosynthesis and selenocompound metabolism are regulated exclusively at postmeiosis. Finally, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, ribosome, citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, nitrogen metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and fatty acid elongation are modulated only at anthesis, when parthenogenesis starts. Protein interaction predictions among members of these stage-specific routes analyzed by comparisons with the STRING database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], revealed they integrate tight networks worth to get functionally explored (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

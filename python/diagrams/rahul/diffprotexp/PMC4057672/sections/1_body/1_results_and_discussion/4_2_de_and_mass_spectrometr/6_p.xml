<p>Peroxiredoxins (Prdx) belong to a widely expressed non-selenium-dependent peroxidase superfamily only discovered over the last decade. Based on the number of cysteine residues, Prdx can be classified as Prdx1-5 (1 unit of cysteine residue) or Prdx6 (2 units). Prdx6 is a bifunctional protein with both phospholipase A2 activity and glutamate/cysteine aminopeptidase peroxidase activity [

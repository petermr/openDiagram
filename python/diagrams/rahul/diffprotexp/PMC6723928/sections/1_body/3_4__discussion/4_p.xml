<p>Annexin V is a cellular protein in the annexin group that plays a central role in the process of cell membrane repair via the formation of a two-dimensional protective bandage at sites of membrane damage [

 <xref rid="B25-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] proposed that annexin V inhibits the inflammatory effect of phospholipids, decreases vascular inflammation, and promotes the induction of regulatory T cells and thus is potentially attractive as a therapeutic agent. JÃ¡gr et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported increased annexin V expression in caries-resistant subjects compared to caries-susceptible subjects. These results support the findings in the present study, where annexin V constituted two out of the fifteen analyzed protein spots (

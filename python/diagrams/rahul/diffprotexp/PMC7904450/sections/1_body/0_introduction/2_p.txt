0: Evidence for the role of interleukin 6 (IL6) mediated cytokine storm in the development of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated morbidity and mortality suggests that therapeutic agents which decrease IL6 signal transduction may prevent serious COVID-19 disease outcomes  [1].
1: Clinical consequences of COVID-19 infection such as multisystem organ failure, intensive care unit admission, and death result from an exaggerated immune response whereby increased IL6 drives a destructive cytokine storm  [2],  [3],  [4],  [5],  [6].
2: This pattern of poor clinical outcomes parallels the Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH) seen in another coronavirus-induced illness, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  [7],  [8].
3: Indeed, many infections result in an IL6-mediated cytokine storm that drives negative clinical outcomes.
4: NF-kappaB-mediates increases in the transcriptional expression of the proinflammatory cytokine  IL6[9],  [10].
5: Binding of IL6 to its receptor complex (IL6R) activates the IL6 signal transduction protein (IL6ST or gp130), a subunit of the IL6 receptor complex.
6: IL6ST activation is integral to many intracellular cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathways, including the cytokine storm / cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients  [11].
7: Further, i n vitro, in vivo , and clinical data demonstrate that many selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) decrease IL6 signaling activity and reduce hyperinflammatory states  [12],  [13],  [14],  [15],  [16],  [17].
8: The SSRI fluoxetine causes pronounced inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling and  IL6 expression correlating with decreased illness severity across a variety of animal disease models including cancer, pulmonary inflammation, and sepsis  [17],  [18],  [19],  [20],  [21],  [22].

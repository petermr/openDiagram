 <caption> Expression of m 5C writers and reader in GI cancer. (A) Based on RNA sequencing data from the TCGA database, a heat map of m 5C writer and reader expression was drawn. Data were collected from cancer patients ( n = 1,568) and healthy patients ( n = 139). Each sample was normalized and was represented by a square. Red and blue regions represented higher and lower expression levels, respectively. (B) RNA sequencing data were used to compare the expression level of each m 5C regulator between tumor and normal samples in different GI cancer types. </caption>

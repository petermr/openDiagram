0: Transcriptome profile of  C.  amaranticolor (a weed host) and  C.  quinoa infected with different viruses determined modulation of photosynthesis, hormone signaling, plant-pathogen interaction, secondary metabolites, lipid, amino acid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism [ 36 39].
1: However, there is no knowledge on the impact of virus infection on transcriptome and small RNA profiles of sweet or bitter quinoa varieties.
2: Therefore, in this study, quinoa leaves from different varieties were inoculated with cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs, and siRNAs were detected among and within quinoa varieties during a time-course virus infection study designed to elucidate general response of quinoa and variety-specific interactions to CMV.
3: In addition, small RNASeq (sRNASeq) analysis was incorporated to complement the transcriptome analysis by characterization of host components involved in viral gene silencing, virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs), and validated known/novel miRNAs.
4: These findings are of particular interest for molecular breeding of quinoa varieties to enhance resistance against virus.

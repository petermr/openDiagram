<p>In order to understand the way in which the mechanical properties were influenced by the precipitation during the soaking step, the residual hardening potential was analyzed by 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> hardness tests (Vickers hardness HV1). These tests were performed after selected soaking temperatures and times and further overcritical quenching and ageing. Therefore, the samples were aged at 180 Â°C for 4 h after the DSC-measurements. The temperature program before the hardness test is shown in

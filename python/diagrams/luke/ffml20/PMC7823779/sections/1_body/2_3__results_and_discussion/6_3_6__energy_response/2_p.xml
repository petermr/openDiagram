<p>Therefore, an energetic NGO would be a more promising additive when compared to GO. After being nitrated and using the same cleaning method to remove metal ion impurities, NGO tends to combust violently in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f008">Figure 8</xref>a. The NGO trip with 60 mm length could be ignited within 20 ms and burned off in 400 ms with intense fire. The average burning rate was around 0.15 m/s. In the gas workability experiment, 10 mg of the NGO powder could generate about 5.8 mL gas finally. NGO performs better combustion behavior and rapid ignition respond with a certain amount of gas products to do work. The combustion tests show that when NGO is used as an additive for energy, it could enhance the combustion performance and energy response of the system.

<p id="Par35">For the regulation of nucleoplasmic LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes (SICER) on euchromatin, the selected 3000 unique genes of control and 226 unique genes of DCM were processed separately via GO and pathway functional analysis. We acquired the annotated results of the 3000 control unique genes (SICER); it contains several biological processes, including intracellular signal transduction, positive regulation of GTPase activity, cellular protein localization, regulation of cardiac muscle contraction, cardiac muscle cell development, cellular response to hypoxia, and oxygen species, regulation of JNK cascade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). A total of 23 pathways were enriched, and we also obtained the corresponding annotation in signaling transduction, like mTOR signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). According to the results of BP analysis in DCM (SICER), the enrichment biological processes are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c. For the results of pathway annotation, WNT signaling pathway was found through analyzing the DCM target genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). The unique genes in both groups and genes associated with functional enrichment mentioned above were collected in Additional file

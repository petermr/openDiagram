<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The MIC values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>) showed that the MA and BM essential oils were the most active against<italic> E. coli</italic> and BM and DE were the most active against<italic> S. aureus</italic>. In contrast, AG and BE were the least effective on<italic> E. coli</italic> and on<italic> S. aureus</italic>, respectively. All the five tested essential oils showed no activity against<italic> P. aeruginosa</italic>. Other studies have shown that this bacterial strain is naturally resistant to other essential oils. The CMB/MIC ratio (2.14 for<italic> E. coli</italic> and 2.02 for<italic> S. aureus</italic>) permitted to qualify the five studied essential oils as bactericidal [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, it was observable that cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of essential oils were different; for example, MA presented the moderate cytotoxicity but a very strong antibacterial activity. This may be explained by qualitative and quantitative variability of chemical compounds identified in these essential oils and their differential molecular mechanisms.</p>

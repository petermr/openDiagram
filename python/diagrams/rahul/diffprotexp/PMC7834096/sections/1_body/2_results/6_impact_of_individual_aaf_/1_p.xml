<p>Due to the genetic heterogeneity of EAEC and potential differences in the regulation and expression strength of the different AAF-encoding gene clusters, it was not possible to directly test whether the specific AAF subtype of wild-type isolates affects biofilm formation. We therefore compared biofilm formation upon heterologous expression of the different AAF constructs in an isogenic EAEC 55989

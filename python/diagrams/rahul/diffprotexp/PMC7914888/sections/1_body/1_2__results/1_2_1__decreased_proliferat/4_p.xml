 <xref rid="B24-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we quantified the formation of melanin pigment in culture B16F1 melanoma cells under standardized conditions [

 <xref rid="B25-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and 5-Brd-2′-dU [

 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Synthetic melanin helped construct calibration curves to quantify by spectrophotometry and fluorometry (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01591">Figure S1d</xref>). The quantification of melanin by both methods was comparable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.999). The two approaches allowed the detection of increase (9 X) and decrease (5 X) in melanin concentration in B16 cells exposed to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>f). However, fluorometry was more sensitive (detection limit 0.098 μg/mL and CV of 9.85%). Up to this point, the pooled results confirmed that exposure to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU induces an arrest at different points in the cell cycle control for B16F1 cells and differential pigmentation phenotype that could be associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in melanin synthesis.

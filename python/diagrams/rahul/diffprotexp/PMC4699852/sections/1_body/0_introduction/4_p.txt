0: In the present study, isolated MSCs from bone marrow and  me_SWH MSCs were differentiated into dopaminergic neurons using an induction medium containing SHH, bFGF, and FGF8.
1: The  me_SWH MSCs were obtained from human bone marrow MSCs by modification of genes in the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway by targeting DNA hypermethylation.
2: We subsequently examined changes in the proteomes of MSCs throughout neuronal differentiation.
3: The signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of dopaminergic differentiation of MSCs were also investigated.
4: Differentially expressed proteins and signal proteins in MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways were quantified by western blotting.
5: We believe that understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating  in vitro neuronal differentiation is crucial for the application of MSCs for cell therapy for the treatment of neurological disorders.

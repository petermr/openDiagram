The levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated astrocytes were measured by ELISA Kit. Astrocytes were incubated for 24&#8201;h with 25, 50, and 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils and LPS (1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL). The data is represented as means &#177; SD and was obtained from three independent experiments. <sup><italic>&#8727;</italic></sup>

 </sup>. Translocation and captive breeding programs continue to be crucial and necessary tools in freshwater mussel conservation, and thus efforts should focus on making these techniques as successful as possible. One of the major factors limiting conservation success is our limited knowledge of freshwater mussel health and disease

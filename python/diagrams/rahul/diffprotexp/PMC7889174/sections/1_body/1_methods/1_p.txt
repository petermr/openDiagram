0: Genome databases.
1: Eukaryotic species were selected for based on factors including importance as experimental organisms, phylogenetic diversity and sequence/assembly quality.
2: This included recently published sequence data from the protozoan alga  Euglena gracilis [ 36] and the freshwater sponge  Ephydatia muelleri [ 37].
3: Details regarding all genomic and transcriptomic data sources are provided in Table S1.
4: Although some datasets are from genome sequencing studies and some from transcriptomic studies, in each case only predicted peptide sequences were analyzed herein.
5: In the case of  Carpediemonas membranifera [ 38] and  Hemimastix kukwesjijk [ 39], nucleotide transcript sequences were translated to predicted peptide sequences using GeneMarkS-T [ 40].

0: The fusion oncogene  RUNX1/RUNX1T1 is expressed as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(8;21), which involves the  RUNX1 gene on chromosome 21 and the  RUNX1T1 gene on chromosome 8 12.
1: When expressed in haematopoietic cells, the fusion protein occupies more than 4000 genomic sites and forms transcription regulatory complexes by recruiting co-factors 13  18.
2: These complexes trigger a local remodeling of chromatin of a wide range of genes and thereby affect their expression 13,  19,  20.
3: In turn, the change of target gene expression leads to a block of cell differentiation, enhancement of self-renewal, modulation of the apoptosis and, eventually, to malignant transformation of t(8;21)-positive cells 15,  21  23.
4: However, despite increasing knowledge of the molecular function of  RUNX1/RUNX1T1, its impact on the leukemic transcriptome is still only incompletely understood.
5: More generally, a potential role of leukemic fusion genes encoding epigenetic modulators such as RUNX1/RUNX1T1 has not yet been established for the regulation of alternative splicing.

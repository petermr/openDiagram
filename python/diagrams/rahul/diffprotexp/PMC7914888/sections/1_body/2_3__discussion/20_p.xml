<p>The analysis of functional enrichment by KEGG pathways for the differentially expressed miRNAs shows diametrically compromised pathways for each phenotype that reinforce the hypothesis of miRNAs that operate in the regulation of signaling pathways under metabolic stress generated by exposure to L-Tyr (PI3K/Akt, MAPK, mTOR, among others) and miRNAs with potential participation in response pathways to genotoxic stress (p53, FoxO, Jak-STAT and transcriptional alteration in cancer).</p>

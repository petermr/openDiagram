<p>Recently, more and more studies suggested that miR-21 is an independent risk factor for CRS and has been regarded as a key therapeutic target [

 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MiR-21 is upregulated in cardiac or renal diseases and can also be transported by microvesicles to other cell types [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Suppression of miR-21 could significantly improve the cardiac and renal function and may represent an attractive therapeutic option. In the current study, we identified a novel MV-mediated communication mechanism between renal tubular epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-21 was exported from renal tubular epithelial cells

<p>We defined three approaches to LIB recycling as described on the left side of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00801-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The first process could be used to extract valuable elements or compounds and valorize them into lower-value products or reintroduce them in the raw material production line. These processes are of low environmental benefit but are simple and less sensitive to economic fluctuation. This is the business model adopted by Retrieve Technologies, where spent LIBs are crushed in an inert environment. Then, Li is recovered in liquid phase and is subsequently sent off-site for further treatment. The transition metal-rich solid paste obtained is sold to external refineries, such as Glencore (Sudbury, ON, Canada), where Co and Ni are recovered. Thus, the end-products no longer serve as battery material, and consequently, the process presents a high level of downcycling. Pyrometallurgical treatment frequently follows this low added-value approach. For example, SNAM (Viviez, France) produces NiFe alloys for stainless-steel manufacturing or a Co concentrate for pigment production from Ni and Li batteries [

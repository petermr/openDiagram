<p id="p0050">We constructed trans-omic networks for differentially regulated metabolic reactions in liver and skeletal muscle between WT and

 <italic>ob</italic> mice. We measured the amount and phosphorylation status of signaling molecules, global gene expression, global protein expression, and the amounts of metabolites and lipids in liver and skeletal muscle, along with the amounts of metabolites in the blood, of WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. We then selected the data relevant to metabolic reactions from the transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. By integrating these data, we constructed trans-omic networks for differentially regulated metabolic reactions in liver and skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice (

<p id="Par7">To understand the high-temperature phases, one needs to examine non-harmonic behaviour, including rotation, which means going beyond a single unit cell, e.g. using molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics requires forces on each atom based on the positions of all the atoms in the system, which requires a force model which is fast enough to allow large simulations. Here we use a machine-learning approach to derive a transferable force model based on an interatomic potential. There are several approaches to machine-learning interatomic forces

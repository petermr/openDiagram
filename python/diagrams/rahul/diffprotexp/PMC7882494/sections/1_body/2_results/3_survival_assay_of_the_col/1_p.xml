<p>Survival analysis is one of the key components in analyzing the influence of any cancer-associated gene (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, the survival assay of the COL11A1 gene is explained by the KM-plots which show a reciprocal correlation between the expression of COL11A1 and overall survival (log-rank p- 0.055) or disease-free survival (log-rank p-0.053), which signifies the COL11A1 gene as a poor prognostic indicator for colorectal cancer (

 <italic>p</italic>-value- 0.1059) (

0: In order to further explore the regularity of some possible key genes during the progression from normal cervix to cervical cancer, we extracted the dataset of  GSE63514 on GEO Datasets, then respectively gathered intersections of five datasets above in venn diagrams and top 100 genes (here we only analysed individual probes) with significantly (adjustment  p value<0.05) high or low expression in  GSE63514 as possible key genes, and used MEV 4.9.0 ( www.tm4.org) to produce heatmaps to analyse the expression of these possible key genes among five categories that represent different periods of cervical cancer: normal, CIN I, CIN II, CIN III, SCC.
1: Meantime hierarchical clustering analysis of genes based on Euclidean distance was conducted with MEV 4.9.0.

 </sup>. DESeq provides methods to test for differential gene expression using a prototype based on negative binomial distribution and a shrinkage estimator for the distribution's variance. Sequencing (uneven library size/depth) bias among the samples was removed by library normalization using size factor calculation in DESeq.

0: It is known, that different cultivars of basil have the genetic ability to generate and keep different sets of chemical compounds.
1: This ability leads to a great variety of chemotypes within the same basil species.
2: According to some investigations [ 2], the essential oils distilled from various basil cultivars can contain alcohols (linalool), oxides (1,8-cineole), phenols (eugenol, methyl eugenol, methyl isoeugenol, thymol), esters (methyl cinnamate), aldehydes (citral), and camphor.
3: The 1,8-cineole, methyl cinnamate, methyl chavicol, and linalool are constituents responsible for the distinct aroma of basil plants [ 3].

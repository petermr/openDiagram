<p id="Par23">It was predicted that circRAB11FIP1 might bind to some miRNAs, including miR-129-5p, miR-130b-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-219a, miR-23a, and miR-708 (miranda v3.3a). The levels of miR-23a, miR-130b-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-708, and miR-219a were measured. As a result, circRAB11FIP1 silencing remarkably upregulated miR-129 expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Besides, the circRAB11FIP1 ectopic expression notably upregulated the miR-129 level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Moreover, as revealed by the fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, circRAB11FIP1 was primarily located in the cytoplasm and overlapped with miR-129 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). The RNA knockdown test showed that circRAB11FIP1 combined with miR-129 directly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D, E</xref>). The dual-luciferase reporter assay further confirmed this interaction. Co-transfection of circRAB11FIP1 wild-type vector and miR-129 mimics into SKOV3 cells resulted in significantly inhibited relative luciferase activity. This result suggested that circRAB11FIP1 interacted directly with miR-129 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).

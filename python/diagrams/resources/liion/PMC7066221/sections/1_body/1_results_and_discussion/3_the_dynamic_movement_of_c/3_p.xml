 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, a bigger picture of the role of cobalt components in facilitating the recovery of the cathode and their dynamic movement is demonstrated. During the cycling, cathode reconstruction occurs in the battery, involving the dissolution and deposition of both Mn and Co components. Deposition of the Mn-based cathode is driven by an electrochemical charge process, which is further facilitated by cobalt components bound on the Mn compound. At the same time, the deposition/dissolution of the Co component is a pH-sensitive process. Owing to the weak acidic environment, a small fraction of cobalt component was dissolved in the electrolyte. During battery discharging, H
 <sup>+</sup> was inserted in the Mn-based cathode (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), resulting in the increase of pH value and consequently the re-deposition of cobalt component on the reconstructed cathode surface. During each charge process, H
 <sup>+</sup> was reversibly released, causing the re-dissolution of cobalt components to some extent. This dynamic movement of the cobalt component in the solid electrode and liquid electrolyte is important for the persistent facilitation of cathode recovery.

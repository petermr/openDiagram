 <caption> (a) Calculated binding energies of intermediate COOH* and H* on Cu(111), Cu(100), Cu(110), and Cu(211) facets with lattice expansion varied between −5 and +5%. The dashed line corresponds to Δ E[COOH*]=Δ E[H*], which is a condition favorable for CO 2RR. Reproduced from ref ( 319) with permission from Elsevier. (b–d) Tracking expansion of interatomic distances in CuZn NPs by operando XAS and artificial neural network. (b) Changes in the Zn K-edge and Cu K-edge XANES spectra for Cu 50Zn 50 nanocatalysts under CO 2RR conditions. (c) The results of the linear combination of XANES data analysis. A representative Zn K-edge XANES spectrum and corresponding fit are shown in the inset. Adapted with permission from ref ( 111). (d) RDFs, extracted from operando Cu K-edge EXAFS data by artificial neural network analysis of Cu50Zn50 NPs and reference materials, showing time-dependent changes in the Cu-M distances. Reproduced with permission from ref ( 25) published by The Royal Society of Chemistry. </caption>

<p>The synthesized cDNA was then used as a template for qRT-PCR using the innuMIX qPCR MasterMix SyGreen and qTower 2.0 (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). The cycling conditions used for amplification were 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, and 65 °C for 25 s. Later, the expression of all genes was normalized to the expression of the corresponding housekeeping gene, GAPDH. The relative amounts of target mRNA in the unstimulated control cells and EF-treated cells were analyzed using the ΔΔ

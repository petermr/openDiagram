<p>Twenty-eight DEGs were manually selected to confirm the expression by RT-qPCR in a validation set of 30 non-survivors, 30 survivors and 20 healthy controls. The DEGs were selected according to (i) their degree of alteration (fold changes and 
 <italic>P</italic> value) (Supplementary Table 2) and (ii) their functions related with immunological responses (Supplementary Table 4). These DEGs included 20 up-regulated genes and 8 down-regulated. RT-qPCR results in the validation set confirmed significantly higher expression in non-survivors compared with survivors and healthy controls for 16 of the 20 up-regulated genes and 1 of the 8 down-regulated genes, respectively (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and Supplementary Table 5). RT-qPCR in the validation set confirmed significantly lower expression in non-survivors compared with survivors (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.016) and healthy controls (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) for 1 of 8 down-regulated genes: 
 <italic>CD160</italic>.

<p id="Par39">Although the identification of nORFs in this study is limited to computational prediction, it is worthwhile to investigate whether some of them are more interesting targets for experimental verification than others. To study the potential regulatory roles of the novel peptides, differential expression analysis was performed on their parent proteins between oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites. However, unlike most canonical proteins whose amino acid sequences have been identified experimentally, novel peptides themselves do not provide information of the full-length novel proteins from which they were generated, they are only evidence that there are PSMs that identify a segment of the transcript. An attempt was made to predict the open reading frame based on where the peptides map to translated sequence of transcripts (see “

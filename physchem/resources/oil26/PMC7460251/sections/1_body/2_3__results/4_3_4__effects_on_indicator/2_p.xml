<p>All enrichment had a nightly average behavioral diversity (H) of 1.60 ± 0.04 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7), and the range of average behavioral diversity scores for each item ranged from 1.51 to 1.71. Behavioral diversity was not related to the stated enrichment goal (F
 <sub>1,174</sub> = 0.005, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.943) but was related to individual enrichment items (F
 <sub>6,207</sub> = 2.61, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.019; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01433">Table S11</xref>). Although most pairwise comparisons for behavioral diversity between the items were not significant and are not reported here, there were a few significant pairwise comparisons. Perfumed Boomer balls
 <sup>®</sup> had lower nightly behavioral diversity than warthog scented towels (t
 <sub>207</sub> = −3.03, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and cricket containers (t
 <sub>207</sub> = −2.56, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011). Warthog scented towels had higher behavioral diversity than pools (t
 <sub>207</sub> = 1.99, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.048), paper towel treat tubes (t
 <sub>207</sub> = 1.99, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.048), and rubber toys with food (t
 <sub>207</sub> = 2.90, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). Containers with crickets were associated with higher behavioral diversity than rubber toys with food (t
 <sub>207</sub> = 2.43, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). Finally, there was a significant decrease in behavioral diversity over the study period (F
 <sub>1,193</sub> = 5.89, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016, 
 <italic>b</italic> = −0.039, 95% CI [−0.071, −0.007]).

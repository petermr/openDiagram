<p>Among the predisposition genes reported by Blondheim et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Nurr-1 is the key transcription factor for the differentiation of human MSCs to dopamine neurons [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Induction of MSCs into dopamine-producing cells is of great interest because of their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to Trzaska et al., human bone marrow MSCs become dopaminergic neurons when incubated with a neuronal induction medium composed of SHH, bFGF, and FGF8 for 12 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A combination of SHH, FGF-8, and RA has also been used to produce dopaminergic-like neurons [

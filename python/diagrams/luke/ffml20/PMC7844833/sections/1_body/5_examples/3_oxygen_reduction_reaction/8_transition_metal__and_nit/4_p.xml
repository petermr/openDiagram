 </sup> In particular, the analysis of 
 <italic>operando</italic> Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra revealed that the Fe–N contribution changes with potential (i.e., is electrochemically active), while the Fe–Fe does not.

 </sup> Moreover, the shift in the Fe K-edge XAS signal (
 <xref rid="fig37" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig37" ref-type="fig">37</xref>
 </xref>a) with increasing applied potential was attributed to the transition from the Fe 2+ to the 3+ state. The changes in the valence state were accompanied by the changes in the local structure. The Fe–N distance increased with increasing potential,

  <xref rid="fig37" ref-type="fig">37</xref>
 </xref>b, while the characteristic XANES feature that is a fingerprint for planar Fe–N
 <sub>4</sub> coordination (shoulder at 7117 eV) disappeared. These changes were attributed to the displacement of Fe from the in-plane to off-plane position (
 <xref rid="fig37" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig37" ref-type="fig">37</xref>
 </xref>c). Interestingly, the average displacement at 0.1 V was different for differently prepared samples,

 </xref>d, and showed a positive correlation with the ORR activity, with the more distorted configuration corresponding to the catalyst with the highest activity.

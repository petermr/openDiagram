 <caption> Overall experimental design. HTR-8/SVneo cells and villous explant tissues were exposed to 0, 10 or 20 µM DCVC for 6 or 12 h. RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis were performed to identify novel genes and pathways affected by DCVC treatment. Follow-up experiments were conducted to verify the affected genes and pathways in HTR-8/SVneo cells </caption>

0: Whole blood was collected from animals treated with raloxifene by either subcutaneous time release pellet implantation (G93A trial), or subcutaneous injection (C57B6 acute treatment) 24 hours after the completion of the experiment.
1: Blood was collected in a Microvette CB300 300 uL capacity EDTA coated (Fisher Scientific NC9141704) and centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 minutes at 4C.
2: Serum was then transferred to a new tube and snap frozen on dry ice.
3: Samples were stored at 20C until they could be analyzed by mass spectroscopy.
4: Mass spectroscopy and raloxifene quantification were performed at the Stony Brook University Biological Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource facility.

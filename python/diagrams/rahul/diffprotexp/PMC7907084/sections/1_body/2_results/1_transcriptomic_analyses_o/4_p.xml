<p id="Par18">The transcriptomes of Gp (G1p) and Gd (G1d) cells in F1 follicles were also analyzed in this study. As shown in Fig. S1, 249 genes were found to be differentially expressed between G1p and G1d cells. Among them, 185 genes were found to show relatively higher expression levels in G1p cells, while 64 genes showed relatively higher mRNA levels in G1d cells. The top 50 up-regulated and down-regulated genes were listed in Table

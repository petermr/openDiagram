<p>Another form of this idea involves the systematic variation of a particular heat treatment, for instance an ageing treatment, prior to reheating (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f020">Figure 20</xref>B). If cooling from solution treatment is carried out faster than the UCCR, the subsequent reheating step will give a total enthalpy change of zero [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f020">Figure 20</xref>D). This fact can be utilised as a baseline correction for the preceding reheating experiment [

 <xref rid="B162-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], an approach that allows the application of chip-sensor-based DFSC for the analysis of the kinetics of quench-induced precipitation in Al alloys. In particular, the specific precipitation enthalpy can be obtained as a function of the cooling rate, allowing us to determine the UCCR of the alloy. In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B129-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], the DRM was developed further towards the obtainment of the specific enthalpy changes depending on the temperature. The latter allowed assessment of the start and end temperatures of certain precipitation reactions, which helps in completing the CCP diagrams for highly concentrated alloys with high UCCRs [

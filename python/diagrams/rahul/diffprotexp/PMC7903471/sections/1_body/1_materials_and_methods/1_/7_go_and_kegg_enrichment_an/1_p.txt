0: Target mRNAs of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were classified according to the principles of GO classification.
1: GO collects information from GO and NCBI databases, annotating and classifying genes based on biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components ( http://www.geneontology.org/).
2: KEGGis a comprehensive database for the systematic analysis of gene function, which is based on manually drawn metabolic pathways and is divided into metabolism, genetic information processing, cellular processes, environmental information processing, biological systems and human diseases ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).

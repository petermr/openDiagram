<p>Regardless of the origin of the changes in the interatomic distances, in several important cases, the metal–metal bond length itself was established as a convenient descriptor of the catalyst properties. A nearly linear relationship between the contraction of the Pt–Pt bond distance (as extracted from 
 <italic>in situ</italic> EXAFS analysis) and the specific catalytic activity for ORR in a broad range of Pt-based alloys was reported by Kaito et al.

 </sup> The relationship between the Cu–Cu distance and the selectivity toward CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR or competing HER in Cu-based alloys was discussed by Bernal et al.

 </sup> For instance, using 
 <italic>operando</italic> EXAFS, a pronounced switch in selectivity was observed for CuZn catalysts during CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR from CH
 <sub>4</sub> production to CO and H
 <sub>2</sub>. The observed change could be correlated with a change in the material structure and composition, from originally having Cu/ZnO
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> to the formation of a CuZn brass alloy under reaction conditions, which led to an increase in the effective Cu-metal distance.

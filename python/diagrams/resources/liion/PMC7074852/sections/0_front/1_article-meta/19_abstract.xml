 <p>Transition metal oxide is one of the most promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Generally, the electrochemical property of transition metal oxides can be improved by optimizing their element components and controlling their nano-architecture. Herein, we designed nonstoichiometric Cu
  <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
  <sub>0.4</sub>Co
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> nanowires for high performance lithium-ion storage. It is found that the specific capacity of Cu
  <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
  <sub>0.4</sub>Co
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> nanowires remain 880 mAh g
  <sup>−1</sup> after 50 cycles, exhibiting much better electrochemical performance than CuCo
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> and NiCo
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>. After experiencing a large current charge and discharge state, the discharge capacity of Cu
  <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
  <sub>0.4</sub>Co
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> nanowires recovers to 780 mAh g
  <sup>−1</sup> at 50 mA g
  <sup>−1</sup>, which is ca. 88% of the initial capacity. The high electrochemical performance of Cu
  <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
  <sub>0.4</sub>Co
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub> nanowires is related to their better electronic conductivity and synergistic effect of metals. This work may provide a new strategy for the design of multicomponent transition metal oxides as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.

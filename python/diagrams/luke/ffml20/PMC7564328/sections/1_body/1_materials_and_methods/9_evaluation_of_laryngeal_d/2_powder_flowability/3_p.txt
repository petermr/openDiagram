0: An appropriate amount of SCU@CD-MOF were filled into the 10 mL graduated cylinder ( M1) until its volume read as 9  1 mL, recorded it as  V1, weighed as  M2.
1: The graduated cylinder was allowed to fall freely from a prescribed height until its volume did not change significantly, which was recorded as the  V2.
2: The bulk density ( b), tapped density ( t) and Carr's index (CI) were calculated as following Eqs.

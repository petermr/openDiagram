<p>Adipose tissue is mainly composed of adipocytes (90%), nonadipocytes (preadipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, inflammatory cells, etc.), connective tissue matrix, blood vessels, and nervous tissues (

A widely different function among Subcutaneous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SASCs), epididymal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (EASCs), and perirenal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PASCs) were illustrated including a higher potential of lipogenesis in EASCs and PASCs (

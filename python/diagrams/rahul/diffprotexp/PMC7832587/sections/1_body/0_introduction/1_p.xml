<p>Malaria is a global health problem affecting over 200 millions of people worldwide, and responsible in 2018 of nearly 4,05,000 deaths around the globe, mostly children[
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Malaria is caused by parasites of the genus 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, a pathogen with a complex life-cycle between the transmission vector, the mosquito 
 <italic>Anopheles,</italic> and a vertebrate host
 <italic>.</italic> Five different 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species infect humans, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> being the most virulent one, accounting for âˆ¼90% of the mortality caused by this disease. Over the last 15 years, artemisinin-combined therapies (ACT) have permitted a substantial reduction of the mortality of this disease. However, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains resistant to current treatments, particularly to artemisinin, have already appeared in different regions of south Asia, representing a serious threat to eradicate malaria as no effective vaccine is yet available [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The fight against malaria thus requires a continuous supply of new drugs to supplement the existing therapeutic arsenal. In fact, the combination of drugs acting on different targets and/or stages is the most efficient strategy to combat malaria as it minimizes the development of new drug-resistance mechanisms [

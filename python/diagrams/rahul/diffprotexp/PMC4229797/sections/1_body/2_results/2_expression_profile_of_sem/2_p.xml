<p>The differential expression of proteins was visualized by using a heatmap based on sample group and mass to charge (m/z) ratio. This shows the relative up- and down-regulated expression of proteins in each individual seminal plasma sample. All differentially expressed proteins were up-regulated in the seminal plasma from the infertile group [Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">b</xref>]. Using the previously published database for seminal proteins,[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] we were able to propose the potential identity of some proteins [

 <caption> Venn diagram representation of the proteomic results of the sucrose, sorbitol and cold exposure datasets. ( a) Comparison between S. commersonii and S. tuberosum Désirée; ( b) Comparison among the three constrains (sucrose, sorbitol and cold) in the same species. The numbers represent the number of identified proteins that are significantly increased (with green arrows) or decreased (with red arrows) in abundance ( p value &lt; 0.05) in S. commersonii and S. tuberosum cv. Désirée. Abbreviations: Suc, Sucrose; Stl, Sorbitol. </caption>

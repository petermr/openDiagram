<p>The concentration of CK-19 was analyzed by applying the CYFRA 21–1 assay, detecting soluble fragments of CK-19. We found significantly higher concentrations of CK-19 in cyst fluids from cPTCs (mean 59 ng/ml) as compared to benign lesions (mean 36 ng/ml) (p&lt;0.001), which is in agreement with the findings in the other three analyses (LC-MS/MS, Western blot and IHC). To determine the cut-off values we applied ROC curve analysis to the ELISA data and identified 55 ng/ml or more as the optimal cut-off value for CK-19 (

At this cut-off, we obtained sensitivity and specificity of 82%, PPV and NPV of 82%, PLR of 4.53 and NLR of 0.22, which is in agreement with AUC (0.86), indicating good diagnostic accuracy of the ELISA test for CK-19/CYFRA 21–1 (p&lt;0.0001) (

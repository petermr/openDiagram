0: The MDA-MB-231 cells in logarithmic growth phase were adjusted to a concentration of 5  10 4 cells/well into 6-well plates and were inoculated in 6-well plates containing 10% FBS serum DMEM.
1: Subsequently, the MDA-MB-231 cells were placed in a 37 C, 5% CO 2 incubator and incubated until 80% confluence, and the blank DMEM medium was used to starve overnight.
2: RSV was divided according to different treatment concentrations into 0, DMSO, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200M groups, and the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 24 h. The cells of each group were collected in a 1.5 ml EP tube, lysed with RIPA cell lysate, and the protein concentration was measured by BCA.
3: The experimental protein samples were then adjusted to the same concentration with RIPA.
4: The protein samples were loaded for 1.5 h following electrophoresis and transferred to a membrane blocked with a 5% skim milk powder blocking solution for 2 h. The primary antibody was incubated overnight (4 C), and on the next day, it was dipped in TBST for 1 h, which was then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody for 2 h. Subsequently, it was immersed in TBST for 45 min, and developed with an ECL chemiluminescence developer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China).

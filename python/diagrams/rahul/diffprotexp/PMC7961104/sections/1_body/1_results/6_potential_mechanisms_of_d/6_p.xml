<p id="p0175">In addition to increased glucose in the blood in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, we found an increase in phosphorylation of As160 in skeletal muscle of

 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). Given that As160 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases and its phosphorylation inhibits its GTPase activity, resulting in promoting Glut4 translocation into the plasma membrane via Rab GTPases, and consequently enhancing glucose transport (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Czech, 2007</xref>), this result suggested the enhancement of glucose transport through Glut4 translocation. In addition, expression of 
 <italic>Slc2a4</italic>/
 <italic>Glut4</italic> was slightly upregulated in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). By contrast, we found reduced glycolysis in skeletal muscle as suggested by slightly decrease in glycolytic metabolites from G6P to PEP together with decreased glycolytic enzymes Gapdh, Pgk1, and Pgam2 and increased gluconeogenesis in liver as suggested by increased Gpt, Gpt2, and Ldha (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C). The two facts that increased blood glucose and phosphorylation of As160 and that decreased downstream glycolytic metabolites (G6P to PEP) are contradictory, implying an existence of dysregulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Consistently, it has been shown that glucose uptake is reduced in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ohshima et al., 1984</xref>). These results suggest the possibility that Glut4 translocation to plasma membrane, which is downstream of As160, is impaired in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, leading to the opposite changes of blood glucose and glycolytic metabolites in skeletal muscle in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. Taken together, blood glucose and blood alanine showed the similar changes to those in the releasing organs (the liver for glucose, skeletal muscle for alanine and lactate) and the opposite changes to glucose, alanine, and lactate in the uptaking organs (skeletal muscle for glucose, the liver for alanine and lactate). This result suggests that abnormal changes of blood glucose, blood alanine, and blood lactate resulted from the imbalance of metabolic pathways in releasing and uptaking organs.

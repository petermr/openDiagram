0: For potato, frost is the abiotic constraint that causes the most severe yield losses.
1: However, there are several potato species, such as  S. commersonii, that are able to cold acclimate and increase their frost tolerance [ 6].
2: Although  S. commersonii does not have a commercial value, this species has been studied for its resistance traits.
3: The conservation of this and other potato species with low commercial value is thus important.
4: The best method to date for the long-term conservation of vegetatively propagated plants is cryopreservation.
5: Indeed, during cryopreservation, cell division, metabolic and biochemical processes are arrested, and thus, the plant material can be stored for a long period of time [ 7].

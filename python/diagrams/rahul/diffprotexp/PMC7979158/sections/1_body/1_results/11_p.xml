<p>To investigate other cell populations that may be impacted by MIA during development, we analyzed astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and GABAergic interneuron cell populations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1k</xref>). Concordant with RNA-seq results, the number of cells expressing GFAP, a protein found in radial glia and a subset of astrocytes (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Eng et al., 2000</xref>), was increased in MIA offspring, mapping specifically to cells that seemed to emerge ventral from the neocortical VZ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b,q</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1k</xref>). Since astrocytes also express SOX9 (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Klum et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) and radial glia also express PAX6, which is decreased by MIA, this finding is consistent with the possibility that the increased SOX9+ cells in the dorsal regions of the neocortex, described earlier, may be indicative of early differentiated astrocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). OLIG2, which is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors and mature cells as well as transiently in astrocyte progenitors (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dimou et al., 2008</xref>), was also upregulated at E17.5 in the MIA group. OLIG2+ cells were increased in MIA brains compared to controls (n = 3 per group, p=0.0134, Student’s t-test) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–d,k</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1k</xref>). PDGFRα, a marker of early developing oligodendrocytes, was also increased in MIA brains compared to controls (n = 7 per group, zone 1 p&lt;0.0001, zone 2 p=0.0063, zone 3 p=0.0125, Student’s t-test) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e–f,l</xref>). Thus, these experiments provide evidence that MIA leads to increased numbers of additional cell types (putative astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) that are typically born at later ages during corticogenesis, reinforcing findings of accelerated cell development that is supported by an increased representation of later-born cell types at E17.5 in brains exposed to MIA.

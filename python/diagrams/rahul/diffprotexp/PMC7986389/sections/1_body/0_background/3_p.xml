<p id="Par14">Given a directed network, a feedback vertex set (FVS) is a set of vertices whose removal leaves the remaining network acyclic. The minimum feedback vertex set (MFVS) is a kind of FVS that has the minimum size among all possible FVSs. The MFVS problem has been proven to be NP-complete [

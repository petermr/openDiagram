<p>The mRNA expression levels of the selected genes were quantified by RT-qPCR, which we reported as the relative of differential expression (rER) concerning the housekeeping gene GAPDH and B16F1 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence determined the expression and location of the corresponding protein. We evaluated some mRNAs involved in the cell cycle and senescence: Cyclin D1 (Ccdn1) expression, cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk2, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (

0: Lithium-ion batteries have become the main power source of portable electronic products because of their high energy density, long cycle life, and eco-friendliness (Dunn et al.,  2011; Fan et al.,  2019; Zhang et al.,  2019).
1: With the rapid development of mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles, the market has put forward higher requirements on the energy storage density and stability of batteries.
2: Therefore, more attentions have been paid to the exploration of electrode materials with high capacity and advanced performance (Ding et al.,  2019; Zhang et al.,  2019).

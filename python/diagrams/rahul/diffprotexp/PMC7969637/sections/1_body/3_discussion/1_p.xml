<p>Sepsis can lead to death of children with a dramatic increase in the incidence of disease. The prominent problem for pediatric sepsis is the inflated misdiagnosis as well as the lack of a gold standard. Epidemiologic research has provided evidence that sepsis is more or less similar to over 50 systemic diseases in children (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For instance, in the case of fever: immunosuppressed children do not always develop fever, so the infection is hard to detect. In contrast, critically ill children have a certain degree of hyperthermia but may not present infection (

Whenever symptoms are present, sepsis in children becomes more severe. All of these are all in dire need of effective forecasting targets or biomarkers for pediatric sepsis. To this end, it is beneficial to develop a comprehensive specific expression profile of genes in pediatric sepsis patients for potential candidates. Here, compared with control specimens, a total of 708 differentially expressed genes in pediatric sepsis were screened out, including 507 up-regulated genes and 201 down-regulated genes (see

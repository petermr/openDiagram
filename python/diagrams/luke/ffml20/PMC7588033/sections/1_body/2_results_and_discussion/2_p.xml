 </xref> for the 26 compounds and the DOPC membrane model simulated with the CHARMM36 forcefield and pulling velocity 
 <italic>v</italic> = 0.5 nm/ns. Our results indicate that the correlation between 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> and the logBB values of the compounds is high, namely, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.85. In particular, the maximum force increases as the logBB values decrease. This result agrees well with the expectation that a larger force may be required to translocate a compound through the membrane when logBB is lower (e.g., mannitol). In the case of 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>neq</sub>, the correlation of the simulation results with the experimental logBB values of the compounds is similarly high, namely, the correlation coefficient is 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.86. Hence, our results indicate a remarkable correlation between the experimentally measured logBB parameters and the reported maximum force values, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>, and the nonequilibrium work, 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>neq</sub>, despite the simplicity of our approach. Both quantities are larger when logBB is smaller.

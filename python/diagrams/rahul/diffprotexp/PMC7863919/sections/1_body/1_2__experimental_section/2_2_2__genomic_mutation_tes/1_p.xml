<p>The presence of point mutation at the 
 <italic>USP8</italic> hotspot (exon 14) and 
 <italic>USP48</italic> hotspot (exon 10) was determined using Sanger sequencing. DNA was PCR amplified with FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using the GeneAmp 9700 PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The PCR product was purified using ExoSAP-IT (USA Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH, USA), labeled with BigDye Terminator v.3.1 (Applied Biosytems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis with the ABI PRISM 3300 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), as described previously [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The following sequences of PCR primers were used: 5′-TCCACCCCTCCAACTCATAA and 5′-CTGACAGATTCAGAGTAGAAACT for 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutation testing as well as 5′-GCCCGGCTAAAGAATAAACA and 5′-TGCCTGCTATAATCCTGGAAA for identification of 
 <italic>USP48</italic> variants.

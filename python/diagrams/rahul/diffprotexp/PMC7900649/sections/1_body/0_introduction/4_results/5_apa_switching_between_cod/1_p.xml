<p id="Par27">Besides the 3′ UTR, APA sites are also found in the coding region, thus affecting translation. As described before, if the usage of coding region APA sites is increased, it is referred as CDS-prefer, or UTR-prefer otherwise [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A total of 149 genes (FDR &lt; 0.01) showed switching events between coding region and 3′ UTR, and 27 genes showed different tendencies at different time points after infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). As the results suggest, genes tend to use more APA sites in 3′ UTR at 1–10 hpi After 10 hpi, the usage of APA sites in coding region prevails (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). APA sites located in the coding region could affect translation and cause premature translation termination. Thus, we explored the function of these CDS-preferred APA genes and found that CDS-preferred genes mainly participate in cellular process and metabolic process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c).

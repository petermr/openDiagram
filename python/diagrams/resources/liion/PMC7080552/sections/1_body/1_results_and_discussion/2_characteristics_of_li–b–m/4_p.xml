<p>The 3D LiB skeleton structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after soaking the Li–B–Mg composite in naphthalene (10 wt. %)‐containing tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution to dissolve the Li component.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> Figure S2a (Supporting Information) shows that the remaining 3D plate structure possesses pores of several micros in size and that the remaining LiB fibers align in parallel along the rolling direction, in accordance with the previous reports.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> In addition, it can be seen from Figure S2b (Supporting Information), the cross‐section of the plate, that LiB fibers of different lengths were interlaced with one another mainly in a direction parallel to the surface. The pores between LiB skeletons are thus the ideal accommodations for free Li encapsulation.

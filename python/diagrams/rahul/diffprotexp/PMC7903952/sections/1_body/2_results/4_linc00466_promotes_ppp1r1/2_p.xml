<p>Furthermore, we also explored LINC00466/miR-137/PPP1R14B axis on the biological function of glioma cells. CCK8 and transwell assays revealed that silencing PPP1R14B and overexpression of miR-137 could suppress the promotion of proliferation and metastasis of glioma cells by up-regulation of LINC00466 (

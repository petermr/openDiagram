 <caption> Epithelial cell‐type protein expression indicate mild crypt hyperplasia in “responders” at baseline. A) Position of proteins mapped to “mature enterocytes” and “goblet cells” along principle component 1 (PC1) in total tissue and epithelial proteome dataset. B) Expression of cell‐type specific proteins (median z‐score per responder group). C,D) Correlation (Pearson) between "mature enterocyte" and "goblet cell" protein expression (median z‐score per patient) with Vh:Cd ratio measured on the same biopsies from total tissue (C) and epithelial proteome (D) datasets (E–G). Comparison of E) Vh:Cd ratio F) Marsh score, and G) IEL count between responder groups(Pairwise comparison by Mann‐Whitney U test). </caption>

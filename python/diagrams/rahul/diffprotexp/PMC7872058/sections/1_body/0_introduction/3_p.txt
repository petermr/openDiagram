0: TREM1 is constitutively expressed by neutrophils and macrophages and its expression is further up-regulated by microbial components [ 11].
1: Although the precise role of TREM1 has not yet been clearly defined, it is well documented that TREM1 amplifies TLR4 and TLR2 inflammatory signaling [ 12, 13].
2: In addition, TREM1 can be secreted as a soluble form (sTREM1), and therefore it has been utilized as a diagnostic marker for inflammatory processes including infections.
3: For instance, the presence of sTREM1 in samples from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from mechanically ventilated patients has been shown to be a good indicator of infectious pneumonia [ 14].

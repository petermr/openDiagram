 </sup>. Expanding our analysis to multiple neuronal subtype populations across the nervous system in the present study revealed that AS is strongly correlated with various phenotypic features including the developmental stage, morphology, and type of excitatory neuron. Similar to the analysis of hippocampal neurons, these results further demonstrate the importance of integrating data from different post-transcriptional regulatory layers to capture variation that is not observed by GE differences alone.

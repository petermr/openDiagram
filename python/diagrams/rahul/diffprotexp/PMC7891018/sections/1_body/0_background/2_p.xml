<p id="Par21">Influenza virus induces caspase-dependent apoptosis by activating caspase-3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Apoptosis is divided into the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway engages caspases via members of the BCL-2 protein family and mitochondria in response to severe cellular damage or stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Mitochondria also play a leading role in the release of many important apoptosis-inducing molecules due to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to a whole-cell proteomic study of A549 cells infected with avian influenza virus H7N9 and influenza virus H1N1, some differentially expressed proteins are localized to mitochondria [

According to their virulence level, IAVs are divided into LPAI and HPAI viruses. Most avian influenza viruses are LPAI viruses, which can produce subclinical infections in poultry or occasionally cause mild respiratory diseases, reduced egg production and low mortality rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. HA subtype H5 and H7 LPAI viruses can mutate into HPAI variants. It is represented by H5N1 and H7N7, leading to severe progressive disease and high bird mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. HPAI viruses can seriously affect animal health and have an economic impact on the commercial poultry industry. In addition, some strains can be transmitted to humans [

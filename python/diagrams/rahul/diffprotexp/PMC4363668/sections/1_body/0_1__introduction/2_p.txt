0: Many data show that EV71 infection has a complex pathogenesis and that the central nervous system (CNS) is likely the main target of the EV71 virus [ 10].
1: The well-established murine and cynomolgus monkey models have demonstrated that EV71 infection may cause neurological lesions in the CNS [ 11,  12]; recently, EV71 Virus infected rhesus monkeys through four route can result in lesion in the CNS [ 13].
2: However, the mechanism that underlies EV71 infections to induce severe neural complications in patients still remains unknown.
3: Therefore, it is very important to elucidate pathogenic mechanism of EV71 CNS infection.

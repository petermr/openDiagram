<p>Total RNA was extracted from nine sets of bacterial fluid samples using RNAprep Pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and quantity of the extracted total RNA were verified using RNA-free agarose gel electrophoresis and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Nine sets of RNA samples were then used for library construction. A total amount of 3μg RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. As for prokaryotic samples, mRNA was purified from total RNA using probes to remove rRNA. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, Adaptor with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. Then USER Enzyme was used to degrade the second strand of cDNA containing U. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 370~420bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and the library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.</p>

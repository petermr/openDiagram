<p>This Review thus complements the recent excellent work by Bordiga, Lamberti, et al.,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
 </sup> which discussed the XAS method and the recent experimental developments in XAS in the context of studies of heterogeneous thermal catalysts. Here we build up and expand the focus of previous reviews by Russel and Rose on the use of XAS for low temperature fuel cell characterization,
 <sup>

 </sup> describing XAS application for the study of nanoscale electrocatalysts. Moreover, we will use this opportunity to summarize and put into context the various XAS data analysis methods available for the investigation of heterogeneous, complex, disordered systems under diverse environmental conditions. The interpretation of XAS data in these cases is often nontrivial, and the proper choice of data analysis tools can be just as important as the advancements and proper care implemented in the acquisition of the experimental data.

 <caption> Phylogenetic tree of StbZIPs. The phylogenetic tree with representative bZIPs of each group from Arabidopsis, rice, maize, barley, and potato (denoted using red, blue, purple, brown, and green stars, respectively) was constructed using the Neighbor-joining (NJ) method by MEGA 7 with 1000 bootstrap values. The StbZIPs were categorized into 11 groups and are shown by colored branches A to I, S, and U. </caption>

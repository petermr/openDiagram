<p>Differentially abundant proteins with a ratio of â‰¤1.5- or &gt;1.5-fold and a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 were selected. In total, this resulted in the selection of 310 spots that were significantly different; of these, 283 spots could be reliably matched and were finally picked on the selected gel, as described. In 210 of these spots, a protein was significantly identified. Elimination of spots from which two or more proteins were identified resulted in a final list of 94 spots/proteins that were considered in this study. When two or more proteins are identified in the same spot, it means that different co-migrating proteins are present. Because when using the normal procedures for two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) there is no way to differentiate which of two co-migrating proteins is changing in abundance, identifying a spot as being significantly different when plants are treated 
 <italic>versus</italic> untreated means nothing if a second protein is also present in this spot.

0: Results (inhibition %) were expressed as mean  standard deviation (S.D.)
1: of three independent experiments in triplicate ( n = 3) and as concentration inhibiting 50% of the initial activity (IC 50).
2: Data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
3: The significance of the difference from the respective controls for each experimental test condition was assayed by using Tukeys test for each paired experiment.
4: Statistical significance was considered at  p< 0.05.
5: IC 50 values were calculated by Graphpad Prism software (version 5.0, GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

<p>Protein 2-DE was performed as previously described
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Frozen kidney tissues were ground into powder under low-temperature conditions. Protein lysis buffer was added at a 5 × volume, and tissues were homogenized in an ice bath for 1 min using a homogenizer. The resultant homogenates were ultra-sonicated 3 times using 5–8 bursts each time. The samples were placed at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C for future use. Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) colorimetry.

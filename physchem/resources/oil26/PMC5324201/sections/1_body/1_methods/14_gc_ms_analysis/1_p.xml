<p>The essential oils were analysed by Electron Impact Ionization (EI) method on GC-2010 Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph, coupled to a GC-MS QP 2010 plus Shimadzu Mass Spectrometer fitted with RTX-5 MS fused silica capillary column (Supelco Inc.) (30 m × 2.5 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness). The column temperature was 40 °C (hold 2 min) to 220 °C (hold 5 min) at the rate of 10 °C/min, maintained with carrier gas helium at a constant pressure of 90 kPa (Acquisition parameters full scan; scan range 40–550 amu). The split ratio was 10. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV.</p>

0: Locomotor activity (see  Supplementary Table S3 for a summary) was recorded using motion-sensitive loggers.
1: In the first year (July 2012 to July 2013), activity was recorded by tri-axial piezoelectrical accelerometers (Actical, Mini-Mitter Corporation, United States), which were sensitive to forces of >0.05  g and were set to record whole-body movements over full 5-min periods.
2: In the following years (20132015), aardvark locomotor activity was recorded over 10-s periods at 5-min intervals using custom-designed activity biologgers (MLOG_AT1, Sigma Delta Technologies, Australia) with a tri-axial accelerometer sensitive to forces of >0.04  g. These devices had previously been validated against visual observations of a free-living primate ( McFarland et al., 2013).

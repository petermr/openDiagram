<p>To examine the contribution of individual genes to clusters 1 and 3, we developed a heat map of gene-level expression relative to the mean of the HV samples. The greatest individual gene log2 fold change above the mean of the HV was visualised in the CLE-A disease group versus the HV group in the IFN gene cluster (range, 3.1–5.9; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). Unsurprisingly, genes with the strongest differential between CLE-A and the mean of the HV were 
 <italic>IFI6</italic>, 
 <italic>IFI44</italic>, 
 <italic>MX1</italic> and 
 <italic>USP18</italic> (range, 5.5–5.9), all of which are IFN response genes. A strong differential was also seen between CLE-A and CLE-U in the IFN cluster. There was a less robust differential between CLE-A and the mean of the HV in the CLE-associated cluster (range, 1.4–3.8), for example, 
 <italic>ISG15</italic>, 
 <italic>GZMB</italic> and 
 <italic>ITGAX</italic> with log2 fold changes ranging from 3.3 to 3.8, and a weak differential between CLE-A and CLE-U in the CLE-associated cluster.

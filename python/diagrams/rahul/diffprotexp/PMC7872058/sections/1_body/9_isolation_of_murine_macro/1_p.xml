<p>Primary macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavities of mice as described before [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After centrifugation of the cell suspension, primary macrophages were counted using a hemocytometer. A suspension of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml in feeding medium RPMI 1640 w/o L-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and L-Glutamine–Penicillin–Streptomycin was prepared, and 1 ml per well was added to 24 well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2-enriched atmosphere. The following day the medium was removed, and 1 ml of fresh feeding medium containing 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> spores at a cell density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml was added to each well. Cell stimulation was carried out for 1 or 2 and 6 hours at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. Negative control included non-infected cells.

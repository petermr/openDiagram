<p>After solution heat treatment at 540 °C for 20 min, the samples were quenched to a certain soaking temperature in a power-compensated DSC (Pyris 1 DSC, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The temperature program and the parameters used are shown in

 <italic>T</italic> = 10 K. The soaking time was determined with preliminary tests, varying the soaking step between 30 and 60 min. The preliminary tests showed that after 30 min, dissolution reactions were no longer detectable. One disc-shaped sample of EN AW-6005A with a diameter of 5.7 mm and a height of 1 mm was repeatedly used for all experiments. Due to initial solution annealing and quenching, a fresh supersaturated solid solution was adjusted for every new experiment. The sample mass was 69.615 mg.

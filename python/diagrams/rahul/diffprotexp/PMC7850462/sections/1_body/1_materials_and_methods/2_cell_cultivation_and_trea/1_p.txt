0: Human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) were purchased from Shanghai Institute of Cell Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
1: HK-2 cells were cultivated in DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin at 37 C with 5% CO 2.
2: Cell model of sepsis was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
3: HK-2 cells were treated with 1 g/mL LPS (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h and then seeded into a culture plate.
4: The cells were incubated in the plate for 16 h and then subjected to transfection.

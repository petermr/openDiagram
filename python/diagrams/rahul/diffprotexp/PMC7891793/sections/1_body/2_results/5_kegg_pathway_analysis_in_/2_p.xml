<p>For innate immune functions (
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) differences between treatment and placebo dominate in lung tissue without lesion. RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway enrichment was observed in this sample type for all groups; NF-kappa B signaling pathway was also enriched in all groups except group 1. Groups 1 and 6, which were treated with ibuprofen for the longest time, demonstrated enrichment in natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and Complement and coagulation cascades. Complement and coagulation cascades pathway was also enriched in lung tissue with lesion of all treatment groups, except group 4 (treated with FPI day 5â€“10). Antigen processing and presentation pathway enrichment was unique for only lung tissue with lesion in groups 4, 5 and 6 (all FPI treated groups). In the cluster of adaptive immune functions most of the pathways were enriched in lung tissue without lesion for group 6. T cell receptor signaling pathway was enriched only in this tissue type in groups 1 and 6, which had the longest ibuprofen treatment. IgA production was enriched in lung tissue with lesion for groups 4 and 6 (FPI treated); and in group 6 IgA production was also enriched in lung tissue without lesion. IL-17 signaling and Th17 differentiation pathways were mainly observed in groups 5 and 6 (combined treatment). Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation enrichment was uniquely attributed to group 6 in both types of lung tissue.

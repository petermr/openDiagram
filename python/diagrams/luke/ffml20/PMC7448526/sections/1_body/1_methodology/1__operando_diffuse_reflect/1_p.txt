0: The zeolite H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 25, obtained from Zeolyst International, was calcined in air at 500 C for 24 h. The BET surface area and total pore volume of the calcined zeolite are 390 m 2 g 1 and 0.23 cm 3 g 1, respectively.
1: Mesopore surface area determined by t-plot method is 34 m 2 g 1 indicating that the total surface area of the zeolite is mainly arising from micropores.
2: Operando DRIFTS and MS experiments were conducted on an Agilent Cary 600 series spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Praying Mantis reaction cell that was connected to a gas dosing system.
3: 30 The reaction cell outlet was connected to a Hiden quantitative gas analysis (QGA) mass spectrometer for analysis of the products.
4: Prior to the spectroscopic measurements, the zeolite was pre-treated in dry N 2 flow (100 ml min 1) at 500 C for a few hours and then cooled to room temperature (RT) under the same flow.
5: Methanol pulse experiments were conducted under the same N 2 flow at RT with different loadings that results in around 8, 4, 2 and 1 molecules per Brnsted acidic site.
6: 29 31 The evolution of surface adsorbed species and products were monitored by DRIFTS and MS, respectively, for around 30 min under the same N 2 flush.

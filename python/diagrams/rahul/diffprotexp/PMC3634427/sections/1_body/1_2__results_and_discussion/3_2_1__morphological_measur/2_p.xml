<p>The shoot length is significantly lower in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> when plants are exposed to a high sugar concentration compared to control conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-14-04912">Figure 1a</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> plantlets show the same increase of shoot length independent of the sugar used, whereas, in Désirée, sucrose affects shoot length less than sorbitol. There is no significant difference in shoot length when the plants are grown at chilling temperature.

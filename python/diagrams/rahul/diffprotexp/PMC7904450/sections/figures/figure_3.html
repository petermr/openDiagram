 <caption> Pathway: NF-kappaB, IL6, sIL6R, IL6ST, and Cytokine Storm. The transcription factor NF-kappaB binds the IL6 gene to induce transcriptional expression of the proinflammatory cytokine. Pro-inflammatory trans-signaling-mediated responses involve IL6 proteins binding to soluble IL6 receptors (sIL6R) which activates the IL6 signal transduction protein (IL6ST or gp130). IL6ST activation is integral to many intracellular cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathways including the cytokine storm / cytokine release syndrome driving many of the negative clinic outcomes associated with COVID-19. </caption>

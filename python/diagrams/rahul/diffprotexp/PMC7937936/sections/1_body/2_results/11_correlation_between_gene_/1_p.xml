<p>CIBERSORT was used to estimate the fractions of 22 infiltrated immune cells using the RNA-sequence data. The relative abundance of parts of the 22 infiltrated immune cells exhibited significant differences between the high- and low-expression groups. Combining the results of differential analysis (

 </xref>), we found that the content of a total of 14 immune cells was significantly correlated with the expression of 
 <italic>CCR4</italic>, 11 with the expression of 
 <italic>CCR8</italic>, and 13 with the expression of 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> (

 </xref>). For example, six immune cells were positively correlated with the expression of 
 <italic>CCR8</italic>, including naive B cells, T cells regulatory (Tregs), T cells CD4 memory resting, T cells follicular helper, resting Mast cells, and activated T cells CD4 memory. Five cells were negatively correlated with 
 <italic>CCR8</italic> expression, including memory B cells, Macrophages M0, activated Mast cells, Eosinophils, and activated NK cells. Notably, five of the infiltrating cells had similar correlations with all three hub genes. The expression of these genes was negatively correlated with the fraction of memory B cells and positively correlated with the fraction of the other four cells, including naive B cells, resting T cells CD4 memory, T cells follicular helper, and Tregs. These results further support that the expression of 
 <italic>CCR4</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR8</italic>, and 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> affect the immunoreactivity of TME.

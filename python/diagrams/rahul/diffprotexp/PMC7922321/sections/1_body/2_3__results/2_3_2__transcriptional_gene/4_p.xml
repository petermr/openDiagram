<p>Focusing on the functional investigation of the gene regulatory network, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis was performed with positively and negatively regulated targets of ETS regulons on the regulatory network (positive regulation indicates similar coexpression patterns, i.e., when ETS protein is downregulated, its targets are also downregulated, and vice versa). It was observed that positive and negative cluster targets of ETS regulons were enriched in biological processes, such as cellâ€“cell adhesion, synapse formation, and protein localization, some of which are common across members, while some are unique for one or few family member(s) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). This classification is not conserved for negatively regulated targets, however; here, ELF1, ELK3, ELK4, ETS1, and ETV4 appear to regulate similar biological processes, while the ELF4 regulon and ETS2 regulon each are comprised of distinct targets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). It is important to note that, in positively regulated targets of the ETV1 regulon, nucleosome and chromatin disassembly related processes were prominent, while no significant negatively regulated targets were identified for the ETV1 regulon. The ELK3 regulon included positively regulated targets in ECM organization, protein maturation, and processing pathways, and negatively regulated targets in synaptic vesicle signaling, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity pathways.

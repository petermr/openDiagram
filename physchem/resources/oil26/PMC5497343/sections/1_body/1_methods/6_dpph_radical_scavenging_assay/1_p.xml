<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par14">DPPH assay was carried out following the modified method of Ajileye et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, the solution of DPPH (0.135&#160;mM) was prepared in methanol and incubated in the dark for 30&#160;min. One hundred microliter of the essential oil or standards (positive control) were prepared in methanol of various concentration ranging from (0.03&#8211;0.5&#160;mg/mL), and was added into all the wells of microtiter plate starting from (C-H) in triplicates except for A (A1-A12) and B (B1-B12). Thereafter, 100&#160;&#956;L of 0.135&#160;mM of DPPH solution prepared in methanol was added into the wells from C-H. Absorbance was spectrophotometrically observed at 517&#160;nm and the essential oil ability to lower DPPH to neutral molecule was expressed as percentage inhibition using the formula percentage inhibition&#160;=&#160;{(Abs <sub>control</sub> &#8211;Abs <sub>sample</sub>)}/ (Abs control) &#215; 100.</p>

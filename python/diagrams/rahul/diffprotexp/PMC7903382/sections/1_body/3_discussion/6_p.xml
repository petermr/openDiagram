<p>The present study has several limitations. For example, the reperfusion time for tissue collection lasted only 2 h. Therefore, it remains unknown if the expression of lncRNA has the same regulation for a longer period after ischemia. Moreover, a functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed without further verification. LncRNAs are poorly conserved and only part of the sequence is conserved by multiple species (

 <xref rid="b65-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). As a result, further research is required to examine the functions of lncRNAs and the conservation of differentially expressed lncRNAs in rats and humans, which will identify their predicted targets and provide a detailed expression profile of lncRNA.

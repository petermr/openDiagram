<p>MBP was labeled with HiLyte Fluor 488 (Anaspec, Fremont, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 100 μg of MBP was dialyzed overnight against 50 mM PBS, pH 7.4 at 4°C. Fluor was suspended in DMSO to generate 10 μL of a 2 mM solution. Protein labeling was conducted at a 7.5:1 ratio of fluor to protein at room temperature for 45 minutes. The dye-conjugated protein was washed with 50 mM PBS, pH 7.4 and separated from unreacted dye by centrifugation in a spin column.</p>

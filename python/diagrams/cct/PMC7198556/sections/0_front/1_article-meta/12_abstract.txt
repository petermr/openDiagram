0: Process control in surface hardening depends greatly on the repeatability of the results.
1: Induction heating facilities stand out in this aspect but challenges arise when it comes to the verification of the expected temperatures.
2: In-situ temperature measurement of a workpiece may be made impossible due to it moving through an enclosed, automated induction facility that lacks built-in sensors.
3: This paper uses transition patterns in the microstructure of the hardened region to reconstruct isothermal contour lines of the temperature field during austenitisation.
4: It does so based on a continuous cooling transformation phase diagram and a time-temperature-austenitisation diagram of the considered steel.
5: The presented method serves as a practical approach to validate simulations of the inductive austenitising process and supports simulations of the heat treatment of the work piece.
6: Once these simulations have been iterated upon and validated thoroughly, they may then yield a reconstruction of the entire temperature field during the heat treatment process.

<p>CD303 immunoreactive area was greatest in participants with CLE, with a multifocal distribution in dermis tracking along with inflammatory infiltrates. CD303 was very low in HVs. Per cent area of CD303 immunoreactivity strongly correlated with IFN mRNA gene cluster expression (dermis, rho=0.84, p&lt;0.001;

<p>In the present study, the altered expression of mRNAs and lncRNAs in the thoracic (T)1-T4 spinal cord were analyzed using high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) between a group of rats established with MIRI and a sham group. Using microarrays, the current study identified 470 mRNAs and 126 lncRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed in rats with MIRI, and further analyzed the biologic roles of these mRNAs and lncRNAs by performing Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. Subsequently, the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs were validated using reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR. The present results may facilitate the development of molecular-targeting therapies for MIRI.</p>

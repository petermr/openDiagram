<p>Refer to the methods of Springer and Gatesy (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Springer &amp; Gatesy, 2018</xref>), several different branch categories were considered during selective analyses: (1) One category accounted for “background” branches, which are lineages with intact teeth and an intact copy of 
 <italic>ACPT</italic>. (2) Nine branch categories to terminal branches with unique inactivating mutations (baleen whales), which lacks teeth. (3) Three branch categories to terminal branches with unique inactivating mutations (pygmy sperm whale, nine-banded armadillo and aardvark), whose enamel has been vestigial. (4) One branch categories were assigned for stem Mysticeti where mineralized teeth were degraded. (5) One branch categories were assigned for crown Mysticeti.

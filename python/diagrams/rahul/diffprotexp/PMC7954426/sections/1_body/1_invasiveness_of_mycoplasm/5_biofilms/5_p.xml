<p>Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> strains can produce biofilms, the most potent of which is the Nobilis MG 6/85 strain [
 <xref rid="cit0181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Intriguingly, the Nobilis MG 6/85 is an attenuated vaccine strain and its biofilm formation is not necessarily associated with pathogenicity. Otherwise, all 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> strains from house finches produce biofilms, but no difference was observed in the biofilm density between these strains [
 <xref rid="cit0165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], which implies that the formation of biofilms was independent of the house finch conjunctivitis caused by 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic>.

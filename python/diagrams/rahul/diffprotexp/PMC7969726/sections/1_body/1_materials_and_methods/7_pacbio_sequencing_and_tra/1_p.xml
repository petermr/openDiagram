<p>According to the Iso-Seq-v3 analysis pipeline

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>). Isoforms with a complete match of the intron chain and potentially novel isoforms (with at least one known splice junction and occurring in both libraries) were selected. We then constructed a full transcriptome. The constructed transcriptome was used to identify alternative splicing (AS) events by SUPPA2 (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Trincado et al., 2018</xref>). Seven types of AS events were identified, including SE, mutually exclusive exons (MX), alternative 5′ splicing site (A5), alternative 3′ splicing site (A3), retained intron (RI), alternative first exon (AF), and alternative last exon (AL).

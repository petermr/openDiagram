0: Western blotting was performed as previously described [ 37], with some modifications.
1: Equal amounts of whole protein extracts were suspended in 6x Laemmli Sample Buffer, heated, loaded, and then electrophoresed on Pre-Casted TGX-SDS gels (Bio-Rad, CA).
2: Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad Turbo Trans-Blot apparatus.
3: Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBST [25 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20] overnight at 4C and the appropriate primary antibodies were added overnight at 4C.
4: Membranes were then washed with TBST and probed with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) secondary antibodies at 22C for 1 h. Blots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal Femto, Pierce, IL) and images were obtained using a VersaDoc 1000 system (Bio-Rad, CA).
5: All Western blots were performed at least in triplicate from three independent experiments, and densitometry analyses were normalized to -actin expression using NIH ImageJ (v1.47d).
6: Data from Western blots is presented as mean  standard error of the mean (S.E.M.).
7: Students t-test analyses were employed and statistical significance was established as *P  0.05; **P  0.01.

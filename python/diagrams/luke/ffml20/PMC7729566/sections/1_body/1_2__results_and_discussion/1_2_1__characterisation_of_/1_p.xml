<p>In an effort to identify potential mixtures capable of presenting a variable hydrophilic/hydrophobic character in the absence of an additional salting-out agent, four aqueous solutions of chloride-based ILs ([N
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl, [P
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl, [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl and [C
 <sub>14</sub>mim]Cl) and three organic acids were screened for the existence of a biphasic regime. The quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts were selected due to their reported temperature-dependent aqueous solubility conferred by the screening of the charge center by the alkyl moieties [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, comparing the behavior of the symmetric [P
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl to its surfactant counterpart [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl in the presence of organic acids allows to determine the contribution of the IL self-organization on the phase separation. Conversely, the comparison of [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl with [C
 <sub>14</sub>mim]Cl permits the evaluation of the surfactant head group, with [C
 <sub>14</sub>mim]Cl displaying an un-screened charge dispersed around the imidazolium ring. Regarding the biodegradable organic acids, acetic acid, lactic acid and the poly-carboxylic citric acid were studied. These acids were selected due to their reported application both in aqueous solutions and as components in eutectic solvents [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is important to emphasise that the tested acids present a range of acidities, with their deprotonation constant (pKa) ranking as: citric acid (3.13) &lt; lactic acid (3.86) &lt; acetic acid (4.75). The possibility for acid deprotonation and subsequent anion-exchange with the ILâ€™s chloride and the formation of a new and potentially hydrophobic IL must be considered.

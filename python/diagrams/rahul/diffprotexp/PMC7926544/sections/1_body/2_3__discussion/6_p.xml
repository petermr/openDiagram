<p>In summary, we identified Hsp70-like STCH and the stress inducible Hsp70 proteins as two novel bindings partners of the immature and ER-resident form of NKCC2. Our results provide evidence that STCH and Hsp70 exert opposite effects on the stability and maturation of the co-transporter. In addition, they show that besides the proteasome-dependent ERAD, the ER quality control of NKCC2 mediated by STCH, involves also the ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation pathway, revealing therefore a new regulatory mechanism governing the co-transporter biogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first report demonstrating that STCH is directly involved in the ERAD of misfolded proteins. Given the dual role of chaperones such as the members of the Hsp70 heat shock family in ERAD pathways [

Accordingly, enhancing the ability of chaperones, such Hsp70 and Hsp40 to stabilize NKCC2 and assist its proper folding might at least partially rescue trafficking of its folding mutants, and consequently restore their function at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, reducing the ability of chaperones, such as STCH and OS9 to promote the ERAD NKCC2, might increase the cellular levels of mutant proteins available to be rescued. Ultimately, the comprehensive characterization and identification of the molecular specific determinants of ERAD NKCC2 might help to provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting co-transporter trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane.

  <p>Summary of proposed DCVC-induced activation of the Integrated Stress Response. DCVC-induced mitochondrial dysfunction activates one or more of the eIF2α kinases. Kinase(s) phosphorylate eIF2α. Phosphorylated eIF2α activates transcription and translation of ATF4 and causes global protein attenuation. ATF4 transcription factor up-regulates many genes involved in biological processes necessary to restore homeostasis. ATF4 also up-regulates transcription factor CHOP, which then interacts with ATF4 to activate transcription of genes involved in cell death signaling</p>

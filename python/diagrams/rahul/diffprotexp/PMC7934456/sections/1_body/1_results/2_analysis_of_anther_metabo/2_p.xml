<p id="Par20">In this study, by using heat map clustering, we classified the metabolites of the sterile and restorer lines (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A). KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the metabolites were involved in secondary metabolism, flavonoid metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, as the metabolite levels changed remarkably in these pathways (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B; Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A volcano plot of differential metabolites showed 37 metabolite differences (|Fold change| ≥ one and |Fold change| ≤ 0.5) between the sterile and restorer lines and 11 kinds of flower buds in the sterile line compared with those in the restorer line. Moreover, there were 11 up-accumulated and 26 down-accumulated metabolites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b lists the top 20 substances with multiple metabolite differences, with pterostilbene being the most up-accumulated and D-erythro-sphinganine being the most down-accumulated (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

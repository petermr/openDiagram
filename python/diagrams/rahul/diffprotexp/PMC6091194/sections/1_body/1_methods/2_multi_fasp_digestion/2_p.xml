<p id="Par39">Following the first digestion, spin filters were washed with 40 μL of urea followed with 2X washes of 40 μL of ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O, then, 3X washes with 100 μL of 50 mM ABC solution, followed by adding 0.1 μg/μL of trypsin in 1:100 and incubating at 37 °C O/N. Peptides were eluted, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and desalted on a C
 <sub>18</sub> MacroSpin column (The Nest Group, Southboro, MA). The concentration of the peptides was determined using a microplate colorimetric assay (BioRad).

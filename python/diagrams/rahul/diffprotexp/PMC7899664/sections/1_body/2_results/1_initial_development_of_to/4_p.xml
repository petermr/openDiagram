<p>The RSM plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>) were critically analyzed to understand the interaction of the manipulated parameters on HA reduction. From the EtOH and 4-MU response surface plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>), decreased HA was observed with low levels of EtOH and moderate levels of 4-MU. Elevated HA was noted when high 4-MU was paired with low EtOH and low 4-MU paired with high EtOH. In the PG and 4-MU plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>), decreased HA was noted with low proportion of PG and moderate levels of 4-MU, with HA level responses seen in a similar pattern as EtOH and 4-MU with elevated HA noted when high 4-MU was paired with low EtOH and low 4-MU paired with high EtOH. Higher proportion of 4-MU did not necessarily result in greater decrease in HA, as we posit that the ethanol and PG also have a role in the penetration and availability of the active ingredient 4-MU in the dermis where HA is in abundance in the skin. The PG and EtOH plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(C)</xref>) demonstrate decreased HA with low-moderate EtOH and low PG, with elevated HA associated with high PG in both extremes of low and high EtOH.

0: This secretome was validated using a TMT-multiplexed strategy [ 13].
1: These authors identified 4200 proteins in the  T.  solium cysticercus proteome, the most extensive intermixing of host- and parasite-derived proteins reported for tapeworm infections.
2: Their data set was then compared with previous proteomic reports for other helminths [ 14 16].
3: Additionally, they used our report on  T.  solium secretome [ 12] to identify 167 excretory/secretory proteins in their data set.
4: Using various algorithms, those authors select 9 antigenic proteins and used them to design a diagnostic assay (ELISA) to detect porcine cysticercosis [ 13].

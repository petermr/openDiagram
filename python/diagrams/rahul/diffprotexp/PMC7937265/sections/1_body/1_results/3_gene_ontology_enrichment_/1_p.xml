<p id="Par35">We assessed whether any biological process Gene Ontology (GO) terms were over-represented in our list of DEGs. Up-regulated DEGs in the HYPO were most significantly enriched in regulation of neurotransmitter receptor activity (FDR = 0.002), while down-regulated DEGs were most significantly enriched in central nervous system myelination (FDR &lt; 0.001) (Fig.

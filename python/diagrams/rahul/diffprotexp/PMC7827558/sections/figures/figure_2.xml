  <p>Modulation of growth arrest vs. apoptosis in p53-inducible cell lines. (
   <bold>A</bold>). GFP-tagged full-length p53 (FLp53) and p53β are induced in SH-SY5Y cells post doxycycline treatment. p21 induction and PARP cleavage are only observed in FLp53-overexpressing cells. Antibodies for WB in this figure: GFP (Abcam), PARP (Cell signaling), p21 (BD). (
   <bold>B</bold>). Synergistic effect of p53β overexpression and IR. GFP-p53β is induced to overexpress in the A549-GFP-p53β-inducible line by Doxycycline treatment for 24 h before subsequent IR at different doses. A549-GFP-p53β without GFP-p53β induction is used as a control. Cell proliferation is assessed by MTT assay 10 days post-IR [

   <bold>C</bold>). Differential cellular effects in FLp53 and p53β-induced cells. As assessed by PI staining for cell cycle analysis, FLp53-induced SY5Y cells undergo apoptosis as indicated by the increasing subG1 population (top left panel; blue line) while p53β-overexpressing cells (GFP-positive population, top right panel) are arrested at G1 (bottom left panel; increased G1/S ratio, red line) and stained positive for SA-β-galactosidase activity (bottom right), a classical cellular senescence marker in the flow beta-gal assay described in Chen et al. Cancer Discovery [

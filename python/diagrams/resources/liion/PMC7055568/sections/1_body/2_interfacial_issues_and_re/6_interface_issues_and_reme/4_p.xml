<p>On account of highly ion‐conducting interphase between ceramic and polymer, the homogeneous dispersion of ceramic fillers doubtlessly contributes to the construction of continuous high‐speed and uniform Li ion migration channels.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">66</xref> The particle size, shape, arrangement, and 3D ceramic framework of ceramic in SCEs may have significant effects on the interface properties between ceramic and polymer. Despite interface investigation in starting stage, some physical and chemical methods have been adopted to create compatible interface of ceramic with polymer, which is significant for promoting the development and application of all‐solid‐state lithium battery.

<p>The humidity-dependent water loadings on AcidBir and δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are characteristic of a Type II adsorption/desorption isotherm,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>
 </sup> with some hysteresis in the desorption leg. The isotherms became nearly congruent when expressed on a mass per mass (mg H
 <sub>2</sub>O/g birnessite) or unit cell (H
 <sub>2</sub>O/UC) basis (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>) and reached ∼1.5–1.6 H
 <sub>2</sub>O/UC just below the dew point of water. This congruency for both materials indicates that the majority of bound water was associated to the birnessite bulk.

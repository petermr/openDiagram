<p id="Par36">We used stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy to observe the differences in anther and pollen development in sterile and fertile lines of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic>. The results showed that the pollen grains of sterile plants markedly shrank, bent inward, and collapsed, whereas those of fertile plants showed a normal phenotype [

 <italic>pol</italic> CMS’s sterile line material exhibited abnormalities and disintegration. These abnormalities mostly occurred in the third phase of anther development and led to early PCD of sporogenous cells, which eventually led to the abnormal differentiation of L2 cells, outer cells, inner cells, tapetum cells, and microspore mother cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In this study, we identified many anther development-related proteins and tapetum development-related proteins in sterile plants, and these proteins were associated with sterility genes. Thus, we concluded that 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS’s sterility genes caused the production of abnormal anther and tapetum development-related proteins, which led to anther abortion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, there are also significant shortcomings in this project. Although several candidate genes were screened by combined multi-omics analysis and yeast two-hybrid experiments, the corresponding results were not verified by other molecular biology experiments and oil-seed rape transgenesis.

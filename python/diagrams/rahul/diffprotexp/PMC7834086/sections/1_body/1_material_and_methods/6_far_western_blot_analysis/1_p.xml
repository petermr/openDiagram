<p>Far-Western blot analysis, as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], was also used to ascertain the interaction between PirB and histone H4. First, 1 µg of the purified proteins (i.e. rGST, rGST-PirB or rPiB) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Next, membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk dissolved in TBST before being incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the supernatant from the pET-32a-

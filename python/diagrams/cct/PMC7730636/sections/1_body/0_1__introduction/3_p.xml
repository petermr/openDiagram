<p>The results obtained by the dilatometer are used to construct various types of diagrams that are closely related to the heat treatment of steels. One of these diagrams is the Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) diagram. These focus on the anisotropic decay of austenite and forming new structures. During the measurement, the expansion curve deviation from its linear direction during cooling or heating is monitored. Based on this deviation, it is possible to determine the initial temperatures

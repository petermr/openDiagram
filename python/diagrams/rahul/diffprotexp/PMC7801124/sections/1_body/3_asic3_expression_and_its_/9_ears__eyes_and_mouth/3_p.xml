<p>Within the mouth, ASIC function has the potential to be involved in both taste and pain sensation. Within odontoblast soma (cells situated on the outer surface of the dental pulp), hASIC3 is expressed at low levels [
 <xref rid="cit0147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]; nevertheless, it may play a role in the transmission of tooth pain [
 <xref rid="cit0148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. This is because rASIC3 has been observed in 33% of sensory neurones innervating tooth pulp, thus indicating a potential role in dental pain [
 <xref rid="cit0149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Similarly, in mice, ASIC3 is expressed in trigeminal ganglion neurones and the periodontal Ruffini, a primary mechanoreceptor, endings [
 <xref rid="cit0150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. In humans, a case study of two patients showed that they were responsive to bitter, sweet, and salty, but not sour stimuli, an observation that was coupled with ASIC3 being one of a few receptors undetectable in the lingual fungiform papillae of the sour-ageusia patients (others included polycystic kidney disease channels and ASIC1a/1b/2a/2b) [
 <xref rid="cit0151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Considering that acid evokes amiloride-sensitive currents in rat vallate taste receptors [
 <xref rid="cit0152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], it can certainly be hypothesized that ASIC3 (perhaps in tandem with other ASICs) is involved in sour taste and thus lack of expression in individuals with sour-ageusia may explain their phenotype.

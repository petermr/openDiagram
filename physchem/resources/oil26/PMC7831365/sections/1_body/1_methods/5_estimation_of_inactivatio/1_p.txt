0: To estimate when  ACPT was inactivated in different lineages of Placentalia, the method described in  Chou et al.
1: (2002) and  Zhang et al.
2: (2010) was used.
3: Among the branches along which the gene became pseudogenes, this method presumes that gene evolves under a selective pressure similar to that in other species until it is inactivated.
4: Next, this gene was presumed to accumulate both nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations at an equal rate.
5: The  K  a/ K  s ( K) value was assessed for this entire branch.
6: The average  K  a/ K  s value was just for a part of the branch, where the gene was under selection ( K  s).
7: In addition, the  K  a/ K  s value for the rest of part of the branch where the gene evolved neutrally ( K  n = 1).
8: Thus, the evolutionary time was weighted by the proportion, for which the gene was evolving under selection ( T  s/ T) and neutrally ( T  n/ T):  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} }{}$$K = K_s \times T_s/T + K_n \times T_n / T$$\end{document}K=KsTs/T+KnTn/Twhere  T is the time since the split from the last common ancestor (LCA).
9: By selecting the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval for the species divergence time  T, which was obtained from TimeTree website ( http://www.timetree.org/) to estimate a lower and upper bound for  T  n as:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} }{}$$T_n = T \times (K-K_s)/(1-K_s)$$\end{document}Tn=T(KKs)/(1Ks)which provides an estimate of how long the  ACPT gene has been evolving neutrally.

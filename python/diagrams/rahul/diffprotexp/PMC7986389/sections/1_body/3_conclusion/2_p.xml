<p id="Par46">WMFVS and WFVS take advantage of both bio-data and the network structure. They can be useful in novel cancer gene prediction and evaluation, and the same idea may also be applied to other bioinformatics problems. The main challenge of our methods is the definition of the weights. WMFVS and WFVS can perform very well when the weights are well defined but may display limited performance when the weights are not directly related to the category. Another issue concerns graph compression. In our experiments, the traditional MFVS method analysed the compressed graph (with the

Because of the different input scales, WMFVS and WFVS were not as efficient as the simple MFVS method, although the time costs were still acceptable. The development of new algorithms for weighted graph compression is left as future work.

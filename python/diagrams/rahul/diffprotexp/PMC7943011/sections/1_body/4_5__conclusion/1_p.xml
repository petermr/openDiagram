<p>The proteomic analysis of changes in the expression of 1,300 different proteins in the human EC cell line HEC-1A revealed that both metformin treatment and insulin supplementation led to anti-tumor as well as some tumor-promoting effects. A set of 80 proteins were selected for a more detailed analysis based on most prominent changes. Metformin and insulin targeted similar pathways and mostly acted on proteins related to proliferation, migration, and changes in the tumor microenvironment, especially cellular immune response. The presented data helps identify proteins affected by metformin treatment as well as insulin supplementation in EC and allows for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the anti-cancer properties of the biguanide drug, that are still not fully understood. However, further investigations are necessary for selected proteins to confirm the observations and conclusions drawn from the presented data after metformin administration, especially for proteins that were regulated in a favorable way, i.e. AKT3, CCND2, CD63, CD81, GFAP, IL5, IL17A, IRF4, PI3, and VTCN1. In the context of a hyperinsulinemic environment, as seen in obese women or PCOS patients, further proteins might be of interest, i.e. AMFR, CCND2, CD63, ERBB3, EZR, GFAP, IRF4, PI3, PLCG2, SORL1, VEGFA, VTCN1, SPP1, and TM9SF2, because sensitization to insulin due to metformin administration might be able to counteract unfavorable effects on their expression profile that have been induced by hyperinsulinemia.</p>

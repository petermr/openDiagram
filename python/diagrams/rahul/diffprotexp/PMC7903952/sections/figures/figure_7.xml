  <p>Overexpressing LINC00466 promotes tumor growth of glioma in nude mice. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Tumor weight and (
   <bold>B</bold>) tumor size in oe-NC and oe-LINC00466 groups; (
   <bold>C</bold>) The expression levels of LINC00466, mir-137 and PPP1R14B in the tumors; (
   <bold>D</bold>) The protein levels of PPP1R14B, proteins which were related to EMT and proteins which were related to proliferation in tumor tissues were measured by WB assay (
   <bold>E</bold>) The expression levels of PPP1R14B and Ki67 in tumor tissues were detected by IHC assay (10um).

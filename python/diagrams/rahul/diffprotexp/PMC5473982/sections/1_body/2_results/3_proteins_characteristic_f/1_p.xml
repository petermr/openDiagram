<p>Out of 78 proteins characteristic for heterophils (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), 20 with the highest PSM difference between heterophils and macrophages are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. These included MRP126, LECT2, CATHL1, CATHL2, CATHL3, LYG2, LYZ and RSFR proteins, all with antibacterial functions. STOM and RAB27A proteins controlling storage and release of granular proteins in neutrophils also belonged among the characteristic and highly expressed proteins in heterophils. Two serine protease inhibitors, SERPINB10 and SERPINB1, were also found among the 20 most characteristic heterophil proteins (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Only a single KEGG pathway was specifically enriched in heterophils and this was the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway comprising PYGL, PGM1 and PGM2 proteins (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.7E−4). Despite the KEGG pathway designation, all these proteins represent enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism [

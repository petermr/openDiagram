<p>A total of 40 POAG and 23 post-mortem TM specimens were analyzed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As detected in pilot studies, 17% (8/40 extracted specimens) of the total TM extracted samples was undetectable. The entire experimental procedure of this lower-case project, procedure, including TM stabilization to reduce protein degradation during transit, is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. The total protein amount was detectable in all specimens included in the study, and representative spectrophotometer plots are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. The electrophoretic analysis of POAG TM revealed the presence of abundant bands at the 100, 90, 70 and 40 kDa. Both heavy and light IgG chains were observed in several protein extracts (SDS-PAGE; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) and samples showing over-expressed heavy/light Ig chains were pretreated prior to hybridization (see M&amp;M).

<p id="Par41">Clinical characteristics of the 15 patients included for RNA-Seq analysis (CI group, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11; control group, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The maternal and gestational ages at the time of sample collection were not significantly different between the two groups. Four women in the CI group delivered preterm [CI-preterm group; gestational weeks at delivery, 19.8 (17.4–30.9)], and the others were delivered after 37 gestational weeks [CI-term group; gestational weeks at delivery, 38.0 (37.0–39.0)]. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts of the CI-preterm group were significantly higher than those of the CI-term group (Table

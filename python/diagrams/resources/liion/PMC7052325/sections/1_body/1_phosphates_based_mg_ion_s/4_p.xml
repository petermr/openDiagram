<p>In 2001, Imanaka used the substitution strategy to improve the ionic conductivity of MZP by partially replacing Zr
 <sup>4+</sup> with Nb
 <sup>5+</sup> (Imanaka et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2000b</xref>). The substitution was used to statistically distribute mobile Mg ions to make a smooth Mg ion diffusion but it also reduced the number of migrating Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ion species in the solid solution electrolyte. Thus, the optimum conductivity was observed at x = 0.15 in Mg
 <sub>1−2x</sub>(Zr
 <sub>1−x</sub>Nb
 <sub>x</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>P
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>24</sub> with 7.7 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 600°C and 3.7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 750°C, demonstrating little enhancement compared to pristine MZP.

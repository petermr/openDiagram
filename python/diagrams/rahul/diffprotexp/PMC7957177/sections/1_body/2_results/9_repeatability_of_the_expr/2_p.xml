<p>To confirm the significance of KRT17 and CRISP2 during the period of tumor progression, we further analyzed their expression among normal and cancer samples in 6 datasets with larger sample size. The extracted data of these two genes’ expression in GEO datasets suggested the same tendency (Figure 
 <xref rid="cam43799-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), so that means that combination of KRT17 and CRISP2 may be used as diagnostic biomarker to distinguish the different histologic grades of cervical cancer.

0: Replication kinetics was performed on both confluent buffalo green monkey (BGM) (BioWhittaker Europe) and human lung adenocarcinoma (CaLu-3) cells (ATCC HTB-55TM, Plateforme iPS, NeuroMyoGene Institute, Lyon, FR, [ 26]) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 3 at 36C with 5% CO 2 for 7 days, fully respecting the WHO interim biosafety guidance related to the coronavirus disease [ 27].
1: Comparative viral particle quantification of culture supernatant was performed by RdRp Institut Pasteur qRT-PCR on a QuantStudioTM 5 System (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) with a standard curve after semi-automated EMAG extraction (bioMerieux, Lyon, FR) [ 6].
2: Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons between both factors of comparison (virus variant and cell line) on GraphPad Prism (software version 8.4.3).

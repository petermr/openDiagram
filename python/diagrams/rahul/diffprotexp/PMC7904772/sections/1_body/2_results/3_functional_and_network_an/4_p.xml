<p id="Par21">Afterward, we also conducted GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of the 122 differential proteins identified in the insusceptible group. A total of 410 BP, 113 CC, 130 MF, and 12 KEGG pathway terms were significantly enriched. The top ten enriched GO terms are displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>. BP category analysis signaled that the majority of proteins were engaged in cellular and vesicle localization, intracellular transport, biosynthetic process, and synaptic vesicle cycle, and CC displayed that most proteins were located in the cytoplasmic, intracellular, neuron, and synapse parts. The majority of proteins in the MF category were predicted to be involved in cofactor, coenzyme, scaffold protein, and small molecule binding, as well as enzyme activity, and KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that the dysregulated proteins were primarily implicated in various metabolism, synapse, and signaling pathways (Fig.

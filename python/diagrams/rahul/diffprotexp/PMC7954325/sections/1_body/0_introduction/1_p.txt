0: One of the biggest challenges of current times is to feed the ever-growing population amidst a changing climate with limited available resources.
1: Abiotic stresses such as salinity, water (drought and flooding), and heat are a few of the many factors that directly impact the agronomical traits and yield of crops [ 1].
2: Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most important food crops, third-largest after rice and wheat in terms of human consumption [ 2].
3: This crop can also be used commercially as a health food because it is rich in antioxidants, minerals, and dietary fibers [ 3].
4: However, as a consequence of global warming, a continuous increase in temperature leads to multiple stresses, including heat and salinity.
5: Consequently, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated inside the cells, which, if not scavenged, can lead to severe oxidative stress to plants [ 3].
6: ROS can be scavenged using an array of enzymatic [such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase] [ 3] and non-enzymatic mechanisms (glutathione, -tocopherol, carotenoids, flavonoids) [ 3 5].
7: Impaired function or decreased activity of any of these ROS scavenging activities can also have a devastating impact on the plants growth and yield [ 6].
8: Stress also affects the quality of potato tubers by altering sugar and solid content [ 7].
9: A limited understanding of heat and salt tolerance regulation mechanisms through TFs (transcription factors) hinders elite cultivars development with higher stress tolerance [ 7,  8].
10: The complete genome sequence data of potato (haploid genome content of 840 Mb) offers an excellent opportunity to explore gene families, their downstream pathways, and regulation mechanisms under stress conditions.

0: The human and mouse brain are composed of ~86 billion 1,  2 and 71 million 3 neurons, respectively.
1: Furthermore, it has been estimated that neurons can contain thousands to tens of thousands of synapses that are capable of forming billions to trillions of synaptic connections 4,  5.
2: In contrast,  C. elegans possesses 302 neurons that form ~7500 synaptic connections 6.
3: These findings and the observation that metazoan species have comparable numbers of protein coding genes highlight the importance of the evolution of gene regulatory complexity as a determinant of neuronal diversity.
4: Neurons are categorized into different subtypes depending on a multitude of related factors, including molecular composition, morphology, location, and physiology 7, and hundreds of distinct subtypes have been defined in the mammalian brain 8.
5: Previous efforts directed at classifying neuronal subtypes using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), most recently at a single-cell level, have largely focused on profiling gene expression (GE) changes 9.

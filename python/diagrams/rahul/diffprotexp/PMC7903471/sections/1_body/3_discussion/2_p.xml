<p>The results displayed differences in the expression levels of a number of lncRNAs between normal and osteoarthritis cartilage, ranging from a few to several thousands. The variable differences may be attributed to the small sample size. However, RT-qPCR was performed to verify the functions of randomly selected lncRNAs. The results suggested that the trend was similar to that of the microarray data, which provided evidence of differential lncRNA expression levels between normal and osteoarthritis cartilage.</p>

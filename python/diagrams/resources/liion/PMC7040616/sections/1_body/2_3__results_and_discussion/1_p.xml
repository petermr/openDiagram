<p>The XRD pattern of the LLZNO powder is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f002">Figure 2</xref>b and was identified as cubic phase (PDF 63-0174). The LD result and SEM image of the LLZNO powder after the attrition milling process, which demonstrated a submicron powder, are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f002">Figure 2</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="materials-13-00560-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The D
 <sub>(10)</sub>, D
 <sub>(50)</sub>, D
 <sub>(90),</sub> and primary particle size of the submicron LLZNO powder were 0.43 µm, 0.59 µm, 0.812 µm, and about 0.1 µm, respectively. The value of D
 <sub>(3,2)</sub> (0.575 µm) is similar to that of D
 <sub>(4,3)</sub> (0.607 µm), which indicates that the prepared powder had a uniform particle-size distribution. In addition, the powder also had a higher specific surface area (2007 m
 <sup>2</sup>/kg), which means that the powder had a high sintering activity, which can promote crystal growth and the rapid densification of ceramics in the sintering process.

<p>It has been suggested that epigenetic marks may have a connection with signaling reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox metabolism, due to it has been observed that the enzymes responsible for histone methylation are sensitive to the production of ROS [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on epigenetic mechanisms in plants. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine changes in the 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation status of the transgenic tobacco H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> overproducing line (L8), which has resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in comparison with the azygous stress-susceptible control (L1). This knowledge could be a fundamental insight into the role of the epigenetic plant strategies used in the adaptation to stress conditions, and the role of the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the physiological adaptation, with the expectation of being applied to enhance the plant tolerance to changing environments.

<p>To determine the functional implications of STCH-NKCC2 interaction, we first tested the impact of STCH co-expression on total NKCC2 protein abundance. Accordingly, Myc-NKCC2 was transfected singly or with GFP-STCH in HEK293 cells. Then, 48 h post-transfection, total protein lysates were harvested and the protein levels of NKCC2 and STCH were analyzed by immunoblotting, using either anti-Myc or anti-GFP antibodies. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, when increasing amounts of STCH (0.2–0.6 μg/well) were co-expressed with NKCC2 (0.2 μg/well), the protein levels of immature and mature forms of NKCC2 expression were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. To better visualize the expression of the immature form of NKCC2 during immunoblotting, we repeated these co-expression studies and performed cell lysis 16–18 h after cell transfection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, with 0.6 μg/well, STCH co-expression strikingly decreased the amount of immature and mature forms of NKCC2. As a consequence, total NKCC2 protein abundance was significantly decreased upon STCH co-expression (−51%;

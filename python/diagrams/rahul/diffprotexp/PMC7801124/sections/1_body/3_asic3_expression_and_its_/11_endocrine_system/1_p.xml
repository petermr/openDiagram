<p>Unlike work on the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, there has been little detailed investigation of how ASIC3 might contribute toward endocrine function. However, in an analysis of 606 Taiwanese individuals, 33 possessed the ASIC3 rs2288646A polymorphism and this was associated with a statistically significantly lower frequency of insulin resistance and lower fasting serum insulin levels [

 <sup>−/-</sup> mice, as well as wild-type mice administered ASIC3 inhibitors displayed improved glucose intolerance with enhanced insulin sensitivity [

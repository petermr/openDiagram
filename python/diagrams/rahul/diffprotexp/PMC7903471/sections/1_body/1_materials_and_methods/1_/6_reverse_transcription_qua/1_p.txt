0: To validate the reliability of the RNA-sequencing data, 6 differentially expressed lncRNAs were randomly selected and RT-qPCR was used to examine the expression level of the lncRNAs.
1: Total RNA was extracted from the cartilage using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2: RT-qPCR reactions were performed using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR kit (New England BioLabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3: The following thermocycling conditions were used: 15 sec at 55 C and 1 min at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 10 sec at 95 C and 30 sec at 60 C, and 30 sec at 50 C. GAPDH was used as an internal control and the relative expression levels of candidate lncRNAs were calculated using the 2 -Cq method ( 26).
4: GAPDH forwards primer, AATGGGCAGCCGTTAGGAAA and reverse primer, GCCCAATACGACCAAATCAGAG.
5: Experiments were conducted in at least triplicate.
6: The primer sequences that were used in the present study are listed in  Table SI.

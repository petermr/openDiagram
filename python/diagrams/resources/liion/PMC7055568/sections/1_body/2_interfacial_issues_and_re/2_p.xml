<p>Generally, there are three types of interface in the as‚Äêassembled battery with SCEs, including the interface between anode and SCEs, the interface between cathode and SCEs, and the interface between ceramic and polymer (

 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">91</xref> Furthermore, phase boundaries between polymer and ceramic fillers could increase the migration barrier for Li ions transportation, which results in high interfacial impedance and poor electrochemical performance of the batteries.

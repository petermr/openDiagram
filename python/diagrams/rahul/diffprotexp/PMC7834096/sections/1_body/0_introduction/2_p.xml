<p>AAF were proposed to have significantly contributed to the exceptional pathogenicity of the outbreak strain, e.g. by increasing the amount of Stx2 molecules absorbed through the colon epithelial cells by the tight adherence of a high number of bacterial cells [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Up to date, five different AAF subtypes are known. In addition to the EHEC outbreak strain [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and a recently discovered EAEC/EHEC hybrid strain [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], AAF are limited almost exclusively to EAEC. They are typically encoded on the large EAEC virulence plasmid pAA [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref>] and are activated by AggR [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is a central virulence regulator in EAEC [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. AAF have been described as surface structures that mediate aggregative adherence to eukaryotic cells, other bacteria, and abiotic surfaces in a characteristic “stacked-brick” or “honeycomb” adherence pattern [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

<p id="Par17">As an alphacoronavirus, PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sensed RNA virus with a genome of approximately 28 kb. The viral genome contains at least seven open reading frames (ORFs). Among the proteins encoded are four structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein [

To address this issue, high-throughput-based sequencing technology provides a powerful tool. For instance, transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) was applied to describe gene responses in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, most of this former work on host response at the cellular level was conducted in Vero cells, which are deficient in innate antiviral response.

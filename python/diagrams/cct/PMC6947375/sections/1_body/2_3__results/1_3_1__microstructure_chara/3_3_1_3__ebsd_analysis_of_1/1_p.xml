<p>The microstructures of 1.0C-1.5Cr steel after various processes were studied using EBSD, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f004">Figure 4</xref>. After spheroidization annealing, few low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs, &lt;10°) were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,a1). However, there were a large number of LAGBs in the cold rolled 1.0C-1.5Cr steels, and the fraction of LAGBs was as high as ~80% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f004">Figure 4</xref>b,b1). Recrystallization annealing only eliminated part of LAGBs, with a fraction of 70% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f004">Figure 4</xref>c,c1). Interestingly, the fraction of LAGBs after cold drawing significantly increased to ~90% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f004">Figure 4</xref>d,d1). Besides, the image quality map clearly showed that a few undissolved carbides existed at the boundaries of ferrite, connected with LAGBs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f004">Figure 4</xref>b–d). The observed phenomenon must be related to the difference between boundary diffusion and volume diffusion of elements that might occur during cold deformation. This is discussed in

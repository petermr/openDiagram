 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f030">Figure 30</xref> shows that at cooling rates faster than 0.5 K/s, the start of the LTR for 6005 is about 400 ± 10 °C, and the peaks of this reaction for all cooling rates faster than 0.16 K/s are located at about 320–340 °C. According to the solvi temperatures determined from first principles modelling in [
 <xref rid="B181-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>], this onset temperature is about 90 K below the solvus of the β’-phase. Hence this reaction is unlikely, due to formation of the β’-phase. Instead, the start temperature corresponds closely (within 10 K) to the solvi temperatures of the hexagonal Al

 <sub>2</sub> phase, the hexagonal Al
 <sub>4</sub>Mg
 <sub>8</sub>Si
 <sub>7</sub> phase and the orthorhombic Al–Mg–Si phase [

 <xref rid="B176-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>], and hence the dominant reaction is thought to be the formation of this Al

 <sub>7</sub> phase, which is termed B’ (for further discussion, see [
 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]). The length of LTR B’ particles is on the order of several hundreds of nm, while their aspect ratio is about 10 [
 <xref rid="B116-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The chemical composition of the rod-/lath-shaped precipitates consists of Al, Si and Mg, and sometimes Cu, as measured by TEM-EDS [
 <xref rid="B128-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. In most cases, more Si than Mg was detected; however, the chemical composition varied between the individual precipitates.

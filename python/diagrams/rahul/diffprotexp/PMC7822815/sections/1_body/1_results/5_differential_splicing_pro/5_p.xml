<p id="Par27">To further structural detail, we assigned SCOP domains for highly identical in silico translated proteins using the SUPERFAMILY hidden Markov models, and we identified 225 conserved domains within these proteins (Structural Classification of Proteins database, release 1.75, June 2009)

 </sup>. Identified domains belong to 146 domain families. About 45% of these domain families are common for proteins translated from differentially (upregulated or downregulated) and non-differentially (no change) spliced RNA isoforms. However, 16% of domain families are associated with differentially spliced RNA isoforms. This uniqueness of differential proteins is robust and is retained even when domains are combined into domain superfamilies (Fig.Â

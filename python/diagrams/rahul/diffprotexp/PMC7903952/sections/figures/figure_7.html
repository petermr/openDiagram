 <caption> Overexpressing LINC00466 promotes tumor growth of glioma in nude mice. ( A) Tumor weight and ( B) tumor size in oe-NC and oe-LINC00466 groups; ( C) The expression levels of LINC00466, mir-137 and PPP1R14B in the tumors; ( D) The protein levels of PPP1R14B, proteins which were related to EMT and proteins which were related to proliferation in tumor tissues were measured by WB assay ( E) The expression levels of PPP1R14B and Ki67 in tumor tissues were detected by IHC assay (10um). </caption>

<p>A subset of 7 cPTCs and 7 benign cystic thyroid lesions were included in the protein profiling and verification by Western blot analysis (

Case cPTC-5 was excluded from the data analysis, as a colloid goiter cyst was detected adjacent to the PTC, and therefore the integrity of the cyst fluid as PTC-related only could not be guaranteed. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were obtained for all 14 cases and used for IHC. In addition four of the cPTCs (cases 1, 4, 6, and 7) and 6 of the benign cystic lesions (Benign-2 excluded due to lack of fluid samples) from the LC-MS/MS screening were included in the ELISA analyses together with additionally 63 cases of cystic thyroid lesions (49 benign lesions and 13 cPTCs) (

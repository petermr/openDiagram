<p>According to cellular functions and processes, we identified changes in the expression of 12 cellular metabolism-related proteins (metabolic enzymes), 5 molecules involved in cytoskeleton, 3 molecules involved in energy metabolism, 2 molecules involved in signal transduction, 1 molecule involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, 1 molecule involved in cell cycle, 1 molecule involved in apoptosis-related proterin, 1 molecular chaperone, and 2 unknown proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our studies showed that the expression of several enzyme molecules including deoxyuridine 5â€²-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase, acyl- CoA-binding protein isoform 1, L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain OS, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E
 <sub>2</sub>N, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core I protein, glutathione synthetase, and Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase were differentially regulated by EV71.

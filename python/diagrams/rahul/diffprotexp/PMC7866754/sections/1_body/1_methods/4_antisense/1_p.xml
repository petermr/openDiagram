<p id="Par21">The first step to identify antisense peptides was to identify antisense transcripts from the pool of potentially novel MSTRG transcripts. Firstly, all the assembled transcripts were compared with reference transcripts using BEDtools intersect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], using parameters that only return transcript that is on the complementary strand of the reference transcript that it overlaps with. Peptides that are matched to these antisense transcripts are then compared with the protein sequences from six frame translation using Transeq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] to see which frame it originated from. Only peptides that are translated from frame 4 to 6 are considered translation evidence for antisense transcripts, because it could be degenerate peptides from reference genes due to six frame translation.

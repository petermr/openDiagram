<p id="Par44">In this study, to retain the topological structure of the network, the weight-loss genes are assigned default weights of 0 rather than being removed. By further analysis, we found 3 weight-loss genes (i.e., CDC2, ZBTB8 and TADA3L) included in the WMFVS result, 7 weight-loss genes (i.e., CDC2, ZBTB8, RhoGDI, TADA3L, RNF12, NP and MAP3K7IP1) contained in at least one of the 875 random MFVS results, and no weight-loss genes in the WFVS result. In particular, CDC2 and ZBTB8 were included in all the random MFVS results as well as in the WMFVS result. The CDC2 gene is related to the highly conserved protein CDK1, which functions as a serine/threonine kinase and is a key player in cell cycle regulation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting that ZBTB8 may act as a transcriptional repressor or be involved in tumorigenesis. The uncovering of CDC2 and ZBTB8 genes illustrates that the WMFVS method may address the disadvantage of traditional DEG methods in missing-data cases.

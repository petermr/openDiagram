<p>The hypervirulent German outbreak strain EHEC O104:H4 encoded AAF/I, whereas EAEC strain 55989, one of its closest known relatives, encoded AAF/III [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The combination of a Stx2-encoding prophage with typical EAEC virulence markers was proposed to have resulted in the unusually aggressive phenotype and we had previously observed that Stx2 phage-cured EHEC O104:H4 formed larger aggregates than other tested EAEC strains on eukaryotic cells

 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Against this background, we wanted to gain insights into phenotypic differences mediated by AAF/I and AAF/III. In order to assess potential differences, we decided to use closely and more distantly related reference fimbriae for a phenotypic comparison (

 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Due to a heavily stained matrix around the cells, the imaging of AAF expression in the EAEC 55989 strain background was very challenging. We anticipate that capsular polysaccharide or colanic acid is the main component of this matrix as large amounts of shedded “slime” blebs can be seen on the bacterial cell surface (

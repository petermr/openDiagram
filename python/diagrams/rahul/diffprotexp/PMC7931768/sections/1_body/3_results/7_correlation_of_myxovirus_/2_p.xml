<p>As expected, the MXA immunoreactive area was large and diffusely distributed throughout the epidermis in participants with CLE, with less robust multifocal immunoreactivity in the dermis. MXA expression ranged from very low to absent in HVs. A Spearmanâ€™s correlation between per cent area of MXA immunoreactivity and IFN mRNA gene cluster expression was highly significant (dermis, rho=0.86, p&lt;0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). As most of the IFN gene cluster comprised IFN response genes, including MXA, and MXA is expressed in the epidermis, this result was expected and indicated that tape-derived RNA offers a potential surrogate for MXA protein quantification in punch biopsies.

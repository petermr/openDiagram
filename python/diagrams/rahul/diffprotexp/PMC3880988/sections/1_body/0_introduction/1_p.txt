0: In vivo and  in vitro cell-mediated cartilage regeneration has been extensively studied in both human and animal models.
1: It has been demonstrated that when articular cartilage defects regenerate, they form mainly fibro-cartilaginous tissue, which has inferior biochemical and biomechanical properties as compared to hyaline cartilage  1.
2: It has been mentioned that the development of fibrocartilage tissue can be attenuated if the appropriate cartilage proteins are expressed.
3: It is therefore believed that further improvement to the cartilage repair outcomes can be achieved by ensuring that the appropriate proteins, which may also involve the proteins predominantly found in hyaline matrix, are expressed within the repaired cartilage site.
4: One way to ensure that this is achieved is through the implantation of cells that have the ability to express the typical proteins required to obtain optimal tissue repair.
5: The effect of implanting these cells has been observed in many studies and is presently being used as acceptable therapies in many countries  2.
6: In most studies, the use of autologous chondrocyte is common  3.
7: However, the use of these cells appears to only provide good medium-term outcomes attributed to the ageing transplanted cells, which is expected of any adult somatic cells  1.

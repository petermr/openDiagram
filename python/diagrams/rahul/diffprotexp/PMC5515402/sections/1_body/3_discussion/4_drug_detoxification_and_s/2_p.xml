<p>The heat shock protein, HSP90B, was found overexpressed and associated with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR; 3.68E00) and xenobiotic metabolism (2.84E00) pathways. HSP90B commonly acts as a chaperone molecule facilitating the proper folding of proteins in ATP-dependent reactions. This protein is also induced upon stress and xenobiotic exposure [

0: RNA-seq libraries were prepared following the standard Illumina protocols by Novogene (Beijing, China).
1: In brief, mRNA (at least 3 g, equally pooled from 5 hens) were enriched from total RNA by poly-A oligo-attached magnetic beads with an integrity value > 8.0.
2: Double-stranded complementary DNA was synthesized with random hexamer primers and purified with AMPure XP beads.
3: Inserts with expected size were concentrated and subjected for transcriptome analyses.

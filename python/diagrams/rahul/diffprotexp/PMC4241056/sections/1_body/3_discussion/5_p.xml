<p>The SOD, as a key enzyme in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anion to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> accumulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the present study, the expressions of Cu, Zn-SOD in three Se treatment groups were lower than that of the control groups. It suggested that the less H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> accumulation in the Se treatment groups is associated with the lower expression of Cu, Zn-SOD. In addition, the similar levels of Cu, Zn-SOD were observed between groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met.

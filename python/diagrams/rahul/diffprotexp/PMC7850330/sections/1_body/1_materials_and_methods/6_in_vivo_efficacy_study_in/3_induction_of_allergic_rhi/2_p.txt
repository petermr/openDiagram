0: Allergic rhinitis rabbit models were developed according to a modified reported protocol (Sagit et al.,  2017).
1: The rabbits were sensitized via intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 1  ml freshly prepared ovalbumin every other day over 7  days followed by intranasal administration of 1  ml physiological saline (PS) having 0.3  mg ovalbumin and 30  mg Al(OH) 3 for 14  days (Sagit et al.,  2017; Senturk et al.,  2018).
2: Treatment was initiated after the 21  days of the induction and for 14  days.
3: The studied formulations were administered as 70  l dose holding 17  g of the loratadine and 7  g of sulpiride in every nostril by means of a micropipette with a low-density polyethylene tubing, having an internal diameter of 0.1  mm at the administration site.

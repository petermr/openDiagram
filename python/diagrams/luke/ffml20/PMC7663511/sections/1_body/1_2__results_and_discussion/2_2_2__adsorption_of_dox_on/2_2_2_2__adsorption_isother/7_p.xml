<p>The values of coefficients obtained assuming the Temkin model of adsorption collected in 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-08230-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> may suggest that the process of DOX adsorption on carbon nanotubes can be treated as chemisorption. Moreover, the process is exothermal in nature for both types of nanotubes. It is worth noticing that the heat of sorption differs diametrically for oxidized and pristine systems that suggest competitive phenomena, from the point of view of energy effects and different ways of adsorption. Considering adsorption processes for different systems with MWCNTs, it can be concluded that the vast majority of other authors report exhibit low (near zero) but a positive value of the heat of sorption [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-08230" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Temkin equation allows a description of the adsorption process for modified carbon nanotubes (Langmuir equation). It confirms different mechanisms of DOX adsorption in the mentioned cases. The non-ideal fit of the Temkin equation to the experimental data can be a consequence of a great range of ion concentration [

 <sub>t</sub>, which can suggest a weak interaction between the DOX and the sorbent, should be treated with caution and should not lead to a further strict conclusion [

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) is a critical component of synaptic activity and neuronal function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Our RNA-Seq data indicated the conversion of iPSCs into NSCs is marked by a significant downregulation of a gene encoding for a serotonin-specific GPCR, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (
 <italic>HTR7</italic>). In addition, adenylate cyclase 2 (
 <italic>ADCY2</italic>) was also downregulated at this time and is known to act immediately downstream of HTRs. Together, the downregulation of 
 <italic>HTR7</italic> and 
 <italic>ADCY2</italic> indicates a functional silencing of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. Furthermore, multiple genes involved in the activation of Ca

 </sup> signaling were downregulated: GPCR subunit alpha-14 (
 <italic>GNA14</italic>), an activator of phospholipase C (LPC); two gene groups encoding inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (
 <italic>ITPR2</italic> and 
 <italic>ITPR3</italic>); and ryanodine receptor 2 (
 <italic>RYR2</italic>). (Fig.

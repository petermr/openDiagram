<p>Studies investigating the genetics and biochemistry of bacterial alkane degradation have mainly focused on the enzymes involved in the initial step of oxidizing 
 <italic>n-</italic>alkanes, particularly medium-length chains (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Rojo, 2009</xref>). Terminal aerobic alkane degradation occurs through sequential oxidation of a terminal carbon initiated by alkane monooxygenases, which produce primary alcohols, and followed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, produces the corresponding aldehydes and fatty acids, respectively (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2013</xref>). Bacteria capable of degrading medium-chain alkanes frequently contain CYP153-type cytochrome P450s and/or homolog of well characterized integral membrane non-heme iron alkane monooxygenases, such as AlkB (

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Shao, 2013</xref>). The degradation mechanisms of long-chain alkane oxidation are less well understood. Bacteria degrading long-chain alkanes may contain a long-chain alkane monooxygenase such as AlmA, and/or a thermophilic soluble long-chain alkane monooxygenase, such as LadA from

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Throne-Holst et al., 2007</xref>). However, the genes that code for these proteins are not present in the 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> genome (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Golyshin et al., 2013</xref>) and this study provides evidence that suggests an alternative enzyme system used by 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> for long-chain alkane oxidation.

0: Sample S3 was porous silicon nanowires (pSi-NWs) synthesized through metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) following the procedure of Zhang et al.
1: [ 43] using sample S1 as feedstock.
2: Si powder was degreased in a Diener Electronic ZEPTO plasma cleaner under O 2 for 5 min.
3: Then, 1 g of sample S1 were added to a 100 mL solution of 75 mL H 2O, 25 mL HF (5M) and 0.344 g AgNO 3.
4: The Ag plating proceeded at room temperature for 5 min.
5: After the first step (HF/AgNO 3) of etching, we observe the formation of small silver particles on the surface of silicon particles.
6: These particles grew in size and formed silver dendrites.
7: During the first minutes of etching in the second solution (HF/H 2O 2), the silver particles sink into the substrate, the silver dendrites grow on and the nanowires are formed as the remaining of the unetched silicon [ 58].
8: Silver-deposited Si particles were etched in 5M HF and 0.3 M H 2O 2 at room temperature.
9: The metal-assisted chemical etching was performed for 8 min in an ultrasonic bath and then stopped by adding a large amount of deionized water to the etching solution.
10: The etched Si powder was filtered through a micropore filter paper and rinsed several times with deionized water.
11: The Ag particles loaded on the etched Si powder were easily removed with standard Ag etchant (NH 4OH:H 2O 2 = 3:1 ( v/ v)).
12: The product, denoted as sample S3, was rinsed with deionized water and dried.

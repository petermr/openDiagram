<p id="Par68">In previous work, several genetically-linked, differentially-expressed or functionally-associated apomixis candidate genes were reported in 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> and other related species [

 <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref> shows some of these candidate genes (with their respective identifiers) and 49 DETs displaying significant similarity them, as well as the stages at which differential expression is detected, the Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC and padj values for each developmental stage and the annotation of the sequence. Ocassionally, different DETs showed the same annotation but displayed contrasting expression profiles, pointing to the existence of transcripts variants of the same gene expressing at distinct reproductive stages. Ten (10) DETs showed different expression levels at all developmental stages, three were specific for premeiosis, five for meiosis, three for postmeiosis and nine for anthesis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>). The rest revealed differential expression levels at more than one stage. The identities of DETs include, among others,

 <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>). Moreover, an examination of the candidate expression levels revealed some variation between stages and/or reproductive modes. For example, transcript TRpn_185717 which codifies for an ARGONAUTE 104 protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], showed a constant higher level of expression in the apomictic genotype during all the developmental stages, while its expression decreased from premeiosis to anthesis in the sexual one (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Transcript TRpn_57024, with high similarity to a gibberellin receptor (
 <italic>GID1</italic>), exhibited an insignificant expression in the apomictic genotype at all developmental stages with a peak at anthesis, while it was steadily expressed at low levels in sexual genotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). Two other genes, 
 <italic>ORC3b</italic> (TRpn_33086/TRpn_96407) and 
 <italic>APOSTART2</italic> (TRpn_175767 /TRpn_52614) showed the same expression patterns that exhibited in the in vivo experiments reported in 
 <italic>P. simplex</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pratensis</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c-f) [

0: Total protein quantification was performed using Coomassie Plus assay as per the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific).
1: Briefly, 10 l of the samples or albumin (BSA) standards were pipetted into a 96 well plate in duplicate.
2: 300 l of Coomassie Plus reagent was added to each well and placed on a plate shaker protected from sunlight for 510 minutes.
3: The absorbance of each sample was read at 595 nm on a spectrophotometric plate reader and blanked against water.
4: Standard dilutions were used to derive a four-parameter best-fit standard curve to calculate sample protein concentration (g/ml).
5: HA-ELISA values were then normalized against total protein content of the sample for the purposes of this study.
6: No Coomassie assay was performed for serum samples.

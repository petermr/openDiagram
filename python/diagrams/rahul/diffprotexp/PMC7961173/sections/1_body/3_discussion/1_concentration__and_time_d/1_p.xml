<p id="Par46">In the current study, the HTR-8/SVneo cell line was used the evaluate DCVC concentration- and time-dependent effects on gene expression patterns in placental cells. Both 6-h and 12-h differentially expressed genes demonstrated larger magnitude altered gene expression with 20 µM DCVC treatment compared to 10 µM, indicating a concentration-dependent response. Likewise, genes differentially expressed by 10 µM and 20 µM DCVC had larger expression changes with 12-h, compared to 6-h, indicating a time-dependent response. These results are consistent with several of our previous studies that demonstrated DCVC time- and concentration-dependent effects on mitochondrial dysfunction (Elkin et al.

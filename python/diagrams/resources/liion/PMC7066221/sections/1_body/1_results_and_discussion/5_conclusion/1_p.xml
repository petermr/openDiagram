<p id="p0175">Stable performance of Zn-ion batteries was realized through a first reported cobalt-catalyzed recovery strategy, which was achieved by facilitating the deposition of active Mn compound in the cathode. The discharge capacity of a Mn-based cathode was determined by (1) the initial amount and valence of Mn in the solid Mn-based cathode before cycling, (2) the dissolution amount of the Mn cathode, and (3) most importantly, the deposition amount of active Mn compound. The facilitation of deposition is achieved by utilizing a facile cobalt modification strategy that integrated the well-dispersed, cobalt-containing species into the defective δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets. Verified by both practical coin-type batteries and a newly designed home-made electrolyzer system, the deposition of active Mn compound was confirmed to be significantly facilitated with cobalt-based compounds (e.g., Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>) and the bound cobalt-containing species (e.g., Co(II) and Co(III)) in the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode, whereas the unbound Co
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte showed no significant impact on the deposition process. In addition, the concentration of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> additives and the volume of the electrolyte are also vital parameters for capacity recovery of the cathode. For a fair performance comparison, these two parameters should be well controlled and clearly indicated in future publications of Mn-based cathode for Zn-ion batteries. Overall, this work provides a deeper insight into the deposition behaviors of the active cathode material and its significant influence on the stable performance of aqueous Zn-ion batteries. This work could also provide inspiration for the materials engineering for future functionalized cathodes, especially for other conversion-type battery cathodes that suffer from the similar dissolution issue, for example, manganese-based cathodes for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries and sulfur cathodes for Li-S and Na-S batteries.

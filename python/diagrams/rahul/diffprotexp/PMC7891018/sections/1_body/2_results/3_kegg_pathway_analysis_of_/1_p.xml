<p id="Par35">KEGG analysis of signaling pathways involving the differentially expressed proteins was conducted. The differentially expressed proteins were involved in 37 signaling pathways, 9 of which were significantly different (

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A total of 7.69% were involved in metabolic processes, 3.85% of which participated in carbohydrate metabolism, 3.85% in lipid metabolism, and 23.08% in genetic information processes. Of the 23.08%, 7.69% participated in the transcription process; 11.54% participated in protein folding, classification, and degradation processes; 7.69% were involved in antigen processing and presentation in the immune system; 7.69% were involved in virus infection; and 7.69% participated in parasitic infection. These findings indicate that the differential proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation of the immune system and viral infectious diseases have important roles in the differences between host cells infected with different subtypes of influenza virus.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In order to differentiate between the analyzed <italic>Ocotea</italic> samples, a hierarchical cluster analysis using the chemical constituents was carried out and the resulting dendrogram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01081-f002">Figure 2</xref>. According to these results, the samples were grouped in two main groups with similarity of 46.6%. Group I is characterized by oils from <italic>O. caudata</italic>, <italic>O. whitei</italic>, and <italic>O. floribunda</italic>, which present high amounts of &#945;-pinene (9.8&#8211;22.5%) and &#946;-pinene (7.3&#8211;21.3%). A higher similarity (74.1%) was found with <italic>O. caudata</italic> and <italic>O. whitei</italic> due the proportions of &#945;-pinene, &#946;-pinene, and &#946;-caryophyllene (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t002">Table 2</xref>). The main compound of <italic>O. floribunda</italic> oil was the diterpene kaurene (34.0%) and it decreased its similarity level. Group II includes <italic>O. cujumary</italic>, <italic>O. caniculata</italic>, and <italic>O. veraguensis</italic> oils, the samples <bold>Cuj-L</bold> and <bold>Can-L</bold> present similar amounts of &#946;-caryophyllene (22.2% and 18.9%, respectively). A lower similarity was found in sample <bold>Ver-L</bold>, which was rich in bulnesol (29.0%) and <italic>p</italic>-cymene (19.8%).</p>

<p>Based on the resulting data from the Affymetrix microarray profiling, we constructed an mRNA–lncRNA expression correlation network in both the TC–EC model and EC alone to identify the correlations between mRNAs and lncRNAs. According to the changes of the expression status of differential molecules between the two networks, we identified the top 10 differential mRNAs (PRKAA2, NLGN4X, ST6GALNAC3, DGAT1, TRIB1, GRPR, and MLLT11) and lncRNAs (n339695, n378130, and n410438) in the tumor–endothelium interaction (

0: Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter of spinal nociception, with activation of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) being a central mediator of dorsal horn plasticity in both physiological and pathological pain states [ 810].
1: NMDARs are tetra-heteromeric complexes consisting of a variety of possible combinations of GluN1, GluN2, and/or GluN3 subunits [ 11].
2: There are four genetically encoded isoforms of the GluN2 subunit, GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C, and GluN2D, and the differential composition of specific GluN2 subtypes in NMDAR complexes enables diversity in the function and regulation of NMDARs across CNS regions and neuron subpopulations.
3: For example, GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs are differentially phosphorylated by Src family kinases and mediate distinct forms of plasticity in brain regions such as the hippocampus [ 12].
4: However, despite our understanding of the specific roles of individual GluN2-NMDAR subunits in mediating synaptic transmission and plasticity in the brain, this knowledge is almost exclusively based on studies conducted in male or unsexed animals.
5: Given that divergent molecular mechanisms of spinal pain processing are being identified between sexes [ 13], it is critical to systematically characterize the expression profiles of NMDAR subunits in the spinal cord (and brain) in both males and females.

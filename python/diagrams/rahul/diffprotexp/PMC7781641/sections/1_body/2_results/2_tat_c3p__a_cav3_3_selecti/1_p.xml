<p>Since Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 was upregulated in the TG of FRICT-ION mice, we hypothesized that blocking this channel would alleviate neuropathic pain in our model. To test this we used the Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3-selective blocking peptide TAT-C3P, which is highly selective for Cav3.3 over other Cav3 subtypes [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We demonstrated a significant increase (p &lt; 0.0001, 2-way ANOVA with 
 <italic>posthoc</italic> Tukey’s test) in mechanical withdrawal thresholds in both male (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a</xref>) and female (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1b</xref>) FRICT-ION mice. The control TAT-C3D peptide, which does not block Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3, produced no significant change (p &gt; 0.05, 2-way ANOVA) in withdrawal thresholds in either male or female FRICT-ION mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a-b</xref>). We also unexpectedly found that blocking Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 resulted in a more significant increase in withdrawal threshold in female than male mice. Comparing the peak anti-allodynic effect observed at the 4 h post-TAT-C3P injection time point, we show that female FRICT-ION mice withdrawal thresholds were significantly higher than male FRICT-ION mice withdrawal thresholds (

 <italic>posthoc</italic> Tukey’s test).

<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) software (version 17.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). The values of sGAG concentrations were presented as mean ± SD. Comparisons of variables between the two groups were analyzed using parametric independent pair-wise student 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. Differences were considered statistically significant at 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. 2-DE gels were analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots software version 4.4 (Nonlinear Inc., NC, USA). Differentially expressed proteins were documented as mean of normalized log volume ± standard error (SE). Parametric statistical analysis using ANOVA test was also performed to determine the statistical significance of the results. Statistically significant differences were regarded at 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. The power of current study was 88.5% calculated using Progenesis SameSpots software.

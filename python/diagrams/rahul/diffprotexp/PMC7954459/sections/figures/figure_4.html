 <caption> Differentially expressed miRNAs between JGK 3 and Himchana 1 and their targets. (a) Number of differentially expressed miRNAs between Himchana 1 and JGK 3 at each stage of seed development. (b) Boxplot showing expression of genes that are targeted by differentially expressed (upregulated and downregulated) miRNAs. (c) Enriched GO (biological process) terms in the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs at each stage of seed development. Differential expression (up or down‐regulation) in JGK 3 at different stages of seed development are given on the top of each column. The color scale and values in the colored boxes represent P‐value of enrichment. (d) Number of differentially expressed miRNAs and their differentially expressed target genes in stages of seed development showing positive and antagonistic correlation. (e) Heatmap showing the differential expression of miRNAs and their target genes at the given stage (indicated on the right). The values in colored boxes (green, up‐regulated, and red, down‐regulated) represent a fold‐change expression of miRNAs and their target genes between the cultivars </caption>

0: MicroRNA (miRNA), a diverse group of small noncoding RNAs, has emerged as a focal research object for its critical role in post-transcriptional regulation.
1: MiRNA-34b-5p (miR-34b-5p) has been found to function in a wide range of biological activities such as the angiogenesis of thyroid carcinoma cells [ 8] and recurrent seizure-induced astrocyte apoptosis [ 9].
2: Recently, studies have reported that miR-34b-5p is associated with sepsis-induced organ injury.
3: For instance, down-regulation of miR-34b-5p suppressed lung inflammation and apoptosis in sepsis-induced acute lung injury [ 10, 11].
4: However, what role miR-34b-5p plays in septic AKI is barely known.

0: Cultured neonatal mouse and rat microglia, as well as acutely isolated microglia from mouse brain or tissue printed microglia from rat brain have been shown to express K V1.3 currents by whole-cell patch-clamp that increase substantially following  in vitro stimulation or  in vivo intracerebroventricular injection with the TLR-4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [ 1418].
1: Stimulation with the gram-negative cell wall component LPS is widely used to induce a classically activated M1-like state of microglia simulating general inflammation like would be associated with a bacterial infection [ 19, 20].
2: In the field of neuroimmunology LPS stimulated microglia should ideally be called M(LPS) microglia based on the stimulus used to induce polarization to avoid using the M1/M2 terminology, which is regarded as oversimplified [ 21], but nevertheless widely used because of its therapeutic attractiveness.
3: Following stimulation with LPS increased K V1.3 expression can be observed at the mRNA level and at the protein level by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and as increased current density measured by whole-cell patch-clamp [ 1518].
4: A similar, but slightly less intense increase in Kv1.3 expression occurs when cultured neonatal microglia are stimulated with oligomeric amyloid- (AO) or -synuclein [ 7, 8], two proteins that are misfolded and aggregated in Alzheimers or Parkinsons disease, and which are often used to create an  in vitro model of microglia responses associated with the respective disease.

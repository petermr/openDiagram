<p>These findings indicate that, despite the low dose achieved in this trial, raloxifene delayed disease progression, decreased SOD1-G93A aggregates, and increased transcription of several proteasome genes as well as some genes encoding DUBs. Therefore, collectively these observations support the exciting possibility that raloxifene treatment in humans, where chronic treatment can achieve the same dose as the acute treatment observed in mice, may have significant clinical impact in delaying the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

0: RNA methylation modifications mainly include m 6A, m 5C, m 1A, m 7G, and so on.
1: Previous studies have shown that these modifications play important roles in the stability, processing, and genetic information transmission of mRNA ( Liu and Jia, 2014;  Oerum et al., 2017).
2: Known mutations in RNA-modifying enzymes are closely related to human diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and mitochondrial-related defects ( Jonkhout et al., 2017).
3: The degree of methylation of specific genes can be used as a diagnostic indicator of cancer ( Li W. et al., 2017;  Traube and Carell, 2017).
4: 5-Methylcytosine (m 5C) includes DNA and RNA methylation modifications, in which the methyl group is transferred to a specific base by using  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor under the catalysis of methyltransferase.
5: m 5C RNA modification has been found to be highly abundant in tRNA and rRNA ( Motorin et al., 2010).
6: Meanwhile, high throughput sequencing has been used to verify the widespread presence of m 5C in non-coding RNA and coding RNA ( Squires et al., 2012).
7: It has been reported that m 5C modification controls many functions: protein translational regulation, RNA processing, regulating stem cell function and stress response, and promoting tRNA stability and protein synthesis ( Aslan et al., 1967;  Blanco et al., 2016;  Liu et al., 2017;  Tuorto et al., 2012).
8: However, the involvement of m 5C modification in GI cancer has not been systematically reported yet.

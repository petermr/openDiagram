  <p>The 
   <italic>yjbH</italic> gene is responsible for pathogenicity in silkworm. (a). Gene organization. (b). Pathogenicity of 
   <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn introduced with the 
   <italic>yjbI, yjbIH, and yjbH</italic> genes c. Pathogenicity of 
   <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tn strain introduced with the 
   <italic>yjbH</italic> gene. Overnight cultures of 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were serially diluted and injected into the silkworm hemolymph (n = 5), and LD
   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from the survival at 30 h post-infection by logistic regression analysis using logit link function. Data are mean ± SEM of triplicate experiments and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test compared with the WT (*

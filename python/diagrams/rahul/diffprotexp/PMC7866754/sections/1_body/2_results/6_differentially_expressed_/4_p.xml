<p id="Par51">Since there is no function annotated for the parent gene of this 3′UTR other than it encodes a conserved protein, its structures with and without the 3′ extension were predicted using the template-based I-TASSER [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. It appears that the isoform with extra helices at the 3′-end (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, highlighted in red) has a very different structure than the one without, where the former is predicted to have a more compact, ordered structure and likely to bind to a peptide substrate, while the latter contains a lot of disordered loops with nucleic acid substrate. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of extra helices allows the parent protein to tether to the membrane and adopt a more stable structure to bind to different substrates. When the parasite matures into salivary gland sporozoite, it expresses the canonical protein with no transmembrane helices, which may be released into the extracellular environment given its non-cytoplasmic domain and potentially involved in the host-parasite interaction upon infection.

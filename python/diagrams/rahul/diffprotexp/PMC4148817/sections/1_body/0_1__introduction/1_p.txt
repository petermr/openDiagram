0: Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at atomic and molecular scales from 1 to 100 nanometers and the creation of new materials with wide ranging applications in medicine, electronics, biomaterials and energy production.
1: The special properties of nanoparticles include unique surface area/volume ratios, refractive indices, and biological and chemical reactivity.
2: These properties help to extend their applications, but raise concerns about their toxicity and environmental impact [ 1, 2].
3: Potential effects on human health are an issue in the manufacturing workplace and after environmental exposure.
4: Likewise, research into the rational delivery and targeting of nanomedicines has yielded promising results, but clearance and toxicity are poorly understood and adverse effects on human health remain a potential problem [ 3].

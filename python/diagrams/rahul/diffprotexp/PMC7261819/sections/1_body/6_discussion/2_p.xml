<p>As has been noticed before and can be seen also from our results, Limma performs well for proteomics data even though it has been developed for expression microarrays. Importantly, we show here that the performance can be further improved by modifying Limma's variance prior estimation to consider the dependence of variance on the number of detected peptides/PSMs per protein. Our tool, DEqMS, performs this modified variance estimation (

Further, our method allows for inclusion of proteins quantified with low number of PSMs without increasing false positive rates, thus salvaging a large portion of low abundant proteins for the downstream analysis. This increases the chance of important biological findings. On all here tested data sets both label or label-free quantification, DEqMS consistently provides leading performance. The other two recently proposed method, EBRC and ROTS both have their own limitations. For instance, EBRC is developed only for label-free data, and whereas ROTS has competitive results, it is limited to two group comparisons only, lacking the flexibility to analyze multiple group experiments. Compared with Limma, DEqMS clearly performs better in small sample size experiments (shown in data set D4) because of improved protein variance estimate (

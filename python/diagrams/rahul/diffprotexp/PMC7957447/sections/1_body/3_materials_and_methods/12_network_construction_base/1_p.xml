<p id="Par39">To decipher dysregulated pathways in COVID-19 patients, a systems analysis framework based on a differential co-expression (DC) network was constructed. Firstly, the R package DGCA was recruited to calculate differences in correlation between molecular (including protein, lipid, and metabolite) pairs in various conditions (non-ICU vs ICU and Cluster 1 vs Cluster 2) [

Three multiscale embedded networks were constructed using MEGENA for ICU comparison group, Cluster comparison group and identical differential correlation between them. Furthermore, to find highly connected molecules, which may have the same biological function, MEGENA was employed to detect their clustering structures in each network [

Finally, three networks, capturing significant differential correlation in each comparison group were retained: DC network between ICU and non-ICU (2167 nodes, 4801 edges), DC network between Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 (2167 nodes, 5818 edges), and identical DC network (1917 nodes, 2364 edges). Nodes with the highest degree in each network and molecule in the same module with nodes were explored to identify primary molecule changes. As melatonin and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid shared the same metabolic pathway, their subnetworks were integrated in the identical DC network. Network visualization was executed using Cytoscape [

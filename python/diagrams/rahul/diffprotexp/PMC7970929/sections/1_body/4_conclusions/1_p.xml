<p id="Par41">This is the first report of comprehensive transcriptome profiling of the grass halophyte 
 <italic>Urochondra setulosa</italic> under increasing salt concentrations. In the Poaceae family, 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic> belongs to subfamily Chloridoideae which is not explored genomically in comparison to other major grass species like rice, wheat, maize or sorghum. Therefore, in-depth comparative transcriptomic analysis of leaf tissues were performed at ECe 30 dS/m (~ 300 mM NaCl), 40 dS/m (~ 400 mM NaCl), and 50 dS/m (~ 500 mM NaCl). The de novo transcriptome sequences were analyzed using the GO and KEGG tools which allowed annotation of a considerable portion of the transcriptome. Analysis of species without any reference genomic databases, transcriptome is the finest critical tool to explore the genic compartment among plants. One of the aspects of this work was to build a reference transcriptome using NGS technology for further annotation and identification of specific genes providing survival at high salt concentration as well as genes of economic and evolutionary importance. The main emphasis was on how the regulation of transcription factors and signalling transcripts are influenced by salinity. Moreover, validation of RNAseq results was performed using real time PCR analysis.

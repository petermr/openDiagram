0: For SWATH-MS data acquisition, the same mass spectrometer and LC-MS/MS setup was operated essentially as described before [ 39,  40], using a dwell time of 100 ms to cover the mass range of 4001,200  m/z and 32 windows of 25 Da effective isolation width.
1: The collision energy for each window was set using the collision energy of a 2+ ion centered in the middle of the window with a spread of 15 eV.

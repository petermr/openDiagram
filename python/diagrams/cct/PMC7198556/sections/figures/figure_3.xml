  <p>Micrographs of the hardened zone. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Taken at 1000 μm depth: pure martensite with some manganese sulphides. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Taken at 2500 μm shows the first occurrence of ferrite (circled) indicating that the material does not entirely reach Ac
   <sub>3</sub> any more due to local differences in chemistry (segregations). In (
   <bold>c</bold>) at a depth of 4000 μm, the original ferritic areas only partly transformed into the austenitic phase, remaining in their original structure of the base metal. In (
   <bold>d</bold>), the first traces of pearlite are found at 4400 μm, where some of the microstructure did not transform into austenite, indicating that the end temperature for Ac
   <sub>1</sub> transformation was not reached at this depth.

<p>Proteins that were significantly differentially expressed as shown in 2-D gel electrophoresis included Nm23/Nucleoside diphosphate kinase A protein (NM23-H1), kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5B), and protein kinase C epsilon type (PKC-ε). These proteins could be closely related to neurogenesis. Results from western blotting confirmed that both PKC-ε and KIF5B increased with time of induction. KIF5B is found in nerve and glial cells, functions to maintain synaptic function and regulation of neural plasticity in mature neurons, and plays an important role in the presynaptic nerve function. Our results could match a previous finding that KIF5B is up-regulated in the developing rat CNS [

 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results indicated that the PKC-ε level measured by western blotting increased with time until 3 days after induction and then remained at a high level. The correlation between PKC-ε and TrkB suggested that there is cross-talk between PKC-ε and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which plays a role in the survival of differentiated neurons.

 <caption> GO analysis of 504 differentially expressed mRNAs in TCâ€“EC interaction, in which gland development, DNA replication, urogenital system development, morphogenesis of a branching epithelium, morphogenesis of a branching structure, branching morphogenesis of an epithelial tube, mesenchymal cell development, nuclear DNA replication, telomere maintenance via semi-conservative replication, and negative regulation of inclusion body assemble are the top 10 biological process (A); mitochondrial inner membrane, transferase complex (transferring phosphorus-containing groups), replication fork, and desmosome are main cell components (B); ATPase activity, catalytic activity acting on DNA, DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and helicase activity are the enriched molecular functions (C). P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. </caption>

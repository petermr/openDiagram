 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows that the addition of ERK inhibitor to NIM did inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK. Without the inhibitor, the phosphorylated ERK reached its peak value at 48 h after induction. The phosphorylated CREB reached its first peak value at 16 h and then gradually decreased, followed by a gradual increase in a second peak at approximately 48â€“56 h. If the NIM supplemented with ERK inhibitor was used, the levels of phosphorylated ERK and CREB were slightly lower (
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) and the neuronal differentiation was somewhat retarded. On the basis of the comparison of the time course of ERK and CREB phosphorylations, we can deduce that when cells were induced by growth factors bFGF and FGF8, the MAPK/ERK pathway was activated, resulting in the phosphorylation of CREB. Downstream of CREB phosphorylation causes the secretion of BDNF and its binding to TrkB, activating the MAPK/ERK pathway, which generates a second CREB phosphorylation peak. When ERK inhibitor was present, there was less CREB activation leading to a reduction in the secretion of BDNF.

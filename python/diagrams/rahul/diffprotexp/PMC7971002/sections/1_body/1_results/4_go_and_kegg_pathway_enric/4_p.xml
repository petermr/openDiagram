<p id="Par13">Conversely, cell cycle, ovarian steroidogenesis, p53 signalling pathway, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and EGF signalling pathways were identified as the key pathways in H3 vs H8 group (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). These pathways align with the GO terms implicated in oocyte development. From the results of KEGG pathway enrichment analyses, we deduce that differential lncRNAs may affect these pathways by regulating mRNAs in ovary development.

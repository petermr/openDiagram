  <p>Validation of RelA alternative mRNA processing. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Primer sets #1-#3 were designed to validate differential exon inclusion/exclusion. The expected size of the PCR product is indicated in red and tabulated in Table II. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantitative PCR for each primer set. hSAECs were infected with RSV and RNA analyzed for isoform expression. Shown is 2% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with GelRed dye (Biotium), with molecular weight (MW, in nt) indicated at the left. Fragments were isolated and sequenced to confirm splice site selection. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Quantitation of RelA isoforms expressed as a fold change in RSV-infected over uninfected cells (mock).

<p id="Par36">In this study we show that EEG beta frequencies in humans, recorded at a scalp location classically associated with motor cortical signals, are attenuated immediately prior to movement initiation specifically during early stages of visuomotor adaptation, and returned to baseline levels when behavioural performance (endpoint errors) had returned to baseline performance: i.e. when adaptative drive is greatest. Further, we provide evidence that beta activity recorded as local field potential activity directly from the motor cortex in cats exhibits similar motor adaptation related changes.</p>

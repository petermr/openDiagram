<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f026">Figure 26</xref>, the individual particles that form in the HTR and LTR are compared using SEM. SEM-EDS and TEM-EDS reveal that both the needle-/plate-shaped and polygonal particle types are nearly pure Si. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in TEM additionally reveals that both particle types have the same diamond cubic lattice structure. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f027">Figure 27</xref> shows a BF-STEM image of a quench-induced Si plate-shaped precipitate (formed during the LTR) after cooling at 0.1 K/s. Under this cooling condition, these Si plates have thicknesses of about 50 nm, with an edge length of 5–20 µm. Via TEM experiments employing sample rotation (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f028">Figure 28</xref>), it was confirmed that particles such as those shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f026">Figure 26</xref> (middle and right) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f027">Figure 27</xref> are indeed plate-shaped.

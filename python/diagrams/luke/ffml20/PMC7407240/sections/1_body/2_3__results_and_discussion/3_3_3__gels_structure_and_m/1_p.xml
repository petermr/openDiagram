<p>As it can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-01544-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, the refraction index variation with ι-carrageenan weight fraction in the 0.02 ÷ 0.23 interval indicates a linear dependency, which implies good miscibility between the two polymers in aqueous solution [
 <xref rid="B55-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The same behavior has been reported for other blends of poly (vinyl alcohol), such as with κ-carrageenan [

 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, a variety of microorganisms have been found to achieve MICP by hydrolysis of urea, and this kind of biomineralization has been used in a wide range of applications, including repairing cracks in buildings and roads, curing sands, making self-healing cements, and developing biomineralized materials [

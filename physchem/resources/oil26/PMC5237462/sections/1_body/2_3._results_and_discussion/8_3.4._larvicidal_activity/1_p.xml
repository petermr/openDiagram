The study of potential larvicide, insecticide, and repellent of essential oils is an alternative technology to synthetic products destined to vector control, since, to date, there is no vaccine ready for use against the four serotypes of dengue. Active agents at potential larvicide essential oils and plant extracts at LC<sub>50</sub> values of &lt;100&#8201;ppm are considereed.</p>

 <caption> CircRAB11FIP1 sponged miR-129. A LV2-1, LV2-2, or LV2-NC was transfected into SKOV3 cells. Later, qPCR was performed to detect miRNA expression. B LV6 or LV6-NC was transfected into A2780 cells. Later, qPCR was conducted to detect miRNA expression. C miR-129 together with circRAB11FIP1 positions in SKOV3 cells was determined by the FISH assay. D CircRAB11FIP1 expression decreased in SKOV3 cell lysate, which was enriched by the circRAB11FIP1 probe, as examined using qPCR. E miR-129 expression decreased, which was enriched by the circRAB11FIP1 probe, as verified through qPCR. F Prediction of possible binding sites in circRAB11FIP1 for miR-129. SKOV3 cells were transfected with miR-129 mimic or NC (NC) RNA together with pMIR-circRAB11FIP1 or pMIR-circRAB11FIP1m, respectively. Thereafter, the luciferase activities were examined. Error bar stands for standard error. * P &lt; 0.05. </caption>

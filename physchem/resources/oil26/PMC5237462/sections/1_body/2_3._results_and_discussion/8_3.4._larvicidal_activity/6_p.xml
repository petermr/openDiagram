<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The evaluation of larvicidal activity is in agreement with studies made by Pavela et al. [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. That determined the value LC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 100&#8201;mg&#183;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> against larvae of<italic> Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, having as a major component the monoterpene which is L-(&#8722;)-menthol, in which the participation in the EO differs depending on the genotype of 20.5% to 57.3%, together with carvone (0.0 to 56.8%) and piperitenone oxide (0.0 to 31.8%).</p>

 <sup>4</sup> cells/well of MDA-MB-231 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were taken and inoculated into 6-well plates, after which 10% FBS serum DMEM medium was added and incubated in a 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. When MDA-MB-231 cells were observed to reach 80% confluence, PBS was used to wash the cells three times, and the serum-containing DMEM was replaced with serum-free DMEM. The cells were starved overnight and were then divided into the control group and RSV treatment group. On the next day, after removing the DMEM medium, a new serum-free DMEM medium was added to the control group, and an optimum concentration RSV containing DMEM medium was added to the RSV treatment group, which was then cultured in a 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 24 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was removed, and 1 ml of PBS was added to each well, followed by gentle washing and removal. After this operation was repeated twice, 1 ml of trypsin was added to each well and digested in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C for 1 to 1.5 min, and 2 ml of 10% FBS complete medium was added. Then, digestion was stopped, and all cells and liquid were collected into 15 ml centrifuge tubes.

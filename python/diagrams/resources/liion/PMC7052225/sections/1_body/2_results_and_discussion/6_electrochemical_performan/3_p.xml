 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref> presents the capacity retention over 100 charge/discharge cycles for two electrodes with different compositions after performing a rapid formation at 5 C. This formation has prevented the migration of PTCDA in the electrolyte, and the Coulombic efficiency has remained at approximately 100% in all the cycling experiments. Electrochemical performance for battery doublons cycled without the formation at high C-rate are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI9</xref>. In this case, a rapid decrease of Coulombic efficiency was observed with cycling. Post-mortem microscopy analyses of the cathode surface after cycling at a 5 C rate should be performed to understand the reasons that cause the better electrochemical performance. It is probable that during cycling at a high C rate, the PTCDA molecules do not have sufficient time to migrate to the electrolyte and are confined in the cathode. During the same time, a passivation film is formed at the surface of the cathode because of electrolyte degradation. This layer could impede the PTCDA dissolution in the electrolyte without affecting the electrochemical performance.

<p>In 2018, there were about 2.1 million newly diagnosed female breast cancer cases globally, accounting for nearly a quarter of all female cancer cases (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). According to the expression levels of estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] protein, breast cancer can be divided into four subtypes: luminal -A, luminal-B, HER-2 positive, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Among them, TNBC accounts for about 15% - 20% of breast cancer (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and compared to hormonal receptor positive or HER2 positive diseases, TNBC is characterized by its highly aggressive clinical progression due to its earlier onset age, greater metastatic potential and worse clinical results (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). TNBC progresses very rapidly, and due to the lack of common therapeutic targets, current methods in controlling disease development are very limited (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). TNBC patients usually receive anthracycline and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, and subsequently take taxane (anthracycline/taxane [ACT]) as standard care. However, only about one-third of patients attain a pathological complete response (PCR), while remaining patients relapse and eventually succumb to the disease (

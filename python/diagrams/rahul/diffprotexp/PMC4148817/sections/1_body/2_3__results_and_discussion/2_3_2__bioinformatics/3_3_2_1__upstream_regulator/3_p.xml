<p>Coagulation factor II (F2) is also called prothrombin. It is proteolyticallycleaved to form thrombin in thecoagulation cascade, which ultimately results in the reduction of blood loss. In alveolar epithelial (A549) cells, thrombin induces activation of Rho and Rac that leads to MLC phosphorylation and formation of the peripheral actomyosin ring with peripheral accumulation of ZO-1/occludin complexes, thus enhanced barrier protection after acute lung injury [

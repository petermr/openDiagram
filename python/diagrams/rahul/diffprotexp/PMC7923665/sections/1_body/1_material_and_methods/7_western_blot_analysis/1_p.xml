<p id="Par23">From the tissues stored in RNA later solution, whole protein was isolated using RIPA buffer and the concentration of the protein was estimated using Bradford’s reagent. Electrophoresis of 40 μg/μl of protein was carried out in 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 to block non-specific binding sites. Primary antibody incubation was carried out for overnight. Initially, the membrane was probed with anti-rabbit ALDH1A2 antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 and later reprobed with anti-mouse GAPDH antibody in 1:5000 dilutions. The band was acquired using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and transferred to Kodak X ray film.</p>

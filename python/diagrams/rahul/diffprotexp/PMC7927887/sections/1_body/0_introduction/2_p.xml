<p>The spliceosome comprises a multi-component enzyme system that facilitates the splicing of pre-mRNA. The spliceosome removes an intron and subsequently ligates the proximal 5’ and 3’ exons. An intron is identified by the spliceosome through the recognition of four consensus elements which include: the 5’ splice site; the 3’ splice site; a branch point located upstream of the 3’ splice site; and lastly a polypyrimidine tract located between the splice site and branch point, which aids the recruitments of splicing factors.

 </sup> SF3B1, a component of the spliceosome, is essential for correct binding and splicing of pre-mRNA.

<p id="Par32">For ES, MS and DS, consecutive four somites were dissected. Tissues were placed into RLT lysis buffer. RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Cat no. 74104) and DNase treated (Qiagen Cat no 79254) for removal of DNA. Libraries were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform (75â€‰bp paired end) at the Earlham Institute. A minimum of three biological replicates for each stage were used for analysis.</p>

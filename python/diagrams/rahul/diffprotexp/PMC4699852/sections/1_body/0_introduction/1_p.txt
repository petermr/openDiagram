0: Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from adult bone marrow can be cultured long-term, expanded in proper conditions, and show the ability to differentiate into neuronal cells  in vitro.
1: The induction of MSCs into neural cells  in vitro was first attempted in 2000 by Woodbury et al.
2: [ 1].
3: They used chemicals to induce mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into neurons.
4: Firstly, the cells were cultured in -mercaptoethanol (BME)-containing medium for 1 day and then in a differentiation-inducing medium containing dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA).
5: After 3 hours of induction, the cells showed the characteristics of neuronal cells, exhibiting neuron-specific enolase and neurofilament-M.
6: In the same year, Sanchez-Ramos published results describing  in vitro differentiation of human and rat mesenchymal stem cells into neuronal cells using growth factors EGF and BDNF.
7: The differentiated cells expressed the precursor gene of neurons, nestin, and biomarkers of neuronal cells, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) [ 2].
8: Blondheim et al.
9: found that human bone marrow MSCs exhibit a total of 12 neural genes, including Nestin, NSE, NeuN, and 11 nerve-related transcription factors, including neural zinc finger 3 (NZF-3) and paired box gene 3 (Pax3) [ 3].
10: Human MSCs also express eight dopamine neuron-related genes such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic  l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the transcription factor nuclear receptor related-1 (Nurr-1), and the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor-3 (Pitx-3).
11: The literature confirms that MSCs have the ability to differentiate into neurons.

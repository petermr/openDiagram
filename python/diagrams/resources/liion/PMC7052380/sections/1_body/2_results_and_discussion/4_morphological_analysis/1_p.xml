<p>SEM images of the graphene oxide and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A–F</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that the micron-scale graphene oxide sheets aggregate into petal shapes; these sheets can provide implantation sites for the adhesion of reaction particles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B,C</xref> clearly shows that the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites are composed of micron-scale spheres and blocks with average dimensions of ~2 μm. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D–F</xref>, it can be clearly observed that these LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene microspheres and micron blocks are composed of densely aggregated nanoparticles. This structure forms because the self-heating effect induced by the microwave heating can greatly shorten the reaction time, and the graphene wrapping the surface of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> particles can inhibit the growth of grains. Under the action of graphene, the nanoparticles assembled into microspheres and micron blocks. When the highly conductive electrolyte penetrates into the cathode material, the nanoparticles have a high specific surface area, which increases the contact area with the electrolyte. The nanoparticle size can shorten the diffusion paths of electrons and lithium ions and improve the conductivity of the cathode material significantly. Moreover, the micron structure formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles does not collapse during the process of lithium-ion intercalation and deintercalation, which ensures the stability of cathode material in the electrolyte. TEM and HRTEM images of the micron/nanoscale LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composite are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4G,H</xref>. The ultrathin graphene sheets successfully form an effective conducting network and intrinsically bridge and intimately connect the active LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> particles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref> indicates that the graphene sheets around LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> are highly graphitic. The highly efficient and stable conducting network can give the material desirable electrochemical properties. In the energy spectrum, elements of P, O, Fe, and C are found, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>; Li cannot be detected because of its very low atomic weight.

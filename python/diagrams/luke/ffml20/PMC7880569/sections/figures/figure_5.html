 <caption> Chemometric analysis of FTIR spectra of AcidBir (orange) and Î´-MnO 2 (blue) from the adsorption ( Figure 4 a,b,d,e) and desorption (not shown) legs. The analysis decomposed the spectra into spectral components (a,b) and relative concentration profiles (c,d). Concentration profiles show both adsorption (filled) and desorption (open) legs. </caption>

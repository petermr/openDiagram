    "New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into an ischemia group (occlusion of the abdominal aorta for 60 minutes), an ischemia-reperfusion group (occlusion of the abdominal aorta for 60 minutes followed by 48 hours of reperfusion) and a sham-surgery group. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis detected 49 differentially expressed proteins in spinal cord tissue from the ischemia and ischemia/ reperfusion groups and 23 of them were identified by mass spectrometry. In the ischemia group, the expression of eight proteins was up regulated, and that of the remaining four proteins was down regulated. In the ischemia/reperfusion group, the expression of four proteins was up regulated, and that of two proteins was down regulated. In the sham-surgery group, only one protein was detected. In the ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion groups, four proteins overlapped between groups with the same differential expression, including three that were up regulated and one down regulated. These proteins were related to energy metabolism, cell defense, inflammatory mechanism and cell signaling."

0: Newly hatched ISA Brown chickens from an egg laying line (Hendrix Genetics, Netherlands) were used in this study.
1: Chickens were reared in perforated plastic boxes with free access to water and feed and each experimental or control group was kept in a separate room.
2: The chickens were vaccinated with  S. Enteritidis mutant completely lacking  Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) constructed as described earlier [ 11] and infected with isogenic wild type  S. Enteritidis 147 spontaneously resistant to nalidixic acid.
3: The strains were grown in LB broth at 37 C for 18 h followed by pelleting bacteria at 10 000   g for 1 min and re-suspending the pellet in the same volume of PBS as was the original volume of LB broth.

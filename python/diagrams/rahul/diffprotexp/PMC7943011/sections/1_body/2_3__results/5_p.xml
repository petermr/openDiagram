<p>A total of 80 proteins were differentially expressed (|log
 <sub>2</sub>FC| ≥ 0.5 and/or an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.05) under one of the tested conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248103.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and were plotted and further analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248103.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A total of 17 proteins were significantly different from the control sample after metformin treatment (F3, PLAUR: |log
 <sub>2</sub>FC| &lt; 0.5), whereas insulin significantly changed the expression of 15 proteins (EGF, EZR, TM9SF2: |log
 <sub>2</sub>FC| &lt; 0.5). Of the 80 selected proteins, 34 proteins displayed a significantly different expression between both treatment groups (GFAP, TFRC: |log
 <sub>2</sub>FC| &lt; 0.5). The results of the antibody microarray analysis have been confirmed for selected proteins, namely IL2 (ELISA) and COL1A1 (western blot analysis) (

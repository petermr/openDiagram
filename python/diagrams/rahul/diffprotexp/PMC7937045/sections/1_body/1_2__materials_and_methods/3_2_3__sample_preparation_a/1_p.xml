<p>For the LC-MS analysis, frozen serum and urine samples were thawed on ice. Serum samples with each group (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of serum) were merged; the urine samples within each group (2 mL of urine) were merged. Pierce™ Top12 Abundant Protein Depletion Spin Columns were used to remove high-abundance proteins from the serum samples of each group. The filtrate was collected and denatured with 8 M urea. DTT and IAA were added to reduce alkylation, and 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of Trypsin was then added at a ratio of 1 : 30 (enzyme : protein). The sample was hydrolyzed overnight at 37°C. Urine samples were precipitated with precooled acetone, and urea was used to redissolve the precipitate, followed by protein quantification using a BCA kit. Lastly, 3.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g Trypsin was added to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g protein from each group, and the samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed (1 : 30, enzyme : protein).

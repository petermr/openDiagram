 <caption> Polyadenylation sites (PAS) differential usage results. Column names as described – PAS: polyadenylation site, gene: gene (cluster in leafcutter), PAS_logeffectsize: log effect size for differential usage of the PAS between human and chimpanzee, PAS_deltaPAU: difference in polyadenylation site usage between human and chimpanzee (delta PSI in leafcutter), Gene_logLR: log likelihood ratio for differential usage of any PAS in the gene (cluster likelihood ratio in leafcutter), Gene_adjustedP-value: adjusted p-value for differential usage of the any PAS in the gene (cluster p-value in leafcutter). </caption>

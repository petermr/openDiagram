<p>The whole proteins of Caco-2 cells treated with/without sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se at 100 nmol L
 <sup>-1</sup> were determined by 2D-PAGE. Approximately 700 spots in each gel were detected, and most of the protein spots are similar in the four kinds of 2D-PAGE gels (Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Differentially expressed protein spots among the four groups of Caco-2 cells were analyzed by PDQuest Advanced 8.0.1 software. As the results, thirty spots represented reproducible upregulated (ratio
 <sub>(Treatments/Control)</sub> ≥2, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) or down-regulated (ratio
 <sub>(Treatments/Control)</sub> ≤0.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) changes in different treatments groups compared with those of the control groups (Figure

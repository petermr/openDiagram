0: The  yjbH gene was amplified using primers SAUSA300_0903_Bam_F: CGCGGATCCATGGCT GGAGAATTACGAATAAT and SAUSA300_0903_Sal_R: ACGCGTCGACTTATTTTGATTTGATTTTAGGCATT, ligated to the BamHI/SalI-digestedpND50-pfbaA vector [ 14] and transformed into  E. coli HST08.
1: Bacteriophage 80-mediated complementation of the plasmids was performed into the respective mutants as previously described [ 14].

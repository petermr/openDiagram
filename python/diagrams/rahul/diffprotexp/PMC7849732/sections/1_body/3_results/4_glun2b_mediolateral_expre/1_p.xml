<p>We next investigated whether the same mediolateral GluN2 expression patterns were observed in female spinal cord. At a qualitative level, there was no visible difference for GluN2A and GluN2D immunoreactivity across the mediolateral axis of the SDH, and only a moderately higher immunoreactivity for GluN2B in the medial SDH in a subset of female rats (

The measured OD per area were not statistically different between the medial, central, and lateral regions of the CGRP+ SDH for GluN2A (p = 0.45, n = 6), GluN2B (p = 0.15, n = 6), or GluN2D (p = 0.36, n = 5) subunits. Furthermore, in contrast to that observed in males, the medial/lateral OD ratio was not significantly different between GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D subunits in females (p = 0.15; n = 6, n = 6, n = 5, respectively), with all ratios near a value of 1 (purple bars in

<p id="Par58">The number of up- and downregulated proteins significantly decreased with age when comparing protein expression across the three age groups. These results indicate that there are several structural and functional changes that occur in the P3 mouse cochlear sensory epithelium. These results are consistent with previous reports of structural changes in the aging cochlea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. When compared to P3, the number of upregulated proteins significantly increases with age, whereas downregulated proteins show a small decrease. The increase in upregulated protein expression with increased age suggests that many proteins may be involved in physiological and morphological changes that lead to and maintain function. To better understand the significance of these differentially expressed proteins, those related to the development and function of the inner ear were further analyzed using GO and IPA.

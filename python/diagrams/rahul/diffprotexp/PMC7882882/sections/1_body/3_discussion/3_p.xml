<p>In recent years, lncRNAs have been reported in various tumors and serve as promising new molecular markers for tumor biological behavior, tumor diagnosis and prognostic evaluation (

 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b55-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) identified differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in NFPA and normal pituitary tissue samples, and constructed an mRNA-lncRNA coexpression network. However, the research failed to illustrate the regulatory mechanisms of the key genes or lncRNAs and their influence on patient prognosis. The current study focused on identifying molecular markers of NFPA recurrence.

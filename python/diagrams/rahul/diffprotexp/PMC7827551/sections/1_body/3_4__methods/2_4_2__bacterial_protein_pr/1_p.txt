0: Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000  g at 4 C for 10 min.
1: Cellular proteins were obtained using bead beating in a lysis solution (500 mM Tris pH 7.0, 130 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail and 4%  w/ v SDS) and acetone [ 37].
2: Cellular debris was eliminated by centrifugation and protein lysate was collected.
3: Proteins used for 2-DE analysis were re-suspended in 2-DE rehydration lysis buffer, while others were re-suspended in water.
4: Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) was utilized to detect protein concentration using bovine serum albumin as a standard [ 38].
5: Each measurement was detected from three biological and three technical replicates.

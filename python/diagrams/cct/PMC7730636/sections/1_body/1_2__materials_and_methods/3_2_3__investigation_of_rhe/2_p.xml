<p>Consequently, the strain value corresponding with the peak stress is described as peak strain. The coordinates [

  <sub>i</sub>;

 <italic>σ
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>] define the inflectional point of the curve. The point [

  <sub>ss</sub>;

 <italic>σ
  <sub>ss</sub>
 </italic>] is an equilibrium point from which strengthening and softening mechanisms are in balance. Therefore, the meaning of lower index “ss” is steady state.

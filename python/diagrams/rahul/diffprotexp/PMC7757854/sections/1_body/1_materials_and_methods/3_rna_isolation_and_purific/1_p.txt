0: Total RNA was extracted from MEFs using a combination of TriZol (Life TechnologiesTM) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), with modifications from the manufacturers protocols.
1: Cells in each well were washed once with 1 ml of PBS prior to the addition of 1 ml of TriZol reagent.
2: TriZol lysates were added to fresh 1.5-ml tubes.
3: Approximately 0.2 ml of chloroform was added per ml of TriZol and was centrifuged at a speed of 12,000 rpm at 4C for 15 min.
4: The upper aqueous phase (~400 ml in volume) was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube.
5: An equivalent volume of 70% ethanol was mixed with the RNA solution, and downstream purification was performed using a RNeasy Mini Spin Column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol.
6: RNA concentrations were determined using a Thermo ScientificTM NanoDrop 2000TM.

 <sup>™</sup> membranes containing adherent Calu-3 cells were rinsed 3 times in ice-cold 250 mM sucrose, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Calu-3 lysates were prepared by adding 500 μL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 10 mM DTT, freshly prepared) to each sample. Cells were incubated at 35 °C for 1 h with agitation and then centrifuged at 15,000 ×

0: For qPCR experiments of mRNAs, reverse-transcription was performed using a FastQuant RT Kit (with gDNase) (Cat.
1: # KR106, Tiangen, Beijing, China).
2: qPCR was performed using SYBR SuperReal Premix plus (Cat.
3: # FP205, Tiangen, Beijing, China) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol.
4: The following real-time PCR protocol was used: polymerase activation (95 C, 15 min), 40 cycles of denaturation (95 C, 10 s), annealing and extension (60 C, 32 s) and melting curve analysis.
5: The primers used for the target mRNA are designed by Intivrogen (Shanghai, China) and listed in  Table S2.

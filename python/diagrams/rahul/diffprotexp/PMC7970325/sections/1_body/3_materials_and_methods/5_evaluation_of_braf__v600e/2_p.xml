<p id="p0295">Detection of 
 <italic>BRAF</italic> (V600E) mutation was performed using allele-specific PCR with dual-labeled probe as described in [
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. PCR cycling conditions were pre-denaturation step 95°С – 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation (94°С, 10 s), annealing, and elongation (60°С, 15 s). Mutation status was considered positive if the mutant allele content was 3% or more of the wild-type allele.

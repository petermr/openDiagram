0: The study was performed using bovine calves ( Bos taurus) and approved by the University of California Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (authorization number 19313).
1: Detailed description of the study design, randomization, interventions, outcomes, handing and detection of the virus has been provided elsewhere [ 19].
2: Briefly, 36 healthy five to six-week-old outbred pre-ruminant bottle-fed Holstein bull calves were randomly split into 6 treatment groups.
3: All animals were infected with BRSV by aerosolization of 5 ml of infected bovine turbinate cell culture supernatant, using individual nebulizers, connected to a tightly fitted face respirator mask.
4: Infection dose of the virus was 3.910 59.710 5 PFU.
5: The following treatment groups were created as follows: Group 1 ibuprofen, starting on day 3 post infection; Group 2 ibuprofen, starting on day 5 post infection; Group 3, placebo; Group 4 the antiviral fusion protein inhibitor (FPI), starting on day 3 post infection; Group 5 FPI and ibuprofen starting on day 5 post infection; Group 6 FPI and ibuprofen starting on day 3 post infection.
6: GS-561937 (FPI) was administered 600mg per animal in 30 ml of a mixture of propylene glycol and First Street Snow Cone Syrup (Amerifoods Inc, Los Angeles, CA) once daily.
7: Ibuprofen was administered at 10 mg/kg, three times daily, in the form of Advil suspension for children (100 mg/5mlPfizer inc, Madison, NJ).
8: The First Street Snow Cone Syrup without ibuprofen was administered as an ibuprofen placebo, as well as its 50:50 mix with propylene glycol without FPI for those groups that did not receive FPI (placebo).
9: All therapeutics, including placebo, were given orally, using catheter tipped syringes.

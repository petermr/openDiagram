0: Ubiquitin primers Os_U51-1a_1 was used against housekeeping miRNA (reference gene) to compare with target sequence (miRNA) for normalization as reported earlier 32,  33.
1: Further, fold change in SR-157 was calculated by comparing the corresponding expressions in SR-159.
2: All primers used in qRT-PCR are listed (Supplementary Table  S2).

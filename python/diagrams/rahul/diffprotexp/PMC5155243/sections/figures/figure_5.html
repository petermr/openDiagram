 <caption> Effect of a specific siRNA of ETHE1 on cell apoptosis after DU exposure. After being transfected with ETHE1-specific siRNA (100 nM) or control siRNA (100 nM), HEK293 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. siRNA-C, siRNA-control; siRNA-E, siRNA-ETHE1. ( a) Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, followed by Annexin V-FITC (FL 1 channels) and PI (FL 2 channels) double staining. ( b) The percentage of apoptosis was counted including early apoptosis (in the lower-right quadrants) and late apoptosis (in the upper-right quadrant). ( c) Calcein-AM/PI staining was used for analysis of the living cell (yellow-green fluorescence) and dead cell levels (red fluorescence) as described in Materials and Methods. Results represent means ± SD of five separate experiments. * p &lt; 0.05, compared with DU-treated cells. </caption>

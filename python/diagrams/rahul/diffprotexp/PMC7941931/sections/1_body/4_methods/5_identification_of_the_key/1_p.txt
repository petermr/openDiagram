0: Expression profiles of all the DEMs target genes were analyzed by using transcriptomic data from our previous report [ 46].
1: Then, the significantly different expression target genes were identified and functional analysis was performed by GO, KEGG and homologous annotation.
2: Finally, expression correlation analysis between DEMs and differently expressed target genes was performed.
3: The miRNAs and target mRNA pairs with  R  0.5 and  P value< 0.05 were identified, and the key miRNA-mRNA pairs for Tartary buckwheat seed development were obtained by homologous annotation of target mRNAs.

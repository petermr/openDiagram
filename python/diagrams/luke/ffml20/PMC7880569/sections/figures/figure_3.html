 <caption> (a) Transmission-mode XRD diffractograms of AcidBir exposed to 0–98% RH and (b) result of d 001 basal spacing (left ordinate axis) analyses from these data (filled square = adsorption; open square = desorption), also showing uncertainties. The model predictions of d 001 in (b) (full line for adsorption; dashed for desorption) were taken from the Dubinin–Asthakhov theory 46 term derived from the microgravimetric water binding data ( Figure 2 a). This model prediction of the hydration fraction (right ordinate axis) was scaled such that d 001 = 0.690 nm at 0 W (0 H 2O/UC) and d 001 = 0.735 nm at 1 W (1.33 H 2O/UC). Diffractograms for δ-MnO 2 were of insufficient quality to be shown here, due to the small particle size. </caption>

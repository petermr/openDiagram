 <caption> Patterns of 24-h activity and body temperature of study aardvarks, double-plotted for better visualisation, during a month of a drought summer (February 2013, panel (A), the following drought winter (August 2013, panel (B), during a non-drought summer (February 2014, panel (C), and the following non-drought winter (August 2014, panel (D) at Tswalu. Grey areas indicate night time. Error bars indicate SD between individuals. Note that on panel (A), activity patterns of two aardvarks for which data were available were plotted individually to display the difference between an aardvark that survived the drought summer ( A06, filled bars), and one that died in the following month ( A02, empty bars). Mean minimum 24-h air temperatures during the winter months were similar (4.5°C in August 2013; 7.6°C in August 2014). Mean maximum 24-h air temperatures differed between the summer months, with the drought summer up to 10°C hotter than the non-drought summer month (36.5°C in February 2013; 26.0°C in February 2014. </caption>

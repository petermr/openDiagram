<p id="Par28">As we expected, the WMFVS method obtained a better total weight than the traditional MFVS. However, the result of WMFVS is not always better than that of MFVS. The total weight of the output of the traditional MFVS method is random (the output is related to the graph structure but has no relevance to the vertex weights), so it is possible for MFVS to output a highly weighted vertex set, even higher than the weight of the calculated WMFVS (Gurobi may not always give a real optimal result because of its numerical instability). However, our WMFVS method clearly has better stability.</p>

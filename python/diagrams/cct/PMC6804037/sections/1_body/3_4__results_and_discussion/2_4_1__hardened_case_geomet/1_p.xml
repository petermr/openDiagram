<p>The shape of the hardened zone was affected by the shape of the Gaussian laser energy distribution, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The Nd:YAG laser used in this study had a Gaussian mode in which the maximum energy was focused at the middle of the laser beam. The laser energy reduced aside the middle of the laser beam. By increasing the distance from the focal plane (see z in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f005">Figure 5</xref>), not only the energy was reduced, but also the laser beam diverged.

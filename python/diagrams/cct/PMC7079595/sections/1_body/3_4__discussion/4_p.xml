<p>The intercritical annealing is much more appropriate treatment for this 5% Mn steel. The experimental results showed that although α’ to γ transformation occurred at both selected temperatures, 700 and 720 °C, no transformation occurred at 700 °C, as in the case for coiling simulation at the same temperature of 700 °C. Similar results were obtained by Nakada et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. They reported that the γ to α transformation did not occur even after 50 h cooling for steel containing 5% Mn. However, when they changed an approach from cooling to heating from α’ to γ (without austenitization), the transformation was present during the intercritical annealing. The reason for this was a higher austenite nucleation site density in the lath martensite and the higher Mn diffusion in α phase in comparison to the austenite. The higher stability of austenite for lower intercritical annealing temperatures corresponds to its amount, which is formed during annealing.

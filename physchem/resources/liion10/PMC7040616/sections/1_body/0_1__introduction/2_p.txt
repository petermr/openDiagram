0: A solid electrolyte is an important component of all-solid-state batteries.
1: It can not only be used as a lithium ionic conductor, substituting for a liquid organic electrolyte, but also can be used to block direct contact between the positive and negative electrodes, like a separator [ 11].
2: Solid electrolytes generally contain Li 3N, LiPON, perovskite, LISICON, NASICON, garnet, etc.
3: [ 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
4: Some of these solid electrolytes have high ionic conductivity (~10 3 Scm 1).
5: However, some issues still exist, such as instability in an ambient atmosphere (Li 10GeP 2S 12, LGPS) and the metal cation being easily reduced by lithium (such as Ti 4+ in Li xLa 2/3 -x/3TiO 3, LLTO) [ 18, 19].
6: The cubic garnet LLZO was discovered by Murugan et al.
7: [ 17] in 2007 and attracted world-wide attention for its advantages, e.g., the simple preparation process, high ionic conductivity (~10 3 Scm 1) at room temperature, high electrochemical window (0~6 V vs. Li/Li +), and electrochemical stability of lithium metal.
8: On the other hand, LLZO also has some defects, such as an unstable cubic phase and a low density of ceramics [ 20, 21].
9: Moreover, a mass of LLZO mother powder is needed to compensate for lithium loss when sintering at high temperatures [ 21, 22].
10: Many solutions have been adopted to solve the above issues.
11: For example, Al, Ga, Fe, Ta, Nb, W, Y, and Sb doping were used to stabilize the cubic phase [ 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]; hot pressing sintering, plasma sintering, and microwave sintering were adopted to improve the relative density and sintering additives [ 31, 32, 33]; and Y 2O 3, Al 2O 3, B 2O 3, CaO, MgO, Li 3PO 4, and Li 4SiO 4 were investigated to reduce the grain-boundary resistance [ 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40].
12: Usually, in order to evaluate the electrochemical performance, LLZO was used as solid electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries [ 41, 42, 43].

0: Cerebral AVMs can develop de novo and could also be congenital in origin.
1: The long-term notion is that AVMs are congenital in nature, and limited studies are available on the pathogenesis of this disease to genes involved in early vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.
2: Recent reports suggest an association of cerebral AVMs with various pathological stimuli such as trauma/brain injury, viral infections, neuronal abnormal development, and migration disorders in the brain, which may occur prior to clinical manifestation of AVM [ 20,  21].
3: An investigation on the nature and functions of glial cells in the immediate vicinity of blood vessels is also possibly relevant to understand AVM pathogenesis.
4: Any stimuli from pathological astrocytes may affect endothelial cells because of the strong anatomical and physiological interaction between astrocytes and endothelial cells.
5: The VEGF protein is pivotal in promoting angiogenesis, and it is known that there is a high degree of VEGF expression in astrocytes in recurrent cases of AVM, when compared to non-recurrent cases of AVM [ 31].
6: There are reports of co-occurrence of AVM and astrocytoma in the brain as well [ 3,  24].
7: Interestingly, in the white matter adjoining AVMs, there is also a proliferation of oligo dendroglial cells [ 16 18].

<p>A non-pharmacological method of pain control is the use of cryo/heat-therapy, which is used and marketed for relief of muscle pain. Whilst temperature does not directly stimulate nor inhibit mASIC3 activity, reducing the temperature from 34°C to 6°C slowed the rate of (pH 4-induced) desensitization [

Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the half-maximal activation pH becomes more acidic (pH 6.73 to 6.66) as temperature was increases (25°C to 35°C) [

0: Finally, the log 2 fold change (log 2 FC) between the infection conditions and the mock infection control were calculated to evaluate the transcriptomic modifications induced by SARS-CoV-2 strains.
1: Criteria for differential expression were an absolute log 2 FC of 1 and a  q-value < 0.05 calculated using a Students t-test with subsequent Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

<p>Calves treated with ibuprofen alone showed increased viral shedding in a previous study from this lab as well as in the present study [

 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus it is an interesting finding that increased function of “negative regulation of viral genome replication” in groups 1 and 2, as well as “Defense response to virus” enriched in group 2 was found. This may be connected with our results of virus shedding measurements in this and in the previous experiment because these groups were treated only with ibuprofen and maximum viral loads were detected [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The viral shedding was significantly higher than in animals in the placebo group as reported in this study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and in our previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory or antipyretic function of ibuprofen was favorable for viral replication. As a result, increased antiviral function is probably a response to increased virus replication, caused by ibuprofen.

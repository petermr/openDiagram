<p>Both 
 <italic>CCR4</italic> and 
 <italic>CCR8</italic> belong to chemokine receptors, and the proteins encoded by these genes belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Chemokines consist of a set of small polypeptides that regulate cellular transport in various types of leukocytes. Chemokines also have essential roles in the development, homeostasis, and function of the immune system, and they have effects on endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis or vasorelaxation (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Besides, these genes are also strongly associated with tumor development. Xu et al. found that 
 <italic>CCR4</italic> and CCR6 are independent prognostic indicators for patients with lung adenocarcinoma (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). One animal study in canines confirmed that the expression of 
 <italic>CCR4</italic> was significantly higher in tumor tissues than in normal tissues and was significantly correlated with the content of Treg cells. They suggest that the 
 <italic>CCL17</italic>/
 <italic>CCR4</italic> axis may drive Treg recruitment in a variety of canine cancers. 
 <italic>CCR4</italic> blockade may be a potential therapeutic option to eradicate tumors through Treg depletion (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Based on the mechanism of 
 <italic>CCR4</italic>, Mogamulizumab is a new humanized anti-
 <italic>CCR4</italic> antibody that is currently being used in the clinical treatment of advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (

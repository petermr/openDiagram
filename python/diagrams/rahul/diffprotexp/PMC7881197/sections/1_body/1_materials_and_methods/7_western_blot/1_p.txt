0: MCF7 cells were grown in 6 well plates for Western blots and were washed with cold PBS twice and scraped in RIPA buffer (Cell signaling, USA).
1: Protein concentration in each sample was measured through Bradford assay using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad, USA) and spectrophotometry at 595 nm (BMG Labtech, Germany).
2: From the measured protein concentration, a total of 20 g of proteins per sample was loaded on 612% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
3: After blocking with 45% skim milk (MBcell, South Korea) in TBST including 25 mM Tris (Sigma, USA), 140 mM NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma, USA), the membrane was probed with indicated primary antibodies.
4: Anti-BUB1B (A300-386A) and anti-BRCA1 (A300-000A) antibodies were purchased from Bethyl laboratories (USA); anti-PLK1 (sc-17783), anti-CDC25A (sc-7389), anti-CDC20 (sc-13162), anti-CHEK1 (sc-8408), anti-CDKN1A (sc-6246), anti-HSP90 (sc-69703) and anti-HSP70 (sc-32239) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA); anti-CCNB1 (#4135) and anti-HIF1 (#14179) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA); anti-ATM (ab78) and anti-MCM4 (ab4459) antibodies were purchased from Abcam; anti-ACTA1 (ACTIN, MAB1501) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA).
5: Antibodies were validated for Western blotting by the manufacturers.
6: Antibody were diluted to 1:3001:2000 in blocking solution for usage as recommended by the manufacturers.
7: For protein detection, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated mouse and rabbit secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076S and 7074S) and signals were detected with EzWestLumi Plus or Western blotting Luminol Reagent (ATTO, WSE-7120L, Japan; sc-2048, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA).
8: Image J software (National Institute of Health, USA) was used to measure the band intensity of immunoblotting.

<p id="p0095">Using a conventional Zn|electrolyte|MnO
 <sub>2</sub> coin-type battery configuration, an oxidation peak at around 1.65 V was observed, indicative of the oxidation of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>. It is no surprise that without introducing MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> into the electrolyte, the oxidation of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> is much less significant (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>). Also, in the same electrolyte composition, the oxidation peaks at 1.65 V of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode were more noticeable than those of the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode, as presented in

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Tyrosinase inhibition colorimetric assay was carried out according to the method, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Each essential oil was dissolved in DMSO to obtain concentration of 20&#160;mg/mL. These stock solutions were diluted to 600&#160;&#956;g/mL concentration in 50&#160;mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH&#160;6.5). Arbutin acid was prepared in similar way and used as positive control. 700&#160;&#956;L of each sample solution or positive control were combined with 300&#160;&#956;L of mushroom tyrosinase (333 Unit per mL in phosphate buffer, pH&#160;6.5). After incubation at 20&#8211;22&#160;&#176;C for 5&#160;min, 1100&#160;&#956;L tyrosine (2&#160;mM) were added to each well. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30&#160;min and the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 492&#160;nm using the spectrophotometer Genesys 10S UV&#8211;vis (Thermo Scientific, USA). Percent inhibition of tyrosinase activity was calculated according to the formula: inhibition (%)&#8201;=&#8201;100-(W<sub>sample</sub>/W<sub>blank</sub>)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;100, where W is absorbance at 492&#160;nm. W<sub>blank</sub> is absorbance of control reaction (containing all reagents without test compound).</p>

0: The specific excess heat capacity is obtained here by measuring an alloyed sample versus a reference sample with similar heat capacity.
1: The specific excess heat capacity is then defined to be the difference between the specific heat capacity of the alloyed sample and that of an inert reference sample.
2: In an ideal situation, the reference and the alloy sample have highly similar absolute heat capacities over the entire temperature range of interest.
3: Another requirement for the reference sample is that it must be inert with respect to thermal reactions within the temperature range of interest.
4: It may be difficult to find appropriate reference material, but in the case of Al alloys, pure Al has proven to be very well suited [ 120, 121].
5: Pure Al reference samples are preferably used in a pre-oxidised condition, i.e., heated once before the actual measurement; however, there are various strategies for obtaining a suitable reference sample [ 122], and changes in the sample mass to adjust the total heat capacities of the sample and reference sample may further improve the signal quality [ 122, 123].

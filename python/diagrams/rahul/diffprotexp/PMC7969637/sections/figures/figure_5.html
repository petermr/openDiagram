 <caption> The construction of logistic regression prediction model and random forest classification model. (A) The Logistic model diagnostic chart. The red dashed line in the figure indicates the COOK distance. (B) The ROC curve. The horizontal axis represents the specificity of the FPR (false positive rate), and the vertical axis represents the sensitivity of the TPR (true positive rate). (C) The construction of the random forest classification model. (D) The ROC curve for the random forest classification model. </caption>

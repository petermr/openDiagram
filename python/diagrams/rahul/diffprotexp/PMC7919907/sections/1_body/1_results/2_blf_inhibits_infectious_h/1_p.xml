<p>To elucidate the antiviral mechanism of action of BLF, the drug time-of-addition experiments were carried out to determine at which step(s) of viral replication BLF exerts its antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A–D)</xref>). For this, 1000 µg/ml of BLF was added to the cell culture at different time points of viral replication (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(B)</xref>) including viral attachment and onwards (#1), viral attachment and entry (#2), viral attachment only (#3), viral entry and onwards (#4), viral entry only (#5), and different time points post-viral entry (#6–#9). For this mechanistic study, HCoV-OC43 was chosen as a representative example of common human coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was used as a surrogate for the infectious SARS-CoV-2. In the first set of time-of-addition experiment, RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 at an MOI of 1, and intracellular viral protein expression was quantified by immunofluorescence staining using HCoV-OC43 specific antibody (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A)</xref>), and viral titers of progeny virus released into the cell culture medium were quantified by plaque assay (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(C)</xref>). The immunofluorescence assay results showed that BLF only inhibited viral replication when it was included in the viral attachment stage (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A), #1, #2, and #3</xref>), and it had no significant antiviral effect when added during the viral entry and post-viral entry (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A), #4–#9</xref>). Consistent with the immunofluorescence assay results, viral titers were significantly decreased when BLF was present at steps including viral attachment (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(C), #1-#3</xref>), but not in the entry and post-entry steps (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(C)</xref>, #4–#8). To test whether BLF inhibits SARS-CoV-2 through a similar mechanism, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles were used in the second set of time-of-addition experiment. The relative titers of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particles were determined by measuring the ratio of luciferase reporter gene expression level with and without LF treatment. The results demonstrated that BLF inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus replication at the attachment stage (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(D)</xref>, #1–#3), but not viral entry and post-entry stages (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(D)</xref>, #4–#9). Collectively, the drug time-of-addition results suggested that LF blocks viral attachment to host cells and has no effect on viral replication when added post-viral entry.

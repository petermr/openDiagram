<p>For weight ratios of carrageenan higher than 0.01, there is excellent compatibility between the two polymers (μ &gt; 0). Since ι-carrageenan presents a higher molecular mass than PVA, at sufficiently higher CAR/PVA ratios, it could act as a pseudotheta solvent for PVA, forming rigid polymer intercomplexes by entangling around the shorter flexible PVA chains. These intercomplexes disrupt the original rigid double-helix conformation of ι-carrageenan (K

The compositions for the two PC5 and PC12 hydrogels correspond to high values of μ, leaving out the possibility of forming two distinct polymer-rich phases during cryogelation.

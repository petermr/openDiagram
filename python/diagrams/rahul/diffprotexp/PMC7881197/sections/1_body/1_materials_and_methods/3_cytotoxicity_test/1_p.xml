<p id="Par29">HUMEC and MCF7 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in a 10 cm dish before splitting into a 96 well plate. Approximately 4 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells were seeded in each well and AS6 was applied according to indicated concentrations. After 24–72 h incubation, 10% (v/v) of water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST, DoGen Inc., South Korea) was added to each well, following the manufacturer’s instruction. Intensity of orange color developed from the enzyme–substrate reaction was measured at 450 nm using spectrophotometry (BMG Labtech, Germany). Cell images were taken by Olympus IX-71 microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with objective lenses (Olympus LUCPLFLN20X, Olympus, Japan), a camera (Olympus XM10, Olympus, Japan), and a light source (Olympus TH4-200, Olympus, Japan). Images were acquired, using CellSens Standard Imaging software (Olympus, Japan).

<p>We have used a lipid bilayer with POPC lipids (2-oleoyl-1-pamlitoyl-
 <italic>sn</italic>-glyecro-3-phosphocholine) in addition to DOPC in order to assess the effect of the membrane composition on our conclusions regarding the translocation ability of the compounds. The model for POPC is also based on the CHARMM36 force-field and consists of 128 POPC molecules. As in the case of the DOPC, the membrane topology for the POPC membrane model was created by using the CHARMM-GUI server,

 </sup> which is compatible with the CHARMM36 all-atom force-field. Also, a DOPC membrane model with cholesterol was studied with a DOPC/cholesterol ratio of 2:1 and using the CHARMM force-field. Finally, the simple point charge water model was used in the case of the GROMOS54a7 force-field, while the TIP3P water model was employed in the case of the CHARMM36 force-field.

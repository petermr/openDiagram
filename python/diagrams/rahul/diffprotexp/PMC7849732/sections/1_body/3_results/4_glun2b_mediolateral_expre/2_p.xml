<p>To further test if the mediolateral expression patterns of GluN2 subunits are conserved between males and females, we directly compared the medial/lateral OD ratio for each subunit between sexes. This comparison reinforced the surprising finding that the specific localization of GluN2B to the medial SDH is present in male rats only (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(a,b</xref>)) was confirmed by quantitative analysis showing a significant difference in the medial/lateral OD ratios for GluN2B between male and female rats (p = 0.008, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(d</xref>)). In contrast, the medial/lateral OD ratio was not significantly different between the sexes for both GluN2A (p = 0.46, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(c</xref>)) and GluN2D (p = 0.94, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(e</xref>)).

0: However, DSC also has certain disadvantages and limitations.
1: In particular, DSC detects the heat effects of all occurring reactions in sum.
2: Since different reactions occur simultaneously in several cases, it can be hard to distinguish the different parts of the signal that belong to specific reactions.
3: This makes the interpretation of DSC heating experiments particularly complicated, as opposite heat effects from endothermic dissolution and exothermic precipitation can occur during heating [ 120].
4: Since only precipitation will take place during cooling, DSC still is the most promising method for comprehensive analysis of the kinetic behaviour of quench-induced precipitation.

<p>In the metabolism category, the most significantly overexpressed proteins belong to the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (5.94E00) pathways. In general, chronic exposure to androgens is associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, low glucose disposal rate and diabetes [

On the other hand, SUCB2, an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) was found overexpressed, and associated by the canonical analysis with 4-aminobutyrate degradation I (2.6E00) and glutamate degradation III (via 4-aminobutyrate; 2.37E00). In this regard, others have shown that gene overexpression of TCA enzymes is related to high steroidogenic activity [

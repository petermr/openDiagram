0: In this research, we first collected clinical information of hospitalized T2DM patients diagnosed with cancer and found that lung cancer was the most common malignant tumor in patients with T2DM in our cohort, with lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) accounting for the majority of cases.
1: Using SWATH-MS and parallel reaction monitoring MS (PRM-MS) analyses, we discovered and preliminarily validated pregnancy zone protein (PZP) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) as potential biomarkers.
2: ELISA analysis was next used to further validate these biomarkers, and PZP was determined as a novel serum biomarker for screening LAC in T2DM patients, which will enhance auxiliary diagnosis and assist in the selection of early surgical therapeutics for LAC.

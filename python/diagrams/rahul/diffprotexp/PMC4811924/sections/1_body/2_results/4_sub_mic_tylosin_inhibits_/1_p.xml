<p>A total of 1501 proteins were identified by iTRAQ. Detailed information is shown in the Supplementary File. A ratio of proteins with &gt;1.5 or &lt; 0.67 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was considered to be differentially expressed. Based on this criterion, 96 differentially expressed proteins were identified in 1/4 MIC tylosin treated cells and nontreated cells. Detailed information could is shown Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. These proteins were detected by GO annotation. Thirty-five proteins were deleted from the database. The remaining 61 proteins were classified into biological process, molecular function and cellular component (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The results regarding the biological process were as follows: single-organism process (8, 13%), response to stimulus (4, 7%), localization (4, 7%), biological adhesion (1, 2%), cellular component organization or biogenesis (6, 10%), cellular process (25, 41%), biological regulation (3, 5%), metabolic process (30, 49%). The results regarding molecular function were as follows: binding (29, 48%), nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity (1, 2%), transporter activity (3, 5%), structural molecule activity (5, 8%), catalytic activity (25, 41%). The results regarding cellular component were as follows: organelle (6, 10%), virion (1, 2%), cell (13, 21%), extracellular region (1, 2%), membrane (6, 10%), macromolecular complex (8, 13%).

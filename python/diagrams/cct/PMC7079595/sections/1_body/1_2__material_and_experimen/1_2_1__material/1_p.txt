0: A laboratory-melted medium manganese steel was studied in this work and its chemical composition is detailed in  Table 1.
1: A relatively low carbon content of the investigated steel (0.16 wt.%) is beneficial due to the improvement in steel weldability [ 10].
2: The 4.7 wt.% of manganese was added to enhance the thermal stability of austenite upon cooling.
3: A high aluminum content (1.6 wt.%) prevents the carbide precipitation during a bainite reaction, hence increasing the carbon content in the austenite [ 11].
4: Moreover, aluminum increases the rate of  to  transformation (increases the chemical driving force) [ 12, 13].
5: Silicon has a similar role as aluminum, yet its content was limited due to its disadvantages during hot-dip galvanizing.
6: This element forms a thin amorphous layer which prevents the good diffusion connection between steel and zinc [ 2].

0: Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SWAT) has been shown to be an important player in the development of the metabolic syndrome, as it is a highly active metabolic tissue and is involved in inflammatory processes [ 1].
1: Its different cell components such as adipocytes, preadipocytes, macrophages, and other cells summarized as the stromal vascular fraction [ 2], act together as an endocrine organ with a huge inflammatory capacity [ 3].
2: Adipocytes and preadipocytes express themselves mRNA of many cytokines and chemokines and are therefore not only able to interfere in inflammation, via interaction and activation of the adipose tissue macrophages [ 4, 5], but can also directly act as inflammatory tissue[ 5].

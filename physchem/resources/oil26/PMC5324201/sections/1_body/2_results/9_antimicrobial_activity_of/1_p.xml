<p>The results of antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. essential oils are shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">13</xref>,

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The oil inhibited the growth of bacterial strains producing a zone diameter of inhibition from 3 to 16 mm, depending on the susceptibility of the tested bacteria and the different dosage level. The highest inhibition of zone was found against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli 2799</italic> followed by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and their effects are also higher than standard antibiotic tetracycline and lower than ciprofloxacin. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> showed the high resistant to the essential oil. However, other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria exhibited moderate to weak activities than the standard antibiotics. The MICs of the essential oils were within concentration ranges from 62.5 to 250 μg/mL and the respective MBCs were from 125 to 500 μg/mL. The organism like 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> 12079 and 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> were less susceptible to the oil with MICs value of 250 μg/mL respectively. The MIC and MBC values of standard ciprofloxacin were varied between 0.19–6.25 μg/mL and 3.125–100 μg/mL respectively.

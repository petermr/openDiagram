<p>This pilot study was designed to evaluate a tape device as a potential tool in clinical trials to monitor CLE biomarkers that are relevant to CLE pathogenesis. Although limited by a small sample size, results indicated that material of sufficient quality and quantity was obtained to provide relevant information on IFN-associated or CLE-associated gene signature detection. However, additional study is warranted to confirm sensitivity and/or specificity of the skin tape device for use in large efficacy clinical trials in CLE. Previous experience of this skin tape RNA device (Dermtech, La Jolla, California, USA) in the diagnosis of melanoma demonstrated 91% sensitivity and 69% specificity. This device is currently used in clinical practice to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma.

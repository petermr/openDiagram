 </sup>. HUMEC and MCF7 cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in six well plates and were replaced with the fresh media before applying AS6 to the target concentrations. After 48–72 h incubation, the cells were washed with cold PBS once and scraped. The cells were washed again with cold PBS twice before the total RNA molecules were extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. cDNAs were constructed from 136 to 600 ng of the collected RNAs using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan). cDNA was analyzed through qPCR using SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions (QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The thermal cycle used was 95 °C for 1 min as pre-denaturation, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The primers used for the experiments were purchased from Integrated DNA technology (USA) and are summarized in Table

<p>With regard to the excretory side of the genitourinary system, renal-innervating rat DRG neurones displayed ASIC3-like currents (transient and sustained currents at pH 5 and 6), which the authors propose play a role in the vasodilatory effects of inflammatory kidney disease such as hypertension [
 <xref rid="cit0132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Further down the excretory route, rat bladder-innervating DRG neurones also display ASIC3-like currents [
 <xref rid="cit0133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>] and it is thought that these ASIC3-expressing neurones likely play a role in bladder function because bladder afferents in ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice no longer respond to extracellular acidification [
 <xref rid="cit0134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Moreover, a common form of bladder irritation is cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis and in rats this is accompanied by increased ASIC3 expression in the urothelium and suburothelia plexus, but not in the detrusor smooth muscle, thus further suggesting a role for ASIC3 in bladder function [
 <xref rid="cit0135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. By contrast, in humans, bladder biopsies show ASIC3 to be expressed in both detrusor smooth muscle and urothelium, increased levels occurring in those presenting with bladder pain [
 <xref rid="cit0136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Lastly, painful urination (dysuria) is a common symptom of urinary tract infections (UTIs), where bacteria, such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, increase urine pH to make it less acidic. Thus, depending upon the causative bacterium, urinary pH has been reported to rise from a more acidic range of pH 5–7.5 [
 <xref rid="cit0137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], toward the basic range of ≥6.72 in children [
 <xref rid="cit0138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] and ≥6.28 in adults [
 <xref rid="cit0139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Considering that hASIC3a is activated by both acidification and alkalinization, and the expression of ASIC3 in bladder afferents, it could well be that hASIC3a plays a role in UTI pain, but this remains to be tested.

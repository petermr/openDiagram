0: Helium (purity 99.999%) with flow rate of 0.9 ml/min was employed as the carrier gas.
1: The column oven temperature was incresed from 50 C (hold 1 min) to 240 C (hold 10 min) with the rate of 5 C/min.
2: The injector and FID detector temperatures were aslo 230 and 300 C, respectively.
3: The injector was operated in the split less mode and programmed to return to the split mode after 1 min from the beginning of the run.
4: Diluted samples (1/10 in ether, v/v) of 0.3 L were injected manually, and the split ratio was adjusted to 50:1.

<p id="Par16">Using 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> as a marker for viral entry gene expression, it was compared to the expression of type I IFN antiviral response genes (
 <italic>IFITM3, MX1, SAMHD1</italic>, and 
 <italic>TRIM25</italic>) in GSE157103, which includes a large transcriptomic dataset from hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring non-ICU care (50), ICU-level care (50), as well as 26 control patients without COVID-19. With non-severe (non-ICU) COVID-19, there was increased expression of the viral entry gene (
 <italic>CTSL</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05)) and increased antiviral response genes (
 <italic>MX1</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), 
 <italic>SAMHD1</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), 
 <italic>TRIM25</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> (ns)). During severe (ICU-level) COVID-19, three of the four antiviral response genes were no longer upregulated (Supplementary Fig.

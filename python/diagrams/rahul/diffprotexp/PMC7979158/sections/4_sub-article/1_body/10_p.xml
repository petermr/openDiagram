<p>We agree that experiments such as birth dating, analysis of cell cycle timing and exit, and analysis of other time-points across the window of neurogenesis will be needed to ultimately resolve the impacts of MIA across neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Regrettably, such in depth analysis is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Nonetheless, we were able to follow the alternative strategy proposed in the review summary, providing an initial perspective on cell cycle kinetics via comparing the ratio of overall cycling cell numbers (Ki67+) with cells undergoing mitosis and labeled by Phospho Histone 3 (PH3), which is present in M phase. In addition to an overall decrease in VZ progenitor cell populations, the reduced Ki67/PH3 ratio revealed a significantly decreased proportion of progenitor cells undergoing mitosis in MIA brains at E17.5. This demonstrates that cell cycle kinetics and mitosis are altered beyond a simple reduction in progenitor cells at E17.5. The altered ratio is consistent with reduced time in M phase and/or a decreased number of cycling progenitors. This result is exciting and extends our findings. In addition to describing the new finding, we additionally acknowledge in the Discussion section that birth-dating, cell cycle kinetics, and time course experiments are needed to comprehensively determine altered proliferative and neurogenesis dynamics following MIA. The new experiments and analysis are included in Figure 4. The following text has been modified in the revised manuscript. To avoid reproduction, see text in [1c] as well as below.</p>

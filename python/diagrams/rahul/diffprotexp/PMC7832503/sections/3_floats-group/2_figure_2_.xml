  <p>The Manhattan and quantile–quantile plots from the common SNVs analysis.</p>
  <p>The genome wide association study was carried out with a logistics regression model for common SNVs. In the Manhattan plot, the blue line means P value is 1 × 10−5 and read line means P value is 5 × 10−8. The Q-Q plot didn’t show any signs of global inflation of test statistics. Although no genome-wide significant associations were identified from the common SNVs analysis, using a less stringent level of 1×10−4, 27 SNPs (represented by an intron variant rs4634725 with P = 3.16 × 10−5) locating on PTBP3 gene were identified.</p>

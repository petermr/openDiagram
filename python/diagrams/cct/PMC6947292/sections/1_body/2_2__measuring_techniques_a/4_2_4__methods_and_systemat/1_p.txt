0: As described above, a comprehensive understanding of the microstructural changes in the alloys caused by cooling is crucial.
1: As shown in  Figure 12, the dimensions of quench-induced precipitates vary substantially and cover about five orders of magnitude.
2: Thus, the use of a range of microscopes is required for imaging of the relevant precipitates.
3: Coarse quench-induced precipitates originating from high temperatures and slow cooling rates can be imaged by OM [ 112, 116, 138].
4: OM images also allow us to evaluate the volume fractions of coarse quench-induced precipitation [ 116, 118, 119, 138, 139].
5: SEM (e.g., [ 140]) allows imaging of coarser quench-induced precipitates.
6: Imaging is typically done with either secondary electrons (SEs) or backscattered electrons (BSEs), the latter of which give better contrast for different atom masses.
7: Analytical techniques integrated into SEM allow further valuable information to be acquired; for example, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) enables the determination of the chemical composition of precipitates [ 112, 138], while electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) can reveal the crystal structure of coarse precipitates [ 138].
8: EDS always involves a compromise between spatial resolution and element-specific stimulation.
9: A sufficient acceleration voltage is required for the EDS detection of alloying elements with heavier atomic masses; for example, the EDS detection of Zn typically requires an acceleration voltage of 25 kV [ 112].
10: However, this enlarges the interaction volume, and may make it larger than the particle of interest.
11: Thus, in most cases, it is rarely possible to obtain EDS signals solely from the precipitate, and part of the stimulated and measured X-rays generally originates from the matrix [ 138].

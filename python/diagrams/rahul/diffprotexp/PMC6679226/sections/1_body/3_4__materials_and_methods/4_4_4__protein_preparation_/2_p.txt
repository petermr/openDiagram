0: An equal amount of each TMT-labelled sample was pooled together in a single tube and SepPak purified (Waters Chromatography, Dublin, Ireland) using acidic reverse phase conditions.
1: After drying to completion, an off-line fractionation step was employed to reduce the complexity of the sample.
2: The sample was brought up in 260 L of 10 mM ammonium hydroxide, pH 10.
3: This mixture was subjected to basic pH reverse phase chromatography (Dionex U3000, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).
4: Briefly, UV monitored at 215 nm for an injection of 100 L at 0.1 mL/min with a gradient developed from 10 mM ammonium hydroxide, pH 10 to 100% acetonitrile (ACN, pH 10) over 90 min.
5: A total of 48 fractions (200 L each) were collected in a 96-well microplate and recombined in a checkerboard fashion to create 12 super fractions (original fractions 1, 13, 25, and 37 became new super fraction #1, original fractions 2, 14, 26, and 38 became new super fraction # 2, and so on.
6: ).

<p>In the model group vs. the control group, GO correlated with the negative regulation of the neurotransmitter transportation, Tau protein binding, long-term neuronal synaptic plasticity regulation, and GABA transport, and other biological processes related to neuronal apoptosis and neurotransmitter regulation were found. These genes were correlated with the neurodegenerative diseases related to Î²-amyloid metabolism and with glycolysis related to fructose 6-phosphate. This suggests that the RPE cells were in a state of anaerobic oxidation, protein dysfunction, and neuromodulation disorder during myopia.</p>

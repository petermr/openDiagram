  <bold>Mikhail Vagin</bold> started his research career in the field of applied electrochemistry in 1997 at the Chemistry Faculty of M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University as an undergraduate student (start 1997; 1998 M.Sc.; 2002 Ph.D.) and ended in 2010 as a full‐time senior researcher. Then, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Ireland (2010–2012, Dundalk Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tallaght Dublin). He joined Linköping University as a postdoctoral researcher in 2012. He became a docent in physical chemistry in 2019. His main scientific interests are focused on the mechanism‐ and the device‐oriented aspects of electrocatalysis.

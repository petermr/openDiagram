<p>The guest-free phase of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> was then prepared by heating 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> at 120 °C overnight under reduced pressure. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> in methanol-
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>4</sub> revealed that only one DMF molecule per HHTP molecule remained in the structure, indicating that the other five DMF molecules were removed upon heating (Fig. S6
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). CHN elemental analysis also confirmed the existence of one DMF molecule in 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>. The XRPD pattern of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> acquired in a dry Ar atmosphere (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>) shows broader peaks than that of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold>, in which fewer peaks are observed. The majority of peaks corresponding to 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> were indexed as (
 <italic>hk</italic>0), and all peaks were observed to be shifted to larger 2
 <italic>θ</italic> values. The d-spacing of the peak at 2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 27.4°, assigned to the (001) diffraction, is 3.26 Å, which corresponds to the distance between the π planes of HHTP and HAT-CN, and indicates that the intermolecular distances in the columns remain constant following DMF removal. Assuming an orthorhombic crystal system, the assigned cell parameters are 
 <italic>a</italic> = 11.2 Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 20.6 Å, and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 3.26 Å. When pseudo-hexagonal packing of the columns on the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane is assumed, a column diameter of approximately 10–11 Å is obtained, which is consistent with the sizes of HAT-CN and HHTP. These results strongly suggest that a structural transformation occurred after DMF removal and that the intercolumnar distance was reduced to maintain the pseudo-hexagonal columnar packing due to the strong π–π interactions between HHTP and HAT-CN. The SEM images shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c and d</xref> indicate that the crystal morphology of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> was maintained after DMF removal. Interestingly, the XRPD pattern became sharper and shifted after exposing 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> to ambient air or water vapor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Assuming that the crystal system is orthorhombic, the unit cell parameters are 
 <italic>a</italic> = 13.5 Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 22.1 Å, and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 3.29 Å, indicating that the lattice expanded along the direction of the 
 <italic>ab</italic> plane. This result strongly suggests that 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> rapidly adsorbs water molecules in the hydrophilic intercolumnar spaces to form 
 <bold>PCT-1·H
  <sub>2</sub>O
 </bold>. In addition, following exposure of 
 <bold>PCT-1·H
  <sub>2</sub>O
 </bold> powder to DMF vapor, the original XRPD pattern of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> was recovered, indicating that the adsorption–desorption process of the guest is reversible and that 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> can be regarded as a porous material (Fig. S7 and S8
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>).

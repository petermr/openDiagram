<p>The only process that has been reported to recover both Li from the electrodes and fluorine-based anions as well as Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions from conductive salts is that implemented by Recupyl [claim 5, 11] [
 <xref rid="B56-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The recovery of spent electrolytes is one of the most important challenge in the LIB recycling industry [

 <xref rid="B52-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and should be implemented for existing or developing processes. This important step has been increasingly studied or integrated, including in the recent pilot plant project proposed by Recyclage Lithion, where the organic carbonate solvents are captured during the automated dismantling step and are subsequently distilled into several fractions [

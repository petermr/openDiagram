0: KEGG is a database resource for understanding the high-level functions and biological effects of biological systems ( e. g., cells, organisms, and ecosystems) from molecular-level information, especially from large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
1: ClusterProfiler R package was also used to test the statistical enrichment of DEGs in KEGG pathways [ 26].

<p id="Par13">In the absence of distinctive transcriptomic or genomic alterations in CNFs and PNFs apart from putative NF1 deficiency, our work confirms that methylation events are key molecular determinants of nerve tumor initiation, growth, and pain generation. How epigenetic regulation of kinase signaling affects cancer predisposition in these tumors remains unclear; however, recent data confirms that accumulating epigenetic alterations in a single field or region are associated with elevated cancer risk [

Thus, our data lay the groundwork for future studies examining how epigenetic alterations affect PNF conversion into MPNSTs, as well as protective mechanisms that spare CNFs from cancerous progression or unchecked tumor growth. The identification of robust differences in the methylation profiles of CNFs versus PNFs also confirms their distinct biology, as well as laying the groundwork for future development of clinical biomarkers.

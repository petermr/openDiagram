<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There was no particular air temperature at which aardvarks emerged from their burrows or returned to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The range of air temperatures at which aardvarks emerged (&#8211;3.2 to 36.9&#176;C) or returned (&#8211;2.4 to 39.4&#176;C) to burrows varied seasonally, and was only slightly narrower than the full range of air temperatures experienced at Tswalu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Air temperatures usually were higher at the time of emergence than at the time of return, except from January to March 2013, when aardvarks had increased diurnal activity.</p>

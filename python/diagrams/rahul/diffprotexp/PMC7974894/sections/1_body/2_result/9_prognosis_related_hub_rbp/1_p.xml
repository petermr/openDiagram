<p>To investigate the functional mechanisms of the identified prognosis-related hub RBPs, we uploaded them to the online tool GSEA (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp</ext-link>) for functional enrichment analysis. The results strongly enriched the prognosis hub RBPs into metabolic processes, including generation of precursor metabolites and energy, glucose metabolic process, glycolysis and TCA cycle, etc (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). The cancer-associated metabolic alterations have profound effects on gene expression, cellular differentiation and the tumor microenvironment 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. And it has become evident that the alteration of cancer metabolism has been considered as an emerging hallmark of tumorigenesis 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Thus, our results indicated that these prognosis-hub RBPs might affect tongue cancer progression through regulating various metabolic processes. In order to determine the detailed role of the prognosis hub RBPs, we further uploaded these prognosis-related hub RBP genes to the online tool KEGG pathway analysis (

KEGG analysis respectively enriched LEPR, PFKM, PGK1, and CYP19A1 in AMPK signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). AMPK, HIF-1 signaling pathways and Glucose metabolism are widely recognized and heavily pursued for treatment of metabolic diseases, such as a variety of cancers 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Previous reports have demonstrated that the increased hormones occurred as cause of tongue cancer progression and revealed the components of the steroid biosynthetic pathways can be considered to be cancer biomarkers 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Thus, the enrichment of LEPR, PFKM, PGK1, and CYP19A1 in the aforementioned pathways suggests these prhRBPs as potential therapeutic targets.

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents these three features for voltage-dependent calcium, potassium and sodium ion channels. Expression variation was quantified as REV (Relative Expression Variability) (see “
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>”) to correct the expression coefficient of variation among biological replicates for redundant spots probing the same transcript. Owing to its importance for the cardiac muscle contraction and high expression in all chambers, 
 <italic>Actc1</italic> (actin, alpha, cardiac muscle 1) was selected as a reference gene to illustrate the independence of COR with respect to AVE and REV in each chamber. However, coordination with any other gene would also prove the independence of the three features.

<p>Prostate cancer (PC) ranks one of the top commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the developed world [
 <xref rid="B1-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Organ-confined PCs can be managed by active surveillance, prostatectomy, and radiation. Treatment decisions are based on several factors such as disease severity, and patient age and preference. The disease severity is commonly graded with Gleason score (GS) and GS-based grading system, World Health Organization (WHO) PC grading system (WHO grade group I-V) or ISUP (the International Society of Urological Pathology) grade [

 <xref rid="B3-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At the molecular level, PCs can be classified into three integrative clusters (iClusters), iCluster 1, iCluster 2, and iCluster 3 [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; this classification is based on alterations occurred in genome, methylation, and gene expression [
 <xref rid="B6-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While iCluster 1 PCs are enriched with 
 <italic>TMPRSS2-ETV1</italic> and 
 <italic>TMPRSS2-ETV4</italic> fusions, iCluster 2 PCs are featured with 
 <italic>TMPRSS2-ERG</italic> fusion [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Fusion of the androgen receptor (AR) target gene 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> to the ETS (E26 transcription-specific) gene family (
 <italic>ERG</italic>, 
 <italic>ETV1</italic>, and 
 <italic>ETV4</italic>), particularly the 
 <italic>TMPRSS2-ERG</italic>, commonly occurs in PC and plays important role in PC initiation and progression [

 <xref rid="B8-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While PC severity can facilitate therapy decision making, current management of PC patients needs significant improvement; as approximately 30% of patients undertaking the curative surgery treatment will have PC relapse or biochemical recurrence (BCR), evident by increases in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) [
 <xref rid="B9-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The relapsed PCs are at significantly higher risk of metastasis [
 <xref rid="B10-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Metastatic PCs (mPCs) are commonly managed with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); resistance nonetheless commonly develops in the form of castration-resistant PC (CRPC) [

 <xref rid="B12-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although multiple therapeutic options are available for CRPCs, including taxane-based chemotherapy [
 <xref rid="B13-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], AR-targeting therapy involving either abiraterone or enzalutamide [

 <xref rid="B16-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and immunotherapy [

 <xref rid="B18-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], effective control of CRPC remains the major challenge [
 <xref rid="B12-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This reflects the complex mechanisms underlying PC progression.

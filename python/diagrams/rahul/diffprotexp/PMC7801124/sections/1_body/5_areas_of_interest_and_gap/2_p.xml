<p>Whilst studies show that in response to an acid stimulus ASIC3 produces a biphasic current and that the sustained element could be linked to prolonged pain sensation, there have not been studies to deduce if this sustained element is directly involved in nociception during chronic pain conditions (constituting &gt;3 months of pain), and unfortunately there do not currently exist any compounds that effectively inhibit only the sustained phased to enable such investigation. There has also to date not yet been an investigation of the contribution of ASIC3 to a chronic pain condition, for example, what is the phenotype of ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice undergoing destabilization of the medial meniscus model of OA, which develops and is sustained over many weeks. Conducting such a long-term study would enable assessment of whether or not ASIC3 expression changes at different time points and perhaps enable it to be determined as to whether or not the sustained phase plays a role in chronic pain? Also, in humans, is there a role for ASIC3 in chronic pain? At least for acute acid-evoked pain in humans, recent data suggest no role for ASICs [

 <xref rid="cit0238" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>], which contrasts with older literature [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but how this scenario is altered in chronic pain states associated with prolonged tissue acidosis and the presence of multiple inflammatory mediators, many of which sensitize ASIC3, remains unknown.

<p>As described previously, tissue pH can decrease during periods of cardiac ischemia and humans who suffer a heart attack experience severe chest pain, as do those with angina where coronary blood flow decreases and pH is thought to drop. Studies by Sutherland and colleagues [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] demonstrated that sensory neurones innervating the heart were excited by acid and produced currents with similar biophysical properties to those of rASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Whilst 90% of rat cardiac-innervating DRG neurones had ASIC-like currents, only 50% of cardiac DRG neurones do in mice, but nevertheless, cardiac innervating neurones isolated from ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice exhibited a more acidic half-maximal pH of activation compared to WT mice [
 <xref rid="cit0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In rat sensory neurones, ASIC-like currents are sensitized by lactate (a by-product of anaerobic metabolism during cardiac ischemia) due to it chelating Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and the same effect is observed with rASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Lactate shifts the activation curve of ASIC3-like currents in rat cardiac-innervating sensory neurones, such that they display prolonged sustained currents at more basic pH in the presence of lactate [
 <xref rid="cit0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In addition to lactate, it appears that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is likely involved in sensitizing of ASIC3, activation of P2X5 by ATP resulting in ASIC3 producing larger responses to acid than acid alone [
 <xref rid="cit0100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that a combination of acid, lactate and ATP is more effective than each individual substance alone at activating muscle-innervating sensory neurones [
 <xref rid="cit0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Thus, it appears that ASIC3 acts as a coincident detector of lactate, ATP and protons to mediate cardiac and skeletal muscle pain.

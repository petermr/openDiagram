<p id="p0075">Using iBAQ mass spectrometry (iBAQ-MS), we measured the expression of proteins in the liver and skeletal muscle from fasted WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. We defined the significantly different proteins in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C; 
 <xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). Out of 2,373 proteins detected in liver, we identified 665 increased DEPs and 770 decreased DEPs in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice; out of 1,078 proteins detected in skeletal muscle, we identified 52 increased DEPs and 21 decreased DEPs in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). The increased DEPs in the liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice included the metabolic enzymes in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (Gck, Gapdh, Pgk1, Pklr), whereas the decreased DEPs in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice included those in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (Gapdh, Pgk1).

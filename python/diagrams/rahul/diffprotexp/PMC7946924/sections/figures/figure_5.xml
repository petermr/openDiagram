  <p>Differential gene expression (DGE) of miRNAs of apical and basal spikelets in V2 (SR-157) over V1 (SR-159) during post-anthesis (0, 5 and 10 days) using DESeq8 tool (
   <bold>a</bold>). DGE of miRNAs of V2 (SR-157) over V1 (SR-159) based on read length showing UP-regulation or DOWN-regulation after anthesis on 0 day in apical spikelets (
   <bold>b</bold>), 0 day in basal spikelets (
   <bold>c</bold>), 5 days in apical spikelets (
   <bold>d</bold>), 5 days in basal spikelets (
   <bold>e</bold>), 10 days in apical spikelets (
   <bold>f</bold>), 10 days in basal spikelets (
   <bold>g</bold>). Heat map showing DGE analysis of selected miRNAs in apical and basal spikelets of V1 (SR-159) and V2 (SR-157) on days 0, 5 and 10 after anthesis. Here, Log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change of 1 was used as cut off, miRNAs &gt; 1 were considered “UP- (red colour code)” regulated, miRNAs &lt; -1 considered “DOWN- (green colour code)” regulated and those between 1 and  − 1 were considered as “NEUTRAL (black colour code)” (

<p>We further examined the down-regulation of Cxcl15 by I.P. LPS (5 mg/kg) at different time points following treatment (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 per time point). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, the suppression of Cxcl15 in both BALF and lung tissue protein extracts was observed as early as 24 h, and in fact, the greatest suppression was seen at this time point. The suppression of Cxcl15 was maintained at 48 h following I.P. LPS treatment. One of the three I.P. LPS treated mice died between 48 and 72 h; however, the surviving two mice seemed to be recovering at 72 h based on their improved physical appearance (posture, fur condition) and increased activity in their home cage, and with the recovering from LPS-induced systemic inflammation, Cxcl15 protein levels returned to baseline (I.P. saline control) at 72 h.

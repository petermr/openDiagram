<p>Interestingly, the generation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is not necessarily linked to the severity of pathology for certain strains. For example, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> formation by 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> do not differ between the isolates from caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia and non-inflamed lungs or other forms of pneumonia [
 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. In addition, although the GlpF, GlpK, and GlpO mutants of 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> were incapable of producing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, these mutants remained fully virulent in the chicken respiratory tract [
 <xref rid="cit0165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Likeweise, the naturally attenuated strains retain the capacity to produce H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in cultures [
 <xref rid="cit0193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Furthermore, although Mmm SC type strain PG1 has been shown to release a large amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at physiological concentrations of glycerol, the cytotoxicity observed was almost negligible; exogenous addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to the axenic medium is not sufficient to cause cytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="cit0188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Therefore, these results demonstrate that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> may have a limited function in the pathogenesis of certain mycoplasmas.

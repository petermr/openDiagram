<p id="Par20">A total of 166 species were recorded in the mesic grassland, 32 in the semi-arid savannah and 30 in the arid scrubland. Some common species (i.e. occurring &gt; 3 times in a dataset) were non-randomly distributed between microsites (c. 20% of species in semi-arid savannah and the mesic grassland, but 0% in arid scrubland, Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.4</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.6</xref>). However, of these species only two occurred exclusively at a specific microsite, with the fern species 
 <italic>Cheilanthes viridis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pellaea calomelanos</italic>, occurring exclusively at burrow entrances in the mesic grassland (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.5</xref> for details).

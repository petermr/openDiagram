 <caption> Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR validation of 10 lncRNAs in the T1-T4 spinal cord. The expression levels of lncRNA ENSRNOT00000080713, ENSRNOT00000090564, ENSRNOT00000082588 and ENSRNOT00000091570 were significantly downregulated in model group, whereas the expression levels of lncRNA ENSRNOT00000087777, ENSRNOT00000082061, ENSRNOT00000087028 and ENSRNOT00000086475 were significantly upregulated. The expression levels of lncRNA ENSRNOT00000091080 and ENSRNOT00000091108 were not statistically different between the two groups. Data are presented as the mean Â± SEM (n=6). *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001 vs. control. MIRI, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA. </caption>

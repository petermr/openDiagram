<p id="Par45">No differential expression was observed at pre-treatment when good- and non-responders were analysed, in keeping with previous results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One possible reason could be that immune pathways are saturated at baseline since patients included the study had very high disease activity at baseline. Only after treatment is administered do the different gene expression groups emerge. We found that good-responders showed enrichment in pathways linked to TNF, supporting the hypothesis that there are different key drivers in different subgroups of patients. In future studies, it will be important to test the differentially expressed transcripts identified herein against different drugs in order to elucidate whether they are general markers of response or specific to this class of drug. The inability to identify baseline markers suggests that further discovery studies should redirect efforts to other data types or include on-treatment sampling as part of the study design. It is possible that the high levels of disease activity seen at pre-treatment in all study participants may be obscuring detection of pre-treatment gene expression signatures that are relevant to future treatment response.

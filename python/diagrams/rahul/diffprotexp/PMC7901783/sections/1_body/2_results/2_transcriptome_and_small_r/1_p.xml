<p>To determine molecular interactions and stress responsive mechanisms in quinoa during CMV infection, transcriptome and small RNA sequencing were performed. In transcriptome sequencing, a total of 1.182 billion raw reads was generated. After removing low quality reads and adapters, trimmed sequences (1.131 B) were mapped to

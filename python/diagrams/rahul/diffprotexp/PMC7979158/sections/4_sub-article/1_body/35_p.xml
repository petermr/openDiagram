<p>Following the reviewerâ€™s recommendation, we added new IHC experiments staining for PDGRFa. We include quantification analysis by zones for this new marker, following the same strategy we used for DLX2 in the initial submission. PDGFRa is specific to immature oligodendrocytes and showed similar over-representation as seen in our original OLIG2 IHC analysis. These new experiments are presented as Figure 6E, F, Ll. The paragraph in the text that describes these new findings is below:</p>

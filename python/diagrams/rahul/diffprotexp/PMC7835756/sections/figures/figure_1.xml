  <p>Phenotype of transgenic tobacco plants. In the photos, there is shown the phenotype characteristics of the transgenic plants in two physiological ages. The first, at 6-weeks-old both plants (
   <bold>A</bold>) L1 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) L8 were practically identical. At this age, samples were taken for the WGBS. At 3-months-old, both plants still looked similar, but the plants (
   <bold>C</bold>) L1 presented a light yellowing in the basal leaves compared with the (
   <bold>D</bold>) L8 plant.

<p id="Par5">Due to the importance of expanding the catalog of RNA subcellular localization, Zhang et al., established a database (RNALocate), from previously published data, that documents the subcellular localization of different RNA types in several species

 </sup>. However, most of the current knowledge about RNA localization is based on cell lines and in most cases restricted to targeted experiments rather than analysis of the complete RNA co-expression profiles. Global profiling of the differences between nuclear and cytosolic fractions is crucial for accurately interpreting data from single-cell transcriptome studies. Single-cell analysis from frozen tissue mainly involves sequencing RNA from sorted nuclei

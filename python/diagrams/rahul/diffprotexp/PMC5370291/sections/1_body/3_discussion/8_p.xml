<p>Gelsolin is a calcium-binding protein that controls cytoskeletal actin dynamics and plays an important role in cell metabolism and survival 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. Gelsolin is known to involve in a variety of cellular signal cascades for motility, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, and carcinogenesis phenotypes 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. Interestingly, gelsolin plays roles as both effector and inhibitor of apoptosis, depending on its association with different cancer types. Our findings revealed that TNFα lowered level of gelsolin in HepG2 cells; however, whether gelsolin acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis in HCC in response to TNFα needs further validation.

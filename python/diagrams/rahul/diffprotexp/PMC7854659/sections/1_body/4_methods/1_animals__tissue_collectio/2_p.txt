0: On day 50 of gestation, cerebrum ( n = 7/group), liver ( n = 7/group), and muscle ( n = 7/group) were collected from fetuses through ovariohysterectomy 72.
1: Tissue collection was performed at this time because fetal organogenesis have already finished and it is in the peak primary myogenesis 12.
2: The tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at  80 C, and later on, RNA isolation and sequencing were performed by the University of Minnesota Genomics Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN), as reported elsewhere 17.
3: After RNA quality control, strand-specific RNA libraries were prepared, and sequencing was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.
4: Sequencing was pair-end (50-bp reads) at a depth of 2  10.4 M reads/sample in both forward and reverse directions 17.
5: Fetal sex was determined by PCR based on the hind limb DNA amplification of the  DDX3X and  DDX3Y genes located on the X and Y chromosomes.
6: The PCR product was analyzed on agarose gel electrophoresis, where males showed two bands, and females resulted in only one.
7: This analysis was based on the primers, and PCR parameters reported elsewhere 73.
8: Thus, were evaluated 6 males and 1 female in the CON group and 5 males and 2 females in the RES group.

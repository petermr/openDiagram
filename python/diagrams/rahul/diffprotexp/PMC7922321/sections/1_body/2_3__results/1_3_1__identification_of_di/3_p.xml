<p>We have next asked whether ETS genes were among the DEGs, and, if so, how their expressions were affected in different glioma stages compared to the non-tumor control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). To that end, we have focused our studies to ETS subfamilies that have been previously reported to be involved in gliomas, namely the ETS subfamily [

 <xref rid="B41-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], TCF subfamily [
 <xref rid="B43-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], ELF subfamily [
 <xref rid="B46-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], PEA3 subfamily [
 <xref rid="B27-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and TEL subfamily [
 <xref rid="B49-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The results showed that the expressions of ETS2 and ELK-1 were downregulated at all grades, while the expressions of ELK4, ELF1, ELK3, ETS1, ETV4, and ETV1 were upregulated at all grades; intriguingly, ETV6 and ELF4 expressions were downregulated at grade 2, but upregulated at grades 3 and 4. The expression of ELK3, ETV4, and to some extent ELK4 was found to increase gradually with glioma grade, while ETV1 expression was highest in grade 2 glioma, and progressively decreased with glioma stage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). The only member of the SPI subfamily of ETS transcription factors represented was PU.1, which was previously shown to be involved in glioma progression, and its levels were indeed found to be increased with glioma grades (

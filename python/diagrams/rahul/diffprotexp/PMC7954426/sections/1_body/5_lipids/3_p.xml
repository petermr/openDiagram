<p>There are two types of GGPLs, GGPL-I and GGPL-III, which are structurally similar to MfGL-II [
 <xref rid="cit0257" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. The monoclonal antibody of GGPL-III does not cross-react with GGPL-I, indicating that GGPL-III is a membrane-specific antigen of 
 <italic>M. fermentans</italic>. GGPL-III alone displays a weak proinflammatory effect; however, it can promote both collagen-induced arthritis and nickel (Ni) allergy, although the effect is not as strong as that with LPS. The enhancement effect of GGPL-III on Ni allergy exists in mice deficient in either T cells or TLR4, but is significantly weaker in mice deficient in macrophages, IL-1, or the histidine decarboxylase [
 <xref rid="cit0264" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>], demonstrating that GGPL-III may be involved in certain types of chronic diseases, such as arthritis and allergy, through the innate immune pathway.

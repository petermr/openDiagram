<p id="Par19">The composition of dendrimers principally encompasses two steps; Michael addition and amidation. The reported method here involved ethylene diamine (EDA) as core, which was attached by acrylate resulting in −0.5G tetra ester. The next step followed the amidation of terminal carbomethoxy group by EDA. This tetra ester with an excess amount of EDA gave 0.0G tetra amine, Fig.

 </sup>. Excess of reagents was removed employing the usage of rotary vacuum evaporator maintained at 50–60 °C, in every step. All the reactions were advanced using tightly corked amber colored round bottom flasks obscured at room temperature for minimal step, defect-free, rapid and cost effective synthesis. The addition reaction took 2 days, whereas the amidation reaction took 4 days for the accomplishment of the array of reactions.

<p>Thorough understanding of contributions to severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pathogenesis is essential to advance the treatments and design of new vaccines. Earlier researches on the severity of influenza mainly focused on the viral virulence and properties [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been noticed that the host genetic variants may be related to the susceptibility of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection among different populations [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8â€“11</xref>]. Nevertheless, the host genetic background responsible for the development of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 diseases have not been well defined. About one-quarter to one-half of patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were previously healthy and did not have comorbid conditions, implicating that the inter-individual genetic variation may have accounted for the distinct disease severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [

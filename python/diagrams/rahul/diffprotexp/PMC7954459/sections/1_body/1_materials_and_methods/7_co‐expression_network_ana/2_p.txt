0: Coexpression network analysis was performed using WGCNA (Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis) package in R (Langfelder & Horvath,  2008).
1: The normalized expression values of miRNAs obtained from DESeq2 were used as input for coexpression analysis.
2: To identify modules, Pearson's correlation coefficient for all miRNAs in all the samples was calculated and an adjacency matrix was generated by raising correlation to a power .
3: The  value of 16 was selected based on the scalefree topology criterion as described (Langfelder & Horvath,  2008).
4: The miRNAs were clustered using the degree of overlap with shared neighbors between them.
5: A clustering tree (dendrogram) was created based on average linkage hierarchical clustering using the dynamic treecutting algorithm.
6: Each branch of the tree represented a module and modules with at least five miRNAs were considered and assigned a color code.
7: The miRNAs included in each module and their target mRNAs were subjected to further analysis.

<p id="Par13">In addition to reducing viral entry, bolstering host viral defenses to limit viral replication and tolerating infection are key to mitigating impact of COVID-19; these defenses are mediated by host immunity. In the aforementioned buccal mucosa data set (GSE103412), the researchers simultaneously collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Gene set enrichment analysis of COVID-19-related genes

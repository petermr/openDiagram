0:  Cytoprotective effects of HEO on tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( t-BOOH) treated lymphocytes.
1: Lymphocytes plus 100 M of t-BOOH were incubated for 24 h in the absence (b) or in the presence of 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, or 1 g/mL of essential oil (cl, respectively).
2: Lymphocytes incubated under the same experimental condition without t-BOOH (a).
3: Cell vitality and integrity were analysed by trypan blue staining ( A) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release ( B).
4: The asterisks (**) indicate significant differences ( p< 0.05).
5: Each value represents mean  SD ( n = 3). )

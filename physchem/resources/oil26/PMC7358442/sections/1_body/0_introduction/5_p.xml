We hypothesised that minimum 24-h body temperature of aardvarks would decline during periods of low food resource availability, resulting in an increased amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm. Secondly, we hypothesised that to compensate for reduced food availability or increased energetic cost to maintain homeothermy during cooler times of the year (in winter), aardvarks might become increasingly diurnal when they were more compromised energetically.</p>

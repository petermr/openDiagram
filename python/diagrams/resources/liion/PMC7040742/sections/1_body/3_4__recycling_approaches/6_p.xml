<p>Lastly, the recycling loop can be shortened by directly regenerating the properties of the active materials. This is the most environmentally friendly method, but it is also more sensitive to the state-of-health of LIBs. Defects and impurities accumulated during cycling or caused by the over-discharging and improper storage of LIBs could affect the quality of the refurbished active material. Ultimately, after many cycles, the active material might have to be discarded and resynthesized because direct recycling cannot yet fully restore the initial properties of pristine active materials. Although more complex pretreatment is required to avoid cross contamination from components of other types of LIBs, this approach reduces the required amounts of energy and reagents and aims to simplify the core process, which could result in smaller and more affordable recycling plants. </p>

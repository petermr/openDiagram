<p>In addition to our discovery that the induction of p53β is specifically required for IR-induction of cellular senescence markers, sporadic reports also suggest that the expression of p53 isoforms is induced in cancer cell lines treated with DNA damage reagents and related to cancer clinical features and outcome [
 <xref rid="B23-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In order to explore whether expression or induction of p53β could serve as a predictive biomarker of outcome in cancer patients treated with radiation or chemotherapy, we interrogated the TCGA database and corresponding RNA-Sequence data of the patients and found evidence suggesting that in stage III/IV breast cancer patients, who are commonly treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, high levels of p53β RNA expression were associated with prolonged overall survival (

<p>The technique of GST pull-down was used to determine the interaction between PirB and histone H4, as described previously [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. First, 
 <italic>P. vannamei</italic> histone H4 (GenBank #: MH311299.1) was cloned with a His-tag and expressed in the pET-32a plasmid (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) as described in subsection 2.2. Next, beads coupled with rGST-PirB were incubated for 0.5Â h at room temperature with supernatant extracted from the pET-32a-
 <italic>Pv</italic>histone H4 expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21. Samples were then centrifuged and washed. Finally, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, as described in subsection 2.2, with mouse anti-His primary antibody (1:3000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China).

<p>None of the ubiquitination processes-related genes that were identified as putative targets of DEMs have significantly distinct expression levels. However, some of DEGs that were identified as targets of DEMs may have an interesting role in the biology of 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut corticotroph PitNETs. For example, our results indicate that hsa-mir-382-5p, which has higher expression in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut tumors, may regulate genes involved in transcriptional regulation: 
 <italic>KMT2C</italic>, 
 <italic>KDM5A</italic>, and 
 <italic>AFF1</italic>. 
 <italic>KMT2C</italic> encodes for lysine methyltransferase that introduces mono-methylation mark at histone H3K4 [
 <xref rid="B31-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], while KDM5A is lysine demethylase that converts di- and trimethylated H3K4 into mono-methylated form [
 <xref rid="B32-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. H3K4 mono-methylation plays a role in regulation of gene enhancers activation [
 <xref rid="B33-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In turn, AFF1 functions as a regulator of transcription elongation and chromatin remodeling [
 <xref rid="B34-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This suggests that hsa-mir-382-5p may contribute to a large difference in gene expression levels between 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt corticotrophinomas.

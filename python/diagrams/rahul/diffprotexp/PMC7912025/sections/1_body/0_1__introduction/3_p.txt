0: The nature, timing, and magnitude of inducible epithelial cytokine responses play important roles in shaping disease and activating adaptive immunity.
1: In the epithelium, IRF and NFB crosstalk is the key regulator of type I and type III IFN gene expression [ 13, 14], responsible for the expression of some 350 interferon-simulating genes (ISGs), producing antiviral protection.
2: IFN type I/III stimulation produces a dramatic upregulation of IRF, TLR3, and RIG-I to further amplify the antiviral response.
3: This IFN amplification loop primes neighboring epithelial cells to elicit a protective antiviral state and commitment to apoptosis [ 15].

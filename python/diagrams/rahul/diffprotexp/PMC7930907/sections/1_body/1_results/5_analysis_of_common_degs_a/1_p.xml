 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) among SASCs, EASCs, and PASCs. GO analysis of common DEGs showed the top 10 significantly enriched BPs, CCs, and MFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). The results of the KEGG analysis showed that common DEGs participated in several information processing pathways including apoptosis, the TGF-beta signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and lysosome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Common differential metabolites were primarily involved in five metabolic pathways, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; purine metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism (

<p>Analysis of HA levels in the skin of mice that were treated with the predicted optimal 4-MU topical formulation (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice, 3 males and 3 females, 7–8 weeks of age) showed a significant reduction as compared to the untreated group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice, 4 males and 4 females, 7–8 weeks) (93.63 ± 27.85 ng/µg protein vs. 175.70 ± 79.98 ng/µg protein, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05). While the predicted reduction in HA was ∼70%, the data obtained from the mice with equal number of males and females grouped together in each treatment showed ∼50% reduction in HA expression in dorsal skin. However, we observed differences in the effect of 4-MU topical treatment among female and male mice, with female mice showing ∼60% reduction (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01), as compared to male mice which showed ∼26% reduction (
 <italic>p</italic>=.11) in HA levels as compared to their respective untreated controls. Sham treatment (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice, 3 males and 3 females, 7–8 weeks) did not result in a significant decrease in skin HA levels compared to untreated (93.63 ± 27.85 ng/µg protein vs. 166.7 ± 58.68 ng/µg protein, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05). However, we observed a slight reduction in the HA levels in the skin of female mice with sham topical treatment as compared to their untreated controls. (

<p>To quantify S.A. β-gal activity, we used a previously reported chromogenic assay [
 <xref rid="B111-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In brief, we fixed B16F1 cells with a 0.2% (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) paraformaldehyde solution (Merck) and 0.2% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 4 °C. We incubated for 18 h at 37 °C without CO
 <sub>2</sub> with the substrate and chromogenic solution containing: 1 mg/mL of X-gal reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 61 mM citric acid/sodium phosphate (pH 4.0, pH 6.0 and pH 7.5; as appropriate), 5 mM K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe [CN]
 <sub>6</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM K
 <sub>4</sub>Fe [CN]
 <sub>6</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich), 150 mM NaCl (Merck) and 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (Merck). We documented the changes through a photographic record and spectrophotometric quantification. The staining solution was removed and washed with PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature and protected from light. We dissolved the β-galactosidase product with 200 µL of 99% DMSO by 5 h and then quantified at 600 nm in the Glomax spectrophotometer. Data were expressed as the average of four independent trials ± standard deviation and analyzed by unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test with Welch correction and a 95% confidence interval.

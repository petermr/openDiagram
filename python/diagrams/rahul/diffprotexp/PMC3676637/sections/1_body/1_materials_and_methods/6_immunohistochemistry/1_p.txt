0: Tissue blocks of the primary tumors and brain metastases were cut into 3-m sections, which were dewaxed, rehydrated, and incubated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidases.
1: Then, the sections were incubated with anti-ENO1 monoclonal antibody (1:100; Abcam) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (ENVISION + ; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) for 30 min at room temperature.
2: Finally, color was developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.

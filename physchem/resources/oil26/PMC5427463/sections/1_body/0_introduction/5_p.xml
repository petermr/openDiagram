<p>Knowing that the activity of EOs from aromatic plants could be affected by several factors such as the geographical origin, the genetic background of the plant from which the EO was obtained (Pattnaik et al., 1997[
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]), the aims of this study were (i) to determine the chemical composition of essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> from Tunisia (ii) to assess antioxidant activity, (iii) to test antimicrobial activity against some pathogens and phytopathogen strains, (iv) to test insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> larvae and 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> adults and (v) to evaluate its effects on seed germination and radical and hypocotyl elongation.

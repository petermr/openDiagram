<p>The mean amplitude of the 24-h rhythm of aardvark body temperature during a non-drought summer month (1.8 ± 0.3°C) increased during a drought summer to 2.3 ± 0.4°C, which was similar to that evident in a non-drought winter month (2.1 ± 0.1°C). Mean amplitude of 24-h body temperature rhythm in a drought winter month (4.7 ± 1.3°C) was more than double the amplitude during the equivalent month in the absence of a drought.</p>

<p id="Par17">These differentially expressed transcripts were subject to Gene Ontology (GO) analyses, and found to be enriched in the biological processes associated with the single-organism developmental system, anatomical structure developmental system, developmental process, multicellular organismal development, etc.. In addition, numerous enriched differentially expressed genes were found to be related to multiple cellular components and involved in molecular functions including extracellular matrix, cell junction and extracellular region (data not shown). However, no statistical difference among the GO terms was detected between the G5p and G5d cells.</p>

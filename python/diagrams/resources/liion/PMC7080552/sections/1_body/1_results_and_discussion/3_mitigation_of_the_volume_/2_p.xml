<p>The in situ formed lithiophilic 3D skeleton is designed to function as a “host” for Li metal to maintain the structural integrity and stability of the electrode. The ability to alleviate the significant volume change is verified through the cross‐sectional SEM, as shown in

 </xref>. It has to be noted that the experiment adopted about 0.2 mm thick Li–B–Mg composite plate and 0.6 mm thick Li foil. As displayed in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, the thickness of the pristine Li–B–Mg is measured to be 247.6 µm. After 15.3 mA h of Li (25% free Li in Li–B–Mg composite) was stripped from the composite, the thickness of the composite plate decreased only by 5.3 µm (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), less than the theoretical value of 37.11 µm (calculation details are shown in the Supporting Information). Besides, the even Mg distribution in the cross‐section of the composite after Li stripped (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c,d) corroborates that Mg remains homogeneous in the whole stripping process. It is noted that Li(Mg) alloy could act as a dual‐conductive host for Li due to the transition to a Li‐deficient material.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> As the concentration of Mg increases with Li stripped, the strength of the composite is enhanced, and it helps to protect the Li in LiB from being stripped. So the exist of Mg contributes to the stability of the electrode. In contrast, Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e,f show that the “hostless” Li foil experienced a vast reduction in thickness of 149.3 µm after 60 mA h Li has been stripped (24.3% of the total Li corresponding to a theoretical thickness of 145.55 µm, see detailed calculations in the Supporting Information). Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g shows a cracked Li surface which may result from the large volume variation during extraction of Li, as schematically illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. The inhomogeneous Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition would lead to the observed Li electrode pulverization. In a word, the current experiment verifies that LiB skeleton can work as a scaffold to alleviate the volume variation and support the whole electrode after Li has been stripped.

<p id="Par29">RNAseq datasets obtained from different brain regions were used (Mayo
 <sup>2</sup>; MSBB
 <sup>3</sup>; ROSMAP
 <sup>4</sup>). Datasets were downloaded from AMP-AD Knowledge Portal (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8672335" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.synapse.org</ext-link>) following all terms and conditions to use the data. The brain area analyzed and the number of individuals per condition was the following: Mayo - Temporal cortex, which neuroanatomically subdivides into the inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri (STG), and cytoarchitectonically can be subdivided into Brodmann areas (BM, instead of BA) 20/21/22/41/42

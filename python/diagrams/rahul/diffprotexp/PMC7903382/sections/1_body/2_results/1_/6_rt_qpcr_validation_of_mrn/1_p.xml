<p>The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that the mRNA expression levels of Frs3, Nedd4l and Tep1 were significantly downregulated in the model group, while the expression of mRNA Myef2 was significantly upregulated in the model group. The expression levels of mRNA Zfp523, Dnajc6 and Myef2 were not significantly different between the two groups (

The expression levels of lncRNA ENSRNOT00000080713, ENSRNOT00000090564, ENSRNOT00000082588 and ENSRNOT00000091570 were significantly downregulated in the model group, but the expression levels of lncRNA ENSRNOT00000087777, ENSRNOT00000082061, ENSRNOT00000087028 and ENSRNOT00000086475 were significantly upregulated in the model group. However, the expression levels of lncRNA ENSRNOT00000091080 and ENSRNOT00000091108 were not significantly different between the two groups (

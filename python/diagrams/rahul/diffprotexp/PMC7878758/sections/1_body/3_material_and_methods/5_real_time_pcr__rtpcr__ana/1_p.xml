<p id="Par29">Validation of fifty most significantly expressed genes having more than 2 log fold changes in any of its time points were selected for RTPCR analysis. Primers were designed using Primer3 software(

Amplification of 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta isoform X1 and NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha sub complex subunit 11 were used as housekeeping gene. RTPCR were performed in biological and technical replicates for each genes from the cDNA synthesized from 1 Î¼g total RNA using Takara SYBR green assay master mix. The relative expressions of the genes were estimated based on the RTPCR Ct value against control (0-dpa) as the baseline.

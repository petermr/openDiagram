<p>For similarly synthesized CuSn catalysts,

 </sup> the addition of Sn resulted in a higher concentration of adsorbed CO and higher selectivity for CO production. Also in this case, the use of the DAT additive resulted in a more nanostructured catalyst morphology, and good mixing of Sn in Cu, as confirmed by Sn K-edge EXAFS data analysis.

 </sup> Enhanced CO selectivity was achieved also for Pd-rich CuPd NPs,

 </sup> where alloying between Cu and Pd was similarly confirmed based on the analysis of Pd–Cu, Pd–Pd, Cu–Pd, and Cu–Cu coordination numbers and interatomic distances.

<p id="Par31">The use of water-soluble carbons demonstrates that better electrochemical performance and shorter preparation time can be achieved; accordingly, the modified LFP with aryl-COOH groups is prepared. The same method for carbon modification is employed but with certain differences. The reaction procedure is represented in Scheme 
 <xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (reaction b). The modification is conducted in acetonitrile rather than acidic media because the LFP powder rapidly reacts with water and acids

 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows the electrochemical performances of two LFP electrodes made of modified LFP–COOH materials with different thicknesses. First, it should be noted that the grafting of organic species on the LFP does not adversely affect the electrochemical performance because the rate capability is practically identical regardless of whether pristine or modified LFP is used. Although this result has not been verified, it indicates that the amount of grafted groups should be extremely low (&lt;1 wt.%) as indicated by the performances remaining unchanged. An extremely high loading of grafted groups leads to an unsatisfactory rate capability, as demonstrated by recent works

 </sup>. In conclusion, the use surface-modified carbon and LFP–COOH allows the fabrication of a strong self-standing film in less than 10 min by simply mixing the components in water. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, a slightly higher capacity is obtained after calendering at 80 °C because the contact between the carbon and active material inside the electrode is better. The same result is obtained with the unmodified LFP electrodes calendered at 50 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI2</xref>; Supporting Information). At 25 °C, an approximately 100-µm thick film is obtained, whereas ~80 and ~70 µm are measured after calendering at 50 and 80 °C, respectively.

0: The siRNAs for STCH (HSPA13) and Hsp70 (HSPA1A) siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon as ON-TARGET plus SMART pools (L-015679-00-0005 and L-005168-00-0005, respectively).
1: HEK cells were first transfected with control or specific siRNA with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Paris, France) using the manufacturers specifications.
2: One day after siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with NKCC2 plasmids.
3: Then, 48 h after NKCC2 transfection, cell lysates were analyzed for each protein using the indicated antibodies.

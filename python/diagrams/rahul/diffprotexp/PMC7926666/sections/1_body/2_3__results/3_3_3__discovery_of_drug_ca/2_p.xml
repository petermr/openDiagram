<p>For instance, among DIP proteins of the pRCC subtype, MET protein came into prominence as a potential drug target. Candidate molecules targeting MET were determined via virtual screening of the ZINC15 library via the available crystal structures of MET from PDB. All available X-Ray crystal structures of MET (PDB IDs: 3DKF, 2RFN, 3EFJ, 3U6H, 4EEV) and their bound ligands were superposed, and potential binding sites were determined to identify the binding site location on the receptor (

Virtual Screening binding analysis was accomplished on the assigned binding site of the X-ray structure of MET (PDB ID: 3DKF) utilizing ZINC molecules which were described by the ZINC15 library. The virtual screening analysis revealed twenty-one ZINC molecules with high binding affinities (ΔG

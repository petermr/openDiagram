<p>Oncosphere vs. adult: a total of 375 differentially expressed proteins were observed between oncosphere and adult 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> (without eggs), with 213 up-regulated and 162 down-regulated (see Data Analysis, ratios with 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, and only fold changes of &gt;1.2 were considered significant differences). The partial significant differential expression proteins are listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and the partial up-regulated proteins were diagnostic antigen gp50, dynein light chain, and thioredoxin glutathione reductase. Metabolic pathways showed that 285 differential proteins were assigned in 188 pathways, with 81 in metabolic pathways, 66 in three diseases, and 21 in ribosome (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Following GO analysis, partial representative GO terms of differentially expressed proteins were assigned as “structural molecule activity” and “oxidoreductase activity” (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).

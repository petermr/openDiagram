0: In this work, micro/nanoscale LiFePO 4/graphene composites are synthesized successfully using a one-step microwave heating method.
1: The synthesis technique has a decisive influence on the structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties of the LiFePO 4 product.
2: Microwave synthesis can save synthesis time; this is because the raw material can absorb microwave energy by itself and convert electromagnetic energy into heat and internal molecular kinetic energy, thus improving the diffusion coefficient and accelerating the reaction rate.
3: Meanwhile, microwave synthesis can lower the synthesis temperature; this is because the electromagnetic field decreases the activation energy of the reaction.
4: Therefore, microwave heating is a rapid and effective synthetic method for preparing a product with small particle size.
5: Furthermore, unlike in complex, multi-step preparation processes, microwave irradiation can restore the graphene oxide into graphene directly without any reductive agent and atmosphere.
6: The synthesized micro/nanoscale LiFePO 4/graphene composites with fine particle size and uniform distribution can decrease the migration distance of lithium ions from the interior to the surface and increase the diffusion rate.
7: Meanwhile, graphene wrapping of the surface of LiFePO 4 particles can guarantee that the electrons migrate to the active sites quickly.
8: Controlling the particle size and coating with graphene play important roles in the electrochemical performance.
9: The effects of graphene and microwave irradiation on the electrochemical performance of LiFePO 4/graphene cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries are further investigated.

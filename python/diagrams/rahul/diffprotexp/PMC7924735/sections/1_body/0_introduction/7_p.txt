0: Bioinformatic analysis has proved to be useful for protein identification and characterization.
1: Three main research approaches have been reported.
2: First, transcriptomic data (mRNA) can be used for the computational prediction of the signal peptide in genomic sequences and characterize them by computational tools [ 4].
3: Second, EST tags (EST2secretome) can be generated in a bioinformatic approach, where the signal peptide is identified, the sequences showing transmembrane motifs are eliminated, and ontological analyses are performed to infer functions.
4: The mapping relies on known domains and metabolic pathways, as well as on the search for homologs [ 17].

0: In vitro Brine Shrimp lethality bioassay of the essential oil was exploited to detect cytotoxicity by Mayers method [ 19].
1: Brine Shrimp eggs were hatched in the brine solution (3.8% NaCl in distilled water) within 48 h. The samples were prepared by dissolving in DMSO solution (not more than 50 L in 5 mL solution) and it was applied in 5 mL brine solution to attain the concentrations of 0.0195 to 10.0 g/mL.
2: DMSO (50 L) was used as negative control.
3: Standard vincristine sulphate (VcS) (0.078 g/mL to 10.0 g/mL) was used as positive control.
4: Approximately 10 matured nauplii were taken to each vial.
5: The numbers of surviving nauplii were counted after 24 h. The lethal concentrations (LC 50) and the dose-response data were calculated by Biostate 2007 data analysis software.

<p>The micromorphology of B-SFO@C was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). Clearly, the B-SFO@C sample presents a dense bulk structure with a size ranging from 10 up to 20 μm, indicating that the xerogels frameworks were effectively stabilized and maintained during oxygen-lean pyrolysis. A close inspection of the magnified SEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>b) unveils that the surface of the monolithic B-SFO@C is constituted of closely packed fine particles, with only an extremely small number of pores/voids. In addition, the element mapping images (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S4</xref>) reveal the uniform spatial distribution of C, O, Sn, and Fe elements throughout the whole framework of B-SFO@C. The tap density of B-SFO@C measured using the tap density tester is about 0.71 g cm
 <sup>−3</sup>—higher than that of various nanosized SnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based composites (about 0.4 g cm
 <sup>−3</sup>) reported previously [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Such high tap density will become largely useful to facilitate homogenous slurry mixing and heighten the energy density and volumetric performance. The N
 <sub>2</sub> volumetry (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S5</xref>) displays that the BET surface area of B-SFO@C is only 12.3 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is one order of magnitude lower than a variety of the nanosized SnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based composites (&gt;100 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>) recorded before [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Such textural feature again signifies a compact structure of B-SFO@C, in good consistency with SEM pictures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b). Besides, the B-SO@C and B-SFO samples also demonstrate the similar bulk structure (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S6a,b</xref>). However, the surface of B-SFO (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S6c</xref>) is rougher than that of B-SFO@C and is made up of many particles with a size of 100–200 nm. The morphology disparity between B-SFO@C and B-SFO is due to the fact that the carbon matrix can serve as the strong spacer to effectively encumber the agglomeration, growth, and coarsening of metal oxide particles during pyrolysis. Detailed microstructures of B-SFO@C can be further analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>c, a high density of dark spots as metal nanoparticles are closely and homogeneously distributed in the carbon matrix. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>c inset) shows the bright polycrystalline diffraction rings of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The magnified TEM image (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S7</xref>) further reveals that the ultra-small nanoparticles with a size of about 5 nm are evenly implanted within the interiors of the carbon framework, giving rise to a unique metal particles-in-carbon sandwich-like configuration. In addition, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>d, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) sheds light on two sets of the well-defined crystal lattice fringes with the interplanar distances of 0.33 nm and 0.27 nm, pertinent to the (110) facet of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and (104) facet of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, respectively. Besides, a clear monolithic contour with no well-observable porosity (including mesopores and macropores) occurs in the TEM images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d), again proving non-porous/compact structural motifs. The vermiculate domains tightly around dark spots (metal nanoparticles) with the poorly visible lattice lines can be indexed as amorphous carbon layers, in good consistency with the noncrystalline characteristics revealed by the XRD and Raman analysis. According to the previous rationale that stress can be assuaged through downscaling towards the nanometre, a dimension threshold to cause the expansion and spread of fracture in the materials has been proven to be roughly 150 nm [

Aa a result, multitudinous exquisite morphological engineering toward highly hierarchical structures have been under study, to fulfil the Sn stress relaxation during the lithiation process. For instance, the marked boosts of long-cycle stability have come true by exploiting the sub-10-nm-sized Sn/SnO

 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] of the hierarchical layouts, as a consequence of the existence of empty room/volume and other topological problems. Worse still, to secure the empty rooms will deprive the materials of vital virtues during the tight calendaring in that majority of empty volume might undergo the utter devastation. Herein, the tap density increases through constructing a compact secondary architecture featuring the inactive/active buffers by composites. Confining a high population of the ultrafine metal nanoparticles inside the bulk-like carbon monolith can not only modulate the stress but also obviate a great deal of void space and, therefore, the related morphological problems. In this sense, such a binary metal oxide nanoparticles-intercalated carbon monolith structure is concluded to be more amenable to traditional electrode preparation than other designer nanomaterials, particularly taking into account the real-world utilization based upon the high average energy/power density rating. As for LIBs, this material is projected to be distinguished by an elevated specific capacity, endurable cyclic behaviour, and oppressed volume swelling; thus, a small irreversible capacity loss and a resultant high capacity retention.

0: Several key challenges, however, should be overcome before the Mg battery technology comes true (Yoo et al.,  2013; Saha et al.,  2014; Bucur et al.,  2015; Wang et al.,  2020).
1: For instance, due to the electrochemical reduction, a passivation layer is formed on Mg anode surface once Mg is on contact with conventional carbonate-based electrolyte solvents used in LIBs (Muldoon et al.,  2012).
2: While conducting for Li ion in LIBs, solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is insulating for Mg ion and thus prevents the conventional electrolyte solvents to be used in Mg batteries (Pan et al.,  2020).
3: Novel electrolytes are therefore developed for Mg batteries and most of them are based on Grignard reagents dissolved in ethereal solvents or glymes such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Deivanayagam et al.,  2019).
4: Nevertheless, concerns on safety and stability still remain for the high vapor pressure and the high flammability of ether-based organic solvents.
5: Furthermore, the presence of Cl  anions in Grignard reagents results in the high corrosion and the electrolytes also have narrow electrochemical operation window (<2 V vs. Mg/Mg 2+), indicating limited practical application (Tutusaus et al.,  2015).
6: Therefore, solid-state electrolyte employed by all-solid-state Mg batteries is a safe alternative in terms of heat and mechanical shock resistance (Ikeda et al.,  1987; Imanaka et al.,  1999; Janek and Zeier,  2016; Famprikis et al.,  2019).
7: Nevertheless, the development of solid-state Mg ion conductor with sufficient conductivity is a key challenge at ambient temperature because of the sluggish mobility resulted by the high charge density of Mg ion (Janek and Zeier,  2016; Famprikis et al.,  2019).
8: Many efforts are thus devoted to improve the mobility of Mg ion within the solid conductor and the target is 10 3-10 4 S cm 1 at ambient temperature, which is comparable with those of solid electrolytes used in lithium or sodium batteries (Janek and Zeier,  2016).

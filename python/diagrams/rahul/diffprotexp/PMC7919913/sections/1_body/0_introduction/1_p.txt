0: Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death among CKD patients [ 1].
1: Myocardial remodeling is an important pathological mechanism in the development of heart failure with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as the main feature.
2: Suppression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has been regarded as an effective therapeutic regimen to prevent heart failure in CKD patients.
3: The inhibitors of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system can reverse the left ventricular hypertrophy and improve the function of the left ventricle, while such inhibition of RAAS system may also lead to a decrease of glomerular filtration rate and an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
4: Other therapeutic regimens, such as regulating blood flow dynamics, relieving fluid overload, correcting anemia or malnutrition, and correcting bone mineral metabolism disorder, are still lack of the capability for completely reversing heart failure in the CKD.
5: To the best of our knowledge, there are no effective therapies specific for types 3 and 4 Cardiorenal syndrome(CRS) so far [ 2], which makes it essential to seek potential therapy by exploring other factors involved in CKD-related CVD.

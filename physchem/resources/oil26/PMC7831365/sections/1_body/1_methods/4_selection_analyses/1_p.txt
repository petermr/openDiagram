0: To evaluate the selective pressure of relevant branches leading to enamel-less and toothless lineages respectively, we implemented  two ratio branch model to calculate the ratio of the nonsynonymous substitution rate ( dN) to the synonymous substitution rate ( d  S) ( =  d  N/ d  S) by running CodeML in PAML 4.8a package ( Yang, 2007).
1: We also recoded premature stop codons as missing data.
2: Akaike information criterion (AIC) scores were used to select the most appropriate codon frequency model in CodeML.
3: The  ACPT gene tree exhibits different topological relationship compared to species tree, which may be unrelated to incomplete lineage sorting.
4: In order to illuminate the detected signal reasonably and accurately, we used a species tree supported by some previous studies ( Fig.
5: S1).

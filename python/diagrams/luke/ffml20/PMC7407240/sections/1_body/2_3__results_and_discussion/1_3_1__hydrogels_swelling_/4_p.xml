 <xref rid="polymers-12-01544-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It can be seen that ι-carrageenan (having a higher molecular weight compared to PVA) interferes with the freeze–thaw-induced crosslinking mechanism of PVA, due to the formation of PVA-carrageenan interpolymer complexes, decreasing the crosslinking density, respectively, increasing the molecular weight between the crosslinks, leading to an increase in water swelling. Additionally, the PVA–water interaction parameter χ increases in the blends with the increase in the ι-carrageenan content, implying stronger interpolymer interactions in favor of polymer-water interactions [

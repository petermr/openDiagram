0: Most pyrometallurgical processes, which currently constitute the dominant recycling route, cannot recover lithium as a valuable element and are not effective for phosphate-based batteries.
1: Moreover, the current business model for recycling of large battery packs is based on service fees to the battery owner.
2: Are these fees discouraging the adoption of lithium-ion batteries?
3: There is a need to find alternative, low-cost recycling processes for large battery packs from EVs and stationary systems.
4: In this context, hydrometallurgy is an alternative process to the standard pyrometallurgical process; however, its large-scale implementation is still significantly limited: Recupyl being the only large-scale operator in this domain due to high operating cost.
5: Still, several hydrometallurgical-based pilot projects are in development, particularly in North America.
6: In this respect, sulfuric acid leaching is the dominant process and offers the advantage of low reagent cost and well-known chemical process characteristics.

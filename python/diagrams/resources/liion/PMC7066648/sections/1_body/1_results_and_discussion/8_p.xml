<p>To better verify the flexibility of the prepared yarn-shaped LIB which has an effective length of 7 cm and a diameter of 1.76 mm (

 </xref>a), its electrochemical performance at different states (normal, bent, and knotted) is demonstrated (

 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.1 C. Even being bent or knotted, the output specific capacity of the assembled yarn-shaped LIB is still maintained above 85%. How to maintain the stable capacity retention rate of the prepared yarn-shaped LIB in the process of multiple bending or folding is still an important issue to be solved in the future. The battery with good flexibility (

The performance of the yarn-shaped LIB assembled from inexpensive materials through a simple preparation process still needs to be further improved.

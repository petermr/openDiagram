<p>Analysis of cellular components after metformin treatment revealed that most regulated proteins belonged to extracellular space/regions (19–22) and were mainly constituents of the plasma membrane (8–12), of which some were related to focal adhesion (7) (
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Molecular functions of the affected proteins included protein binding (37), growth-related functions (6–7), and adhesion (5). The biological processes of the regulated proteins were related to cell proliferation (10), particularly of B and T cells (5–6), and with involvement of the MAPK cascade (6), cell adhesion, migration as well as angiogenesis (5–8), and immune (9) or inflammatory (7) responses. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis revealed a link to PI3K/AKT signaling (9), a pathway involved in quiescence, proliferation, and cancer. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions (9), focal adhesion (7), cancer-related components of the extracellular matrix, so called proteoglycans (8), and a link to hematopoiesis (9) were also identified as pathways that were targeted by metformin administration.

<p id="Par31">LMNA, the component of nuclear inner membrane protein, is located mostly at the nuclear periphery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cheedipudi SM et al. reported that Lamin A/C interacted with heterochromatic lamina-associated domains (LADs) to regulate gene expression in DCM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, according to recent reports, the combination of LMNA and euchromatin attracts high attention, and the role of LMNA binding to euchromatin in LMNA mutation-associated DCM is still unclear. Although LMNA is mainly distributed around the nuclear periphery, it is less tightly linked to the inner nuclear membrane (INM). They are also found in a more mobile and dynamic throughout the nucleoplasm pool. LMNA can bind euchromatin directly or by the complex with lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP2α, a protein from the Lamina-associated polypeptide 2 family), which plays an important biological function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. LAP2α is a non-membrane protein associated with the nucleoskeleton and is uniformly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It may help to dynamically associate with chromosomes by interacting with LMNA via their unique C-terminal tails [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The binding disorders of nucleoplasmic LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes cause late onset striated muscle diseases or erythroid and epidermal progenitor hyperproliferation, and the disorders also impair heart function and stress response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the regulation and specific functions of this dynamic, nucleoplasmic pool of lamin A/C are still poorly understood.

<p>To date, LCV and a large number of effectors transferred by the intracellular multiplication/defective organelle transport (Icm/Dot) type IV system of 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. have been identified [
 <xref rid="b9-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="b12-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although the roles of these genes from 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. have been evaluated, little research has been done on genes of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. during endosymbiosis with 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. To understand the intracellular survival strategy of 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp., inhibition of phagosome lysis in 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. needs to be studied. In this study, total transcriptional changes of 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> in response to survival and replication of 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> during 12 hr and 24 hr were investigated by RNA sequencing analysis.

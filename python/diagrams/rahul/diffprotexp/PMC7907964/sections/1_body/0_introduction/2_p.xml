<p>Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that serves a critical role in targeting proteins for degradation. It is also involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria via autophagy and proteasomal mechanisms. Parkin is encoded by the 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> (
 <italic>PRKN</italic>) gene, which is located on chromosome 6q25.2-q27, and spans &gt;500 kb. It contains 12 exons, which translate to a protein of 465 amino acids (

 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants appear to be responsible for PD pathogenesis, which was first reported in Japanese families in 1998(

Although the mechanism by which loss of parkin function results in dopaminergic cell death in PD is unclear, it is considered to involve the disruption of mitochondrial quality control (

0: The antioxidant activity against ABTS + radical was carried out according to Smeriglio et al.
1: [ 37].
2: Briefly, the reaction mixture (4.3 mM potassium persulfate and 1.7 mM ABTS solution 1:5,  v/ v) was incubated for 1216 h in the dark at room temperature, and was diluted, before use, with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in order to obtain an absorbance at 734 nm of 0.7  0.02.
3: Fifty microliters (50 L) of sample solution (range 30050 g/mL) was added to 1 mL of reaction mixture and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 6 min; the absorbance was then recorded at 734 nm using an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601).
4: The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).

<p>The thermal stability of GO so low that even can explode upon being heated due to the remaining potassium salt in the preparation. The GO containing potassium salt will rapidly disproportionate and generate a large amount of water vapor and CO
 <sub>2</sub> gas with heat release with the catalysis of potassium salt. However, the purified GO cannot be ignited, which might be used as a flame-retardant material [

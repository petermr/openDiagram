<p>ETS proteins focused on in this study (namely, class I subfamilies ETC, TCF, and PEA3 and class II subfamilies ELF and TEL) exhibit little tissue specificity, and, in fact, many family members are ubiquitously expressed [

 <xref rid="B15-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that gene regulatory network analysis of ETS transcription factors exhibits extensive overlap of targets, confirming that functional redundancy exists at least to a certain extent (

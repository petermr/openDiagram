 <caption> Gene regulatory network of glioma grades under the regulation of ETS transcription factors. Diamond nodes represent ETS members as a regulator, and circle nodes correspond to the target genes. The color of the circle indicates the mean fold change of glioma grades compared to non-tumor samples, resulting from differential gene expression analysis. Edge colors show the enrichment score of each target gene with corresponding regulators resulted from GSEA analysis. </caption>

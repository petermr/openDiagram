<p id="Par5">Based on the recurrent trend of increased rates of infection and severity in oncology patients reported across multiple studies as well as our own experience, this paper leverages large-scale genome-wide transcriptional data of normal and malignant tissues from human adults and children to illustrate increased expression of viral entry genes in the cancer state, particularly in respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract tissues, as well as decreased expression in pediatric 
 <italic>vs.</italic> adult samples. Additionally, by interrogating the effects of cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy on human tissues, biological pathways of innate immunity are identified to be commonly dysregulated by both cancer treatments and COVID-19.

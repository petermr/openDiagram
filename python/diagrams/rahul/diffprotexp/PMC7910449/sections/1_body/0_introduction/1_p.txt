0: Circular RNA is a novel type of noncoding RNA discovered in recent years 1.
1: Circular RNA has various biological effects, including the regulation of cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis 2.
2: Autophagy is related to physiological states as well as a variety of pathological states, such as tumors, inflammation, and so forth 3.
3: Some studies confirmed the function of circular RNA in autophagy.
4: CircHIPK2 participates in astrocyte activation by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy via sponging miR-124-2HG 4.
5: CircDnmt1 promoted the proliferation and survival of breast carcinoma cells through the activation of autophagy.
6: CircDnmt1 directly interacted with p53 along with AUF1 to promote their nuclear translocation 5.
7: CircHECTD1 promoted TIPARP transcription and expression, thus activating autophagy and astrocytes 6.

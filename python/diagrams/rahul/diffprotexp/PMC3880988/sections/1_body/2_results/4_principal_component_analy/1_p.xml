<p>Principal components analysis was used to determine the homogeneity in the protein profiles of MSC, cMSC and AC. Proteomic maps were utilized as “score graphs” for variables and spots from the different groups. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows that MSC spots (magenta) were close to each other and were situated on one side of the graph, while AC spots (violet) were clustered on the opposite side. Spots corresponding to the cMSC were situated and clustered between these positions. These results indicate that our data were homogenous with no outlier data affecting the statistical analysis.

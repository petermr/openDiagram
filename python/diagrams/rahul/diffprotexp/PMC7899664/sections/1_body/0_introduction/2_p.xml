<p>The functional and homeostatic characteristics of HA are not only determined by quantity or organization into an extracellular matrix, but also by its molecular weight. High molecular weight HA (HMW-HA) predominates in the steady-state condition in skin, and is considered anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic (Bollyky et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In contrast, the size profile skews toward low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA) in inflammatory conditions, acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). HA is produced by three hyaluronan synthases HAS1,2, and 3. HAS1 and HAS2 produce very high molecular weight HA (900 KDa and above), while HAS3 produces lower molecular weight HA (500KDa) (Bollyky et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Balaji et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Though encoded on different chromosomes and with tightly-regulated spatiotemporal expression patterns, HAS1-3 are well-conserved enzymes with a high degree of functional redundancy due to their crucial role during embryonic development. The degradation of HA is regulated by hyaluronidases (HYAL), with HYAL1 and HYAL2 considered key enzymes for HA degradation. KIAA1199 has been shown to have a role in binding and depolymerization of HA in skin fibroblasts and its expression by dermal fibroblasts has a key role in HA degradation in normal skin (Yoshida and Okada 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In the skin, HAS1 predominates in epidermal keratinocytes, while HAS2 is the primary isoform in dermal fibroblasts, and the presence and relative quantity of all three of these enzymes appear to play critical roles in keloid formation and skin cancer (Edward et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Notably, knockout of HAS2 is embryonic lethal, underscoring the importance of this family of enzymes. In addition, the pathologic hypermobility of epidermal keratinocytes that contributes to the “over-healing” of wounds in keloid formation has been attributed to HAS2 overexpression, and similarly, the role of HAS2 in promoting keratinocyte migration appears to be involved in melanoma metastasis (Edward et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sidgwick et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Supp et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Unfortunately, HAS deletion has not been effectively modeled to this point: shRNA knockdown of the HAS family of enzymes has been poorly reproducible, and pure HAS knockout murine models have not been successful or standardized. A dual HAS1/HAS3 knockout (Kessler et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) combined with an inducible HAS2 knockout has previously been developed but has not been efficiently repeated. Given this lack of an animal model, other non-genetic means of HAS knockdown and HA inhibition must be sought.

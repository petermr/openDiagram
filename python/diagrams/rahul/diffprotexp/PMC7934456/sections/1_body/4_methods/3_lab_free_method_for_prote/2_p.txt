0: The trypsin peptide was dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (solvent a) and directly loaded on a self-made reversed-phase analytical column (length: 15 cm, 75  m).
1: The gradient consisted of increasing from 6% B to 23% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile) in 26 min, from 23 to 35% in 8 min, climbing to 80% in 3 min, and then remaining at 80% on easy-nlc 1000 UPLC system.
2: The flow rate was 400 nl / min in the last 3 min.
3: The peptides were processed from NSI sources, and then tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed in Q ExactiveTM Plus (Thermo) connected online to UPLC.
4: The applied electrospray voltage was 2.0 kV.
5: The m/z scan range of the complete scan is 350 to 1800, and the complete peptide is detected in Orbitrap with a resolution of 70,000.
6: Then use NCE to set 28 to select peptides for MS/MS, and detect these fragments in Orbitrap with a resolution of 17,500.
7: The data-dependent process performs 20 MS/MS scans after one MS scan, and the dynamic elimination time is 15.0 s. Automatic gain control (AGC) is set to 5E4.
8: The fixed first mass setting is 100 m/z [ 60].

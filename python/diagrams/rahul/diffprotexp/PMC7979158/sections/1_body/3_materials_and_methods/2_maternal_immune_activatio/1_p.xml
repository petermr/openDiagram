<p>Assessment of females baseline immunoreactivity before pregnancy and maternal immune activation were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Estes et al., 2020</xref>). Since female mice display a wide range of baseline immunoreactivity to poly(I:C) that dictates susceptibility and resilience of offspring from later pregnancies to MIA, virgin females in the lowest 25th percentile of immune responsiveness to poly(I:C) (IL-6 serum levels) were excluded from the study to reduce variability and ensure sufficient immune responsiveness of all included dams. E12.5 pregnancies were determined by visualizing vaginal seminal plug (noted as E0.5) and by body weight increase. IL-6 serum levels were measured at 2.5 hr post-injection. Temperature, weight, and sickness behavior were tracked as previously described (

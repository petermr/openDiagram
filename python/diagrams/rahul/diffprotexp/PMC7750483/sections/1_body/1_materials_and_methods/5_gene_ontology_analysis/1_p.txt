0: The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the m 5C RNA methylation modification was analyzed  via the DAVID function annotation tool ( Dennis et al., 2003).
1: GO contains biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions.
2: In this analysis, count represents the number of genes contained in the GO term.
3: Therefore, the count and  P values are considered together to obtain important metabolic process.

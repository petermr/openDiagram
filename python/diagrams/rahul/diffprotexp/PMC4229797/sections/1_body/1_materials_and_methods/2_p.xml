<p>After complete semen liquefaction, semen analyses (volume, progressive motility, and viability) were performed according to the WHO guidelines for the examination of human semen.[

 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The motility was determined using direct observation of an aliquot of the sample at Ã—40, and graded as follows: I = progressive motility; II = nonprogressive motility and III = immotile. Sperm concentration was determined by using a Makler chamber (Sefi-Medical Instruments, Haifa, Israel)[
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and morphology was evaluated according to the Tygerberg strict criteria.[
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In addition, the teratozoospermia index was calculated as the number of abnormalities present 
 <italic>per</italic> abnormal spermatozoon. The respective numbers of abnormalities in head, neck/midpiece and tail defects or presence of cytoplasmic droplets are then added together and the resultant sum is divided by the number of abnormal spermatozoa.[

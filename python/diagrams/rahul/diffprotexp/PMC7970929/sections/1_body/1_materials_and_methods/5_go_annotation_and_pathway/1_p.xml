<p id="Par11">Uniprot and KEGG pathway databases were used for functional annotation of the transcripts for homology approach through BLAST against “
 <italic>viridiplantae</italic>” data. Transcripts were assigned with a homolog protein from other organisms, if the match was found at e-value less than e-5 and minimum similarity greater than 30%. KAAS server was explored for assigning pathway analysis. Since no reference genome is available for the halophyte, 
 <italic>Urochondra setulosa,</italic> hence for pathway identification 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic>, 
 <italic>Oryza sativa japonica</italic>, 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic> and 
 <italic>Dendrobium officinale</italic> were considered as reference organisms being monocots from same family 
 <italic>Poaceae</italic>.

 <caption> The perfusates presented a different protein composition compared to liver cytosol extracts. Eight micrograms of protein from the perfusate and cytosol mixtures a from both the model and control rats was loaded onto the gel, and the gel was subsequently silver-stained. Substantial differences were detected in the perfusate and cytosol. Many high-abundance cytosolic proteins (black arrows) were not observed in the perfusates, whereas some proteins were enriched in perfusates (white arrows). M-L: Liver cytosol mixture from the model rats. C-L: Liver cytosol mixture from the control rats. M-P: Perfusate mixture from the model rats. C-P: Perfusate mixture from the control rats. a. The cytosol mixture was prepared according to our previous work [ 3]. Briefly, the perfused rat livers were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then ground into a powder with a pestle. The liver tissue powder was suspended in 40 mM Tris buffer on ice, followed by centrifugation at 12000 g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were collected as liver cytosol extracts. The cytosol mixture was prepared by pooling liver cytosolic extracts from five model or control rats. </caption>

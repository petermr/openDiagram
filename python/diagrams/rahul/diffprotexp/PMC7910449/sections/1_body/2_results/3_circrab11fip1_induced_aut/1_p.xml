<p id="Par22">CircRAB11FIP1 promoted autophagic flux. Therefore, the study explored whether circRAB11FIP1-induced autophagy participated in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion. SKOV3 cells transfected with LV2-1 had decreased proliferation and invasion capacities. However, this effect was partly reversed after the ectopic expression of ATG5 and ATG7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A–C</xref>). On the contrary, circRAB11FIP1 ectopic expression enhanced A2780 cell proliferation and invasion abilities. However, these effects were partly retarded after ATG5 or Beclin1 silencing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D–F</xref>).

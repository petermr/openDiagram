<p>As a result, the preheating of the free wire length leads to reduced welding power for melting the electrode. Thereby, the same deposition rate can be achieved [

 <xref rid="B27-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A characteristic feature of the resulting material transfer is the formation of larger droplets. This can be described by the softening of the wire throughout the resistance heating as well as a reduction of the electromagnetic pinch-force, due to the reduced welding current. The decreased welding current leads to decreased penetration depth and increased weld seam height in joint welding and cladding [

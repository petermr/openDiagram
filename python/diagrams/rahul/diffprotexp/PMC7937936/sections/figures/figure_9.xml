  <p>Relationship between the expression levels of hub genes in tumor tissues and clinical characteristics of patients. 
   <bold>(A–C)</bold> The expression of 
   <italic>CCR4</italic>
   <bold>(A)</bold>, 
   <italic>CCR8</italic>
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and 
   <italic>P2RY14</italic>
   <bold>(C)</bold> were all significantly correlated with the T staging. The expression levels of these genes all decreased gradually with the progression of the T stage. 
   <bold>(D–F)</bold> Similar results were seen with the pathological staging in all three hub genes, but not as significant as for T staging. 
   <bold>(G–I)</bold> All of these genes were less expressed in males than in females, with no significant difference was shown in CCR4 (
   <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05), and significant differences were demonstrated in both 
   <italic>CCR8</italic> and 
   <italic>P2RY14</italic> (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05).

<p>SEM analysis was performed to observe the 1/4 MIC of tylosin treated cells and nontreated cells biofilm formation by 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> under same growth conditions. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, the surface of the glass slide is almost entirely covered by the aggregates and microcolonies of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> when growth was carried out in the culture medium without tylosin. However, when the culture medium was added to 1/4 MIC of tylosin, the biofilms were characterized by the presence of small clusters of cells interspersed amongst individual cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This result showed that the biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> was inhibited by the tylosin of 1/4 MIC 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic>

0: EAEC 55989  agg3  cells containing either pBAD24 or the plasmids encoding the different AAF subtypes were plated on LB agar containing the suitable antibiotics and incubated overnight at 37C.
1: Afterward, a single colony was inoculated in 2 ml LB medium containing the suitable antibiotics and grown overnight at 37C and 180 rpm.
2: The next day, 100 l of these pre-cultures were used to inoculate 20 ml fresh LB medium and the cultures were grown at 37C and 180 rpm.
3: The OD 600 was determined using the Ultraspec 2100pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) in regular intervals until an OD 600 of 0.40.6 had been reached.
4: 600 l of a 10% arabinose solution were added and incubation continued for another 60 min.
5: Sterile glass tubes were filled with 5 ml bacterial culture and kept static at room temperature.
6: For the measurements, 100 l samples were taken approximately 1 cm below the liquid surface in duplicates and the OD 600 was determined.
7: Samples were taken every 10 min in the first 60 min after the beginning of the experiment and afterward every 60 min for a total assay time of 3 h.

<italic>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</italic>), where their binding energies were &#8722;40.97, &#8722;44.99, &#8722;38.67, &#8722;48.79, &#8722;46.46, &#8722;45.56, and &#8722;44.47 EEU, respectively. Following the binding energy criterion, aardvark&#8217;s ACE2 was predicted to be an effective receptor, but it may be ineffective due to glycosylation. The shrew had two interface glycosylation sites, N23 and N41, which form hydrogen bonds with N487 and Y449, respectively (

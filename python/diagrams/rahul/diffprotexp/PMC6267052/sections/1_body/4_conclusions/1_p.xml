<p id="Par34">Despite similarities in protein expression between articular cartilage and meniscus, 21 proteins differed between the two tissues in the DIA analysis. Eleven out of these also differed in the DDA analysis. In articular cartilage, aggrecan core protein was the most abundant protein and phospholipase A membrane-associated and lysozyme C had the largest articular cartilage to meniscus ratio in the DIA and DDA analysis respectively. In meniscus, serum albumin was the most abundant protein and dermatopontin had the largest meniscus to articular cartilage ratio. More research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind these differences in protein expression. Comparing the two methods DIA has several clear advantages over DDA, e.g. no missing values and lower variance, therefore DIA will be our method of choice in future studies in OA research.</p>

<p>In patients with Cushing’s disease, these mutations appear related to lower tumor size and clinical remission after surgery [

 <xref rid="B12-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which could allow to consider 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations a possible favorable prognosis marker. However, they are also related to a higher risk of recurrence [
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In concordance with these previous observations, we found a significantly higher rate of clinical remission in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut patients suffering from Cushing’s disease and a trend of lower tumor volume in mutated patients; however, no statistically significant difference was determined. We did not find differences in preoperative 24-h urinary free cortisol, which was observed to be significantly higher in patients with mutations in some previous studies [

 <xref rid="B14-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, we did not find the difference in the proportion of tumors with invasive growth reported in other published results [
 <xref rid="B5-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

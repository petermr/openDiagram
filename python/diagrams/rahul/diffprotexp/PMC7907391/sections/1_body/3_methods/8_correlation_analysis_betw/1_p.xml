<p id="Par39">For a large cohort of COVID-19 (n = 100) and non-COVID-19 patients (n = 26), patients were stratified into groups based on severity: ‘COVID-19-ICU’ (n = 50), ‘COVID-19-Non-ICU’ (n = 50) and ‘Non-COVID-19′ (n = 26). Spearman’s rank correlations were performed to determine the strength of the relationships between viral entry gene 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> and viral response genes 
 <italic>MX1</italic>, 
 <italic>SAMHD1</italic>, 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> and 
 <italic>TRIM25</italic>. A multiple linear regression model was also fitted using the lm function in R to determine whether the relationship between viral defense genes and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> expression was statistically significant.

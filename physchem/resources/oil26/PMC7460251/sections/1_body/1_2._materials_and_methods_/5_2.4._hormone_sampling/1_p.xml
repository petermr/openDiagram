<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Fecal samples were collected once a day in the evening (Baji: 26 samples; Roxaane: 37 samples; Rachaael: 27 samples; Kaatie: 35 samples). Animal care staff collected fecal samples within three hours of defecation. As they were housed in pairs, aardvarks received different colored food paste in avocado to make their feces distinguishable [<xref rid="B25-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Fecals were collected after care staff cleaned the habitat to eliminate the risk of collecting older samples. Samples were immediately stored at &#8722;20 &#176;C. </p>

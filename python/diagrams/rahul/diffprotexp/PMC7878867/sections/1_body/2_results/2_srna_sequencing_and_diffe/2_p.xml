<p id="Par19">Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified based on the normalised reads count. For a summary of the number of DEMs subject to different factors, see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">S5</xref>. To study the effects of progeny stress treatment, paired-comparisons were made between AtCC and AtCW, AtWC and AtWW (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). For progeny from the control parents, 86 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) between the control and water-deficit stress group in the flag leaf (AtCW_L vs AtCC_L). In the developing grains, 571 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) between the control and water-deficit stress group (AtCW_G vs AtCC_G). For progeny from the stressed parents, 234 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) between the control and water-deficit stress group in the flag leaf (AtWW_L vs AtWC_L). In the developing grains, 456 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) (AtWW_G vs AtWC_G). It appears that leaf miRNAs were more responsive to water-deficit stress in the progeny from the stressed parents (higher number of DEMs compared with progeny from the control parents), while grain miRNAs were less responsive in the progeny from the stressed parents (lower number of DEMs compared with progeny from the control parents) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).

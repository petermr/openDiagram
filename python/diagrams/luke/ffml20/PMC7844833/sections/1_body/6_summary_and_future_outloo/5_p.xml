<p>One of the important consequences of the former complexity is that the findings of the XAS data analysis should be, whenever possible, complemented with the insight from other techniques, that is, other 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> spectroscopic or microscopic methods as well as theoretical modeling. Only by combining the information obtained from the different perspectives provided by these methods can unambiguous answers be gained about the intricate processes that take place in (electro-)catalysts at work. An ongoing trend, which will continue without a doubt in the years to come, is the tighter integration of XAS with complementary techniques. For example, in depth information on functional materials can be gained through the simultaneous acquisition of XAS data and either XES, XRD, SAXS, or NRIXS

 </sup> data in the hard X-ray range, or the collection of soft X-ray XAS in combination with near ambient pressure XPS data.

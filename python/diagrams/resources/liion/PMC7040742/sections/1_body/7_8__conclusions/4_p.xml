<p>Apart from direct recycling and hydrometallurgical leaching, a new approach being developed is selective leaching, in which lithium is selectively extracted from the hosting material while retaining the internal structure of the cathode material. Combined with most recent developments in mechanical separation, this approach may have a considerable success for the treatment of mixed cathodes or LFP batteries. </p>

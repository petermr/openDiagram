<p id="p0045">Because obesity impairs metabolic homeostasis in various organs, such as the liver and skeletal muscle, and inter-organ metabolic cycles between them through the blood, it is necessary to generate a trans-omic network that includes multi-omic data from the relevant organs and data from blood samples. The leptin-deficient obese (

 <italic>ob</italic>) mice are a widely used model of obesity and insulin resistance, because these mice become profoundly obese by overeating because of deficiency of the anorexigenic hormone leptin (

 <italic>ob</italic> mice. Using these trans-omic networks, we provided potential mechanisms of the dysfunctions of the glucose-alanine, glucose-lactate, and ketone body cycles between the liver and skeletal muscle, which characterize the dysfunctional systemic metabolism in

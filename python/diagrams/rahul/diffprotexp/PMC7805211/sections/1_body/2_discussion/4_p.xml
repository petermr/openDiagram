<p id="Par15">Our data confirms that CNFs and PNFs strongly exhibit differential methylation at two established DMRs (i.e., DMR1 and DMR2) that are situated immediately upstream of the 
 <italic>MAP2K3</italic> transcriptional start site. This pattern of differential methylation resulted in upregulated protein expression of MKK3 and p38 in CNFs, whereas in PNFs the reciprocal effect was observed with downregulated expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This effect was consistent within and across tumor types despite expected signaling heterogeneity from analyzing whole tumor tissue from multiple subjects. The cell types that contributed to the observed differences in methylation profiles could not be determined. Unfortunately, deconvolution analysis is dependent on cell type-specific profiles which are lacking for NF1-deficient neurofibromas.

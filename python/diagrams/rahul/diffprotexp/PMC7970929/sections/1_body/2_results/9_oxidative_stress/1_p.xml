<p id="Par23">DEGs in response to oxidative stress include peroxidases, catalases, Putative L-ascorbate peroxidase, Mitogen-activated protein kinase, Trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase, Lactoylglutathione lyase, Methionine sulfoxide reductase, and alkaline alpha galactosidase. Oxidative stress is often associated with many stresses including salt stress. In present experiment, it was found that L-ascorbate peroxidase (

 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN48599_c0_g1_i1) are up-regulated with increasing salt levels (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) along with Catalase (

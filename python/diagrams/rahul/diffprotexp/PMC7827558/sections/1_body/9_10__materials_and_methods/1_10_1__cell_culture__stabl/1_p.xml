<p>Parental A549 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. Parental SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 15% FBS plus 1% antibiotics. SH-SY5Y and A549-inducible cell lines to express GFP-tagged full-length human p53 (GFP-p53FL) or p53β were generated by infection of lentiviruses and selected with 2 μg/mL of puromycin. After selection, stable lines were maintained in appropriate media supplemented with 1 μg/mL of puromycin. MCF-7 cells were transfected with pCMV-BirA-p53FL or pCMV-BirA-p53β for BioID experiments by Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermofisher Waltham, MA, USA). MCF-7 (date of purchase, 18 April 2006), SY5Y (date of purchase, 12 February 1999), and A549 (date of purchase, 7 February 2006) were purchased from the ATCC between the years 1999 and 2009 and authenticated on 29 August 2016, using certified human cell line authentication (CLA) analysis provided by the Duke University DNA analysis facility.</p>

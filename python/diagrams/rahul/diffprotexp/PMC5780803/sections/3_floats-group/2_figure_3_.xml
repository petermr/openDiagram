  <p>Flow cytometry detects cell apoptosis. Cell apoptosis was examined by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometry results from repeated experiments are presented as dot plots. The total apoptosis rate is summarized in a bar chart on the right in which the x-axis represents the induction time of apoptosis and the y-axis represents the apoptosis rate. Data are presented as the mean Â± standard deviation of two independent experiments. *P&lt;0.05. XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.</p>

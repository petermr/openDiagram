<p id="Par13">To further interrogate the accessible chromatin landscape during somite development, we used HINT-ATAC
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup> to discover differential TF footprints in regions of open chromatin identified in PSM, ES, MS or DS. Initially we focussed on the CDX2 TF, which is a readout for posterior WNT signalling and has been implicated in defining neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. CDX2 is essential for axial elongation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup> and is highly expressed in the PSM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Consistent with high levels of WNT signalling activity in the PSM, HINT-ATAC identified a greater number of CDX2 footprints in open chromatin in this region when compared to ES, MS and DS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b–d</xref>). Similarly, LEF1, a transcriptional effector for canonical WNT signalling, is highly expressed in the PSM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). LEF1 is also expressed in somites, where it becomes restricted to the myotome
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. We identified a greater number of LEF1 footprints in the PSM when compared to any of the somite samples, consistent with the more restricted expression of

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f–h</xref>).

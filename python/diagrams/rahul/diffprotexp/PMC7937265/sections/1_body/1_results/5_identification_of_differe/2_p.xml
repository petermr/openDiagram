<p id="Par38">We next identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between prenatal treatments. Males had 1123 mCG DMRs in the HYPO, of which 468 (41.7%) were found within 2 Kb of a gene (
 <italic>n</italic> = 266 genes with hypomethylation, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 125 genes with hypermethylation, and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11 genes with regions of both hypo- and hypermethylation), and 358 mCH DMRs, of which 138 (38.5%) were within 2 Kb of a gene (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13 genes with hypomethylation, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 118 genes with hypermethylation). The TnA had 57 mCG DMRs, of which 27 (47.4%) were found within 2 Kb of a gene (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17 genes with hypomethylation, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 genes with hypermethylation, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 gene with regions of both hypo- and hypermethylation), and 15 mCH DMRs, of which 5 (33.3%) were found within 2 Kb of a gene (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 genes with hypomethylation, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 genes with hypermethylation). The majority of DMRs found within 2 Kb of a gene were located in the gene body, specifically introns, for both mCG and mCH (Supplementary Fig. S1, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), similar to past methylation work in zebra finches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For the full list of genes with DMRs see Supplementary Tables S4, S5, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. A GO analysis of genes with mCG or mCH DMRs in each brain region indicated that genes with mCG DMRs in the HYPO were significantly enriched for processes like the regulation of molecular function (FDR = 0.01) and cell morphogenesis (FDR = 0.03; Supplementary Table S6, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). No other enriched GO terms were found.

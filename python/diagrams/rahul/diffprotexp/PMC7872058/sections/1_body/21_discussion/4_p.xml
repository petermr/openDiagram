<p>Functional analysis of SNPs in TREM1 has shown that levels of sTREM1 can be regulated by individual variability at genomic level with a potential impact on the progression and severity of the disease and patient outcome [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, a clinically relevant association of the rs2234237 T-allele with higher levels of sTREM1 has been reported in mechanically ventilated burn patients and in sepsis [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. TREM family receptors have been also suggested to regulate the cellular adhesion process and trans-endothelial migration [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this context, the T allele at rs2234246 was associated with increased levels of sTREM1, affecting its expression levels, and with increased levels of soluble L-selectin which are thought to represent a homeostatic effort to limit excessive inflammation [

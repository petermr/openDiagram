0: HEK293 cells were pretreated with or without ETHE1 (100 ng/ml) for 0.5 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 M) for 24 h. Then the cells were used for measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential and observation with transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
1: The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by a mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit (Beyotime) with a JC-1 probe as our previous study 39.
2: Mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored by a TCS-SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica).
3: In this study, increased ratios of green and red fluorescence represented mitochondrial depolarization.

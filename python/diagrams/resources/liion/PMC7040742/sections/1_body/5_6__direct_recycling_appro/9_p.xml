<p>Regenerated LFP with good electrochemical capacity (150 mAh/g) was obtained by Ganter et al. after chemical relithiation in solvent solution of lithium iodide (LiI) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00801-f019">Figure 19</xref>, the spent LFP batteries were prepared by discharging them to 0.5 V, followed by dismantling and isolating the cathode. The black mass was then manually scraped off the cathodic current collector and ground. The following relithiation step involved suspending spent LFP in acetonitrile and 1 M LiI for approximately 20 h. A similar process with slight variation on preparation steps and iodide solvent was patented by Sloop in 2016 [

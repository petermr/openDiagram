<p>Herein, we report nonstoichiometric Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanowires, which can be regarded as a composite of CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, as an anode material in lithium-ion battery. As we know, such composites, as an anode material in lithium-ion area has not been reported yet. Owing to the relatively low activation energy for electron transfer between Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>/Cu, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>/Ni
 <sup>3+</sup> and Co
 <sup>2+</sup>/Co
 <sup>3+</sup>, the electronic conductivity and cycling stability for Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanowires are significantly improved. In the first cycle, discharge and charge capacities are 1120 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 972 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. After 50 cycles, the specific capacity of Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanowires remain 880 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and the coulombic efficiency is approximately 100%.

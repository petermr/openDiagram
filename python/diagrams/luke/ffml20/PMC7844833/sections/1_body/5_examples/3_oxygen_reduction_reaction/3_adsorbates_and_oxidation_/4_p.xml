<p>The changes in the XANES features due to interactions with adsorbates and oxide formation are more easily distinguished in HERFD-XAS data, as demonstrated by Merte et al. in the study of size-selected Pt NPs with sizes ∼1.2 nm.

 </sup> In this study, three distinct potential regimes were observed: (i) hydrogen chemisorption occurring between 0 V and ∼0.3 V versus RHE, as evidenced by a broad asymmetric white line with low amplitude; (ii) chemisorption of oxygen species (OH or O) as the potential was increased between 0.3 and 0.96 V, with the WL becoming narrower and its amplitude increasing; (iii) platinum oxide formation being observed at or above 0.9 V, as evidenced by an increase in the WL width (see

 </sup> While the spectrum for the catalyst in as-prepared dry state resembled that of PtO
 <sub>2</sub>, the intensity of the WL for the catalyst in its final state at 1.26 V versus RHE was lower, suggesting a lower average oxidation state of Pt in the obtained PtO

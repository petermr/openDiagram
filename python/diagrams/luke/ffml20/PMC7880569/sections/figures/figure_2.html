 <caption> Gravimetrically derived water loadings on (a) AcidBir (59.2 m 2/g) and (b) δ-MnO 2 (204 m 2/g), collected as adsorption (closed symbols) and desorption (open symbols) isotherms at 25 °C. Loadings are shown in terms of bound water molecules per unit cell (H 2O/UC) and birnessite mass-normalized (left ordinate axis) mass of H 2O (mg/g). Lines (see labels) are predictions of water binding during the adsorption (full) and desorption (dashed) leg of the data collection and generated using the composition adsorption–condensation–intercalation model of this study. The orange line in (a) and the blue line in (b) show the sum of internally and externally bound water to the basal faces of birnessite. </caption>

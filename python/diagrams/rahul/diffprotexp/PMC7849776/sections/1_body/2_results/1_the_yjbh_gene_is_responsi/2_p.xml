<p>We next evaluated the pathogenicity of the mutants by determining the microbial burden in the organs of infected mice. We found that colonization of 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tn was reduced in kidney and heart [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while that of 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn was reduced only in the heart of infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a,b</xref>)). To further confirm the killing ability of these strains, we examined the survival of mice in a systemic infection model. We found that the injection of wild-type, 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tnp
 <italic>yjbH</italic> and 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tnp
 <italic>yjbH</italic> strains killed all the mice within 16Â hours, and the killing ability of 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tn, 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn, and 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tnp
 <italic>yjbI</italic> strains was significantly decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(c</xref>)). Thus, similar to the silkworm survival assay, mouse survival assay revealed that the YjbH was required for the killing ability of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.

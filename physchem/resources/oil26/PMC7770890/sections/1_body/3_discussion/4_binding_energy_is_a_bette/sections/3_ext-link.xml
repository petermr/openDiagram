To circumvent the randomness of binding energy from a single model, we evaluated a large ensemble of structure models (e.g., 500 models in this work) for each complex and took the lowest binding score as the binding energy for ACE2 usage analysis. With a proper threshold (i.e., &#8722;47 EEU), the binding energy calculated in this manner correlated well with experimental data, perfectly distinguishing the experimentally determined effective ACE2 receptors from the less effective ones with a maximum MCC of 1.0 (

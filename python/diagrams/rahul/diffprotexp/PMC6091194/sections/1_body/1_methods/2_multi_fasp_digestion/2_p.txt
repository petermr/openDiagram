0: Following the first digestion, spin filters were washed with 40 L of urea followed with 2X washes of 40 L of ddH 2O, then, 3X washes with 100 L of 50 mM ABC solution, followed by adding 0.1 g/L of trypsin in 1:100 and incubating at 37 C O/N.
1: Peptides were eluted, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and desalted on a C 18 MacroSpin column (The Nest Group, Southboro, MA).
2: The concentration of the peptides was determined using a microplate colorimetric assay (BioRad).

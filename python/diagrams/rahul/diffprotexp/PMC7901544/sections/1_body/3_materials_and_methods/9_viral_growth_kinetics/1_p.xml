<p>LMH cells transfected with KPNA3 or KPNA4, and KPNA3-KO or KPNA4-KO LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4 or FA4_Del at 0.01 MOI, respectively. And then the viruses were harvested at indicated time points post-infection and stored at −80°C before use. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of the harvested viruses was determined in 96-well plates by serially dilution from 10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−8</sup>, and calculated by Reed-Muench method.

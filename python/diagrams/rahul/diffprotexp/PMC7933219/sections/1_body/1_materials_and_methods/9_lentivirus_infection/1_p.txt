0: The pFU-GW (hU6MCSubiquitinEGFPIRESpuromycin) vector was used for the knockdown of miR-124-3p.
1: The mature microRNA in cells can be competitively bound by antisense microRNA sequences, thus affecting the binding between the mature microRNA and target gene mRNA and reducing the inhibition of the microRNA on the translation of target gene mRNA.
2: The infection of antisense miR-124-3p sequences (GGCATTCACCGCGTGCCTTA) was done according to Shanghai GeneChem Corporations operation manual.
3: Target cells at the logarithmic growth stage were digested by trypsin to make a cell suspension.
4: The cell suspension (cell number was about 5  10 4) was inoculated in a 6-well plate and cultured in an incubator with 5% CO 2 at 37C until the cell fusion rate reached about 30%.
5: An appropriate amount of virus was added according to the MOI value of cells.
6: After 12 h, cells were observed and it was confirmed that the virus had no obvious cytotoxic effect.
7: The culture medium was changed after 24 h. If there were significant cytotoxic effects, the medium was replaced immediately.
8: The expression of the reporter gene EGFP on lentivirus was observed 3 days after infection.
9: The cells with a fluorescence rate of more than 80% were divided into two parts.
10: One part was placed in a 12-well culture plate to be overgrown and then collected for RNA extraction; the other part was placed in a 6-well plate to be overgrown and then collected for immunofluorescence detection to determine the infection efficiency.

<p>Depletion of high abundance proteins and fractionation of samples to reduce proteome complexity prior to SELDI-TOF MS analysis can increase the number of detected peaks but can introduce additional variability into the analysis beyond that associated with the SELDI MS method itself [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In order to focus on possible differences in the mitochondrial proteome, to reduce the proteome complexity of brain tissue, and increase the number of detected peaks, particularly for low abundance proteins, we employed sub-cellular fractionation as well as anion exchange fractionation. Our recent work on the proteomics of Multiple Sclerosis has focused on changes occurring in normal appearing grey matter (NAGM) rather than in whole brain or white matter tissue that might include lesions. This type of analysis requires a tissue preparation protocol in which brain tissue is cut into thin slices and the slices flanking the tissue to be homogenized are examined under a microscope to confirm the absence of lesions prior to homogenization.

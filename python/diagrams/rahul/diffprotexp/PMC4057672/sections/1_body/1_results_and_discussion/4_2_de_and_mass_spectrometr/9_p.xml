<p>Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DPYL-2), also known as CRMP-2, belongs to the dihydropyrimidinase-related protein family. This protein is involved in the neuronal differentiation process and plays a key role in T lymphocyte polarization and migration [

Cell populations with morphological and functional characteristics of both endocrine cells and nerve cells are found in most parts of lung from the trachea and bronchus to the alveoli. Ricin poisons animals through the aerosol route, inducing apoptosis and nerve damage. However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms are caused by the indirectly induced nerve damage from the solid organ injuries or by the direct damages from ricin on the nerve system.

 <caption> The comparison of the genes expression profiles of the Gp and Gd granulosa cells along the follicular growth. ( A) The number of genes showed the similar expression tendency between the Gp granulosa cells and the Gd granulosa cells. ( B) The FPKM value comparison of the genes (NGFR, PTGER3, LHCGR, FSHR and EGFR) along the follicular growth. ( C) Quantitative real-time PCR validation of the genes expression (NGFR, PTGER3, LHCGR, FSHR and EGFR) along the follicular growth. The results were normalized based on the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Each data point represents mean of ten individuals (N = 10) * p &lt; 0.05. </caption>

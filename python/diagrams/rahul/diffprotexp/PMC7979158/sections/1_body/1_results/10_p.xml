<p>Examination of the distribution of the lamination markers TBR1 (layer 6), CTIP2 (layer five and a subset of cells in layer 6), SATB2 (layers 2–4, and a subset of cells in layer 5), and CUX1 (layers 2 and 3), revealed MIA-induced cortical layer-specific alterations in lamination, thickness, and cell density at E17.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b,e–f</xref>). Overall, MIA brains appeared to be at a more mature stage of lamination at E17.5, showing a full separation of cortical deep layers more typical of later ages and in contrast to the partial layer overlap found in control offspring at E17.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>). Similarly, SATB2 and TBR1 co-staining suggested differences in lamination and migration state between the two groups. Oval cell body shapes were observed, which resembled radially migrating cells (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 2013</xref>) were observed in both SATB2 and TBR1 cells in control tissue, whereas these cells showed a more rounded/post-migratory cell body shape in the MIA brains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d</xref>). The number of TBR1+ and CTIP2+ cells, but not SATB2+ cells, were also significantly reduced in the neocortex from MIA offspring (TBR1+ cells, p=0.0138; CTIP2+ cells, p=0.0119; SATB2+ cells, p=0.306, two tailed Student t-test) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). The thickness of these layers and also a more external layer represented by CUX1, were measured by comparing the radial spread of stained cells within the neocortex. We found a significant reduction in CTIP2 layer thickness and a similar trend in TBR1 layer thickness in the MIA brains. In contrast, SATB2 showed an MIA-induced significant increase in layer thickness with no change in the more external layer represented by CUX1 (TBR1 thickness, p=0.081; CTIP2 thickness, 0.024; SATB2 thickness, p=0.039; CUX1, p=0.430, two tailed Student’s t-test).

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016</xref>) and measured the thickness of the developing somatosensory cortex at two anteroposterior regions at E17.5. In contrast to previous reports (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016</xref>), we did not find obvious cortical dysplasia or gross alterations in brain anatomy in the analyzed rostral and caudal regions, including somatosensory cortex and S1DZ (

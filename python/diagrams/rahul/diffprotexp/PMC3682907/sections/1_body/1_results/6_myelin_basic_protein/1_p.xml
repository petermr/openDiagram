<p>The identity of the differentially expressed proteins in fraction Q3 as myelin basic protein isoforms was confirmed with Western blots (not shown). MBP is not expected to be associated with mitochondria. Indeed Ravera et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] reported finding no MBP in mitochondria using fresh bovine brain tissue and slightly different preparation conditions. MBP is a basic protein that interacts with membranes and it is possible that the mitochondrially-enriched fraction was contaminated with MBP released from myelin during tissue homogenization. To test this we added fluorescently labeled MBP to brain tissue prior to homogenization and measured the fluorescence intensity of nuclear, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions. Most fluorescence is observed in the cytoplasmic (70%) and nuclear (22%) fractions, with less than 2% of the total fluorescence observed in the mitochondrially enriched fraction. While this is only a small fraction of the total MBP added, we cannot rule out contamination of the mitochondrial fraction by free MBP. Freezing and storage are known to lead to contamination of mitochondria by synaptosomal membrane fragments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] and it is possible that freezing and storage of brain tissue blocks prior to homogenization and subcellular fractionation also leads to contamination of mitochondria by myelin membrane fragments or myelin vesicles. To test this we employed Western blots to determine if contamination was also observed in the mitochondrial fraction obtained with fresh mouse brain tissue. The presence of MBP isoforms in mitochondrial fractions from frozen control and EAE mouse brain tissue was confirmed in a Western blot probed with antibodies to mouse MBP (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). The 21.5 kDa MBP isoform was clearly seen in both frozen control and EAE mouse samples. In addition, other MBP isoforms or MBP fragments are observed in the frozen EAE sample. By contrast, no MBP was detected in mitochondrial fractions derived from fresh mouse tissue (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B left lane). The positive control (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B right lane) was prepared by adding purified bovine 18.6 kDa MBP isoform to the mitochondrial fraction derived from fresh mouse tissue. This gel was probed with both mouse and bovine anti-MBP antibodies.

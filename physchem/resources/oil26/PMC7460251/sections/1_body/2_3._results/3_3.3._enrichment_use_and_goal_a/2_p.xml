Total time foraging from all food items did not differ based on the length of time in the study for the stated enrichment goal (F<sub>1,221</sub> = 1.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.303) or the specific enrichment items (F<sub>1,216</sub> = 1.59, <italic>p</italic> = 0.209). Total time investigating non-food items did not differ based on the length of time in the study based on the stated enrichment goal (F<sub>1,221</sub> = 0.096, <italic>p</italic> = 0.757) or the specific enrichment items (F<sub>1,216</sub> = 0.047, <italic>p</italic> = 0.829). Finally, time locomoting did not differ based on the length of time in the study based on the stated enrichment goal (F<sub>1,221</sub> = 0.75, <italic>p</italic> = 0.386) or the specific enrichment items (F<sub>1,216</sub> = 0.87, <italic>p</italic> = 0.351).</p>

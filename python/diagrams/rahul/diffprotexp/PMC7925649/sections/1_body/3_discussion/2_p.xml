<p id="Par30">A CPB-induced inflammatory response is known to be associated with post-operative morbidity, and in particular post-operative interleukins levels have served as valuable prognostic biomarkers

 </sup>. In our study we found increased expression of STAT5B (&gt; twofold change), which mediates signal transduction triggered by various cell ligands, such as IL2, IL4, CSF1 and different growth hormones

 </sup>. Similarly LYN and PTPN6 which control the interleukin signaling was found to be increased in patients who developed LCOS. In patients who did not develop LCOS, there was down regulation of interleukin cascades (IL7R, IL5RA, IL2RB, PRKACB) and inflammatory cascade which could explain the attenuated SIRS response. Corticosteroids have been used to attenuate the inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass with mixed results in both adults and pediatric patients

 </sup>. In a recently published randomized controlled trial using corticosteroids in neonates undergoing CPB, steroids were shown to improve outcomes in neonates undergoing palliative surgery but not corrective surgery

 </sup>, Differential gene expression after cardiopulmonary bypass can explain individual variation in response to corticosteroids.

0: Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening was performed as described previously in details [ 39].
1: Briefly, the cDNA fragment encoding the distal region of the NKCC2 C terminus (last 195 aa) was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBKT7-BD and transformed into the yeast strain AH109.
2: AH109 expressing the bait was then mated with the Y187 yeast strain pretransformed with a human kidney cDNA library constructed in the pACT2-AD vector.
3: Mated yeast cells were first grown on low stringency selection plates (Leu, Trp, His) and then on high stringency selection plates (Leu, Trp, His, Ade).
4: Colonies were tested for -galactosidase activity, and DNA from positive clones encoding the putative interacting proteins was isolated from yeast cells using the RPM yeast plasmid isolation kit (BIO 101 Systems, Illkirch, France).
5: Prey plasmids were rescued by transformation into DH5  bacteria (Invitrogen) and isolated using a Qiagen kit.
6: cDNA plasmids were then sequenced and assessed using the BLAST program.

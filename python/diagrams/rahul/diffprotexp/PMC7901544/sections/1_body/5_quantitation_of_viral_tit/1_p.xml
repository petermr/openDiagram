<p>The liver, spleen, and kidney collected were homogenized, treated with 10× penicillin and streptomycin for 1 h and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant. The cloacal swabs collected from the chickens were placed in 800 μL of PBS. After three times of freeze-thaw cycles, the samples were treated the same with organs homogenates. The virus-containing supernatants were then serially diluted and inoculated into LMH cells. Four days post-infection, the infected LMH cells were fixed and detected by IFA using 3B5 mAb against Fiber-1, and the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of these supernatants were determined by the Reed-Muench method.

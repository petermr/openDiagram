<p>In 2014, Yamanaka and Tatsumisago prepared the MgS–P
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>5</sub>-MgI
 <sub>2</sub> glasses and glass-ceramics by a mechanochemical method (Yamanaka et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The addition of MgI
 <sub>2</sub> content in 60MgS·40P
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>5</sub> helped the formation of glass-ceramic and the conductivity monotonically increased with the increase of MgI
 <sub>2</sub> content, showing the highest ionic conductivity to be 2.1 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 200°C. The authors proposed that the Mg
 <sub>2</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> crystal phase contributed to the increased conductivities. But no solid evidence was presented to support the claim in the study.

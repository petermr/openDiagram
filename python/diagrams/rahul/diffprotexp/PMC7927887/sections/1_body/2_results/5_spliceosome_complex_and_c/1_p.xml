<p>Differential gene and transcript analysis identified genes and transcripts not necessarily differentially spliced but altered in response to alternative splicing. We identified 234 significantly differentially expressed genes (adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic>≤0.05) and 365 transcripts that were differentially expressed between 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutants and the controls (adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic>≤0.05) (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Tables S7-S10</italic>). Of the differentially expressed transcripts, 79 corresponded with a change at the gene level (22%). The differentially expressed genes at both the gene and transcript level included the protein coding genes 
 <italic>EREG, IL1B</italic>, and 
 <italic>MINA</italic>, which were found to be upregulated in the 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>mutants and have been associated with cell proliferation.

 </sup> Other transcripts that were significantly differentially upregulated included a number of RNA splicing and spliceosome genes including 
 <italic>DHX9, CLASRP, SNRPE, BCAS2</italic>, and 
 <italic>EIF4A3</italic>.

 </sup> These genes have significant changes at the transcript level only and indicate a change in isoform ratio without an effect on the overall gene expression level (

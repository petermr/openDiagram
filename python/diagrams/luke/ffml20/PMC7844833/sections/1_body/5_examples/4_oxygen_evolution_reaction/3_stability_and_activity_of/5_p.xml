<p>In addition to stability, another issue hindering the application of the former noble metal-based catalysts is their high costs. A study of Abbott et al. on IrO

  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> NPs confirmed that with reducing particle size (i.e., increasing active surface area), an increase in the OER activity is observed. Nevertheless, the decrease in the NP size had also a concomitant detrimental effect on catalyst stability. XAS measurements at the Ir L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge revealed that Ir was in a lower oxidation state (closer to 3+) in the smaller IrO
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> NPs (ca. 1.7 nm) as compared to the bulk-like catalyst. This difference (and also the enhanced activity for smaller NPs) was attributed to surface-effects and in particular, to the formation of hydroxo- species at the particle surface. Under reaction conditions, the small IrO

  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> NPs were reversibly oxidized to the 4+ state, as suggested by the shift of the absorption edge to higher energy values and a reduction in the Ir–O interatomic distance (

(b) Evolution of the NP size deduced from CNs obtained from EXAFS data fitting during the in situ coarsening in H 2 atmosphere of Pt NPs supported on Al 2O 3. Reproduced from ref ( 258) with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies. (c) Determination of the NP size for Fe NPs using CNs for the first ( C 1), third ( C 3), and fourth ( C 4) coordination shells.

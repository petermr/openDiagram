<p id="Par35">The STRING database and the Cytoscape software were used to construct the PPI network of the overlapping DEGs in EOC. Finally, three important clusters were screened by MCODE. Among them, cluster 1 included 59 proteins with the highest score (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), cluster 2 and 3 contained 15 and 5 proteins, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b &amp; c). Additionally, we analyzed the function of cluster 1. In KEGG analysis, the cluster 1′ DEGs were mostly enriched in Cell cycle and Oocyte meiosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). In GO analysis, cluster 1′ DEGs were mostly enriched in Protein binding, Nucleoplasm and Nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e).

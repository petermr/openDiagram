<p id="Par20">Since the known genes have been analysed thoroughly by Lindner et al. when they reported the transcriptomes and proteomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], only potentially novel transcripts with “MSTRG” prefix were considered in discovering nORFs that have been overlooked previously. Peptides that identify these MSTRG transcripts were subsequently classified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) into different categories as defined above based on the position of matched peptides relative to the reference genes. Each category was classified independently as described below.

  <p>(a, b) Effect of the synthesis parameters on the structure of MnO

   </sub> catalysts for OER. (a) Mn K-edge EXAFS and XANES (inset) after deposition on the electrode (thick lines) and after 3 min at 1.76 V in 0.1 M K
   <sub>2</sub>HPO
   <sub>4</sub> and 0.1 M KH
   <sub>2</sub>PO
   <sub>4</sub> mixture for samples prepared via the synproportionation method (black lines) and impregnation-based synthesis (red lines). The former results in a structure dominated by edge-sharing octahedra, as in δ-MnO
   <sub>2</sub>, while the latter leads to corner-sharing structure units as in β-MnO
   <sub>2</sub> and γ-MnO
   <sub>2</sub>, as shown in panel b. Reproduced from ref (

   <italic>In situ</italic> Mn K-edge XANES after applying a sequence of potential pulses between 1.1 and −0.4 V (NHE). The inset shows the edge position after a sequence of pulses terminated at an anodic (“A”) or a cathodic (“C”) potential. (d) Changes in Mn–O (red) and Mn–Mn (blue) coordination numbers, as extracted from EXAFS data fitting signifying the transition from a δ-MnO

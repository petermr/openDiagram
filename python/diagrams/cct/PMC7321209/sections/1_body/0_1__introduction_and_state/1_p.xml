<p>The industrial application of additive manufacturing processes for metallic parts is growing continuously. A market growth of 41.9% was found for metallic parts in 2018 [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This includes technologies such as powder bed fusion (PBF) as well as direct energy deposition (DED) processes. Thereby, a differentiation is made between the applied power source (e.g., laser, electron beam and arc) and the deployed material (e.g., powder and wire) [

0: Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was performed on Agilent gas chromatograph, Model 7890A, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).
1: Analytical conditions were HP-5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm coated with 5% phenyl methyl silicone, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane, 0.25 m film thickness) and helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min).
2: Injection was done in split mode (1:60), injected volume was 1 L (10% essential oil/CH 2Cl 2v/ v), and the injector and detector temperatures were 250 C and 280 C, respectively.
3: The oven temperature was held at 50 C for 1 min, then increased to 240 C at 5 C/min and held at 240 C for 5 min.
4: Percentages of compounds were determined from their peak areas in the GC-FID profiles.

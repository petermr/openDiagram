0: Consequently, the strain value corresponding with the peak stress is described as peak strain.
1: The coordinates [   i;   i] define the inflectional point of the curve.
2: The point [   ss;   ss] is an equilibrium point from which strengthening and softening mechanisms are in balance.
3: Therefore, the meaning of lower index ss is steady state.

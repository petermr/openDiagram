<p id="Par11">We acquired proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic data from sequencing serum samples, and transcriptomic data from whole blood cells. Differential expression analyses of the multi-omics profiles were separately performed using multiple testing, with 2101 mRNAs, 3 proteins, 38 metabolites, and 10 lipids identified as significantly altered between severe and critical samples (Additional file

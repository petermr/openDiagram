<p>Figure S5 (Supporting Information) compares the electrochemical properties of the Li–B–Mg and Li–B composites in symmetrical batteries under the current density of 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. It is obvious that the overpotential of Li–B–Mg composite is lower than that of Li–B anode especially in the partial enlarged figures, which is consistent with the above calculation results of enhanced adsorption energy with the addition of Mg.

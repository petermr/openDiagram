<p>All three proteins were detected in plasma by Western blotting, as shown in FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. Ywhab increased 3.7-fold in the model plasma, consistent with the results from the model perfusates (3.5-fold increased). As a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, Ywhab plays a key role in cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation [

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The hydroxyl radical scavenging assay was performed as described by Tellone et al. [<xref rid="B38-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This assay is based on quantification of the degradation product of 2-deoxyribose by condensation with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). The reaction mixture contained the following in the final volume of 1.0 mL: 2.8 mM 2-deoxy-2-ribose, 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 25 &#181;M FeCl<sub>3</sub>, 100 &#181;M EDTA, 2.8 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 100 &#181;M ascorbic acid and sample solution in order to obtain the final concentration range of 15&#8211;0.92 &#181;g/mL. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 &#177; 0.5 &#176;C in a water bath. Then 1.0 mL of 1% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) TBA was added to each mixture followed by the addition of 1 mL of 2.8% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The solutions were heated in a water bath at 100 &#176;C for 15 min to develop the pink coloured malondialdehyde&#8211;thiobarbituric acid adduct. After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm against an appropriate blank solution. The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).</p>

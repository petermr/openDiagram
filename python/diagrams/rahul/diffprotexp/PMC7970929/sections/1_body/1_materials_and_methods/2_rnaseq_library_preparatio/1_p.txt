0: RNA sequencing libraries were prepared with Illumina-compatible NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) as per manufacturers instructions.
1: mRNA was isolated from total RNA (100 ng to 1 g) and subjected to first strand synthesis in the presence of Actinomycin D (Gibco, life technologies, CA, USA) followed by second strand synthesis.
2: HighPrep magnetic beads (Magbio Genomics Inc, USA) were used to purify double-stranded cDNA and after end-repairing and adenylation, it was ligated to Illumina multiplex barcode adapters as per NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit protocol.

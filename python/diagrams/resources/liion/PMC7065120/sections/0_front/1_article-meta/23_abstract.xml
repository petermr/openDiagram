  <bold>A clear case</bold>: A computational study on the conversion‐reaction mechanism of FeNCN in Li‐ and Na‐ion batteries yields calculated voltage profiles which agree well with experiments, and their characteristic behavior is well explained by chemical‐bonding and Mulliken‐charge analysis. Furthermore, a predicted ternary intermediate with composition Li

  <sub>3</sub> during lithiation is confirmed by operando XAS analysis.

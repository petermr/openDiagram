For a subset of 16 genes (Figure 4), we pulled the DNA sequence matches from the reciprocal best BLAT hits in the elephant and manatee genomes to determine conservation and presence of premature stop codons in the open reading frame (ORF). We translated the ORF for each hit into amino acid sequences, and grouped up hits for each gene into one FASTA file along with the UniProt protein sequences for the human, dog, cat, and cow orthologs. Using a pipeline hosted at NGPhlyogeny.fr[@Lemoine_2019], the homologs were aligned using MAFFT[@Katoh_2013]; the aligned sequences were cleaned using BMGE[@Criscuolo_2010]; and then a gene tree was constructed using FastME[@Lefort_2015]. Alignments were then visually inspected for conservation and presence of premature stop codons.</p>

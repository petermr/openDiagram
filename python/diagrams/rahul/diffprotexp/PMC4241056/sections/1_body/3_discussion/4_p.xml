<p>TCPZ is the Î¶ subunit of T-complex protein 1 (TCP1), known as chaperonin-containing T-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) or TCP1 ring complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Regardless of cell type, the expression level of CCT depends on cell growth rate. The upregulation of CCT is to meet the increased requirement for assistance in the folding of proteins which are actively synthesized during cell growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. HnRNP-F is one of the constituents of the splicing-related hnRNP complex and is related to the pre-mRNA cleavage reaction in the mammalian nucleus. And it seems that hnRNP-F might also be related to the cells growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Different forms of Se exposure induced the different expressed levels of TCPZ and hnRNP-F in Caco-2 cells. Compared with the control groups, significantly more downregulation was found in TCPZ and hnRNP-F of the groups treated with Se. However, no significant differences were observed in TCPZ and hnRNP-F between groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met. The results indicate that nano-Se has the similar impact with Se-Met to regulate the growth of Caco-2 cells.

<p>Bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were cultured with high-glucose medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA) at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. CP biotype BVDV strain VEDEVAC AV69 kept in our laboratory was propagated on MDBK cells, and the virus titer was approximately 10
 <sup>6.5</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose, TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per 0.1 mL. Before infecting the MDBK cells with BVDV, 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL of MDBK cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 24 h. Subsequently, 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> BVDV was added to each well (experimental group, E group). In parallel, high-glucose medium was used for mock infection (control group, C group).

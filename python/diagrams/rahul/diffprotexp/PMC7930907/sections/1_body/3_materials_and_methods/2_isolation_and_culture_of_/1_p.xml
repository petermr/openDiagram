<p>Rats were starved for 12 h before isolating ASCs. First, rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane to induce sacrifices, soaked in 75% ethanol for whole-body disinfection, removed from alcohol, and placed on a sterile ultra-clean table. The limbs were fixed, and the SAT was obtained from the groin. Perirenal and EAT was obtained from the kidney and testis, and the tissue was rinsed in precooled PBS. The washed adipose tissue was transferred into the cell platform, muscle and lymph tissue were removed, tissue was cut into 1–2 mm pieces, and collagenase type I was added. After digestion, all the suspensions collected were filtered through a nylon filter (Dutscher, 100 μm), centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the sample. Then the suspension was evenly spread in culture dishes and cultured into a 37
 <sup>°</sup>C incubator for 2 h. The upper-medium was discarded, high glucose medium containing 10% FBS was added, and SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs were obtained. After culturing at 37
 <sup>°</sup>C in an incubator for 3 days, RNA and metabolites were extracted from the third passage (P3) cells and sequenced by transcriptomics and metabolomics, respectively (

<p>Upstream regulator analysis can predict upstream molecules, including microRNA and transcription factors, which may be causing the observed protein expression changes. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="proteomes-01-00219-s001">Table S4</xref> lists the upstream regulators that were predicted to be activated or inhibited based on the activation z-score. Given the fold change of corresponding proteins, the state of the upstream regulators that control these proteins can be predicted. Only two upstream regulators, Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), were shown to be activated with a z-score &gt; 2, and the others were inhibited with z-score &lt; −2. Many of these upstream regulators are cytokines or transcription regulators. In general, the depression in upstream regulators indicates a stress response as well as an effect on the cellular defense mechanism which may make the airways more susceptible to attack by microorganisms. However, two of the upstream regulator pathways delineate control of intracellular processes that have direct applicability to the functional effects previously documented in the Calu-3 cells—namely a decrease in TEER or barrier function and a decrease in hormone-stimulated Cl
 <sup>−</sup> secretion.

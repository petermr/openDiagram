0: BLF was mixed with remdesivir at combination ratios of 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, separately.
1: The mixture of each compound with remdesivir at each combination ratio was serially diluted into 7 different concentrations and applied in HCoV-OC43 CPE assay to determine EC 50 of BLF and remdesivir in the combination ratio.
2: CIs plot was used to depict the EC 50 values of each compound and remdesivir at different combination ratios.
3: The red line indicates the additive effect, and above the red line indicates the antagonism, while below the red line indicates the synergy [ 39].

<p id="Par17">Antisense transcripts, particularly lncNATs, present in many genomes of diverse kingdoms, showed either positively or negatively correlated expression with their corresponding sense transcripts. This antisense lncRNAs regulate the expression of their sense transcripts in a negative or positive way, by means of different transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms. In particular cases, upregulation of sense gene expression may be explained by the participation of a lncNAT in the inhibition of other factors at translational level, such as efficient translation initiation or elongation

<p>It is well known that ERAD involves, in most cases, activation of the proteasome proteolysis pathway and/or the lysosomal machinery. Therefore, to explore the possible implication of proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation pathways in the STCH-induced down-regulation of NKCC2, 16 h post-transfection, cells were treated for 6 h with 2 μm MG132 or 100 μm chloroquine and their lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis. In accordance with our previous work, MG132 treatment significantly increased the protein levels of the immature form of NKCC2 without a notable increase in its mature form, an effect consistent with an ER-associated degradation. Interestingly, in cells overexpressing STCH, MG132 appeared to increase NKCC2 levels and to exert a protective effect against STCH-induced NKCC2 degradation (

 <bold>lower panel</bold>). Interestingly, in the presence of chloroquine, STCH effect on NKCC2 was also partially inhibited revealing therefore that the lysosomal machinery is also involved in STCH-induced down-regulation of the co-transporter. Accordingly, the combined use of MG132 and chloroquine was able to abrogate the STCH induced downregulation of NKCC2, and to fully restore the expression level of the co-transporter. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that STCH decreases NKCC2 expression by promoting its ERAD in a proteasome and lysosome dependent manner.

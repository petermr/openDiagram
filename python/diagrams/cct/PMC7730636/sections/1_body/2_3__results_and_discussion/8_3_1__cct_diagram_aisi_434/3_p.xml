<p>The end of all measurements was set at 50 °C. For this reason, in the CCT diagram, there is no boundary region of martensite formation 
 <italic>Mf</italic>. This is because it lies in negative temperatures, and our device does not currently allow negative temperatures to be set. As already mentioned, the resulting 
 <italic>Ms</italic> temperature was evaluated from the first dilatation curves and has a value of 282 °C. According to the CCT diagram, this temperature represents the limit value at which a martensite begins to form in the structure of the material. In order to avoid the formation of a possible heterogeneous structure, the specific cooling rate must be maintained.

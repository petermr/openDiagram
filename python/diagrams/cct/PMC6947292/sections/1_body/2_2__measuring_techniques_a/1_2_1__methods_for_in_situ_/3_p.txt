0: One additional requirement that allows the analysis of quench-induced precipitation, of course, is the need for controlled cooling covering a wide range of cooling rates.
1: This aspect of the metrological implementation might be difficult in several cases.
2: All of the abovementioned methods also have certain advantages and some drawbacks, and these will be briefly reviewed with respect to their capabilities and limitations for the analysis of quench-induced precipitation.

<p>Finally, we assessed how enrichment characteristics affected levels of abnormal and social behaviors. We modeled pacing and initiating affiliative interactions using Poisson distributions and log link functions, and we modeled initiating agonistic interactions using a negative binomial distribution and a log link function. We were unable to fit models for pacing, initiating affiliative interactions, or initiating agonistic interactions using the specific enrichment (each of the seven items) due to the relative rarity of these behaviors. Therefore, fixed factors for these three behaviors included: time in the study (continuous two-week period), stated goal of enrichment, counts of enrichment events, and total time in enrichment events. We also included the interaction between the stated goal and the count of enrichment events, and the interaction between the stated goal and the total time in enrichment events, as fixed factors in the pacing model. These models used variance components covariance structures and the aforementioned random slope terms, with the exception of the model for initiating affiliative interactions, which would only support a random intercept. </p>

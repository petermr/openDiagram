0: The LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C composites were synthesized via the following steps.
1: FeSO 47H 2O and H 3PO 4 were dissolved in a mixed solution of de-ionized water and ethylene glycol, and GO suspension was added to the solution.
2: Next, a mixture of LiOHH 2O aqueous solution and GO suspension was added into the mixed solution under constant stirring.
3: The molar ratio of Li:Fe:P is 3:1:1.
4: After stirring for 3 h, the solution was evaporated at 80C for 12 h. Meanwhile, a separate sample was prepared with the GO suspension replaced by sucrose as the source of carbon, and the previous steps were repeated.
5: Finally, the precursors obtained were pressed into pellets, and then the pellets were placed inside a quartz crucible with a cover to prevent air oxidation.
6: The quartz crucible was put in the middle of the domestic microwave oven, and the precursors were radiated by microwave for 10 min with a maximum power of 1,500 W and a frequency of 2.45 GHz.
7: After microwave irradiation, LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C composites were obtained, respectively.

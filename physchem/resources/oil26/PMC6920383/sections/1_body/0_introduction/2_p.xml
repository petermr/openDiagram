<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par3">Ecosystem engineers generally have a positive impact on species richness at the landscape-level by increasing habitat diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and the loss or introduction of such species may disproportionally affect the distribution of other organisms and the functioning of ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the nature and strength of the impact of an ecosystem engineer may vary spatio-temporally, depending on environmental conditions, community characteristics and the resources altered by the engineer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, herbaceous species richness in beaver meadows (i.e. wetlands formed by beavers damming streams) varies depending on site hydrology, with higher richness in areas of more variable water table depth and faster drainage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. As a result, a specific ecosystem engineer can potentially have very different species- and community-level impacts in different environments, even when the engineer functions similarly in all environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is therefore challenging to predict when and where ecosystem engineers will have a strong impact on communities and ecosystem processes, despite this being an important question in ecology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>

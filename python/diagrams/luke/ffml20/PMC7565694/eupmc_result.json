    "A high-barrier polyimide (2,7-CPI) was synthesized through the polymerization of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and a novel diamine (2,7-CDA) containing carbazole moiety. The synthesized diamine and polyimide were fully characterized by elemental analyses, FTIR and NMR. The 2,7-CPI displays very attractive barrier performances, with oxygen transmission rate (OTR) and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) low to 0.14 cm<sup>3</sup>·m<sup>-2</sup>·day<sup>-1</sup> and 0.05 g·m<sup>-2</sup>·day<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Meanwhile, 2,7-CPI also exhibits exceptional thermal stability with a glass transition temperature (<i>T<sub>g</sub></i>) of 467 °C, 5% weight-loss temperature (<i>T<sub>d5%</sub></i>) of 550 °C under N<sub>2</sub> and coefficient of thermal expansion (<i>CTE</i>) of 3.4 ppm/K. The barrier performances of 2,7-CPI are compared with those of a structural analogue (2,7-CPPI) and a typical polyimide (Kapton). Their barrier performances with respect to microstructure were investigated by molecular simulations, wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The results show that 2,7-CPI possesses better coplanar structure and more number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the three PIs, which result in tight chain packing and thereby high crystallinity, low free volume, and decreased chains mobility. That is, the high crystallinity and low free volume of 2,7-CPI reduce the diffusion and solubility of gases. Meanwhile, the poor chains mobility further decreases the gases diffusion. The reduced diffusion and solubility of gases consequently promote the improvement of barrier properties for 2,7-CPI. The polyimide has a wide application prospect in the field of flexible electronic packaging industries."

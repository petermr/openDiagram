  <p>Percent of time spent using enrichment (
   <bold>a</bold>) and the rate of enrichment use (
   <bold>b</bold>) for each enrichment item by the time of night (mean Â± SE; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4). PM observations occurred between 21:00 and 22:00, MID observations occurred between 00:30 and 01:30, and AM observations occurred between 04:00 and 05:00. Significant pairwise comparisons (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) within each timeframe are noted on the graph with different letters, using uppercase letters for percent of time and lowercase letters for rate per 20 min. Note that the scale for enrichment use changes between the PM, MID, and AM graphs. Pairwise comparisons can be found in

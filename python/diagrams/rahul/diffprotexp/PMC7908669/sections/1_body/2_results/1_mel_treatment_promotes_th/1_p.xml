<p id="Par22">To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying MEL-induced BMSC differentiation toward osteoblasts, we first validated the effects of MEL treatment on the osteoblast differentiation of human BMSCs in vitro. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we showed that the relative mRNA levels of three osteoblast marker genes, 
 <italic>ALP</italic>, 
 <italic>RUNX2</italic>, and 
 <italic>OPN</italic>, were significantly increased by MEL treatment in BMSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The elevated expression of these three osteogenic biomarkers in BMSCs by MEL treatment was also confirmed by western blot (WB) analysis, which showed increased protein levels of these markers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Furthermore, ALP staining revealed significantly elevated expression of ALP in human BMSCs following MEL treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Finally, we verified that MEL treatment substantially promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs, compared with the control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d) using the Alizarin Red staining method. These results confirmed the role of MEL in stimulating the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

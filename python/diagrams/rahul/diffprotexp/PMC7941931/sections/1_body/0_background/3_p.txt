0: Tartary buckwheat ( Fagopyrum tataricum) is an annual medicinal and edible crop, belonging to the eudicot family Polygonaceae [ 46].
1: It is widely cultivated in Asia and Eastern Europe, especially in the mountainous areas of Southwest China [ 46].
2: Tartary buckwheat seed is a good source of nutrients including starch, protein, dietary fiber, fatty acid (linoleic acid), and various minerals [ 46].
3: Importantly, Tartary buckwheat seed also contains rich flavonoids especially rutin, which have been proved to be effective in preventing liver injury and especially inflammatory liver injury [ 43,  46].
4: Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the molecular mechanism of Tartary buckwheat seed development, which will be helpful in high-yield and quality breeding of Tartary buckwheat [ 46].
5: To date, several transcriptome analyses have been reported that examine the molecular mechanism of Tartary buckwheat seed development [ 4,  43,  46 48].
6: However, to our knowledge, no one has studied miRNAs in Tartary buckwheat, and miRNAs whether and how to regulate the development of Tartary buckwheat seed is largely unclear.
7: In this study, we first examined the conserved evolution of miRNA biosynthesis in Tartary buckwheat compared to other plants through homology identification and phylogenetic analysis of miRNA biosynthesis genes.
8: Then, we identified the known and novel miRNAs in the developing seed of Tartary buckwheat and predicted their target genes.
9: Finally, we performed integration analysis between miRNA and mRNA expression to insight into the miRNA-mediated molecular mechanisms of Tartary buckwheat seed development and identified key miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs for Tartary buckwheat seed development.
10: Our results provide valuable information for enhancing the understanding of the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism of Tartary buckwheat seed development and aid in the Tartary buckwheat seed improvement.

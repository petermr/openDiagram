<p>To further dissect the fate transition of germ cells during PF formation, the pseudotime trajectory of germ cells was established to reveal five developmental States and two branching cell fates (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). According to the distribution of germ cells in States, the differentiated status of DEHP-treated germ cells at PD3 underwent a remarkable change, with an apparent increase of cells at State 5 being observed (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B-C). Gene expression along with cell trajectory showed at State 1 that the 
 <italic>Taf7l</italic> gene was actively expressed at the pre-stage of PF formation, while the 
 <italic>Figla</italic> gene was expressed at all investigated stages, while at State 3 the 
 <italic>Zp3</italic> and 
 <italic>Padi6</italic> genes were specifically and actively expressed in follicular oocytes (late-stage; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S5</xref>A). This evidence implied that PF assembly was impeded by DEHP.

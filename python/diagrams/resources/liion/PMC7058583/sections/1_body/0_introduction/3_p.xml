<p>Herein, inspired by the structure of sandwiches, we constructed a novel 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-rGO sandwich nanocomposites (MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO) for lithium-ion battery anode through a linking mode and 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> conversion. Supported by the PEO chains, the enlarged interlayer space of rGO not only accommodated as many MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nano-flowers as possible, but also acted as a conductive framework. The mild volume expansion of the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nano-flowers during charge-discharge processes was effectively alleviated by the PEO chains. The rGO conductive framework mad all flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub> stuffings electrochemically active. With this unique design, the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich composites exhibited remarkable specific capacity and ultra-stable cyclic performance during the electrochemical measurements.

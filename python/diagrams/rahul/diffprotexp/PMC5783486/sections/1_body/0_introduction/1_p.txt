0: Kawasaki disease (KD), first described in 1967 by Kawasaki ( 1), is a type of acute vasculitis with unknown etiology; however, KD is known to induce pathological alterations in medium-sized arteries, particularly coronary arteries.
1: Some patients with KD develop coronary artery lesions and exhibit similar clinical outcomes to those of patients with coronary atherosclerosis ( 2).
2: Several studies have demonstrated that patients without coronary artery lesions still exhibit a high risk of various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, in adulthood ( 2 4).
3: KD is a main cause of acquired heart disease in children, predominantly affecting coronary arteries ( 5).

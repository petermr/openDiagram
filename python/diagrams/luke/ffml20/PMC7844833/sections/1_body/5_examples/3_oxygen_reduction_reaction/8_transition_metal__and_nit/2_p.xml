<p>TMNC catalysts for ORR are currently the subject of vivid investigations, since they are considered promising alternatives to Pt-based materials. The activity of Co-based macrocycles for ORR was pointed out already in 1960s, but the stability and the activity of these materials were low.

 </sup> Later, it was found that both the stability and catalytic performance could be improved significantly upon pyrolysis of the transition metal-containing precursors.

 </sup> Such high temperature treatment, however, results in significant changes in the TMNC materials, and heterogeneous structures with different coexisting species severely complicate the elucidation of the actual active sites for ORR. In particular, M-N

 </sub> structural motifs have all been proposed as possible active species, with the corresponding reports in the literature often providing contradicting evidence.

 </sup> Moreover, the reason for the significant deactivation of the TMNC catalysts, one of the main issues for their transfer into practical applications, is still a controversial subject. The most popular types of TMNCs for ORR are Fe- and Co-based materials. Commonly, Fe-based TMNCs are believed to be more active for 4e ORR process, while Co-based TMNCs seem to favor 2e ORR process with H

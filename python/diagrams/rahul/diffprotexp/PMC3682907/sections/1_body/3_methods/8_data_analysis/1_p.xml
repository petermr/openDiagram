<p>Univariate (Mann-Whitney test) and multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) were performed using Ciphergen Express software. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to calculate the p-value. SELDI-MS peak intensity differences were considered significant when p â‰¤ 0.05. Hierarchical clustering was performed on all peaks that were present in at least 25% of spectra with SNR &gt; 4.0 and heat maps were generated [

<p>Our study may shed light on how the IIR can be attenuated through mRNA-processing regulators of the IIR. Both RelA and IRF7, master upstream regulators of the IIR, are encoded by genes that express transcripts with retained introns. Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the detection of numerous transcripts that retain introns (reviewed in [

Although intron retention (IR) typically does not contribute to proteomic diversity, IR events have the ability to act as negative regulators of gene expression. The mechanisms by which IR transcripts function as negative regulators are by slowing down splicing kinetics [

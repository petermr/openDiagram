<p>Finally, we examined DLX2 and GAD67, markers of committed and maturing cortical interneurons. Although 
 <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression was downregulated in the MIA group from bulk tissue dissections at E17.5, the number of cells positive for DLX2 protein in the neocortex were comparable when assessed via IHC in the MIA and control groups (n = 3 per group, total DLX2 p=0.5494; by zones DLX2, zone 1 P=0.9848, zone 2 P=0.6903, zone 3 P=0.2714, Student’s t-test) (

In contrast, GAD protein in this DLX2+ subpopulation, assessed by the pan-GABAergic marker GAD67+, was increased across the neocortex of MIA brains, and was not restricted to any specific zones of the neocortex (n = 3 per group, total DLX2+/GAD67 p=0.0004; by zones DLX2+/GAD67, zone 1 P=0.2277, zone 2 P=0.1352, zone 3 P=0.2862, Student’s t-test) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i–j and n,p</xref>). Since GAD67 expression increases in developing cortical interneurons, the decrease in 
 <italic>Dlx2</italic> transcript expression but no difference in cells expressing DLX2 protein could indicate increased interneuron maturation but no change in interneuron numbers at this age. While neuroanatomical characterization here was limited to E17.5 and interrogated a subset of genes and processes of interest, our IHC findings correlate with transcriptional profiles, providing validation of MIA-associated DE in developing cortex.

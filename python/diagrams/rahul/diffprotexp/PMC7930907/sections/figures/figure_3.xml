  <p>Analysis of metabolic pathways in SASCs, EASCs, and PASCs. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Analysis of metabolic pathways of differential metabolites between SASCs and PASCs. The color depends on the 
   <italic>P</italic>-value, and the size of the circle represents the degree of correlation. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Top 25 enrichment of differential metabolites between SASCs and PASCs, and the 
   <italic>P</italic>-value represents the enrichment level, the darker the orange, the greater the 
   <italic>P</italic>-value; the length of the bar represents the amounts of metabolites. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Analysis of metabolic pathways of differential metabolites between SASCs and EASCs. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Top twenty-five enrichment of differential metabolites between SASCs and EASCs.

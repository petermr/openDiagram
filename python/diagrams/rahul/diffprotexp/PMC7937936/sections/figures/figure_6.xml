  <p>Differential expression analysis of hub genes in tumor and normal tissues in GEO data sets. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> There was no significant difference in the expression of 
   <italic>CCR4</italic> in the GSE30784 data set. 
   <bold>(B, C)</bold> Significant differences were observed in the expression of 
   <italic>CCR8</italic> and 
   <italic>P2RY14</italic> between tumor and normal tissues in the GSE30784 data set (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> No significant difference in 
   <italic>CCR4</italic> was observed in the GSE37991 data set. 
   <bold>(E, F)</bold> In the GSE37991 data set, 
   <italic>CCR8</italic> expression was increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, while 
   <italic>P2RY14</italic> expression was significantly decreased.

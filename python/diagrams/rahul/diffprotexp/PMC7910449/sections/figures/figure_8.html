 <caption> CircRAB11FIP1 enhanced the DSC1-dependent autophagy. A LV2-1, LV2-NC, or LV2-1 + PCMV5-DSC1 was used to transfect SKOV3 cells. LV6, LV6-NC, or LV6 + DSC1 siRNA was utilized to transfect A2780 cells. Later, LC3 expression was detected through western blot analysis. B, C LV2-1, LV2-NC, or LV2-1 + PCMV5-DSC1 was transfected into SKOV3 cells. Later, confocal microscopy was performed to analyze the distribution of mRFP-GFP-LC3 within SKOV3 cells. D, E LV6, LV6-NC, or LV6 + DSC1 siRNA was transfected into A2780 cells. Thereafter, confocal microscopy was conducted to analyze the mRFP-GFP-LC3 distribution within A2780 cells. The Image-Pro Plus 6.0 was employed for quantifying LC3 dots. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, and typical results were presented. Error bar stands for standard error. * P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.01. Scale bar = 5 µm. </caption>

<p id="Par25">Chromatin compartments were computed at 100 kb resolution as previously described and implemented in compartmap (v1.65.71). Briefly, pre-processed M-values were subset to “open sea” CpG probes (at least 4 kb away from annotated CpG island) and masked probes that were found in at least 50% of samples were imputed using k-nearest neighbor via the impute (v1.59.0) R package. Next, loci were median summarized in 100 kb bins. Group-level compartments were inferred by computing Pearson correlations of summarized bins and the first principal component of the correlation matrix. A/B compartments correspond to positive (open chromatin) and negative (closed chromatin) eigenvalues, respectively. Genome-wide discordant compartments were identified by comparing the sign of the eigenvalue for overlapping genomic bins and filtering out those with small absolute eigenvalues (&gt; 0.02). In total, we identified 2937 discordant chromatin compartments between plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas. Results were plotted using circlize (v0.4.8).</p>

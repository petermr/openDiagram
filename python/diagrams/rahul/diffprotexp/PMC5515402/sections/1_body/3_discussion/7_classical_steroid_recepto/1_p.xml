In the same line of evidence, our data showed that 17α-meT decreased intracellular GnRH expression, suggesting repressive effects on FSH and LH, hormonal changes that might represent dysregulation of the endocrine system. However, we observed that 17α-meT caused a non-significant trend to increase AR expression. Similar to our results is the fact that DHT (2.4 μM) did not modulate the expression of AR in lymphocytes [

Interestingly, we found that AAS exposure decreased expression of ER, a result that is consistent with previous studies showing that, in the hypothalamus, its expression is inhibited by androgens [

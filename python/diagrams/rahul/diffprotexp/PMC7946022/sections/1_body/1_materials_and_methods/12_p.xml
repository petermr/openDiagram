 <bold>Effect of biofilm DNAse treatment on 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> vancomycin susceptibility in single and mixed biofilms with 
  <italic>C. albicans</italic>
 </bold>. 24 hr-preformed single and mixed-species biofilms were grown as described above and, after removal of non-sessile cells, DNAse I (0.625 mg/ml), vancomycin (800 µg/ml) or a combination of both were added to appropriate wells with biofilms. Following 24 hrs of incubation at 37°C, wells were sonicated, and cell suspensions were diluted and plated on species-specific chromogenic media for CFU enumeration. Control wells with no treatment were included; DNAse I optimal activity concentration was pre-determined in a dose–response assay (data not shown) and the vancomycin concentration used was based on our previously published work on mixed biofilm assays [

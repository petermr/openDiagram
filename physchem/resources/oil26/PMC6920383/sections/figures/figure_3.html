 <caption> Species richness at the different microsites at two study sites. BE = “Burrow entrance”, IA = “Impacted area”, C = “Control”. Microsites within a site not sharing a letter differ significantly. Plots indicate median values (thick lines), interquartile range and range (box and whiskers, respectively), and outliers (empty circles). See Fig.  4 for results for the mesic grassland site, and Supplementary Table  S.1 for statistical results. Note that at the arid scrubland sample area differed between the burrow entrance and the other two microsites. </caption>

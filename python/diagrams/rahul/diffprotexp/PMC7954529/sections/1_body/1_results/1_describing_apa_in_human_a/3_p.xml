<p>To compare PAS usage across species, we needed to identify the orthologous genomic regions of all PAS in our dataset, regardless of the species in which they were originally annotated. As we were unable to confidently identify orthologous PAS at base pair resolution (inferring synteny at base pair resolution in non-coding regions is challenging; Broad Institute 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lindblad-Toh et al., 2011</xref>), we extended each PAS by 100 bp upstream and downstream. We then used a reciprocal liftover pipeline to obtain an inclusive set of PAS regions with which we could confidently compare PAS usage between species (see 'Materials and methods'). Prior to the filtering described below, we identified 445,944 orthologous regions.

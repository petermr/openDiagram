<p>All samples were collected and stored at the Karolinska Biobank. Prior to surgical operations or other sampling of tissues at the Karolinska University Hospital, all patients are routinely asked for permission to save their tissues or biological fluids for research purposes. All patients are informed both verbally and by a written patient information. Patient consent (or denial) is obtained verbally and thereafter documented in the patients’ medical records as a standard procedure. The procedure of obtaining verbal consent from patients is in agreement with Swedish law and ethical regulations. The research project as well as the procedure of obtaining patient consent for biobanking were approved by the local ethical committee, at the time called The Karolinska Institutet Research Ethical Committee (permission number 03–517).</p>

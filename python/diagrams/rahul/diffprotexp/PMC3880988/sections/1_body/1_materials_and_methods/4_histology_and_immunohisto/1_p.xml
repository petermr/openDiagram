<p>This experiment was performed according to the instructions described in DAKO Cytomation EnVision + System HRP kit (DAKO, Denmark). MSC- and AC-alginate beads were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, followed by serial dehydrations (70% ethanol for 15 minutes, 95% ethanol for 30 minutes, 100% ethanol for 30 minutes) and xylene (20 minutes). Samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5-Î¼m thickness) and stained with monoclonal anti-collagen type-II (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore, MA, USA) and Safranin-O.</p>

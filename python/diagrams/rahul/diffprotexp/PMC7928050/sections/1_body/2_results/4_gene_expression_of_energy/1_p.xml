<p>The genes Me1, Acaca, Elovl6, and Thrsp were most significantly downregulated in both groups and are all responsible for energy metabolism. Malic enzyme 1 (ME1) is involved in the glycolytic and the citric acid cycles and plays an important role for NADPH production, glutamine metabolism, and lipogenesis[
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Acaca gene encodes for Acetyl-CoA carboxylase which catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of actetyl-CoA and is therefore a very important regulator in fatty acid biosynthesis[

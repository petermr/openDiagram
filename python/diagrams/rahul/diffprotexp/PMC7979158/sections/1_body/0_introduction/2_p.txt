0: MIA-induced outcomes in adult offspring have been well characterized; however, mechanisms of initiation and progression of NDD-related brain pathology remain poorly defined.
1: Poly(I:C) increases proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, CXCL1, and TNF- in the maternal circulation ( Ballendine et al., 2015;  Dahlgren et al., 2006;  Hsiao and Patterson, 2011;  Meyer et al., 2006b;  Meyer et al., 2006a;  Smith et al., 2007).
2: Downstream pathological changes in the brains of offspring have been reported across cell types, from neurons to microglia, and these changes have been linked to perturbations in proliferation, migration, and maturation in the developing brain ( Haida et al., 2019;  Shin Yim et al., 2017;  Soumiya et al., 2011;  Zhang et al., 2019;  Zhao et al., 2019).
3: Recent studies have identified acute transcriptomic changes in fetal brain in mice and rats at single time-points (34 hr) following MIA, with significant overlap between transcriptome changes in the cortices of MIA-exposed offspring and those altered in the brains of children with ASD ( Lombardo et al., 2018).
4: Although MIA could cause a dynamic sequence of transcriptional changes in the fetal brain following acute exposure, no integrated picture of MIA-associated transcriptomic pathology exists that maps changes spanning from the initial acute response to MIA through birth.
5: Here, we combined time-course transcriptomics with neuroanatomy to map changes in prenatal mouse cortical development following MIA induced by poly(I:C) injection at E12.5.

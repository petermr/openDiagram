0: Precipitated proteins were washed with acetone and dried.
1: The pellets were dissolved in 300 L of 8 M urea and processed by the filter aided sample preparation method [ 15] using Vivacon 10 kDa MWCO filter (Sartorius Stedim Biotech).
2: Proteins were washed twice with 100 L of 8 M urea and reduced by 100 L of 10 mM DTT.
3: After reduction, proteins were incubated with 100 L of 50 mM IAA and washed twice with 100 L of 25 mM TEAB.
4: Trypsin (Promega) was used at 1:50 ratio (w/w) and the digestion proceeded for 16 h at 30 C.

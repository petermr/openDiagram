<p>(5) Finite element simulation showed that, at the beginning of each pass during cold rolling, the stress and strain increased with increasing depth from the surface to a depth of ~3 mm, and subsequently, the values decreased with the increased depth. The largest stress and strain were 830 MPa and 0.6 at a depth of 3 mm after the fourth pass of the 0.10C-1.50Cr steel, respectively. Stress and strain accumulation in the surface region of the cold rolled steel led to the existence of dense LAGBs.</p>

0: Demographic variables (sex, age, and PMI) were compared between the groups using a  2-test and Welchs t-test.
1: The latter was also used for comparing the levels of protein (DARPP-32, CaN) expression between the diagnostic groups (schizophrenia and control, with bipolar disorder as a reference).
2: The correlations of expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN in each sample were assessed by Pearsons correlation coefficients, and the ratio of proteins were compared between the diagnostic groups by Welchs t-test.
3: For association study of SNPs, we divided all samples into minor allele carriers and non-carriers of each SNPs.
4: A Mann-Whitney  U-test was then used for comparing the levels of protein expression between the genotypes of each SNP.
5: In the comparison between the two groups, we excluded outliers (>mean  3 SD) from analysis.
6: Further, Spearmans rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between the expressions of each protein and estimated total dosage of neuroleptic drugs.
7: SPSS ver.
8: 25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and (SigmaPlot14.0; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) was used for analysis.

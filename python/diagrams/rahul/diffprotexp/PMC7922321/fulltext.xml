Introduction</title><p>ETS proteins are present in metazoan lineages [<xref rid="B1-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and play a role in diverse biological processes. Intriguingly, ETS proteins also exhibit extensive overlaps in their tissue expression profiles, with many members of this superfamily having ubiquitous expression [<xref rid="B2-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Not surprisingly, members of this family also tend to exhibit overlapping and sometimes redundant DNA binding, as analyzed by genome-wide occupancy and other assays [<xref rid="B3-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The ETS (E26 transformation specific) domain transcription factor superfamily includes 27 members in humans in 11 subfamilies [<xref rid="B2-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Taking its name from the founding member of this superfamily, namely oncogenic v-ets [<xref rid="B5-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], ETS domain transcription factors are typically defined by their DNA binding domain, called the ETS domain, which binds the consensus motif 5&#x02032;-GGA(A/T)-3&#x02032;, called the ets motif of the ETS binding site (EBS) [<xref rid="B6-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Their DNA binding property, as well as transactivation function, is regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway [<xref rid="B7-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In addition to their roles in normal growth and development, ETS proteins are commonly involved in cancer formation and progression through the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, or vascularization, as well as regulation of epithelial&#x02013;stromal interactions and epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition [<xref rid="B9-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The expressions of several ETS family members, such as PEA3, ETS-1, and ETS-2, are upregulated in tumors, playing a role in different aspects of tumorigenesis, including tumor initiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and angiogenesis [<xref rid="B4-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B10-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In some cases, ETS members are amplified and/or rearranged, such as c-ETS1 in acute myelomonocytic leukemia, or undergo chromosomal relocations that result in fusions, like in the case of chromosomal translocation of 5&#x02032; TMPRSS2 to the ETS genes, resulting in TMPRSS:ERG fusion proteins in nearly half of prostate cancers, or chromosomal translocation that yields EWS-FLI1 fusion in Ewing sarcoma. The transcriptional potency of ETS proteins is also often increased in various cancers as a result of changes in protein&#x02013;protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and/or protein stabilization [<xref rid="B4-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Ets-1 was found to be overexpressed in breast cancer, which was reported to be associated with poor prognosis [<xref rid="B10-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ets-1 is not only a critical regulator of invasion [<xref rid="B10-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but is also involved in regulating cancer energy metabolism in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines [<xref rid="B11-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has also been shown to play a role in telomere maintenance through the regulation of hTERT expression [<xref rid="B12-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. T417 phosphorylation of Elk-1, a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily, was found to be associated with the differentiation grade of colonic adenocarcinomas [<xref rid="B13-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, in high clinical stage prostate cancer, ELK-1, not TCF members ELK3 or ELK4, was found to be associated with disease recurrence [<xref rid="B14-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, ELK1 expression was reported to be higher than ELK3 in many cancer cell lines, including brain, skin, and myeloid tumors and sarcomas [<xref rid="B15-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PKC&#x003b1; expression, parallel to cell migration and tumorigenicity, of hepatocellular carcinoma was increased by MZF/Elk-1 transcription factor complex [<xref rid="B16-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The PEA3 subfamily of ETS domain transcription factors was also involved in a number of cancers, such as in lung tumors with MET amplification, and PEA3 subfamily members were found to play a role in migration and invasion [<xref rid="B17-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In colorectal carcinoma, PEA3 was shown to promote invasiveness and metastatic potential [<xref rid="B18-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In ovarian cancer, the loss of repressors of the PEA3 subfamily was shown to cause overaccumulation of ETV4 and ETV5 [<xref rid="B19-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Malignant gliomas are the most common and lethal primary tumors of the brain. Grading of diffuse gliomas is based largely on the mitotic activity and vascular proliferation states, and molecular markers are also used as diagnostic entities. Still, further molecular information will be important in a more detailed description and categorization of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, in particular for reliable and reproducible classification of grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas [<xref rid="B20-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), WHO grade IV, is the most aggressive and lethal among all gliomas. High-grade gliomas are composed of a highly proliferative tumor core, with highly invasive cells surrounding them [<xref rid="B22-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>ETV2, an early regulator of vascular development, was found to be overexpressed in high-grade gliomas, and was reported to play a critical role in endothelial transdifferentiation of CD133+ GBM stem cells, which is thought to render them resistant to anti-angiogenic therapy [<xref rid="B23-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another ETS-related gene, ERG, was found to be a novel and highly specific marker for endothelial cells within CNS tumors, a feature that can be used in studying the vascularization of gliomas [<xref rid="B24-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A transposon-based study of gliomagenesis identified friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (Fli1), among other genes, to be expressed in gliomas, although Fli1 expression is limited to a subset of glioma cells [<xref rid="B25-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and ETS protein PU.1, known for its critical role in hematopoietic development, was also reported to be highly expressed in glioma patients, indicating its role in the progression of glioma [<xref rid="B26-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition to their role in tumor vascularization, ETS proteins can also regulate other aspects of tumorigenesis. In a network analysis based on complexity, as measured by betweenness, Etv5 was identified as a regulator in low-grade optic gliomas in Nf1 mutant mice, and experiments validated the increased expression of both Etv5 and its target genes in optic gliomas [<xref rid="B27-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Gliomas can be broadly classified as diffuse and non-diffuse (circumscribed) gliomas. Diffuse gliomas, namely oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, exhibit similarities to glial precursors, and are identified and categorized based on the WHO classification of CNS tumors [<xref rid="B28-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Due to their rather heterogeneous nature, the reproducibility in diagnosis of low-grade (WHO grade II/III) diffuse gliomas can be a challenge. Several molecular markers, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations or telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations, which create ETS binding sites [<xref rid="B12-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], are used to assist in differential diagnosis [<xref rid="B20-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previously, ETS gene status in clinical prostate tumor samples has been determined, and ERG+ and ETV1/4/5+ cases were found to be associated with worse prognosis, indicating that ETS status may act as a prognostic biomarker and be used in combination with other existing molecular determinants [<xref rid="B29-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we have analyzed microarray data from patients with different grades of glioma for relative expression of ETS genes, and identified different ETS genes that are upregulated at different glioma grades. We show that, while ETV1 is expressed at high levels in grade 2 glioma, its expression gradually decreases with glioma stage, and on the other hand, ELK3 and ETV4 expressions are increased with progression of the glioma stage. Furthermore, both ELF4 and ETV6 expressions are downregulated at grade 2 glioma, but upregulated at increasing levels in grades 3 and 4, indicating that these genes can also be utilized as additional molecular determinants to distinguish glioma grades. We further compare these data to microarray results from Elk-1-VP16 or PEA3-VP16 overexpression SH-SY5Y cells in order to narrow down transcriptional regulons, and identify common and unique transcriptional regulatory networks for these ETS proteins. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-jpm-11-00138"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-jpm-11-00138"><title>3.1. Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Gliomas</title><p>Before analyzing the expression of genes within the ETS superfamily, we have obtained and analyzed microarray datasets corresponding to different stages of glioma from patients (grades 2&#x02013;4), using epilepsy patients as the non-tumor control [<xref rid="B31-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the transcriptome profiles of these glioma samples yielded a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the performance of the differential expression levels in discriminating the tumor cells from non-tumor cells was verified through principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>). According to the PCA analysis, it was found that, while non-tumor and glioma samples were readily separated, discrimination of glioma stages was less pronounced; grade 2 and grade 4 gliomas were relatively separate, however, grade 3 tumor samples were not clearly separated from the other tumor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Therefore, any outlier data were eliminated for differential gene expression analysis. According to differential gene expression analysis, 8402 of 19,225 genes were found to be significantly changed (with adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change &#x0003e; 0.6 thresholds) in the tumor samples (grades 2&#x02013;4) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Up- and downregulated genes in all three grades of gliomas were obtained by differential gene expression analysis, and the volcano plot was used to visualize the DEGs, which shows that the distribution of differentially expressed genes was compatible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;D). </p><p>We have next asked whether ETS genes were among the DEGs, and, if so, how their expressions were affected in different glioma stages compared to the non-tumor control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). To that end, we have focused our studies to ETS subfamilies that have been previously reported to be involved in gliomas, namely the ETS subfamily [<xref rid="B40-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], TCF subfamily [<xref rid="B43-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], ELF subfamily [<xref rid="B46-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], PEA3 subfamily [<xref rid="B27-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B48-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and TEL subfamily [<xref rid="B49-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The results showed that the expressions of ETS2 and ELK-1 were downregulated at all grades, while the expressions of ELK4, ELF1, ELK3, ETS1, ETV4, and ETV1 were upregulated at all grades; intriguingly, ETV6 and ELF4 expressions were downregulated at grade 2, but upregulated at grades 3 and 4. The expression of ELK3, ETV4, and to some extent ELK4 was found to increase gradually with glioma grade, while ETV1 expression was highest in grade 2 glioma, and progressively decreased with glioma stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). The only member of the SPI subfamily of ETS transcription factors represented was PU.1, which was previously shown to be involved in glioma progression, and its levels were indeed found to be increased with glioma grades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>E; [<xref rid="B26-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p><p>Previous microarray studies where either constitutively active Elk-1-VP16 or PEA3-VP16 was overexpressed in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells have identified a number of transcriptional targets for these ETS proteins. In order to narrow down our search and focus on gene regulatory networks of ETS proteins, we have identified overlapping genes by comparing DEGs from glioma grades 2&#x02013;4 with the microarray results from Elk-1-VP16 and PEA3-VP16 overexpressing cells; 2637 genes were found to be at the intersections of these two experiments, with 63 genes commonly regulated in both glioma tumor samples (DEGs), as well as cell line studies (Elk-1-VP16 and PEA3-VP16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>F).</p><p>To clarify the functional profiles of the identified DEGs in glioma grades, enrichment analysis was performed, and significant GO and KEGG annotations were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f003">Figure 3</xref>). For the GO enrichment analysis of biological processes, initially, up- and downregulated genes of the different glioma grades were analyzed. While the upregulated gene clusters of grades were observed with cell cycle related phenotype in all glioma grades, the downregulated gene clusters of grades showed neuronal phenotype, such as synaptic transmission, as would be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In the KEGG enrichment analysis, while the upregulated genes of glioma grades were enriched in p53, TGF-&#x003b2;, and Notch signaling pathways, prominent downregulated gene clusters fell into synaptic function related pathways, such as glutamatergic, GABAergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). For instance, the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway was found to be altered through glioma progression, as observed by an increase in the level of BMP molecules, including BMP3 and BMP4, as well as their targets, such as Smad1/5/8 and Id. Additionally, the expression of cMyc and p15 associated with cell cycle were significantly increased. On the other hand, Notch signaling pathway genes, such as Delta, Notch, and Fringe, were observed to be upregulated in glioma. The MAPK signaling pathway was found to be enriched in downregulated clusters, with the expression of genes, such as Ras, MEK1, ERK, JNK, and Elk-1, being downregulated. All of these functional enrichment analysis results confirmed that, in all of the glioma grades, cells had downregulated pathways directly related with neuronal function, but upregulated signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and survival. It is interesting to note that the grade 4 glioma samples did not exhibit significant TGF-&#x003b2; pathway upregulation, but PI3K pathway upregulation instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-jpm-11-00138"><title>3.2.

The initial network obtained using the transcriptional network inference (TNI) algorithm contained 10 ETS member regulons, 11,762 target genes, and 23,181 total interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). We have focused on the expression changes of ETS members in different grades of glioma, and regulon activity scores were calculated from the initial network. The analysis of regulon activity scores showed that, while ELK-1 and ETS2 showed high regulon activity in the non-tumor condition (magenta, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f004">Figure 4</xref>A), ETV1 showed a high activity score on mainly grade 2 glioma (green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The other ETS proteins showed high regulon activity in the grade 4 glioma cluster, however, regulon activity of grade 3 glioma was dispersed between grade 2 and grade 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). After including DEGs into the initial network using the transcriptional network analysis (TNA) algorithm, a focused network of glioma grades was constructed. According to TNA algorithm, nine significant ETS regulons were found to be enriched with different numbers of target genes. ETV1, which expressed the least significance among the significant ETS regulons, was marked in blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>To determine the direction of regulation between each regulon and its targets, two-tailed GSEA was performed, and positively and negatively regulated co-expression patterns in target gene distribution were constructed for individual ETS regulons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In this analysis, genes were ranked for their fold changes in the x-axis, and enrichment scores were given in the y-axis; the peak of each plot is the enrichment score for the gene indicated (dotted lines), while the colored bar shows the positively and negatively correlated genes. These results suggest that enriched ETS regulons have both unique and common gene targets in gliomas, as indicated by a clear separation of negatively and positively correlated targets in regulons such as ETS2 and ELK1 (unique), and overlapping negative and positive regulons, such as those of ELF4 and ELK3 (common). </p><p>The network from the TNA algorithm was filtered by DEGs from Elk-1-VP16 and PEA3-VP16 overexpression microarray results to create a much more unique regulatory network of ETS members. As a result of filtering, a final regulatory network was constructed with 3366 target genes and 6610 interactions with ETS regulons, and the gene regulatory network was visualized with Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f006">Figure 6</xref>). This network representation shows fold changes of DEGs, as well as their interaction with the ETS regulons, showing the common targets to be clustered in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f006">Figure 6</xref>). </p><p>Focusing on the functional investigation of the gene regulatory network, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis was performed with positively and negatively regulated targets of ETS regulons on the regulatory network (positive regulation indicates similar coexpression patterns, i.e., when ETS protein is downregulated, its targets are also downregulated, and vice versa). It was observed that positive and negative cluster targets of ETS regulons were enriched in biological processes, such as cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, synapse formation, and protein localization, some of which are common across members, while some are unique for one or few family member(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Tables S4 and S5</xref>). ELF1 and ELF4 regulons appear to belong to similar biological processes; ELK1 and ETS2 also were found to have targets within the same biological pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). The ETV1 regulon appears to have a distinct set of positively regulated targets, while ELK3, ELK4, ETS1, and, to some extent, ETV4 appear to regulate similar biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). This classification is not conserved for negatively regulated targets, however; here, ELF1, ELK3, ELK4, ETS1, and ETV4 appear to regulate similar biological processes, while the ELF4 regulon and ETS2 regulon each are comprised of distinct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). It is important to note that, in positively regulated targets of the ETV1 regulon, nucleosome and chromatin disassembly related processes were prominent, while no significant negatively regulated targets were identified for the ETV1 regulon. The ELK3 regulon included positively regulated targets in ECM organization, protein maturation, and processing pathways, and negatively regulated targets in synaptic vesicle signaling, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity pathways.</p><p>Similar comparative analysis using KEGG pathway enrichment showed that, unlike the GO biological processes analyzed above, distinct signaling pathways were regulated by each ETS regulon, while a positively regulated cluster of the ETV4 regulon was enriched for the MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, and a negatively regulated cluster of this protein was enriched for endocytosis and the synaptic vesicle cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,B, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Tables S6 and S7</xref>); the positively regulated cluster of ELK1 was enriched for cholinergic and dopaminergic synapses, as well as calcium signaling, while its negatively regulated cluster was enriched Hippo signaling, signaling of pluripotent stem cells, and cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,B). Interestingly, endocytosis and the synaptic vesicle cycle were common signaling pathways in almost all ETS regulons, except for ELK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f008">Figure 8</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-jpm-11-00138"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The five stages of gliomagenesis are the initial growth stage, oncogene-dependent senescence stage, growth stage, replicative senescence stage, and, finally, the immortalization stage [<xref rid="B28-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Disease stage classification and identification of stage-dependent or grade-dependent biomarkers is important in the accurate diagnosis of gliomas. </p><p>Graph complexity analysis in low-grade glioma has shown Etv5 and its network expression to be critical features of the neoplastic state [<xref rid="B27-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Unfortunately, ETV5 of the PEA3 subfamily does not appear to be significantly altered in tumor vs. non-tumor samples in the microarray datasets used in this study (data not shown). However, we have identified another PEA3 subfamily member, ETV1, to be expressed at high levels in low-grade glioma and decrease in expression in higher grades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>). ELK-1 protein is known to be a critical partner for the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer, and its expression was found to be associated with a higher clinical stage and prognostic marker of disease recurrence in prostate cancer [<xref rid="B14-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. No such distinction was apparent in our study on glioma grades 2&#x02013;4. However, we have identified ELF4 and ETV6 to be downregulated in grade 2 gliomas, and upregulated in increasing amounts in grades 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the ETS expression profile is also different in epilepsy; ELF1, ELK1, ELK4, ETS1, ETS2, and ETV1 are expressed at higher levels than ELF4, ELK3, and ETV4, and there is also variability in expression among different types of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). However, since the type of epilepsy used in the datasets analyzed in this study were not known, it was not possible to normalize for ETS gene expression (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) [<xref rid="B51-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>ETS proteins focused on in this study (namely, class I subfamilies ETC, TCF, and PEA3 and class II subfamilies ELF and TEL) exhibit little tissue specificity, and, in fact, many family members are ubiquitously expressed [<xref rid="B2-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B15-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that gene regulatory network analysis of ETS transcription factors exhibits extensive overlap of targets, confirming that functional redundancy exists at least to a certain extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f006">Figure 6</xref>). However when positively and negatively regulated targets of ETS regulons were analyzed, negatively regulated targets were found to extensively overlap (mostly related to synaptic vesicle trafficking and synaptic transmission, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>B), while positively regulated targets appeared to be selective for groups of ETS family members, with ELF1 and ELF4 comprising one class (targets in synapse pruning, immune function, and cell to cell adhesion related biological processes), ELK1 and ETS2 forming another class (targets in synapse function and synaptic vesicle trafficking related processes), and ELK3, ELK4, ETS1, and ETV4 forming a third class (targets in extracellular matrix related processes, as well as protein processing and localization, ER stress, and cell cycle related processes); ETV1 appeared to be a class by itself (targets in nucleosome and chromatin disassembly) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). These regulon classes were not directly related to ETS subfamily assignments. </p><p>Although more physiologically relevant non-tumor controls are required to fine-tune the results in the future, this is a proof of concept study that shows that expression levels of ETS genes can be used as diagnostic markers for glioma grade identification, in addition to already existing molecular markers. In addition, the gene regulatory network analysis for ETS regulons can be used to identify target gene clusters in positively and negatively regulated pathways and processes, which can help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional redundancy among family members. We propose that such network analysis can also be extended to differentiate stages of tumorigenesis in other types of tumors, as well as to developmental stages of various tissues.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank members of the AxanLab for helpful discussions.

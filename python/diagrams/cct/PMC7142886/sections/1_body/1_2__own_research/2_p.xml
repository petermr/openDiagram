<p>The structure of the test steel was bainitic-ferritic. The thermomechanical treatment of steel S700MC leads to the refinement and defecting of its structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-01312-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and supersaturation of the structure with hardening components. The thermomechanical rolling process leads to selective plastic deformation of the grain. The steel was subjected to precipitation hardening, solid solution hardening, and strain hardening. Structural changes occurring in the welded joint during cooling are described in the CCT (Continuous Cooling Transformation) diagram (

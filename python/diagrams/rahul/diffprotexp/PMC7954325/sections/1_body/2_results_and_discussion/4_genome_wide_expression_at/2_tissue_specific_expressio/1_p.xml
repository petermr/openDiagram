<p>The leaf-stage expression study showed an expression of a total of forty-seven 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic>. Out of these, thirty-four exhibited an expression value of &gt;2 FPKM. In roots, fifty-five 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> were expressed, and forty of them had the FPKM value of &gt;2. Out of these, thirty-six 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> had expression &gt;5 FPKM, and 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 25, 34, 50, and 89 had a maximum expression. Forty-eight 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> were expressed in tubers, and 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 4, 22, 34, 42, 50, 63, 68, and 89 had the highest expression. In the sepal and petal stage, fifty-one and fifty-two 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> were expressed, and out of these six 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic>, each showed maximum expression in sepal (
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 20, 25, 34, 50, 63, and 89) and petal (StbZIP 20, 25, 34, 75, 87 and 89). During the mesocarp &amp; endocarp development (fruiting stage), expression analysis revealed fifty-four and forty-four 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> with expression &gt; 2 FPKM. However, only thirty-eight 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> showed &gt; 5 FPKM with the highest expression in 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 20, 34, 42, 50, 87, and 89. Expression analysis based on FPKM suggested that most 
 <italic>bZIPs</italic> are expressed in all tissues. 
 <italic>StbZIP 25</italic> had a higher expression in root, sepal, and petals, and 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 89 and 34 had the highest expression in all tissues, i.e., root, tuber, sepal, petal, and fruit. Similarly, 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 50 showed the highest expression in root, tuber, sepal, and fruit. 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 42 showed the common highest expression in tuber and fruit (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247864.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The expression analysis suggested the tissue-specific expression of a few, and the ubiquitous expression of most, 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic>. This expression atlas can further be used to identify candidate 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> for crop improvement by developing cis/trans-genic lines. Using a similar approach, 
 <italic>CabZIP25</italic> was identified from 
 <italic>Capsicum annum</italic> and its role in imparting salt stress tolerance was shown by heterologous expression in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [

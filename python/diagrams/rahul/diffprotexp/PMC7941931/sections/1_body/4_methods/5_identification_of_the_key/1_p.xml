<p id="Par54">Expression profiles of all the DEMs target genes were analyzed by using transcriptomic data from our previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Then, the significantly different expression target genes were identified and functional analysis was performed by GO, KEGG and homologous annotation. Finally, expression correlation analysis between DEMs and differently expressed target genes was performed. The miRNAs and target mRNA pairs with 
 <italic>R</italic> ≥ 0.5 and 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 were identified, and the key miRNA-mRNA pairs for Tartary buckwheat seed development were obtained by homologous annotation of target mRNAs.

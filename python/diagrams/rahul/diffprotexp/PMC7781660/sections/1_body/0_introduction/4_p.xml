<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA with a length of over 200 nucleotides (nt). They are located in the cytoplasm or nucleus and play an important role in biological activities and disease development by regulating target genes, thereby affecting gene expression [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although a recent study reported that certain lncRNAs are able to encode small peptides [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], lncRNAs generally lack an efficient open reading frame, such that they do not perform a protein-coding function. LncRNAs tend to fold into thermodynamically stable secondary or higher-order structures that provide multiple sites within the molecule for the binding of proteins. Specific and dynamic interactions can also occur between DNA and RNA through the principle of base-complementary pairing. Some lncRNAs could be cleaved into polyA tails and promoter structures similar to mRNA and are dynamically expressed during tissue organ differentiation [

 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and in several human diseases [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Current research indicates that lncRNAs are a key regulator of viral infection and host immune responses involved in hostâ€“virus interaction [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the profiles and functional activities of lncRNAs in host cells in response to BVDV infection have not yet been elucidated.

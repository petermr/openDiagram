<p>In this study, we analyzed GEO microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes as candidate targets for further IHC confirmation. We found that the expression of Ki67 was increased according to histopathological stage, whereby high expression of KRT17 was specifically found in cervical cancer and low expression of CRISP2 was specifically observed in HSIL. Therefore, we proposed that combined analysis of KRT17 and CRISP2 expression to determine different histological stages of cervical cancer, it would be helpful for accurate histological diagnosis.</p>

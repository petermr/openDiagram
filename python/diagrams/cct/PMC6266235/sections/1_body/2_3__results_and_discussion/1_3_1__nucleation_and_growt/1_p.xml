 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f001">Figure 1</xref>a shows that reversed austenite started to nucleate when the temperature reached around 640 °C. Due to the limitation of magnification, only nucleation at the grain boundaries was observed clearly; the nucleation inside the grain cannot be presented. Theoretically, the pre-existing retained austenite were the preferable sites for austenite nucleation and growth [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-11-02127" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this investigated steel, the 5~10% retained austenite played a beneficial role in improving nucleation number. Therefore, after completion of reversed austenite transformation, the grain size was small. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f001">Figure 1</xref>b, the grain size was around 3~10 μm at the temperature of 850 °C.

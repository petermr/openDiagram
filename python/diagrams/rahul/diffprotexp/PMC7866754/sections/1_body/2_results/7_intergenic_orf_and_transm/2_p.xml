<p id="Par53">Intergenic ORFs with high-quality PSMs were then analysed to see if they have functional roles. Firstly, a BlastP search was performed on all the intergenic ORFs against the non-redundant protein sequence database, and no significant hit with expected value (E-value) smaller than 0.05 was returned, indicating that these ORFs share little or no sequence homology with known proteins. Interestingly, InterProScan detected many transmembrane domains in the intergenic ORFs from prediction by TMHMM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a), where 12 out of 34 were predicted with one or more transmembrane helices, and one of them was predicted with four helices. A similar scenario was observed in AltORFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b) as well, where 99 out of 248 ORFs were predicted to contain transmembrane domain. Such abundance suggests that these ORFs may have biological functions in the membrane, which have been previously overlooked by the conventional annotation methods. Interestingly, this scenario has previously been observed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], where over half of the novel small proteins (16–50 amino acids) identified in the intergenic region were predicted to have a transmembrane segment and also shown to co-fractionate with the membrane experimentally. Therefore, it is possible that this may be a common strategy adopted by organisms with small genomes to expand their proteome, although their exact functional roles still require experimental testing.

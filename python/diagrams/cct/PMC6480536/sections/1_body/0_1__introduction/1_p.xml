<p>An intragranular acicular ferrite (AF)-type microstructure is characterized by fine grain size and high-angled grain boundaries, which contribute to improving steelâ€™s comprehensive properties of strength and toughness [

 <xref rid="B2-materials-12-01070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Inclusion-induced AF transformation has been extensively researched and applied to various steel products. The most significant application is toughness improvement of the steel welding heat-affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal (WM) [

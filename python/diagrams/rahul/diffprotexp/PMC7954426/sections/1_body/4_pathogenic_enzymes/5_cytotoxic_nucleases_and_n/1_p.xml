<p>Mycoplasma nucleases are not only involved in the aforementioned degradation of NETs to escape the killing of neutrophils, but also have a direct pathogenic effect on host cells. For example, 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> Mpn133 can induce apoptosis-like death of A549 mammalian cells through caspase-independent mechanism [
 <xref rid="cit0132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]; 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> MG_186 can cause chromatin condensation, DNA degradation and apoptotic morphological changes [
 <xref rid="cit0133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]; similar cytotoxic nucleases can also be found in 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic> (P40), 
 <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> (Mhp379 and Mhp597) and 
 <italic>M. hyorhinis</italic>, which cause host cell damage through multiple mechanisms [
 <xref rid="cit0125" ref-type="bibr">125–127</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Moreover, the 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> strain Hubei-1 secretes a 5ʹ-nucleotidase (MMB_0636) that can utilize host nucleotides as a substrate (such as ATP or ADP), which enhances macrophage death and damages the host tissue [
 <xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The gene encoding 5ʹ-nucleotidase has also been identified in the genome of 
 <italic>M. bovirhinis</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

<p id="Par47">We carried out functional over-representation analyses to identify the biological process and pathways underpinning relevant functions related to fetal programming. The gene lists from DEG, TS, and TF analyses were queried by using ClueGO v. 2.5.7 (

 </sup>. This approach allowed us to underline specific and common biological functions within and among gene lists for each tissue. To reduce the redundancy of the GO terms, we applied the fusion of similar biological processes. Likewise, the terms were grouped based on the kappa score = 0.4. Significant results were taken considering the group

0: In this study, micro/nanoscale LiFePO  4/graphene composites are synthesized successfully using a one-step microwave heating method.
1: One-step microwave heating can simplify the reduction step of graphene oxide and provide a convenient, economical, and effective method of preparing graphene composites.
2: The structural analysis shows that LiFePO  4/graphene has high phase purity and crystallinity.
3: The morphological analysis shows that LiFePO  4/graphene microspheres and micron blocks are composed of densely aggregated nanoparticles; the nanoparticle size can shorten the diffusion path of lithium ions and thus increase the lithium-ion diffusion rate.
4: Additionally, the graphene sheets can provide a rapid transport path for electrons, thus increasing the electronic conductivity of the material.
5: Furthermore, the nanoparticles being packed into the micron graphene sheets can ensure stability in the electrolyte during charging and discharging.
6: Raman analysis reveals that the graphene has a high degree of graphitization.
7: Electrochemical analysis shows that the LiFePO  4/graphene has an excellent capacity, high rate performance, and cycle stability.
8: The discharge capacities are 166.3, 156.1, 143.0, 132.4, and 120.9 mAh g  1 at rates of 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C, respectively.
9: The superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the synergy of the shorter lithium-ion diffusion path achieved by LiFePO  4 nanoparticles and the conductive networks of graphene.

<p>DNA microarray analysis has now become a standard tool for molecular studies of cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ability to complement this approach with methods of proteomic analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] is crucial for identification of proteins that may serve as targets for new antibody-based therapeutic strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Such proteomic research is particularly important for the characterization of gene products contributing to the metastatic potential of cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Molecular screening of metastases by proteomic analysis has been done in several previous studies, including investigations of breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, there has been little proteomic analysis of clinical samples of gynecological malignancies, including brain metastases.

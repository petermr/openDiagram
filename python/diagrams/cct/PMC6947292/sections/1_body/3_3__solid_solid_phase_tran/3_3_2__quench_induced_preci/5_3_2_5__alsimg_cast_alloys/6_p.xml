 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f073">Figure 73</xref> shows that the maximum hardness achievable for the three alloys is very similar (111 to 116 HV1), and this hardness is achieved using high cooling rates in excess of ≈100 K/s [
 <xref rid="B131-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="B214-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. This result perfectly fits with those of Ref. [
 <xref rid="B49-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], in which the maximum hardness after ageing was found to occur after cooling at 110 K/s and above (average cooling rates between 450 and 200 °C). If cooling is performed at lower rates, the age-hardening potential drops significantly for the different alloys, and drops much more quickly for the fast solidified variant (with finer structure) and/or higher concentrated alloys. For instance, at a cooling rate of 2 K/s, which is a typical value for gas cooling, Al7SiMg0.3 still reaches 95 HV after ageing, while the hardness of the LBM variant of Al10Si0.3Mg drops to only around 60 HV1. Dimensional and shape distortion after quenching is very relevant for net-shaped cast products, and quenching rates are therefore often restricted to lower rates. In this case, a permanent mould cast (and less concentrated) alloy could achieve ≈150% of the strength of the LBM alloy. This finding correlates well with the discussion of the AlMgSi and AlZnMgCu wrought alloys (

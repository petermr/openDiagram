0: Retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) is a ubiquitous cytosolic DEXD/H box RNA helicase required to detect non-self RNA with important role in innate immune response against most RNA viruses including JEV and  Dengue virus (DENV) [ 25, 26].
1: Upon detection of viral RNA, RIG-I activates transcription factors such as IRF-3, IRF-7 and NF- resulting in the expression of type I IFN [ 27].
2: In turn, type I IFNs are secreted by virus-infected cells and bind to the heterodimeric type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) which is expressed by most (if not all) cell types [ 25].
3: IFNAR activation leads to the transcription of several ISG such as OASL, ISG15, ISG20 and RIG-I Itself, which play roles as antiviral effectors [ 28].
4: IFN is the single type II IFN.
5: IFN is mostly secreted by T lymphocytes and Natural Killer cells (NK) and is considered an important component of antiviral and inflammatory responses.
6: IFN is traditionally associated to protection against viral infections such as dengue [ 29], herpes and measles [ 27].

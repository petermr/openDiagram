<p>The annotated RelA gene in the hg38 assembly includes 12 exons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f008">Figure 8</xref>A). Four RefSeq annotated mRNAs have been deposited and validated; these variants include alternative splicing in exons 11 and 12. Our data extends the understanding of RelA isoforms due to the inclusion of introns 1 and 8 in distinct AS events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f008">Figure 8</xref>A). Three of the most abundant RelA isoforms (PB.6969.12, PB.6969.13, and PB.6969.5) were selected for independent validation. For this, a qualitative RT-PCR approach was developed using gene- and exon-flanking primer sets, diagrammed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f010">Figure 10</xref>, and sequences presented in 
 <xref rid="viruses-13-00218-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. hSAECs were infected in the absence (mock) or presence of pRSV (MOI = 1), and total RNA was subjected to isoform-specific RT-PCR. The PCR products were size-resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f010">Figure 10</xref>B). Notably, primer set #1 detected a major ~270 nt fragment and a less abundant 96 nt fragment, confirming the presence of occult exons contained in the first intron (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f010">Figure 10</xref>A). To validate these splice forms, gel bands were excised and sequenced independently, confirming the presence of each. For primer set #2, representing the inclusion of an exon within intron 8, a 205 nt fragment was produced. A longer 876 nt fragment was not produced, so the transcripts with inclusion of intron 11 could not be validated.

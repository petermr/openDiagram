<p id="Par5">In a previous study, we found that translocation of the freshwater mussel 
 <italic>Amblema plicata</italic> (Threeridge), whether to another river system or into captivity, induces a similar general stress response, characterized by decreased levels of metabolites involved in amino acid, polyamine, methionine, and nucleotide metabolism

 </sup>. Because mussels exhibited changes in primary metabolic pathways up to a year post-translocation, it is reasonable to infer that these metabolic changes were accompanied by changes in gene expression. However, there are few genomic resources available for freshwater mussels
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>, and while some studies have looked at the effects of environmental stressors on gene expression of freshwater mussels
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>, none have described the effects of translocation to other habitats. We sequenced and characterized the transcriptome of the freshwater mussel 
 <italic>Amblema plicata</italic> to establish the necessary molecular resources to assess transcriptomic changes in response to various experimentally-induced environmental stressors in this tolerant species

 </sup>. Here, we leverage the power of RNA-Seq in a comparative transcriptomic framework to determine how translocation into captivity changes the gene expression profile of 
 <italic>A. plicata</italic> so that we can better understand the physiology of 
 <italic>A. plicata</italic> and the effects of this common conservation technique. Specifically, the study objectives were to determine whether 
 <italic>A. plicata</italic> experience stress after 11 months in captivity, and whether changes in gene expression reveal how biological pathways are governed.

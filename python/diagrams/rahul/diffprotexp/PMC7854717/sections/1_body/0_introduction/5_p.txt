0: A number of molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain the leftright asymmetry at the heart level and in the internal organization of the amniote embryo.
1: Starting from Kartageners syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with  situs inversus15, researchers have proposed as primary leftright asymmetry determinant a mechanosensitive detection mechanism of unidirectional yolk sac fluid movement.
2: One interesting hypothesis emphasizes the role of  Pkd2 (polycystin 2, transient receptor potential cation channel), in sensing the leftward flow of fluid in the yolk sack produced by unidirectional rotation of cilia on the endodermic surface of the Hensen node 15.
3: The yolk sac fluid movement is generated by cilia rotation on the endoderm side of the primitive node, involving TRPP2 ion channels belonging to the polycystin subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP), activation of non-canonical Hedgehog pathway and asymmetrical calcium signaling 16,  17.
4: Another rare clinical condition, the Holt-Oram syndrome, associated with congenital heart defects 18, has led to an elegant demonstration using differential gene expression methods of the rheostatic control exerted by the transcriptional activator  Tbx5 in interventricular septum formation and ventricular patterning.
5: Other researchers have evidenced the role played by differential leftright expression of Nodal and bone morphogenetic (BMP) signaling pathways along the lateral plate mesoderm, leading to asymmetrical activation of transcription factors Pitx2 and Prrx1 and subsequent heart laterality in vertebrates by asymmetrical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 19.
6: Whole-cell patch-clamp studies on isolated cardiomyocytes have demonstrated the role of Notch1 signaling pathway in achievement of a mature shortened triangular ventricular action potential (AP) phenotype and the role played by various voltage-dependent K + channels (Kv) subunits and interacting proteins like KChIP2 20.

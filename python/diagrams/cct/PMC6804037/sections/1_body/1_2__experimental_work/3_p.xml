<p>The pulse frequency was kept at 15 Hz. After LSTH, the samples from the medium of the hardening line were sectioned by wire cut EDM (electrical discharge machining). The samples were prepared with standard metallographic grinding and polishing techniques and etching to observe the microstructures with the following reagent: 2% Nital’s solution (ethanol 98%, nitric acid 2%) according to ASTM E 407. Leica MEF 4A optical microscopy (Leica Microsystems, 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) with 50–100X magnification and the ImageJ software (LOCI, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA) was used for measuring the geometry features of the hardened case, i.e., width and depth of hardened case, angle of entry of hardened area; see

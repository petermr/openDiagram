<p>Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells were purchased from ATCC. The KPNA3-KO, KPNA4-KO LMH cells were generated in this study and stored in our laboratory. All these cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/F12 (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonsera, Shanghai, China) in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. The FAdV-4 strain SD was isolated and stored in our laboratory, and propagated in LMH cells. The recombinant virus FAdV-4-EGFP was generated and stored in our laboratory. KPNA3 (ab6038) and KPNA4 (ab6039) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Abcam. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3B5 against Fiber-1 and mAb 3C2 against Fiber-2 were generated in our laboratory, and mAb 1C9 against Fiber-2 was kindly provided by Professor Hongjun Chen.

0: BDNF, encoding a member of the nerve growth factor family of proteins, is a crucial regulator of neuronal growth, differentiation and survival [ 7].
1: Previous evidence in mouse and cellular models of HD revealed that mHtt not only inhibited the synthesis and release of BDNF at cortico-striatal synaptic junction [ 8], but also disrupted its post-Golgi trafficking and vesicular transport [ 9,  10].
2: A resultant reduction in BDNF supply led to a failure of trophic support, which, in turn, exacerbated striatal degeneration and motor deficits [ 11,  12].
3: However, the neuropathological mechanisms of HD attributable to low BDNF expression remained elusive.
4: Consequently, we sought to conduct a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of BDNF based on gene expression data and functional annotations, which might gain insight into the molecular roles of BDNF underlying HD pathogenesis.

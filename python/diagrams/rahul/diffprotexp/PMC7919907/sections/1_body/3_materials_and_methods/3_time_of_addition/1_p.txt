0: Drug time-of-addition experiment was performed as previously described [ 54, 55].
1: Briefly, RD cells were seeded at 1  10 5 cells/well in 12-well plate.
2: 1000 g/ml BLF was added at different time points of viral life cycle, as illustrated in  Figure 2(B): 2 to 1 h (viral attachment), 1 to 0 h (viral entry), 0, 3, 6 to 14 h (post-viral entry).
3: RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 at an MOI of 0.1 24 h after seeding.
4: Viruses were harvested at 12 hpi.
5: The viral titers were determined by plaque assay.

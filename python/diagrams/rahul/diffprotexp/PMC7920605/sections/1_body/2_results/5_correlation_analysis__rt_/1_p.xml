<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">B</xref>, joint m6A modification and mRNA expression joint analysis showed changes in m6A methylation abundance and mRNA abundance in WTAP, RIPK2, JAK3 and TNFRSF10A. Compared with the control group, the m6A methylation abundance of WTAP, RIPK2 and JAK3 in MH7A cells after TNF-α stimulation was significantly decreased, while the mRNA abundance were increased. In contrast, the m6A methylation abundance of TNFRSF10A was significantly increased, while the mRNA abundance was significantly decreased. To validate the sequencing results, RT-qPCR and Western blot were applied to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of WTAP, RIPK2, JAK3 and TNFRSF10A in MH7A cells and synovial tissues of AA rats. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression trends of these genes were in accordance with the sequencing results (

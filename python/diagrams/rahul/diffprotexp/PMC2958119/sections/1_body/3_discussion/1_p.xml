<p>To uncover the underlying mechanisms of honeybee caste differentiation, this study compared the global proteome of worker and queen larvae of the honeybee at 72 and 120 hours developmental stages. The results provide preliminary information at the protein level for future advanced molecular and biochemical investigations of caste pathway decisions on the honeybee and other related eusocial insects. The results of the proteome comparison between both queen and worker caste destined larvae at two developmental stages showed that proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production were the most upregulated proteins. This suggests that both larvae at the fast growth stage demand high energy source proteins. The results of the enrichment and biological networks analysis confirmed that proteins for antioxidation were the second most upregulated proteins and played significant roles in the formation of caste polymorphism.</p>

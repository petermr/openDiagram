0: In this study, we have analyzed the differential gene expression pattern of trigeminal ganglia (TG) from FRICT-ION mice compared to naive mice and established a potential role for the Ca v3.3 T-type calcium channel.
1: We performed behavioral pharmacology experiments using a selective Ca v3.3-blocking peptide and found that mechanical allodynia is alleviated in both male and female FRICT-ION mice.
2: Furthermore, we also show that the Ca v3.3-blocking peptide appears to be more effective in female than male mice in alleviating mechanical allodynia in our model.

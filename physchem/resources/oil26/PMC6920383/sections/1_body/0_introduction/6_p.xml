<p id="Par7">However, burrowing also sometimes affects plants negatively, as evident at newly created or recently abandoned burrows where plant cover is often greatly reduced relative to adjacent undisturbed areas

Therefore the age of burrows and excavated soil mounds could mediate their influence on vegetation characteristics with new and old soil disturbances potentially having contrasting effects on plant species and their cover, and possibly even contributing to a shifting mosaic of microhabitat conditions and plant communities within a landscape

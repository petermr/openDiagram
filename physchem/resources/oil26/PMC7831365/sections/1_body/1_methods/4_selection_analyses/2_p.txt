0: Refer to the methods of Springer and Gatesy ( Springer & Gatesy, 2018), several different branch categories were considered during selective analyses: (1) One category accounted for background branches, which are lineages with intact teeth and an intact copy of  ACPT.
1: (2) Nine branch categories to terminal branches with unique inactivating mutations (baleen whales), which lacks teeth.
2: (3) Three branch categories to terminal branches with unique inactivating mutations (pygmy sperm whale, nine-banded armadillo and aardvark), whose enamel has been vestigial.
3: (4) One branch categories were assigned for stem Mysticeti where mineralized teeth were degraded.
4: (5) One branch categories were assigned for crown Mysticeti.

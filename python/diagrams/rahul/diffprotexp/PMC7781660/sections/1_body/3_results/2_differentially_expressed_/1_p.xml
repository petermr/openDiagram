<p>Difference analysis of mRNAs expression between the E and C groups was performed using edgeR software. In order to explore the similarities and compare the relationships between the different libraries, the expression patterns of differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were measured using systematic cluster analysis (Supplementary Figure S1a, Figure S2a, and Figure S3). According to the cutoff criteria (P &lt; 0.05 and |log2FC|&gt;1), a total of 895 up-regulated genes and 696 down-regulated genes were identified in the BVDV-infected MBDK cell group (

Then, Gene Ontology (GO) categorization and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed using the online software package. To better understand the potential roles of host factors involved in BVDV infection, GO term classification statistics involved in molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes was performed for the DEGs that were up-regulated or down-regulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(b</xref>)). Of which most significantly enriched GO terms related to biological processes were cellular component organization or biogenesis, biological regulation, metabolic process, cellular process, response to stimulus, and single-organism process; the majority of DEGs in comparison group E vs. C were associated with stimulation related to cellular component, including cell, cell part, organelle, macromolecular complex, and membrane; the majority of DEGs were assigned to molecular function associated with stimulus, including binding, catalytic activity, molecular function regulator, molecular transducer activity, and transporter activity.

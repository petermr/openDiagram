 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)]. Heartwood essential oil of 
 <italic>C. decurrens</italic> was studied, it was found that 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane derivatives were the main components (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) reported that leaf oil of 
 <italic>C. decurrens</italic> from the pacific northwest, USA, was dominated by limonene (31.31%), δ-3-carene (21%) and α-pinene (9.2%) while Robert &amp; Sanko (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) proved that the oils of 
 <italic>C. decurrens</italic> from two populations in Oregon and one disjunct population in southern California were high in δ-3 carene (15.20%- 20.00%), limonene (18.21-23.62%), α-pinene (8.7-15.8%), terpinolene (5.72- 8.01%), α-fenchyl acetate (3,5- 9.71%) and cedrol (0.8- 1.2%) (

<p>Several theories have been proposed regarding congenital cholesteatoma origin, including the ‘epithelial rest theory’ [

 <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the ‘implantation theory’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although it remains unclear which theory best describes congenital cholesteatoma etiology, all theories insist that congenital and acquired cholesteatoma have different origins. Aquired cholesteatoma generally arise from a pars flaccida retraction pocket.

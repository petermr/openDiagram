0: Studies have shown that protein-coding genes (PCGs) are involved in the activation of pathways or key proteins and play vital roles in the biological processes of pituitary adenomas.
1: For example, Uraki  et al ( 19) showed that reducing the expression of MSH6 and MSH2 can directly promote the growth of pituitary tumors through the ATR-Chk1 pathway.
2: Long  et al ( 20) suggested that collagen  VI chain interacts with P4HA3 to inhibit pituitary adenoma cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt pathway.
3: The low expression of TGF- RII may be related to the development and invasion of NFPAs ( 21), and Zhu  et al ( 22) confirmed that the expression of TGF-1 and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) in recurrent tumors is higher compared with that in primary tumors, suggesting that these PCGs may be related to cell proliferation and recurrence.
4: Compared with non-invasive NFPAs, the expression levels of WIF1 and secreted frizzled-related protein 4 are reduced in invasive NFPAs; thus, WIF1 may be a potential biomarker for the aggressiveness of NFPAs ( 23).

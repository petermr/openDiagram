0: Microsatellite genotyping via fragment analysis was performed using AmpFLSTR Identifiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit run on an 3730XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Waltham, MA, USA).
1: DNA for 8 tetranucleotide repeat loci and the Amelogenin sex determination marker were identified.
2: The short tandem repeat profile generated for our cells was compared to the short tandem repeat profile for cells identified as HTR-8/SVneo (ATCC  CRL-3271TM) by ATCC  (2015) (Manassas, VA, USA).
3: The short tandem repeat profile was an exact match: CSF1PO: 12, D13S317: 9,12, D16S539: 13D5S818: 12, D7S820: 12, TH01: 6,9.3, vWA: 13,18, TPOX: 8, Amelogenin sex determination marker: X (ATCC 2015).

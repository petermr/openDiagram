<p>In a first instance, a screening of four different ILs, namely [N
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl, [P
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl, [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl and [C
 <sub>14</sub>mim]Cl, with various water-soluble organic acids in aqueous solutions was performed at 323 K to identify potential biphasic mixtures. For each IL + organic acid + H
 <sub>2</sub>O system, two initial binary mixture compositions were selected to which the third component was titrated until the system became turbid. Initial mixture compositions were of 75.0 wt.% IL in water and a 50:50 wt.% IL + organic acid (including the initial acid water content), respectively.

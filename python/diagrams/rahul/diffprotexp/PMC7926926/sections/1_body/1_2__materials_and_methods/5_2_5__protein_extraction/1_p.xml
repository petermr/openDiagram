<p>The needles and samples of the same parts of 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> seedlings with different treatments were selected for protein extraction by utilizing the phenol extraction method [
 <xref rid="B54-life-11-00177" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Tissue samples of pinus needles (stored at −80 °C before use) were weighed and ground into a fine powder. Phenol extraction buffer was added to the powdered samples, followed by sonication. The samples were centrifuged at 5500xg for ten minutes after adding Tris-balanced phenol. After centrifugation, methanol was added to supernatant and kept overnight. 8M urea was added to the overnight-kept samples to reconstitute the pallet. Later, protein concentration was estimated for each sample with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (BCA kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

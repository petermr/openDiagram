0: MCF-7 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC No.
1: HTB-22) were cultured in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 30 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer), NaHCO 3, and penicillin streptomycin.
2: The cytotoxicity of the essential oils on MCF-7 cells was determined using the 96-well MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay as reported previously [ 45].
3: Cells were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates at a concentration of 1.2  10 4 cells/well and a volume of 100 L in each well.
4: The plate was then labeled and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 48 h. After 48 h, the cells reached 7080% confluent growth.
5: The supernatant fluid was gently aspirated (without touching the bottom of the well to avoid removing cells) and replaced with 100 L growth medium that contained either 1.0 or 0.5 L of essential oil (1% in DMSO), to give final concentrations of 100 and 50 gmL 1.
6: The plate was then incubated at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 48 h. After 48 h, the liquid was gently aspirated from each well.
7: In a tube, 10 mL feeding medium was mixed with 2 mL of MTT stock solution (and was protected from light).
8: Into each well, 100 L of the MTT solution was added and the pre-read absorbance was immediately measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm (using a Molecular Devices Spectra Max Plus 384 microplate reader).
9: Formazan crystals were formed over the course of 4 h at 37 C and 5% CO 2.
10: After 4 h, DMSO was used to dissolve the purple crystals.
11: The amount of MTT-formazan produced was determined spectrophotometrically at 570 nm.
12: Growing medium, DMSO, and tingenone (100 gmL 1) served as negative, compound, and positive controls, respectively.
13: Solutions were added to wells in eight replicates.
14: Average absorbances, standard deviations, and percent kill ratios (% kill oil/% kill control) were calculated.
15: Median inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) were determined using the Reed-Muench method [ 46].

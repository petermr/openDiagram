<p>Whilst the work from Abbott and Merck has led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors of ASIC3, they have lacked selectivity. Since then, the availability of cASIC1a crystal structures, which were not available at the time of conducted research, could aide a structure-based approach, as opposed to the ligand-based approach employed so far, to develop a selective inhibitor.</p>

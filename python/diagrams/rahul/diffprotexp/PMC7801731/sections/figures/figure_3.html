 <caption> Gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at day 1 and day 3 of regeneration using DAVID database. Ontology domains comprise biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF). The GeneRation is a measure of the gene count divided by the number of genes in the total group of genes assayed that belong to the specific gene category. </caption>

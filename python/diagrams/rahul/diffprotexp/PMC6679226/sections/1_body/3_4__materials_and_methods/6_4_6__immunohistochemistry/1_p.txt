0: Paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated.
1: Heat-induced antigen retrieval was achieved by using a pressure cooker at 98100 C for 15 min in 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, followed by cooling at room temperature for 30 min.
2: Histostain-Plus Kits with diaminobenzidine as the substrate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for detection of Cxcl15 using the monoclonal rabbit anti-mouse Cxcl15 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) per manufacturers instructions.
3: Non-immune rabbit IgG (0.5 g/mL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as the control.
4: Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

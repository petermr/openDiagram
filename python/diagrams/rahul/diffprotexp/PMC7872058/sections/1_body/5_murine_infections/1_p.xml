 <sup>+/+</sup>) mice, raised on C57BL/6 N background, were used. Mice were bred in house at the National Center for Microbiology. Immunosuppression was induced with 150 mg kg−1 cyclophosphamide (Pras‐Farma, Barcelona, Spain) administered intraperitoneally, and 112 mg kg−1 of Cortisone 21‐acetate (Sigma, C‐3130) administered subcutaneously, both on day −3 and −1. On day 0, the animals were anesthetized intramuscularly with 0.1 ml of a mixture of KetolarR (ketamine 50 mg ml−1; Pfizer) and RompumR (xylazin chlorohydrate 2%; Bayer) at final concentrations of 12.5 and 2 mg ml−1, respectively, followed by the intranasal inoculation of 30 μl saline suspension containing 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> conidia per mouse. After infection, cyclophosphamide (150 mg kg−1) was used every three days until completion of the experiment.

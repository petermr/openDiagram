<p>Undoubtedly, the Li‐O
 <sub>2</sub> or Li‐air systems using SCEs would gain remarkable performance due to the small side reactions between SCEs and cathode. Whereas, the Li‐O
 <sub>2</sub> or Li‐air systems using SCEs present quite different reaction mechanism compared to that using liquid electrolyte. For Li‐O
 <sub>2</sub> or Li‐air systems using liquid electrolyte, the charge/discharge reactions occur at the solid–liquid–gas interface, while which occurs at solid–gas interface in the Li‐O
 <sub>2</sub> or Li‐air systems using SCEs. The charge/discharge reactions rate would reduce greatly due to the larger interface resistance. It is significant to develop some catalysts to promote the charge/discharge reactions and improve the reaction kinetics.

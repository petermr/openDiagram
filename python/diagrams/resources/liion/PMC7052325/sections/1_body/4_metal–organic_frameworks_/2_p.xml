<p>In 2014, Aubrey and Long first presented porous MOFs of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>(dobdc) (dobdc
 <sup>4−</sup> = 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) and its analog Mg
 <sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) (dobpdc
 <sup>4−</sup>=4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate) as solid Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> conductors (Aubrey et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These MOFs exhibited ionic conductivities of up to 2.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at room temperature after soaked in solution containing Mg salt, comparable with polymer gels. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, Mg
 <sub>2</sub>(dobdc) shows the pore size of 13 Å and Mg
 <sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) has the pore size up to 21 Å, suggesting their good ability to accommodate the ion species like Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> in high charge density. With the insertion of Mg salts, a high density of open metal sites in MOFs could capture nucleophilic anions and thus allow for the favorably free mobility of Mg ions within pores (

 <sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) impregnated with magnesium phenolates.

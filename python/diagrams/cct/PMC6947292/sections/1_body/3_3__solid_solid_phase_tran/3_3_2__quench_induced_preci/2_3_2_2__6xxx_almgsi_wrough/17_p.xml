<p>In Ref. [

 <sub>III</sub> that β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles, which are not fully dissolved during (insufficient) solution treatment, strongly influence the mechanism of nucleation and growth of quench-induced precipitates. Partly dissolved β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles may occur for instance when a solution temperature below the solvus is chosen, or a solution temperature very close to the solvus temperature with short soaking durations. In the presence of undissolved β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si at the end of the solution treatment, no additional nucleation is required with the onset of cooling, and these undissolved β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles instantaneously start to grow. This effect considerably increases the quench sensitivity of the alloy. In this way, the critical cooling rate can be increased by a factor of three, and the hardness after ageing can be reduced by about 30 % for medium cooling rates [
 <xref rid="B148-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. As an additional effect in such cases, the HTR dominates over the entire cooling rate range (

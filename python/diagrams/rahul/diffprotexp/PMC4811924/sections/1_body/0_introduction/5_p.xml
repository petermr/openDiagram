<p>We identified several proteins in sub-MIC tylosin inhibiting biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> by using iTRAQ technology in this study. The findings from the present study may provide a theoretical foundation for therapy of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm infection and provide references for finding new potential therapeutic targets.

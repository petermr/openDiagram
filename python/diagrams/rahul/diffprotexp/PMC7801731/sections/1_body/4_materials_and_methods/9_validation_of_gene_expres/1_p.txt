0: Gene expression values (Log2FC) obtained from RNA-seq data were verified using the QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) and SYBR Green I as the DNA intercalating agent.
1: A total of 7 genes were used for the analysis (see Supplementary Table  S4 online) among which there was the mortalin gene analyzed in a previous study using the same RT-qPCR methodology 28.
2: Reaction volumes comprised 12 L SYBR Green I, 0.6 L of each primer and 1 L of DNA, the rest of the volume was adjusted to 20 L with nuclease-free water.
3: The Ct values (see Supplementary Table  S5 online) were analyzed with the 2 Ct (Livak) 93 method using NADH as the housekeeping gene and the normal stage as the calibrator.
4: A total of 12 expression values from day 1 and 3 regenerating intestine were compared between RNA-seq and RT-qPCR using equivalent measuring units of Log2FC.

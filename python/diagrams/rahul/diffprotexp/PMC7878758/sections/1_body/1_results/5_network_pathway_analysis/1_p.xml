<p id="Par14">A total of 327 genes/proteins were found mapped by the Ingenuity Pathway analysis software for various canonical network and pathways of human and mouse database. The major molecular and cellular functions associated with the differentially regulated genes/proteins during regeneration are cellular assembly &amp; organization, cellular compromise, transcriptional &amp; translational regulatory genes/proteins, DNA binding protein, cellular functions &amp; maintenance and Cellular development along with structural constituent of cytoskeleton proteins. The major physiological system development and functions associated with regeneration mechanism are skeletal &amp; muscular system development, embryonic development, organ development and tissue development.</p>

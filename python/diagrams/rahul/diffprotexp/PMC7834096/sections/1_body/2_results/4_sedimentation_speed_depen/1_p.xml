 <sup>−</sup> cells expressing the different AAF variants. We induced the expression of AAF/I, III, IV, and V as described above for the preparation of EM samples. Afterward, glass tubes were filled with 5 ml of culture, kept static at room temperature and the cell density was determined directly under the surface of the culture in regular time intervals.

<p id="p0140">Finally, in the comparison of PC vs FA we observed the greatest number of differential pathways. The previously mentioned pathways (
 <italic>ATM pathway</italic> with its branch 
 <italic>Cell Survival, p53 pathway, BRCA1 pathway, Biocarta cell cycle G2M checkpoint pathway, KEGG Base excision repair pathway</italic>) followed the same regulation trends, but there were also several new pathways. These were 
 <italic>KEGG Homologous recombination pathway</italic>, 
 <italic>Nucleotide excision repair effect pathway, Reactome Mismatch repair MMR directed by MSH2, MSH6, MutSalpha pathway</italic>, 
 <italic>Reactome Mismatch repair MMR directed by MSH2, MSH3, MutS beta pathway</italic>, and specific branch of p53 pathway 
 <italic>Gene Expression DNA Replication and Repair via TP53</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All the pathways were upregulated in PC compared with FA except for the cell cycle G2M checkpoint pathway, which was downregulated. We, therefore, conclude that PC, if compared with FA, had more active double strand DNA breaks repair, nucleotide excision and mismatch repair mechanisms, but less active G2M checkpoint transition pathway.

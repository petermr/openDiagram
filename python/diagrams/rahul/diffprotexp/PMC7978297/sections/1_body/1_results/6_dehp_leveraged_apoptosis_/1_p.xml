<p>To uncover the destiny of germ cells in lagging cysts affected by DEHP, the DNA double strand break (DSB) and apoptotic processes were examined. The staining of ovarian sections showed that the double-positive of MVH and Î³H2AX (phosphorylated histone H2AX, served as a marker of DSB) in germ cells was raised by DEHP at PD3, as well as PD5 and PD7 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). In addition, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay detected that germ cells and ovarian somatic cells both underwent apoptosis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B), and the numbers of TUNEL positive cells in these cell types increased (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). These results suggested that DEHP exposure of pregnant mothers would trigger the apoptosis of pup ovarian cells.

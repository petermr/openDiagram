<p id="Par29">Furthermore, we mapped the gene network connections of tandem APA switching genes and DEGs to explore the potential links between them. We chose cell cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], endoplasmic reticulum protein processing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], cell junction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], four pathways that were reported in previous research concerning PEDV infection. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, genes clustered in either alternative polyadenylation or differential expression were mapped to four specific functional networks, while the overlapped genes are preferentially mapped as “focus” genes, such as CDK6, E2F1, DNAJC10, CANX and AKT3.

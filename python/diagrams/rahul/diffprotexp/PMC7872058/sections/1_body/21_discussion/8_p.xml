<p>Histological visualization of lungs agreed with above-mentioned results and showed that infection with 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> produced lung inflammatory responses in both murine genetic backgrounds. However, WT mice showed a significant infiltration of inflammatory cells and it was possible to appreciate destruction of blood vessels. As described before [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], an important role of TREM1 has been reported in cellular adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils and monocytes. The histological pattern of

 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice would correlate with an impaired recruitment of inflammatory cells in the lungs and an apparent decrease of tissue damage due to the absence of TREM1. Although we could hypothesize that suppression of the TREM1 pathway may be beneficial for the pathological processes associated with IPA, our results indicate a higher susceptibility to infection by 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. This agrees with fact that a right balance between moderating excessive inflammation while preserving the capacity for microbial control is required for a successful resolution of 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infections [

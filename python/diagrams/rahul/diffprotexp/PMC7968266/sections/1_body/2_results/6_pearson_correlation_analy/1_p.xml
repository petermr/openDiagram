<p id="Par38">Through above analysis, we screened the top 5 core genes (including CCNB1, KIF20A, ASPM, AURKA, and KIF23) with better diagnostic efficiency and higher prognostic value for EOC. To further explore the role of the 5 core genes, we used the GEPIA to assess the correlation between gene expression and different immune checkpoint proteins (PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, TIGIT, LAG3 and TIM-3) in EOC samples. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, CCNB1 had positive correlation with the LAG3 (R = 0.11, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.027) and PD-L1 expression (R = 0.11, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.021) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a &amp; b). KIF23 had positive correlation with PD-L1 expression (R = 0.15, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0025) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). KIF20A had positive correlation with the PD-L1 expression (R = 0.16, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.00097) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). AURKA had positive correlation with the TIM-3 (R = 0.13, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0069) and LAG3 expression (R = 0.14, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0042) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e &amp; f). The above results indicate that four in five core genes are closely related to the EOC immunosuppressive microenvironment, which may explain that they could be used as effective prognostic markers for EOC.

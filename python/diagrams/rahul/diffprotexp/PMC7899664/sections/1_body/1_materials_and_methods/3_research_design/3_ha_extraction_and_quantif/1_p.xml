<p>Mouse skin samples were weighed and homogenized in freshly made, pH optimized lysis buffer comprised of 0.15 M Tris base, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 5 mM deferoxamine, and 20 U/ml 
 <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> protease (Sigma) in a ratio of 15 µl buffer per 1 mg of tissue. Each sample was digested at 55 °C for 16 hours on a shaker at 1400 rpm. To stop digestion, the protease was denatured on a hot plate at 95 °C for 10–15 minutes. The supernatant was collected from each tissue sample. HA quantification in skin and serum samples was then performed using an ELISA-like sandwich protein binding assay as per the commercial manufacturer's instructions (Corgenix). Briefly, the assay uses microwells coated with highly specific HA binding proetin (HABP) to capture HA from the test samples. 50 μl of the samples or standards were pipetted into the HABP coated microwells and incubated for 1 hr, and an enzyme conjugated version of HABP was used to detect HA. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader and optical density was blanked against reagent reference. HA concentration in the samples was measured by comparing absorbance againt standard curve. The HA values were normalized to total protein determined from the undigested homogenate using Coomassie plus assay.

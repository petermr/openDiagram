<p>To further characterize the 40 and 47 proteins that were up-regulated in nuclei preparations from either D1 or D2 MSNs respectively, these two groups of proteins were separately subjected to annotation enrichment analysis using Perseus with Fisher exact test 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 to identify positively enriched pathways, molecular functions, and cellular components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,B). The most significantly enriched cellular components in the D1 nuclei preparation were the nucleus and nucleoplasm. Consistent with this finding, the most significantly enriched molecular functions were those expected to be in the nucleus including RNA, mRNA, transcription factor, and DNA binding. Similarly, the two most significantly enriched pathways (i.e., cell differentiation and spliceosome) were both pathways that are located primarily in the nucleus. Although the nucleus and nucleoplasm were also among the three most significantly enriched cellular components in the D2 MSN preparation, the most significantly enriched cellular component in this nuclei preparation was the endoplasmic reticulum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). In agreement with the D1 nuclei preparation, RNA binding was also among the four most significantly enriched molecular functions in the D2 nuclei preparation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). The finding that D2 dopamine receptor binding was among the three most significantly enriched molecular functions in the D2 nuclei preparation provided validation of the source of the nuclei that were isolated from the D2 MSNs. Neither of the two molecular functions that were most significantly enriched (i.e., unfolded protein and integrin binding) in the D2 nuclei preparation were significantly enriched in the D1 nuclei preparation. Similarly, none of the four most significantly enriched D2 nuclei pathways (i.e., protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, inositol phosphate metabolism, protein folding and maturation) were enriched in the D1 nuclei preparation.

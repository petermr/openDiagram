0: Water vapor adsorption and desorption experiments were carried out by exposing the resulting mineral film to 0.495% RH in the reaction cell at 25  1 C. A 250 mL/min flow of water vapor of controlled pressure was first generated by mixing predetermined proportions of humid N 2(g) and dry N 2(g) using a humidity generator module (proUmid MHG32).
1: Water vapor pressures were continuously monitored by a sensor equipped with the module and a nondispersible infraRed device (LI-7000, Licor Inc).
2: A separate deuteration exchange experiment ( Figure S6), in which birnessite was suspended in D 2O(l) for 3 days, showed that the intercalated water populations were all responsive to changes in chemical gradient.

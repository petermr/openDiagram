<p>To determine the direction of regulation between each regulon and its targets, two-tailed GSEA was performed, and positively and negatively regulated co-expression patterns in target gene distribution were constructed for individual ETS regulons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In this analysis, genes were ranked for their fold changes in the x-axis, and enrichment scores were given in the y-axis; the peak of each plot is the enrichment score for the gene indicated (dotted lines), while the colored bar shows the positively and negatively correlated genes. These results suggest that enriched ETS regulons have both unique and common gene targets in gliomas, as indicated by a clear separation of negatively and positively correlated targets in regulons such as ETS2 and ELK1 (unique), and overlapping negative and positive regulons, such as those of ELF4 and ELK3 (common).

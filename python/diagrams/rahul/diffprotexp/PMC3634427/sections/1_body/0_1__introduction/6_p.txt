0: The present work includes a proteomic study on the effects of the different treatments and the effects of these on  in vitro shoots of two potato species.
1: Moreover, we analyzed the amounts of soluble sugars that, combined with the proteomics approach, show some of the metabolites that undergo changes under different preculture conditions.
2: Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of combined study (proteomic and targeted metabolites analyses) compares  S. tuberosum with its frost-tolerant relative,  S. commersonii, to highlight some common and different mechanisms in response to abiotic stress.

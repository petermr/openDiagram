<p>Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was carried out on an Ettan IPGphor Manifold (GE Healthcare) in an IPGphor unit (GE-Healthcare) with the following protocol: 300 V for 2 h, gradient to 1000 V over 2 h, 1000 V for 2 h, gradient to 2000 V over 2 h, 2000 V for 2 h, gradient to 4000 V over 4 h, 4000 V for 2 h, gradient to 8000 V over 4 h, 8000 V, until ~120,000 V h were reached at 20 °C, with a maximum current setting of 50 μA per strip. After equilibration, reduction and alkylation of cysteines using DTT and IAA, respectively, the strips were placed on 12.5% acrylamide precasted gels (Serva Electrophoresis, Heidelberg, Germany). The SDS-PAGE step was performed in an Ettan DALT Twelve separation unit (GE Healthcare).</p>

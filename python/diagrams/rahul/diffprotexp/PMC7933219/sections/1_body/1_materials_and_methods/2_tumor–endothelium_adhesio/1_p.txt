0: HUVECs were cultured in 96-well dishes coated with 1% gelatin.
1: When HUVECs reached an approximate confluence of 100%, PC-3M cells were washed and resuspended in culture medium (10 5 cells/ml).
2: One hundred microliters of the tumor cell suspension was added to HUVEC monolayers in 96-well dishes and cocultured with HUVECs for 30 min at 37C.
3: At the end of the incubation, the wells were washed three times with PBS to remove adherent and non-adherent PC-3M cells ( Andrews et al., 2001).

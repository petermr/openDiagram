0: The four D1 and four D2 nuclei pellets were each resuspended in 250 L resuspension buffer with DyeCycle Ruby (1:1000; Invitrogen) for 1 hr on ice.
1: Nuclei were then sorted with a BD FACSAriaTM cell sorter equipped with 640-nm and 488-nm excitation lasers and an 85 m nozzle.
2: Nuclei were gated by two criteria: the presence of a GFP signal above the background fluorescence level (as assessed by comparison with nuclei obtained from a wild-type littermate mouse) and the signal from DyeCycle Ruby corresponding to single nuclei.
3: Sorted nuclei (i.e., about 80,000 for each biological replicate from two mice) were collected in 100 L of resuspension buffer, centrifuged for 5 min at 2000  g, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 C. To assess the purity of the isolated nuclei, the sorted nuclei were imaged at 40 with a fluorescence microscope using 640-nm and 488-nm excitation lasers.

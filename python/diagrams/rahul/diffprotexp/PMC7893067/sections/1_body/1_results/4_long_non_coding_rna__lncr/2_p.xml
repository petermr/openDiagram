<p id="Par14">To further understand how subcellular localization of lncRNAs varies between different tissue types, we explored the subcellular distribution of lncRNAs in 10 cell lines from the ENCODE project. In this analysis, we only focused on lncRNAs that showed significant subcellular localization in either the cytosol or the nucleus in the brain samples. Although we found an overlap of lncRNAs between the subcellular compartments, there were many lncRNAs that exhibited differential subcellular localization between the brain samples and the cell lines (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). A range from 35 to 69 lncRNA displayed differential localization between the brain and each of the different cell lines (Supplementary Table 7), such as 
 <italic>LINC00672</italic>, which was cytosolic in the brain and nuclear in 7 out of 10 cell lines. The lncRNAs 
 <italic>RP11-452F19.3</italic> and 
 <italic>RP11-449H11.1</italic> were nuclear in the brain and cytosolic in 5 and 3 different cell lines, respectively. We also found that many of the lncRNAs that display differential localization between the brain and cell lines differ within the different cell types (Supplementary Table 7). These results further support that subcellular localization of lncRNAs is often tissue specific. The lncRNAs that displayed similar localization patterns between the brain and cell lines are listed in Supplementary Table 8.

0: Fe 2+ chelating capacity was evaluated as described by Smeriglio et al.
1: [ 37] with some modifications.
2: Briefly, 25 L of FeCl 24H 2O solution (1.8 mM) was added to 50 L of sample solution (range 607.5 g/mL) and incubated at RT for 5 min.
3: Following, 50 L of a ferrozine solution (4 mM) was added to the reaction mixture, and the sample volume was diluted to 1.5 mL with deionized water.
4: After that, the mixture was vortexed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.
5: The absorbance was read at 562 nm using an UV/VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601).
6: The inhibition (%) of Fe 2+ chelating capacity was calculated using Equation (1).

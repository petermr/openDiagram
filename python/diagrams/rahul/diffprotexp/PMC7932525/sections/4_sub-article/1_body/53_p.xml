<p>� As a result of our study, we reached the conclusion that N-fixation occurs in vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 by comparative transcriptome analysis and histological analysis. Knowledge of the nature of the heterocysts of blue-green algae has been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for investigation of the physiology and biochemistry of these puzzling structures. Some successful technique for the isolation of heterocysts of Anabaena cylindrica was all based on ‘differential cell disruption’. Therefore it is difficult for us and all related researchers to separation of NDV and NDH to acquire the intact vegetative cells to study the N-fixation function.</p>

0: Interaction associations of the proteins encoded by the DEGs were extracted from the STRING online database ( https://string-db.org/) and were used to generate PPI networks of medium confidence (interaction scores > 0.40) for each tissue [ 68].
1: The genes in the PPI network are represented as nodes and the interactions between nodes are edges.
2: Nodes with a high number of edges (aka degrees) are defined as hub genes that likely have highly influential biological functions.
3: The Cytoscape plug-in CytoHubba was used to identify hub genes through degree method (top 10 genes with 10 degrees).
4: We then identified subnetworks within PPI networks using ClusterONE, a Cytoscape plugin that finds densely connected regions that can be considered protein complexes.
5: We only included significant ( p < 0.05) subnetworks with a minimum of 10 nodes.
6: A GO enrichment analysis was performed on DEGs in subnetworks.

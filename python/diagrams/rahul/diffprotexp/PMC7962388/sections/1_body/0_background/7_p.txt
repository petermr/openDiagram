0: All the above-cited contributions have partially disclosed the nature of numerous apomixis candidates and evidenced the effects of polyploidy on gene expression.
1: However, our knowledge on the chronological modulation of transcript levels along the sexual and the apomictic reproductive routes remained limited, since previous studies were conducted on samples collected at a particular timeframe or on mixed pools representing a group of developmental stages.
2: Under these experimental limitations, either part of the DETs go undetected or those experimenting expression increments at different developmental stages for contrasting reproductive modes are mistakenly classified as non-differential.
3: Moreover, the plus/minus orientation of the expressed transcripts remains globally unexplored, even when some apomixis candidates ( ORC3,  PsACR/H5,  PsACR/H.13) display antisense differential expression [ 39,  59].
4: The lack of comprehensive data prevents researchers from grasping the true dimensions of heterochronic expression and antisense regulation affecting apomixis development as well as from inspecting their biological consequences.
5: The objective of this work was to gain a quantitative, statistically significant, massive characterization of sense/antisense transcripts expressed across four crucial reproductive steps in sexual and apomictic  P. notatum and, after reciprocal comparisons, produce a detailed picture of the main molecular pathways operative during apomixis.

 </sup>). The effect of the interaction between microsite and burrow age was tested, but was never significant and is therefore not reported. Chi
 <sup>2</sup> tests were used to determine whether common species (occurring &gt; 3 times in a dataset) were non-randomly distributed across the different microsites. In the arid site burrow entrances were excluded from Chi
 <sup>2</sup> tests due to differences in sample area.

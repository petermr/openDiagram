<p>Antiviral activities of BLF or HLF against 229E, NL63 and OC43 were tested in CPE assays as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, cell cultures at near confluency in 96-well plates were infected with 100 µL of viruses at desired dilutions and incubated for 1 h. Unabsorbed virus was removed and different concentrations of LF (0, 3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.3, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 µg/ml) were added. Remdesivir was included as a positive control. The plates were incubated for another 3–5 days when a significant cytopathic effect was observed in the wells without compound (virus only). Cells were stained with 0.1 mg/ml neutral red for 2 h, and excess dye was rinsed from the cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from the cells with buffer containing 50% ethanol and 1% glacial acetic acid. Plates were read for optical density determination at 540 nm. Readings were normalized with uninfected controls. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined by plotting percent CPE versus log
 <sub>10</sub> compound concentrations from best-fit dose response curves with variable slope in Prism 8. Toxicity of LF at each concentration was determined in uninfected cells in the same microplates by measuring neutral red dye uptake.

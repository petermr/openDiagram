<p id="Par48">Cochleae from three biological replicates from three different age groups, P3, P14, and P30 were solubilized to extract proteins that were first digested with LysC endoprotease followed by a second digestion with trypsin. Each digest was separated into 14 fractions using SCX and analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS. Spectral counts were used to quantitatively differentiate between proteins among different ages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A total of 3176, 1620, and 1666 protein were identified on P3, P14, and P30, respectively. All proteins identified from each age group are listed in Additional file

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> show that P3 relative to the other ages has the largest number of proteins unique to its age, while there are 1197 proteins common between the three age groups. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine differential expression protein candidates on P3, P14, and P30 cochlear sensory epithelium. There was a statistically significant effect of age on protein expression (df = 15,

There were 25 proteins differentially expressed between P14 and P30 as compared to 359 and 389 differentially expressed proteins between P3 and P14 and between P3 and P30, respectively (Additional file

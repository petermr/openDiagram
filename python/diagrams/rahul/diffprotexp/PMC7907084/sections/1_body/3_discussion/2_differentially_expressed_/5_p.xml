 </sup>. DHCR24 regulates cholesterol homeostasis through catalyzing the reduction of the delta-24 double bond of sterol intermediates during cholesterol biosynthesis

 </sup>. Lanosterol synthase (
 <italic>LSS</italic>) is the key four-ringed intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis, which can convert the (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to a protosterol cation and subsequently to lanosterol
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. DHCR7 is the enzyme that removes the c (7–8) double bond in the B ring of sterols and catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. All these genes showed a higher expression level in Gd cells than in Gp cells, strongly supporting the existing hypothesis that Gd cells have a higher capacity in steroidogenesis such as progesterone synthesis than Gp cells

<p>Glioma is one of malignant tumors which can cause an adverse effect on the brain and spine.
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Mixed tumors, ependymoma, oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma are four common subtypes of this kind of tumor.
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The treatment methods of glioma focus on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. These methods can improve the physical condition of patients. However, the infiltrative growth characteristics and chemotherapy resistance of glioma have brought challenges to the treatment of glioma.
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In response to these challenges, scientists have conducted in-depth research into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma development and progression. Even so, the uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying glioma development and progression were limited so far.
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular and biological mechanisms of glioma progression will help us to develop new therapeutic and prognostic approaches.

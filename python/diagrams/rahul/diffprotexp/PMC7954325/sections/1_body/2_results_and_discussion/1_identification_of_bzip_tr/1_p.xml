<p>The genome-wide analysis resulted in identifying a total of 90 potato StbZIPs using a combination of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile PF00170, a search against the whole potato proteome using Ensembl database by HMMER3.0, and BLASTp search using 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, maize, rice, and barley bZIP sequences. Each potato bZIP protein was assigned a unique identifier from StbZIP1 to StbZIP90, and the information on StbZIPs is depicted in 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247864.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Since the cultivated potato (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.) is highly heterozygous and presents challenges in genome analyses and breeding, the information derived from diploid potatoes genomic resources will aid in the identification of gene variants such as copy number variation, single nucleotide polymorphism, and genomic-enabled development of inbred diploid potatoes and improvement of cultivated tetraploid potatoes.

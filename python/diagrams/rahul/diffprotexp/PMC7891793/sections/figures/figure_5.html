 <caption> Cluster of functionally connected GO terms in lung lesions (LL) and their associated genes in the comparison of treatment group 6 to group 2. Differential gene expression analysis in LL across treatment groups revealed DE genes only in treatments group 6 versus 2. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of this gene list (p&lt;0.05) was conducted and results were visualized as a map of predicted connections among significantly enriched GO terms and related genes. </caption>

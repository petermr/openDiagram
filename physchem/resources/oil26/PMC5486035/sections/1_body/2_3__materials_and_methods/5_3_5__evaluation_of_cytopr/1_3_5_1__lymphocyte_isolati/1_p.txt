0: Lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized whole blood collected from healthy volunteers, who provided written medical histories through a standardized questionnaire and had not taken anti-inflammatory medication or nutritional supplements.
1: Blood samples were diluted with equal volumes of balanced salt solution, layered over Histopaque-1077 in centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 400  g for 3040 min at 25 C. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer was removed with a pipette and washed by centrifugation.
2: The PBMCs were passed through a Percoll gradient according to Repnik et al.
3: [ 39] to enrich the fraction in lymphocytes.
4: Lymphocytes (viability > 90%) were counted on a haemocytometer and suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin G and streptomycin.
5: Cell concentration was adjusted to 1  10 5 cells/mL.

  <p>Flow chart of experimental design. Parameters for the development of topical formulation for 4-MU delivery were selected based on standard pharmacology of topical applications. Central composite design was used to define formulation parameters and local optima. Response surface methodology was used to generate a regression equation that predicts HA decrease, which was optimized using genetic algorithm. The optimal formulation was then validated 
   <italic>inÂ vivo</italic> for its effect on HA levels.

<p id="Par36">We further used the cytoHubba to identify hub genes in PPI network according to the topological algorithm maximal clique centrality (MCC). To identify more interested genes, we selected the top 20 genes for further analysis, which were also included in cluster 1(Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Then, the genetic information of the 20 hub genes were shown through the cBioPortal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b &amp; c). These genes were altered in 154 (50%) EOC samples or patients. PBK (9%) and AURKA (9%) were altered most frequently. Meanwhile, amplification accounted for the highest percentage of these alterations.

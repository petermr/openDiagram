0: The survival analysis for overall survival and disease-free survival is determined by generating Kaplan-Meier (KM) plot using the GEPIA server.
1: It is a web server for analyzing the RNA sequencing expression data of 9,736 tumors and 8,587 normal samples from the TCGA and the GTEx projects ( Tang et al., 2017).
2: On the other hand, the KM-plot for disease-specific and overall survival of these genes in the TCGA COAD dataset is performed using the UCSC Xena server.

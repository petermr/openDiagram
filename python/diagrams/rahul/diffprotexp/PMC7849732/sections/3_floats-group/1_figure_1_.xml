  <p>Immunohistochemical staining approach to identify the CGRP+ SDH region and study GluN2 subunit distribution. Left) Laminae I and IIo of the superficial dorsal horn (SDH) are immunopositive for punctate CGRP (red) staining, labeling the relatively nociceptive-specific marginal region of the SDH. Middle) Co-labeling with an antibody against a specific GluN2 subunit (GluN2B here, yellow) is performed on the same spinal sections stained for CGRP. Right) Overlay of CGRP and GluN2B immunostaining. The marginal SDH that is CGRP-positive is outlined (white line), and then GluN2 subunit immunoreactivity is described and quantified in this CGRP+ SDH region in comparison to the remaining deep dorsal horn (DDH) laminae. Scale bar: 200 μm</p>

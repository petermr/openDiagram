0: Calcium channels and prostanoid mediated vasodilation was studied following the protocol detailed by Li et al.
1: [ 55].
2: Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 5M;  n = 6), and to explore the role of calcium channels in the vasorelaxant effect, endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca 2+-channel type VOC, verapamil (10 5 M;  n = 6) and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+-ATP ase (SERCA) inhibitor, thapsigargin (10 7 M;  n = 6) for 20 min prior to contraction with phenylephrine (10 6 M), then, the cumulative concentrationresponse curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.

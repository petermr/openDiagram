<p id="p0155">It is important to note that the pH value of the electrolyte could be one of the important parameters that may cause the dissolution and redeposition of cobalt components. The pH value of the electrolyte (2 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> + 0.2 M MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>) is ∼5 (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), a mild acidic environment under which the cobalt components (e.g., Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>) could be unstable (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gayer and Garrett, 1950</xref>). As indicated in previous reports, the electrolyte pH of Zn-ion batteries may vary due to the intercalation/de-intercalation of H
 <sup>+</sup>. In a system with a large volume of electrolyte (e.g., 10 mL, experiment shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E), the intercalation/de-intercalation of H
 <sup>+</sup> is not significant enough to largely influence the pH value. Decomposition of Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> was observed only after five CV cycles (1.0–1.85 V, 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S16</xref>). However, in a coin-type battery with a small amount of electrolyte (200 μL in each of our battery), the pH value of the electrolyte could be significantly increased after being fully discharged (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). The pH increase after the first discharge to 1.0 V was evidenced by the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate (which only forms in high pH environment) on the cathode surface, as confirmed by XRD analysis (

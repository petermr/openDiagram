<p>Even if the sulfate groups of carrageenan are completely ionized at pH values greater than 2.8, a variation in pH in the 3 รท 7.3 domain determines the occurrence of a net osmotic pressure between the inner and the outer environment of the hydrogel. This difference (more significant at pH values of three and four) determines molecular restructuration, modifying the free volume accessible to penetrant water molecules and leading to an increase in swelling (

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">According to Masmoudi, Le Dr&#233;au,[<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] modifications could be observed to the conductivity values of the emulsions before seeing the instabilities of the systems. Studies by Bernardi, Pereira[<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] observed modifications to the conductivity values of the emulsions before seeing the instabilities of the systems. The studies by Abdullah, Abdulkarim[<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and Mahmood and Akhtar[<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] attributed the continuous increase of conductivity values to the process of coalescence of the internal phase. This was followed by a reduction, which may be attributed to phase separation. Nevertheless, F1 and F2 presented an increase in conductivity during all the experiment, and they were the only formulations that did not have a decrease in conductivity during the period of 180 days [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 3</xref>]. Furthermore, F2 showed a lower value in conductivity than F1 and a better stability.</p>

<p>Negative affection of process behavior and near net shape quality with increased CTWD is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f009">Figure 9</xref>f. Herein, the combination of the reduced frequency of droplet transfers and increased welding velocity of 0.6 m/min led to partial wetting of the previously set layers. This resulted in inhomogeneous layer geometries during the manufacturing process. Throughout these dimensional deviations in layer height, the arc ignition after the short circuit phase as well as the arc length was affected constantly. The unstable welding process was insufficient for WAAM processing. As a result, the described properties for near net shape quality could not be met.

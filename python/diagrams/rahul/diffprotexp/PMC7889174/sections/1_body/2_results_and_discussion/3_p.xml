 <italic>Lineage-specific proteins dominate metazoan NEA protein cohorts</italic>. Firstly, a cohort of 50 NEA proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>) identified initially in rodents [
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and subsequently in several human cell lines [
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42â€“45</xref>] were used as queries. We distinguished three groups (see Methods). Group A (13 proteins) are highly conserved across eukaryotes indicating an origin predating the LECA, and thus likely to support universally required functions. Gene ontogeny (GO) analyses for Biological Process revealed that these proteins are mostly involved in lipid metabolism (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4</xref>), consistent with this interpretation. Group B (eight proteins) includes proteins present only in amorphean groups, i.e., Metazoa (including mammals), Fungi, Apusomonada, and Amoebozoa. GO identified these proteins as mainly related to transcription. Many of Group B may have been lost due to saprophytic or parasitic lifestyles in which the host is able to provide these requirements, as indicated on the specific losses within the Amorphea that collectively exemplify sculpting. Group C (29 proteins) comprises proteins restricted to Metazoa, suggesting an origin in a recent ancestor. NE and membrane (NE and/or ER) associated proteins in this group partake in a variety of general functions and we observe an enrichment in proteins involved in the lipid metabolism, RNA processing (including ribosomal, messenger RNAs and non-coding RNAs such as t-, sn- and piwi-RNAs) and ion transport. Additionally, several proteins stand out as being involved in complex processes characteristic to metazoans: in innate immune response, such as Tmem173/NET23/STING [
 <xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and tissue differentiation and development, such as NET37 in skeletal muscle development [
 <xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], Mospd3 in heart development [
 <xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], Nepro in neurogenesis [
 <xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]; and multiple other proteins with tissue specific functions at the nuclear envelope that appear critical for healthy tissue maintenance (Wolframin, Tmem201, Emerin and Nesprin/SYNE proteins, see below). This participation of the NEA proteins in cell/tissue differentiation is commonly accompanied by functions in signal transductions, highlighting the importance of this set of proteins in triggering signaling pathways such as MTOR, Wnt, MDA-5, Notch, kinase cascades, etc. Moreover, transcriptional regulation is a common function in the cohort, influencing regulation of RNA polymerases (I and II) such as Noc2l which acts as a transcription corepressor [
 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], Wdr43 which is needed for activation of promoters and favors transcription elongation [
 <xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], Int1 [
 <xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], Zmiz1/2 [
 <xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and Rprd1b/1a which are transcriptional regulators of RNA polymerase-II transcription [
 <xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

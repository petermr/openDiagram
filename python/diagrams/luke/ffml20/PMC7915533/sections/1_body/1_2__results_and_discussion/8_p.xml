<p>Tedaniophorbasin B (
 <bold>2</bold>) was isolated as a fluorescent yellow gum. A mass ion (MH
 <sup>+</sup>) at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 266.0706 (Δ 0 ppm) was consistent with 
 <bold>2</bold> possessing a molecular formula of C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>11</sub>N
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>S. Its 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-19-00095-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were almost identical with that of 
 <bold>1</bold>, with the most notable difference being the absence of the NH
 <sub>2</sub> resonance at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 9.05. The COSY (

 <sub>3</sub>/C-2, C-4; 6-NH/C-8, C-9a; H-7/C-5a, C-8; and H-8/C-7, C-9a) correlation data for 
 <bold>2</bold> was identical with that observed for 
 <bold>1</bold>, indicating that the two molecules possessed the same molecular framework. Considering that the molecular formula for 
 <bold>2</bold> differed from 
 <bold>1</bold> by the replacement of a NH
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> with an oxygen, the most logical explanation is that 
 <bold>2</bold> is the 2-oxo derivative of 
 <bold>1</bold>. The structure proposed for tedaniophorbasin B (
 <bold>2a</bold>) is also supported by 
 <sup>13</sup>C DFT (GIAO) NMR calculations (MAE = 1.3, compared to MAE = 3.2 for the 6-S, 9-NH regioisomer (
 <bold>2a′</bold>) (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-19-00095">supplementary material</xref>)). Tedaniophorbasin B is therefore the 2-oxo derivative of 
 <bold>1</bold> and contains a novel 2-oxo-1,3-dimethyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-1
 <italic>H</italic>-[1,4]thiazino[3,2-g]pteridin-4(6

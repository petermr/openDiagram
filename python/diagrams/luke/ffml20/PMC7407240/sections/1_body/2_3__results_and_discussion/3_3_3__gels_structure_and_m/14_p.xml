<p>In drug delivery, polymer matrix-guest molecule interactions are determinant for the release profiles. For PVA, diffusion is controlled by the chemistry of the release medium (ionic strength and nature of the present chemical species (kosmotropes, chaotropes)), which enhances or disrupts the hydrogen bonding in the hydrogel. Supplementary, by adding Î¹-carrageenan to PVA additional electrostatic interactions could be promoted between the completely ionized sulfate groups and the antibiotics, as a function of the pH of the release medium.</p>

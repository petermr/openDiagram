 <sub>50</sub> profiles showed 713-MtzR had consecutive gains in drug susceptibility at week 4 (P8) and week 8 (P16) upon cessation of drug selection, while the 106-MtzR line displayed its lowest Mtz susceptibility at week 4, then Mtz resistance equivalent to parental MtzR lines at week 8. Given that large changes in PTM proteins were detected between MtzS and MtzR isogenic lines (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), total protein lysate from MtzR lines at weeks 4 and 8 was probed for fluctuations in PTM networks upon cessation of drug selection (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, panel B). KAc, K-MMe, and pY networks showed significant fluctuations between MtzR-P0 and MtzR-P8 and MtzR-P16, as well isolate-specific variations between 713- and 106-MtzR. There were changes in the intensity of modifications of H3 and H4 variants for both lines. In 106-MtzR, both histone variants at 4 weeks without Mtz had increased KAc and K-MMe, while by 8 weeks KAc and K-MMe modification levels still remained higher than MtzR selected lines on the H3 variant. In 713-MtzR, H4 KAc levels decreased, while H3 modifications were stable at 4 and 8 weeks. Together, these suggest that the cessation of Mtz exposure caused significant changes to epigenetically linked modifications.

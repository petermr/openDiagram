 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto</italic> was maintained through a dog-sheep life cycle in our animal house. Local strain dogs were purchased from farmers around Shihezi city. Before the study, the dogs were confirmed not to be infected with 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> by ELISA. Each dog was orally administered 200Â mL CE cyst fluid extracted from the fresh liver CE cysts of naturally infected sheep in a slaughterhouse in Shihezi. After 45 days of infection, feces were collected and smeared on a glass slide to observe the ovulation cycle of the eggs.

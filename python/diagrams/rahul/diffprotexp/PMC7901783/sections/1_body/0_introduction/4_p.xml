<p>Small RNAs (sRNA) are non-coding RNAs that classified into micro (mi)RNA and short interfering (si)RNA with the size of 21–24 nucleotides and a preferential 5’ terminal base [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The miRNAs have incomplete complementarity with their targets and are cleaved through incorporation of DCL1 and AGO1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The siRNAs are excised from dsRNA that have perfect base-pairing with their target and are processed by association of different DCL, AGO, and RDR components [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Natural antisense siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) are generated through cleavage of endogenous dsRNA into 21 or 22nt by DCL4 or DCL2, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs) are comprised of 24nt dsRNA via cleavage of DCL3 and mediating of AGO 4/6/9. Hc-siRNAs are involved in silencing of heterochromatic, repetitive regions, coding sequences, gene promoter regions, and transposable elements via RNA-directed (PolIV) DNA methylation and histone modification. RDR2 is also recruited in the process to generate dsRNA to enhance siRNA biogenesis [

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Determination of differentially expressed miRNA and/or siRNA upon virus infection identifies major candidate small RNAs silencing viral genes. These candidates in combination with transcriptome profiles provide a comprehensive source of genes, miRNAs, and siRNAs as potential targets for enhancing plants resistance against viruses.

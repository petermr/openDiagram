<p>Based on the importance of splicing associated with 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations, we characterized abnormal splicing and potential association with clinically relevant features of MM. We observed a significant difference in novel splicing sites in the pooled normal samples compared to all other groups, suggesting that there is a general increase in aberrant splicing in MM. In addition, there were clear differences in aberrant or alternative splicing in the different translocation groups. In our ongoing quest to refine the classification of MM subgroups, the identification of an association of t(4;14) samples with less aberrant splicing and the t(11;14) subgroup being associated with more aberrant splicing was of particular interest.

 </sup> Patients that have the less aggressive t(11;14) and have high novel splicing had no change in their OS. In the t(4;14) with high novel splicing (top 20%), the OS is significantly poorer, suggesting that there is an ultra-high risk group of t(4;14) with increased alternative splicing which showed some association with high-risk features such as LOH and double- hit. However, in the case of OS, it was the increased splicing which was the most significant. Although increased splicing is not exclusively associated with aggressive disease, these results provide evidence that changes to a cell's splicing as either a mechanism or result of other adverse features may suggest a more aggressive phenotype that may need to be treated differently.

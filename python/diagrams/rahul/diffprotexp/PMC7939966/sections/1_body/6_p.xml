<p>DEGs of 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> were assigned an Entrez Gene ID and subsequently classified into 3 domains: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). Classified DEGs were subdivided further into various gene ontology (GO) terms under each of the domains. In the 12 hr pi group, DEGs were assigned to 10 subcategories in BP, 8 subcategories in CC, and 23 subcategories in MF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-kjp-59-1-67">Fig. 2</xref>). During the 12 hr endosymbiosis, 17 genes in ‘regulation of transcription’ (domain: BP), 30 genes in the ‘nucleus’ (domain: CC), and 37 genes in ‘DNA binding’ (domain: MF) were determined to be the most upregulated genes. Within the CC domain, 200 downregulated genes were involved in the GO term ‘integral component of the membrane’. In the 24 hr pi group, DEGs were subdivided into 29, 13, and 41 GO terms under BP, CC, and MF domains, each respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-kjp-59-1-67">Fig. 3</xref>). In the BP domain, 26, 39, and 32 genes from the GO terms ‘regulation of transcription’, ‘intracellular signal transduction’, and ‘cyclic nucleotide biosynthetic process’ were drastically downregulated, each respectively. In the CC domain, similar to the 12 hr pi 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic>, 270 downregulated genes were involved in the GO term ‘integral component of membrane’. In the MF domains, downregulated genes associated with the GO terms ‘zinc ion binding’ and ‘protein kinase activity’ were 57 and 42, respectively. From each of the domains, 26 genes from ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’ (domain: BP), 30 genes from the ‘nucleus’ (domain: CC), and 40 genes from ‘DNA binding’ (domain: MF) were mainly upregulated.

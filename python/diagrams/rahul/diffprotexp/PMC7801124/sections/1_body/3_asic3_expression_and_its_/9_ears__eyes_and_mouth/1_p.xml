<p>In addition to playing a key role in the somatosensory system, ASIC3 is also expressed in certain sensory organs. For example, in mice ASIC3 is expressed in cochlear spiral ganglion neurones and the organ of Corti [

 <xref rid="cit0141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], as well as in the vestibular afferent neurones of rat [
 <xref rid="cit0142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. With regard to the function of ASIC3 in hearing, ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice have normal hearing at birth, but go on to develop hearing loss (4 months post birth); however, the mechanism for this early-onset hearing loss and any potential role of ASIC3 is not fully understood [
 <xref rid="cit0141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Functioning auditory capability of mothers is essential for them to respond to vocalization of their pups. The auditory frequency of mice is reduced from 2 to 90 kHz measured in WT mice, to 4–32 kHz in ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup>, which was coupled with a reduction in maternal care and pup social development (e.g. reduction in anogenital sniffing, whisker to whisker and push under interactions), phenotypes that were accompanied by reduced serotonergic transmission in the hippocampus, striatum, midbrain and brainstem [
 <xref rid="cit0143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Lastly, ASICs may also contribute to the ototoxic action of aminoglycosides, such as neomycin and streptomycin. This is because aminoglycosides reduce the desensitization rate of the ASIC-like currents in mouse spiral ganglion neurones, i.e. Na
 <sup>+</sup> influx is maintained for a longer period, and a known side-effect of these drugs is ototoxicity associated with persistent Na
 <sup>+</sup> entry [

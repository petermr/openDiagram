  <title>Phylogenetic tree of StbZIPs.</title>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree with representative bZIPs of each group from 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, maize, barley, and potato (denoted using red, blue, purple, brown, and green stars, respectively) was constructed using the Neighbor-joining (NJ) method by MEGA 7 with 1000 bootstrap values. The StbZIPs were categorized into 11 groups and are shown by colored branches A to I, S, and U.

<p id="Par51">The total proteome for P3, P14, and P30 was analyzed using the Gene Ontology database to determine biological processes, cellular localization, and molecular function. All categories were counted non-exclusively, when a protein has more than one category for biological process, cellular localization, and molecular function. Cellular localization analysis of these three proteomes shows a significant number of proteins found in the cytoplasm, organelle, and membrane (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). On P3, P14, and P30, 66, 70, and 71% of proteins are in the cytoplasm, respectively, 73, 74, and 72% of proteins are in organelles, respectively, whereas 38, 41, and 43% of proteins are localized in the membrane, respectively. In contrast, the least number of proteins are localized in the cilium and vacuole. GO shows that on P3, P14, and P30 1, 2, and 2% of proteins are in the cilium, respectively and 2, 3, and 3% of proteins are localized in the vacuole, respectively. Molecular function analysis shows that the most highly expressed proteins on P3, P14, and P30 include binding proteins (60, 62, and 61%, respectively), specifically nucleotide (21, 22, and 22%, respectively) and nucleic acid (18, 18, and 15%, respectively) binding proteins as well as proteins involved in catalytic activity (36, 38, and 38%, respectively) (Fig.

The GO analysis for biological processes shows that the most highly expressed proteins on P3, P14, and P30 are involved in cellular processes (72, 76, and 76%, respectively), metabolic processes (57, 60, and 58%, respectively), and biological regulation (47, 48, and 47%, respectively) (Fig.

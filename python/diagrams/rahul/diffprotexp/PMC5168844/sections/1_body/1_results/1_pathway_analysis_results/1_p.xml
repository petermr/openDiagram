<p>For each cancer type, we find representation of five out of twelve “target pathways” in our sample of 132 proteins using “GO” clustering tool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; they are the PI3K signaling pathway, Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, RAS signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. It is interesting to note that all these five “target pathways” are all related to “cell survival” function.

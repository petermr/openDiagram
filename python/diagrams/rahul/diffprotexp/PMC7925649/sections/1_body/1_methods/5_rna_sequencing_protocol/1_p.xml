<p id="Par10">Total RNA quality assessment was done using BioRad Experion Automated Electrophoresis Station (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) and quantified using Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit) (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sample libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat # 20020594) and TruSeq RNA Single Index Set A Index (Cat # 20020492) (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Two rounds of purification were performed and during the second elution the RNA was fragmented and primed for cDNA synthesis. DNA was subjected to end repair, A-tailing and adapter ligation. Post ligation cleanup was performed using AMpure XP beads (Agencourt, Beverly, MA, USA). DNA fragments were amplified using PCR and purified using AMpure XP beads (Agencourt, Beverly, MA, USA). The quality of the amplified libraries was checked on an Agilent 4200 Tape Station System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the D1000 Screen Tape Assay. The libraries were standardized to 2 nM, equal volumes of these libraries were pooled, and then the pooled library was sequenced using 100 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Samples were demultiplexed using Casava (v1.8, Illumina)

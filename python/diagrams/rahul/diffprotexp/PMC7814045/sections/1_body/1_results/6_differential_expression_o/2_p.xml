<p id="Par17">The snoRNAs are involved in different biological processes including rRNA modifications, maturation, and splicing. Interestingly, although all of them are known to be involved in the ribosome biogenesis, specific roles for some of them have been reported. snR17B, that is revealed upregulated at 45 min, is one of the two box C/D snoRNAs U3 (snR17A, snR17B) that are required for cleavage of the primary rRNA transcript

 </sup>. Moreover, the snR10, snR30 (box H/ACA), and snR128 (box C/D), that are all downregulated at 120 min, are also involved in the cleavage of the primary rRNA transcript

 </sup>. Furthermore, loss of snR10 results in slow growth, impaired production of ribosomal small subunits, loss of pseudouridylation at positions 2919 (which occurs in the A loop), and a reduced rate of protein synthesis

 </sup>. This gene is also associated to cells with higher susceptibility to osmotic and cold stresses

 </sup>. In addition, also snR191 is downregulated at 120 min. This H/ACA snoRNA guides pseudouridylation at positions 2258 and 2260 in the large subunit rRNAs. These two modified bases are the most conserved pseudouridines from bacteria to human rRNAs. In yeast, the presence of this snoRNAs and of the conserved pseudouridines is not essential for viability, but it is discussed to provide a small growth advantage in cells placed in competition with cells that lack these features

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. It is assembled with the core domain of Cbf5p, Gar1p, Nop10p, and Nhp2p proteins

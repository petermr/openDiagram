<p>B16F1 cells exposed or not to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU were seeded in a sterile 96-well culture box (Corning, NY, USA); after 10-12 h of incubation, the medium was removed and incubated again for 1h at 37 °C with 0.83 mg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of MTT (3 (4.5 dimethylthiazol) 2.5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). We removed the MTT excess MTT, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Merck, Branchburg, NJ, USA) to help to dissolve the formazan crystals. The wells were read at 560 nm on a GloMax
 <sup>®</sup>-Multi Detection System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s specifications. To determine the diluted formazan crystals’ proportionality with the number of viable cells, we constructed a calibration curve using six serials 1:2 dilutions from 8.0 * 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells. Each well-read read under the same conditions. We assessed population doubling time following the reported protocol [

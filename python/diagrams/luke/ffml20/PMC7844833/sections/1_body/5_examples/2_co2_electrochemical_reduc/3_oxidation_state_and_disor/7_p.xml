<p>The evolution of the Cu oxidation state in electrochemically deposited Cu films, the role of the initial state of the electrode, and that of the electrolyte were studied also by Velasco-Velez et al.

 </sup> using Cu L
 <sub>2,3</sub> and Cu K-edge XAS. It was shown that a Cu
 <sup>0</sup> electrode is stable under reaction conditions in KClO
 <sub>4</sub> but may get partially oxidized to Cu(I) in the presence of the CO
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated KHCO
 <sub>3</sub> electrolyte. Electrodes prepared initially in the Cu(I) state got mostly reduced to Cu
 <sup>0</sup> under CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions; however, a weak contribution of Cuâ€“O bonds was discernible in Cu K-edge EXAFS. Electrodes that were initially in the Cu(II) state got reduced to Cu(I) and then Cu(0) in KClO
 <sub>4</sub> but formed an inert and stable carbonate layer in KHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, as obtained from EXAFS data fitting, making it inactive for catalytic processes.

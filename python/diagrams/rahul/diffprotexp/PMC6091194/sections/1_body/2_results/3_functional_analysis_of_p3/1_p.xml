<p id="Par53">To determine whether there were any significant changes between P3 and P14 developing sensory epithelia, we used IPA to gain insights into function. All IPA analyses are found in Additional file

 <bold>:</bold> Table S4) found that, within the physiological system development and function category, 22% associate with tissue development, while 35% associate with organismal survival. Within the disease and disorders function category, many of the proteins associate with hereditary and developmental disorders. A similar IPA analysis of P3 downregulated proteins (Additional file

 <bold>:</bold> Table S5) shows that a majority associate again with tissue development, whereas 62% associate with neurological disease in the disease and disorders category. IPA analyses determining the function of proteins exclusively expressed on P3 and P14 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>
 <bold>:</bold> Tables S6 and S7) show that survival and embryonic/nervous system development proteins (35 and 33%, respectively) are important on P3. Similarly, 75 and 100% of proteins exclusively expressed on P14 associate with tissue morphology and tissue development, respectively.

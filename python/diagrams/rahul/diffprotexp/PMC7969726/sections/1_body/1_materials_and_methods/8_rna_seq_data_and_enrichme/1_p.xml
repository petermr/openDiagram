<p>Total RNA was extracted from HepG2.2.15 cells transfected with CPSF1 or scrambled siRNAs. Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kits (Illumina) and subjected to 150 cycle paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Each group was sequenced in three replicates. Quality control and preprocessing of the sequencing data were performed using fastp-0.20.1 (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Patro et al., 2017</xref>) and gene models were generated in BED format. Wiggle files indicative of read coverage were generated by GenomeCoverageBed (BEDTools, v2.26.0) after sequence alignment by STAR-2.7.0f (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). Then, APA event analysis was performed using DaPars (version 0.9.1) to predict proximal polyadenylation sites and distal polyadenylation sites (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>). Significant APA events were determined using three criteria. First, the 
 <italic>P</italic>-value of the PDUI differences should be &lt;0.05. Second, the absolute mean difference of the PDUI must be ≥0.2. Third, the mean PDUI fold change must be ≥1.5. For functional analysis of the transcripts, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) gene sets were analyzed using DAVID

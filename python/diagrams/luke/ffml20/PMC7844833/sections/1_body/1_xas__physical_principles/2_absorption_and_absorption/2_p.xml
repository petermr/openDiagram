<p>The absorption of any portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is described by the Beerâ€“Lambert law that states that the intensity of the radiation after the sample (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>T</sub>) is exponentially reduced as the sample thickness 
 <italic>d</italic> is increased in comparison to the intensity of the incident radiation (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) due to the interactions of the incident photons with atoms in the material

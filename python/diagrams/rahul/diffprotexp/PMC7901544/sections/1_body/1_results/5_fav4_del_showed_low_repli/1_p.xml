<p>To test the viral replication ability of the rescued FAV4_Del, the LMH cells were infected with FAV4_Del and wild type FAdV-4 at 0.01 MOI, respectively, and the viral growth kinetics of the two viruses in the LMH cells were compared. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6a</xref>, the FAV4_Del replicated significantly slower than the wild-type FAdV-4. The viral titer of FAV4_Del was about 100 times lower than that of the wild type FAdV-4 at 24 hpi-120 hpi. Notably, the peak titer of FAdV-4 could reach to 6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml whereas that of FAV4_Del was only 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at 96 hpi. This data was confirmed by IFA and western blot analysis. As described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6b</xref>, a lot of specific immunofluorescences could be found in the LMH cells infected with FAdV-4 but only a few immunofluorescences could be detected in the LMH cells infected with FAV4_Del at 96 hpi. In the western blot, the Fiber-2 protein in the LMH cells infected with FAdV-4 could be easily detected at 24 hpi, 48 hpi and 72 hpi whereas that in the LMH cells infected with FAV4_Del was barely detectable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6c</xref>). All these data demonstrate that the N-terminal 7–40aa of Fiber-2 significantly affect the viral replication of FAdV-4 in LMH cells.

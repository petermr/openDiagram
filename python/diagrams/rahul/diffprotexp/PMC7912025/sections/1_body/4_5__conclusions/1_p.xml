<p>In conclusion, we apply SMRT sequencing to understand the role of mRNA processing in the IIR to RSV infection. A high-quality curated transcriptome of hSAECs was generated and alternatively processed isoforms quantitated by short-read RNA sequencing. RSV infection induces differential polyadenylation of transcripts important in protein and mRNA processing, affecting signal recognition, translation, and nonsense mRNA decay pathways. Strikingly, a number of DIU events are observed corresponding to genes controlling the cell cycle and type I IFN pathways. We validated a number of novel isoforms of the master regulators of the IIR, RelA and IRF7. These DIU events primarily include exon inclusion, exon skipping, and intron retention. Our data provide a foundation for a further understanding of the role of mRNA processing in controlling the activation and termination of the IIR to RSV infection.</p>

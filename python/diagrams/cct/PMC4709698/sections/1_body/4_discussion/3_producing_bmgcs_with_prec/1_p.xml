<p>In order to test our hypothesis of a quasi-equilibrium for the present alloy system, we have synthesized a variety of alloys with compositions ranging from BT0 up to BT95 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). If the quasi-equilibrium as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> exists than for a rod diameter above 10 mm, the volume fraction of the glassy phase and β-Ti should be predictable by applying the lever rule. The composition of the glass should be Ti
 <sub>32.02</sub>Zr
 <sub>30.13</sub>Cu
 <sub>9.01</sub>Co
 <sub>4.84</sub>Be
 <sub>24.00</sub> (BT0) and that of the dendrites Ti
 <sub>60.58</sub>Zr
 <sub>36.11</sub>Cu
 <sub>2.30</sub>Co
 <sub>1.01</sub> (BT100). Therefore, the crystalline mole fraction,

<p>H9C2 cells were cultured under different conditions, then removed the culture medium and washed twice with PBS, digested by trypsin. The cells were centrifuged at 800 g, and resuspended with 200 µL PBS and transferred to a new centrifuge tube. The centrifuge tube was placed in an ice bath and lysised. The ANP concentration was determined according to a Rat ANP ELISA Kit (CUSABIO). All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>

<p>Despite its significance in mammalian enamel maturation, very little is known about 
 <italic>ACPT</italic> evolutionary trajectory, relationship and function in mammals. To address this issue, we carried out a series of evolutionary analyses on 
 <italic>ACPT</italic>, aim to uncover the evolutionary pattern of 
 <italic>ACPT</italic> gene among mammalian lineages.

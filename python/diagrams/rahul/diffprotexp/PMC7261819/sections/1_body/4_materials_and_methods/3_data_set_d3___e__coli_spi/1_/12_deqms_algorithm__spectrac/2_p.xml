<p>In proteomics, a major determinant of quantification accuracy per sample, and therefore also of effective within-group variance, is the number of PSMs or peptides detected for a protein. We therefore modified the IBMT function of Sartor 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) by changing the regression covariate from intensity to PSM or peptide count. In our DEqMS package, this modified IBMT function is called “spectraCounteBayes.” For TMT or iTRAQ labeled data, the number of PSMs is used to estimate prior variance as the quantification is done at MS2 level. For label-free data, the protein abundances are summarized from peptides and therefore the number of peptides per protein is used to estimate prior variance. The remainder of the package provides wrapper functions to conveniently tie in this function with the necessary calls to limma's functions.

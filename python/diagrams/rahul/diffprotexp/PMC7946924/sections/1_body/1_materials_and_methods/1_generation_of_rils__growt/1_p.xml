<p id="Par5">The recombinant inbred lines (RIL) of rice 
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L
 <italic>.</italic> used in this experiment were generated by cross breed of IR73963-86-1-5-2-2 and CR 2324-1 as parents and subsequent development of a mapping population. Of the two cultivars, the first one was selected from a lot of tropical japonica derived NPT line, with high general combining ability, whereas the second was a potential aromatic culture from ICAR-National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), Cuttack. Moderately large number of F2 population was generated from the cross and these lines were maintained using Single Seed Descent (SSD) up to F9 population. At this population level RIL genotypes were selected for the study viz., CR 3856-62-11-3-1-1-1-1-1–1 (SR 157) and CR 3856-63-1-1-1–1-1-1-1 (SR 159) (Photo 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) with contrasting grain filling patterns, i.e., high percentage of spikelet fertility in the former and low fertility in the latter. The RIL cultivars were grown in the irrigated field conditions of NRRI during the wet season of 2017 with recommended agronomic practices.

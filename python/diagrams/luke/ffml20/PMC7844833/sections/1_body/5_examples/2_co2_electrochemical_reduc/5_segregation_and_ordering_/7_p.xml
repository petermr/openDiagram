<p>CuAg alloys were also investigated for applications in CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR. Despite the fact that Cu and Ag have minimal miscibility, which results in strong segregation,

 </sup> several reports describe that the addition of Ag may enhance the selectivity of Cu toward C

 </sup> For example, in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref252">252</xref>), electrodeposited Cu and CuAg samples with different morphologies were analyzed. Addition of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole (DAT) during the electrodeposition changed the morphology of the Cu and CuAg samples from polycrystalline to wire-like. CuAg samples with wire-like morphology exhibited enhanced activity and selectivity for CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR to C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub> and C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>OH with respect to that of polycrystalline CuAg and similarly prepared Cu samples. The difference in the atomistic structures of polycrystalline and wire-like CuAg became apparent after the analysis of

  <xref rid="fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref>
 </xref>d,e). While for the polycrystalline sample no Ag–Cu bonding was detected (thus, Cu and Ag were completely segregated in this sample), significant interaction between Ag and Cu and a more homogeneous distribution of these metals were observed for the wire-like sample. The EXAFS fits indicated a Ag–Cu coordination number of ∼2 for this sample, and a contraction of the Ag–Ag distance as a result of Ag alloying with Cu. The observed Ag–Cu alloying in this sample is believed to be responsible for its superior catalytic properties.

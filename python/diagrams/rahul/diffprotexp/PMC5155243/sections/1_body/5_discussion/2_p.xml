<p>MT is metal-binding protein involved in diverse processes, including metal homeostasis and detoxification, the oxidative stress response and cell proliferation. Aberrant expression and silencing of these genes are important in a number of diseases

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> showed that MT might play an important role in antagonizing DU-induced nephrotoxicity, however, Ecker

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> that, yeast metallothionein conferred resistance to copper and cadmium, but not to uranium (data not showed). We think the difference may be related to species, exposure time and concentration. Michon 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> that, 5 moles of U (VI) could be complexed by 1 mole of MT. In fact, though MT is the metalloprotein with low binding site density, MT could significantly alleviate depleted uranium-induced nephrotoxicity. In addition, 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> MT-1 appeared to be important for DU accumulation

<p>We agree that the cell-type specific impacts could be either primary or secondary, and are likely to be driven by complex interactions between cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous signaling.

We hope our findings spur further future work. We also agree that this should be referred to as progenitor maturation, and updated the text accordingly. The text below from the Discussion now addresses this point:</p>

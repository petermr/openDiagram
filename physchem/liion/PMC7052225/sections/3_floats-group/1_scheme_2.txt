0: Scheme 2Schematic of new method developed for the fabrication of self-standing electrode films.
1: The first step is the formation of a carbon current collector made of cellulose fibers and VGCF.
2: The second step is the formation of a Li-ion electrode directly on the carbon current collector (red color refers to PTCDA cathode material).

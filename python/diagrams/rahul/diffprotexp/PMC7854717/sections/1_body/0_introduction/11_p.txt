0: Gene Ontology Consortium ( www.geneontology.org) and Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes ( https://www.kegg.jp) were used to select the genes encoding ion channels and transporters (ICT, 199 genes) and genes involved in the following pathways: adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes (ASC, mmu04261, 104 genes), calcium signaling (CAS, mmu04020, 121 genes), cardiac muscle contraction (CMC, mmu04260, 65 genes), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (GLY, mmu00010, 50 genes) and oxidative phosphorylation (OPH, mmu00190, 111 genes).

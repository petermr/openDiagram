<p>Combined with the findings from our previous studies [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we propose that in a mixed biofilm, the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> polysaccharide matrix, the increase in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> matrix components, and interactions 
 <italic>via</italic> secreted chemical moleucles, create a protective environment advantageous to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, the work presented provides novel mechanistic insights into interspecies interactions in biofilms, with important clinical relevance. We expect the novel findings from this study to further our understanding of the enhanced pathogenesis and resistance of biofilm-associated polymicrobial infections, which may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these complex infections.

0: TG/DTA 6300 (The Seiko Instrument, USA) thermo gravimetric analyzer was used for monitoring continuous weight change of root powder due to drying, volatilisation and gasification and followed a linear heating program.
1: The DTG and DTA curves were recorded in terms of percentage weight loss per minute and temperature difference in mV (for DT).
2: Powder sample (7.34 mg) was heated in a platinum crucible under the furnace atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 C/min up to the final temperature performed of 800 C. The -Al 2O 3 (6 mg) was used as a reference material.

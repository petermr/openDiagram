0: Six differentially expressed proteins (VATA, GPDA, HSP70, 1433Z, ALF, and UCHL1) were randomly selected for further verification using Western blotting.
1: Total protein from both wild type and RGE-treated flies were extracted using lysis buffer and concentrations determined (as described above).
2: Equal amounts of proteins (4050 g) were resolved on 12% polyacrylamideSDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) using standard methods blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (NFDM; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) freshly made in TBS-T [Tween-Tris buffered saline: 0.1% Tween-20 in 100mM TrisHCL (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl], rock on a rotating shaker for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4C.
3: The membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies (dilution 1:1,000 in TBS-T/1% NFDM) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4C, washed three times of 15 min each with TBS-T, and then incubated for an additional 1.5 h with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilution 1:2000 in TBS-T/1% NFDM) at 37C.
4: The levels of selected proteins were visualized using an ECL system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA).
5: The Western blots were performed in triplicate, and the target protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry using Image J (version 1.50) (National Institutes of Health, MD, USA) processing software and normalized to the signal intensity of GAPDH.

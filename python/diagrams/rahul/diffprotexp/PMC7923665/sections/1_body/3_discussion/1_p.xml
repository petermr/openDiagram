<p id="Par34">Transcriptomic analysis of nidus tissue of human cerebral AVM reveals upregulation of the retinoic acid target angiogenic gene CYR61 in the AVMs and the astrocytes in and around the cerebral AVM nidus. The upregulation of CYR61 was associated with increased expression of ALDH1A2 protein, a key rate-limiting enzyme of retinoic acid signaling pathway. This novel finding indicates the role of astrocytes in modulating angiogenesis in the brain parenchyma around AVM.</p>

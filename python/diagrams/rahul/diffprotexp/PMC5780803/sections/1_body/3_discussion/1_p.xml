<p>XIAP has been revealed to be an important regulator of cell apoptosis. The overexpression of XIAP may reduce the sensitivity of RCC cells to apoptosis induced by extrinsic or intrinsic factors, and may provide favorable conditions for tumor cell survival and development. Inhibition of XIAP by a chemical inhibitor or siRNA has been reported to reduce the growth of tumor cells (

 <xref rid="b34-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) discovered that XIAP and its E3 ligase serve an important function with regards to regulating cyclin D1 expression in tumor cells. Through the E3 ligase activity, XIAP may be a generalist in cancer development. This suggests that when XIAP is used as a target molecule for the treatment of RCC, the possible synergistic effects and side effects of the non-apoptotic biological functions of XIAP in tumor therapy require consideration.

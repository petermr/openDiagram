 <caption> LINC00466 facilitates PPP1R14B expression by inhibiting miR-137. ( A) VENNY plot of the predicted target mRNAs of miR-137; ( B) Differential expression of miR-137 in Tumor and Normal of TCGA-GBM/LGG; ( C) The survival curves of PPP1R14B expression level to the prognosis of patients, high-expression group was defined as red line, and low-expression group was defined as blue line; ( D) The expression level of PPP1R14B in glioma tissues and adjacent normal tissues; ( E) The target binding site between miR-137 and PPP1R14B and the results of dual luciferase assay; ( F) The co-immunoprecipitation of miR-137 and PPP1R14B in T98G cells was evaluated by RIP assay; ( G) The relative expression levels of LINC00466, miR-137 and PPP1R14B in different groups of T98G cells. </caption>

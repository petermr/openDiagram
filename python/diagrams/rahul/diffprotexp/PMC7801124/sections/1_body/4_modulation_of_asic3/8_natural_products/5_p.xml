<p>So far all herbal compounds described are inhibitors, but lindoldhamine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9g</xref>), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid extracted from 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic>, has been shown to generate sustained currents in both rASIC3 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.2 mM) and hASIC3 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.77 µM) expressing cells at pH 7.8, as well as greatly potentiating acid-evoked transient currents at pH 5.5 and 5.0, for rASIC3 and hASIC3, respectively [
 <xref rid="cit0222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. Additionally, it was shown that potentiation of hASIC3 transient amplitudes by lindoldhamine (1 mM) was greater under basic conditions (pH 8.5 compared to 7.4).

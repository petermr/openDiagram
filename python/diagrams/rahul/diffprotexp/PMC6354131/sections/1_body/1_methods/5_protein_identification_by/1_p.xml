<p id="p0035">MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis of protein spots was conducted on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Framingham, MA, USA). Differentially expressed protein spots were excised from the 2-DE gels and washed with water before digestion. Digestion and peptide extraction were performed according to previous methods.

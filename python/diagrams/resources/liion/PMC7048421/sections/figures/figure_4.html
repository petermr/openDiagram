 <caption> Comparison of cycling stability at 60°C. ( A and B) Capacity retention and DCR of the SEB cells versus the baseline LIB cell during cycling at 60°C. The cells are charged with CCCV protocol at 1 C to 4.2 V with a cutoff current of C/20 and then discharged at 1 C to 2.8 V. ( C and D) Discharge curves of the fresh SEB cell versus aged cell. </caption>

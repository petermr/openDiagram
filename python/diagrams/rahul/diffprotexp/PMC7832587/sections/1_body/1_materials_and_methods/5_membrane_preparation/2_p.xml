<p>Frozen cell-pellets from large-scale cultures were resuspended in 1 mL of TES buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 0.6 M sorbitol) per gram of cell-pellet, supplemented with PIC and 1 mM PMSF. The cells were broken with 0.5 mm glass beads using the planetary mill Pulverisette 6 (Fritsch). The broken crude extract was recovered and the beads were washed with 1.5 mL of ice-cold TES buffer per gram of cell-pellet. The pH of the broken cells was adjusted to 7.5, and centrifuged at 1000 
 <italic>× g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 20 000 
 <italic>× g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C to obtain the second pellet (P2). The resulting supernatant from the previous step (S2) was then centrifuged at 125,000 
 <italic>× g</italic> during 1 h at 4°C, obtaining the third pellet (P3). P3 pellet was re-suspended in 0.2 mL of HEPES-sucrose buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0,25 M sucrose) per gram of cell-pellet. Aliquots of all membrane pellets were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C. An appropriate amount of membranes containing the desired total protein amount was mixed with loading buffer containing urea, heated at 30°C during 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.

<p>Here we report that type I and type II IFNs have distinct roles in experimental SLEV infection. We observed that type I IFNs are crucial for the control of SLEV replication and disease development. In contrast, IFNÎ³ deficiency confers a slight protection to SLEV-infected mice. Susceptibility to SLEV infection is associated to failed ISG induction, including of the innate immune sensor RIG-I.</p>

<p id="Par30">However, there are several notable limitations of this study. First, although protein dysregulations in the prefrontal cortex of the stressed rats were identified, the precise functions and roles of these proteins behind such aberrations need to be further explored to obtain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of stress resiliency and stress-induced depression/anxiety. Second, it is important to further investigate the expressions of these phenotype-associated differential proteins in the prefrontal cortex tissues of patients with depression and anxiety for translational research.</p>

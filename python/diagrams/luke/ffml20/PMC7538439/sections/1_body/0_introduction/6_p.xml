<p id="Par8">Any machine-learned potential should conserve energy, and therefore be based on a Hamiltonian (the potential). Forces are guaranteed to be conservative if they depend on translational and rotational invariant quantities: the “fingerprint” of each atom. We are interested in molecular phases here, so our potential specifies which atoms are “bonded” and allows stretching but not breaking of bonds.</p>

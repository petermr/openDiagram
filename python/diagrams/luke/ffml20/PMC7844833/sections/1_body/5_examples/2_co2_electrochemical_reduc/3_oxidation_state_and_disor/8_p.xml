<p>The presence of specific anions can also affect the stability of Cu(I) species and the catalyst performance. In ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref423">423</xref>), nanostructured Cu catalysts prepared by cycling electropolished Cu foils in the presence of Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, Br
 <sup>–</sup>, I
 <sup>–</sup>, and CO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> anions were investigated. While EXAFS analysis of all samples under CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions showed a predominantly metallic structure, the HERFD-XANES method, more sensitive to the oxidation state of the catalyst, showed that Cu(I) species are present in some of the halide-modified catalysts. An especially high concentration of Cu(I) species was observed for the iodine-modified catalyst, where linear combination analysis of the HERFD-XANES data showed that ∼15% of Cu remained in the Cu(I) state (ca. 8% as Cu
 <sub>2</sub>O and 7% in CuI state). A positive correlation between the amount of Cu(I) species detected by HERFD-XANES, and the yield of C
 <sub>2+</sub> products was observed.

 </sup> In another recent study that focused on the effect of halide ions, Cu
 <sub>2</sub>O microspheres were electroreduced in the presence of iodine, which resulted in porous Cu structures. When exposed to CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions, this catalyst yielded a significantly improved selectivity for C
 <sub>2+</sub> products as compared to pristine metallic Cu. Analysis of the 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> EXAFS spectra suggested that the structure of the porous Cu catalyst is predominantly metallic, but the amplitude of the spectral features (Cu–Cu coordination number) was reduced due to strong disorder or the presence of a small fraction of nonreduced species.

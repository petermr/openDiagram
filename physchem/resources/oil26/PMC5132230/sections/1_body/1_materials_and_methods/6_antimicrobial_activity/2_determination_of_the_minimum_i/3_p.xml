The orifices of the microplate were filled with 50 &#956;L NaCl and 50 &#956;L of solution OE <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suaveolens</italic>. Then serial dilutions were made from 100 to 0.048 &#956;g.mL<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, 50 &#956;L was distributed suspensions of microorganisms in each well of the microplate. As a positive control, it was used amoxicillin (50 &#956;L.mL<sup>-1</sup>). There were performed the control of the culture medium, EO control and the negative control (4% DMSO). The microplates were incubated at 37&#176;C for 24h. The experiments were performed in triplicate. The MIC was considered the lowest concentration of EO which was not displayed microbial growth. The presence of turbidity in the wells indicated microbial growth and therefore there was no antimicrobial activity.</p>

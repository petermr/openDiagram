<p id="Par35">The expression heat map of all DEMs as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c. Among these DEMs, 26, 18, and 9 miRNAs displayed specifically high expression at the initial filling stage, peak filling stage, and initial maturity stage, respectively. Twelve miRNAs exhibited high expression at both the initial filling stage and peak filling stage. Notably, the expression of 9 novel miRNAs (fta_novel_miR17–25) was sustained growth during seed development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). To verify the results of miRNA sequencing, quantitative stem-loop RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression level of 9 DEMs during Tartary buckwheat seed development. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the results were broadly consistent with those obtained in miRNA sequencing.

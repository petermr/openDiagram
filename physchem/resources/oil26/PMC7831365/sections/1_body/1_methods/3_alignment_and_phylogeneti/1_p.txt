0: The 116 mammalian  ACPT sequences were aligned based on their amino acid translations using online PRANK ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/webprank/), and then deleted the gaps and non-homologous regions by using GBLOCK, then we corrected the multiple sequences alignment (MSA) in MEGA 7 ( Kumar, Stecher & Tamura, 2016) by eye.

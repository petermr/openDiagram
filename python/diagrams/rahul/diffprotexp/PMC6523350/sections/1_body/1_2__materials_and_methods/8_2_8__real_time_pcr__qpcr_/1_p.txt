0: Some differential proteins were selected to perform the mRNA expression level verification in order to validate the iTRAQ results.
1: Total RNA was extracted in accordance with the Trizol kits operating manual procedures and system.
2: 1 g of total RNA was taken and reversely transcribed into cDNA.
3: The cDNA was served as a template.
4: Real-time PCR internal reference gene (actin primers) were used in Q-PCR amplification to verify the mass of cDNA.
5: The reaction conditions were (95 C, 1 min, 1 cycle); (95 C, 15 s, 60 C, 40 cycles).
6: The experiment was repeated thrice, and the relative expression was calculated by 2 Ct.

 <caption> ( A) Scanning rate ranges of different DSC devices and the quenching dilatometer; ( B) related sample dimensions and masses (in the case of Al samples). In order to make the broad dynamic range easier knowable the cooling rate axis is complemented by the durations of cooling, which are needed to cover the temperature range of 540 to 20 Â°C (typical for the age-hardening of Al alloys). </caption>

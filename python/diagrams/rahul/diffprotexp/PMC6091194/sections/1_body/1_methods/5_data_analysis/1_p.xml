<p id="Par42">Sequences were assigned using the MASCOT search engine version 2.3 (Matrix Science) against the UniProt database (2012.01) selected for 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (108,308 entries). The parent and fragment ion maximum precursors were set to ±8 ppm and ± 1.2 Da, respectively. The search included a fixed modification of carbamidomethyl of cysteine and variable modifications of oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation. A maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. Scaffold (Version 4.3.2, Proteome Software) was used to validate peptide and protein identifications. Peptide and protein identifications were accepted if they were greater than 95 and 99% probability, respectively, and contained two or more identified peptides. Peptide assignments were also manually verified by inspection of the tandem mass spectra. In addition, a false discovery rate (i.e. false positives) was determined using Scaffold using the empirical method by counting the number of reverse or randomized hits and dividing by the number of forward hits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Proteins were eliminated when identified as a contaminant, such as keratin. Proteins identified in all three replicates were reported. In Scaffold, spectral counts were normalized to the sum of all spectral counts prior to statistical analysis to observe significance. The data were exported from Scaffold and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferonni test using Statistica software (Version 12, StatSoft, Inc.). Proteins between age groups were considered significantly different when

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the mean normalized spectral counts were used to determine fold changes between age groups.

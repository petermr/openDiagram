0: To elucidate the molecular basis of phenotypic change in the Rodentia and Afrotheria clades, we generated variants of ancestral pigments (A to E in  Fig.
1: 1) in which we introduced one or more of the derived residues by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis ( 7).
2: We identified more critical sites and screened for these in other vertebrate species in National Center for Biotechnology Information ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

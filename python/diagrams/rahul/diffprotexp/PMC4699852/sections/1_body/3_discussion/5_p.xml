<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, the level of phosphorylated ERK had a rebound increase after 24 h of induction, suggesting that a sustained expression of pERK was required for neuronal differentiation. This is correlated with the finding that sustained ERK activity is required for cell differentiation in PC12 cells [

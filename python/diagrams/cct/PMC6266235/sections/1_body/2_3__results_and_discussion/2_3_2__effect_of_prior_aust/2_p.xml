<p>Mn has a definite segregation tendency due to its differential diameter of 5 × 10
 <sup>−12</sup> m with the Fe element. During the welding thermal cycle, Mn may segregate towards gain boundaries by the nonequilibrium segregation mechanism. The higher the peak temperature is, the higher the segregation concentration of Mn at grain boundaries is. For FGHAZ, the small grain size allows Mn and C to diffuse short distance to grain boundary. Furthermore, the great number of grain boundaries can enhance more Mn and C segregates at the grain boundaries. Therefore, the concentration of Mn and C should be lower in FGHAZ than in CGHAZ. Consequentially, the martensite start temperature was higher in FGHAZ than in CGHAZ.

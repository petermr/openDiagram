0: The plant was purchased from market and was authenticated by botanist as  P. anisum L. (voucher number: PMP-667).
1: Extraction of the fruits was performed using boiling water, and the collected extract was concentrated by rotary evaporator at 45C temperature.
2: Essential oil of the fruits was obtained by steam distillation method using Clevenger apparatus.
3: Essential oil was analyzed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatography (GC) system equipped with a BPX5 column (30 mm  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m).
4: The column temperature was programmed from 50C, being held for 5 min, at a rate of 3C/min to 240C, at a rate of 15C/min to 300C, and being held for 3 min.
5: The injector temperature was set at 290C.
6: Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
7: Mass spectroscopy (MS) was Agilent 5973 model mass detector with electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV, and ionization source temperature of 220C was used.
8: For GC and GC-MS analysis, 1 L of the essential oil dissolved in hexane was injected by the split mode (1:25).
9: Electronic integration of the Flame Ionization Detector peak areas was used for determination of quantitative data.
10: MSD Chemstation software (Agilent Technologies) was used for data analysis.
11: Components were identified using their retention times to n-alkanes compared to those of Wiley 275 library and those described by Adams (2004).

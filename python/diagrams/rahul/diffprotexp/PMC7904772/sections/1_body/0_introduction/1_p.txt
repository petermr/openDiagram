0: Depression and anxiety, as two chronic and common psychiatric disorders, have a negative influence on socio-occupational factors and well-being of patients, families, and society 1  3.
1: Many studies demonstrate that depression and anxiety have common risk factors, including chronic stress and life event stress 4  6.
2: Mounting evidence indicates that chronic stressful life events provide the adverse environmental factors underlying the depression and anxiety etiologies 7,  8.
3: Yet, many individuals do not exhibit anxious and depressive symptoms even after exposure to chronic stress 9  12.
4: Chronic mild stress (CMS) has been widely used to induce depressive and anxious behaviors in rodents to model the environmental risk factors influencing humans 7,  10.
5: To illustrate the potential biological etiology and pathophysiology of depression and anxiety, it is meaningful to focus on the neural substrates underlying susceptibility and resiliency to these stress-induced disorders 9.

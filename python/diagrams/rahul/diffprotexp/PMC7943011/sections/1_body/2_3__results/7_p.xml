<p>Additionally, 31 proteins were assigned to four different clusters related to molecular functions, of which 12 proteins were summarized in a subset characterized by growth factor activity (e.g. CTGF, EGF, HGF) (

Another two clusters contained 14 (e.g. IL1B, IL2, IL17A) and 3 proteins (CCL8, CCL28, CXCL12) that were associated with cytokine and chemokine activity, respectively. A total of 13 proteins showed signal receptor activity (e.g. EGFR, ERBB3, KDR). The remaining 50 proteins could not be assigned to any of the above-mentioned molecular functions.

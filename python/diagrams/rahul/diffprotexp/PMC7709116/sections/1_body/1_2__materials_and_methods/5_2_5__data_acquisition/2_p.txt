0: RP-LC-MS/MS/MS was performed using a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) connected to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer in the MS & Proteomics Resource of the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University.
1: After injection, the samples were loaded into a trapping column (nanoACQUITY UPLC Symmetry C18 TRAP column, 180 m  20 mm) at a flowrate of 5 L/min and then separated with a C18 column (nanoACQUITY column Peptide BEH C18, 75 m  250 mm).
2: The compositions of mobile phases A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, respectively.
3: Peptides were eluted with a gradient extending from 6% to 20% mobile phase B over 120 min and then to 40% mobile phase B for another 50 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a column temperature of 37 C. The data were acquired with the mass spectrometer operating in a top speed data-dependent mode with multinotch synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 scanning for TMT tags [ 27].
4: The full scan was performed over the range extending from 3801580 m/z at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z and automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 2  10 5, with the maximum injection time set at 60 msec.
5: Dynamic exclusion was enabled for a duration of 30 s. The most intense ions were selected above an intensity threshold of 5000 for collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS fragmentation in the linear ion trap with collision energy of 35%.
6: The isolation mode was set to quadrupole, and the isolation width was set to 1.6 m/z.
7: The top 10 fragment ions for each peptide MS2 were notched out with an isolation width of 2 m/z and co-fragmented with higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 65% to produce MS3 scans that were analyzed in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000.
8: The maximum injection time was set to 120 ms, and the AGC target value was set to 1  10 5.

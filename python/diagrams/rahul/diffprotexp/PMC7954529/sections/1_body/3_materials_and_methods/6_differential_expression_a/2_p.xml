<p>To generate an updated orthologous exon file for the most recent chimpanzee genome assembly (panTro6), we followed the procedure reported in Pavlovic et al. with slight modifications (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). We started with human (GRCh38) exon definitions from Ensembl version 98. We filtered this set of definitions for biotypes ‘protein_coding’ using the command mkgtf from cellranger (10× genomics). We then removed exon segments that were in exon definitions for multiple genes. This broke some exons into smaller unique exons. We then removed exons smaller than 10 bp. We took the final set of exons (1,371,917 exons from 20,338 genes) and extracted their sequences from the genome Ensembl GRCh38.p12. We used BLAT version 35 to identify orthologous sequences within the chimpanzee genome (panTro6) (

We then extracted the panTro6 sequences that had the highest sequence identity. We ran BLAT on this orthologous exon set to find matches in both the human and chimpanzee genomes. We removed exons that did not return the original location in humans or chimpanzees, as well as exons that mapped to multiple places with higher than 90% sequence identity. We removed exons from different human genes that mapped to overlapping regions in the chimpanzee genome. Finally, we removed exons that mapped to a different contig than the majority of exons from each gene. This resulted in a set of 1,250,820 orthologous exons from 19,515 genes.

0: Owing to their critical role in the heart physiology, a particular emphasis was placed on expression coordination among the ICT genes in each chamber and the degree of their expression synchrony between adjacent chambers.
1: We have explored a number of functional pathways, addressing the differences in expression level, control and coordination between the two atria, the two ventricles, and between the atrium and the ventricle on the same side.

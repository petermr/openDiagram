0: The aim of this study is to evaluate the chemical composition, antioxidant, antimicrobial, insecticidal and allelopathic activities of Tunisia   Salvia officinalis essential oil (SoEO).
1: The SoEO was characterized by the presence of 49 components with camphor (25.14 %), -thujone (18.83 %), 1,8-cineole (14.14 %), viridiflorol (7.98 %), -thujone (4.46 %) and -caryophyllene (3.30 %) as the major components, determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
2: The level of antioxidant activity, determined by complementary tests, namely 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging (IC  50= 6.7 mg/mL), linoleic acid peroxidation (IC  50= 9.6 mg/mL) and ferric reducing assays (IC  50= 28.4 mg/mL), was relatively moderate.
3: The SoEO was also screened for its antimicrobial activity.
4: Good to moderate inhibitions were recorded for most of tested microorganisms.
5: It also exhibited important insecticidal activity against   Spodoptera littoralis larvae and   Tribolium castaneum adults with LC  50 values of 55.99 and 97.43 l/L air, respectively.
6: The effect of the SoEO on seeds germination and growth showed different activities against radical and hypocotyl elongation of the tested species.
7: These results suggest the potential use of the SoEO as natural antimicrobial preservative in cosmetic, pharmaceutical industry and in pest management.

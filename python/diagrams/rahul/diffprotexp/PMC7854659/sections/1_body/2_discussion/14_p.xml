<p id="Par32">Our findings reinforce that fetal metabolic programming is affected by maternal nutritional imbalances even in early pregnancy. Energy metabolism-related pathways were over-represented in the cerebrum, liver, and muscle, suggesting a multi-tissue coordinated adaptive response mediated by differential gene expression. Likewise, pathways related to myogenesis seems to be negatively regulated in nutrient restricted fetuses. Factors affecting fetal muscle development can reduce animal performance, muscle growth, and consequently, meat production and quality

 </sup>. Furthermore, fetal adaptive response by affecting insulin metabolism may adversely affect animal feed efficiency. Itâ€™s worth mentioning that due to the similarities underlying embryonic development in humans and cattle and the conserved genetic architecture of complex traits in both species

 </sup>. Pathways related to human diseases, such as maturity onset diabetes of the young and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, were over-represented among the differentially regulated genes in our study. These findings reinforce the potential adverse effects of early maternal nutrient restriction on offspring health. Additionally, it suggests that pathways affected by maternal nutrition in cows are likely to be regulated similarly in humans.

0: The expression of TSARL1 was relatively quantified upon time-course CMV infection among quinoa varieties.
1: Three biological and two technical replicates was used in RT-qPCR.
2: The primer design ( S1 Table), cDNA synthesis and qPCR methods were performed as described above.
3: The relative expression pattern of the gene was measured using 2 CT method based on the comparison of mock- and CMV-inoculated samples.

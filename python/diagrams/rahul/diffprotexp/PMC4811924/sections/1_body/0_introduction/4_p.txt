0: At present, most of the available information regarding biofilm formation by drug intervention is based on transcriptomic analyses.
1: However, a limitation of transcriptomic analysis for identifying biofilm-regulated gene network raised concerns among investigators.
2: The method of proteomics is thought to be an essential complement to transcriptomic analysis for discovering key regulators of biofilm (Sauer,  2003).
3: Different immunogenic components of planktonically grown  S. suis proteins such as secreted or cell wall-associated proteins had been studied by using immunoproteomic assays (Zhang and Lu,  2007a, b; Geng et al.,  2008; Zhang et al.,  2008).
4: Additionally, our lab found that quorum-sensing played a crucial role leading to biofilm formation through quantitative proteomic analysis of  S. suis biofilm inhibited by sub-MIC erythromycin treatment  in vitro (Zhao et al.,  2015).
5: However, there are no reports regarding the proteomic analysis of sub-MIC tylosin inhibiting biofilm formation of  S. suis in vitro.

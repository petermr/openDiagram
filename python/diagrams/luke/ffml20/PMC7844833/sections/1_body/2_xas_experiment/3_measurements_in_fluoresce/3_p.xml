<p>The fluorescence detector is usually located at 90° with respect to the X-ray beam (see

 </xref>a). Such geometry minimizes the elastic scattering from the sample and hence reduces the background signal. To increase the solid angle from which the photons are collected by the fluorescence detector, the sample is often rotated by 45° with respect to the incoming beam to better face the detector.

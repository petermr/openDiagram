<p>The gel images of the different samples were acquired using a Typhoon Variable Mode Imager 9400 (GE Healthcare) at a resolution of 100 μm, according to the instructions provided for each dye. Images were analyzed using the Decyder version 6.5 software (GE Healthcare). A two-way ANOVA, with species as one factor and treatment as the second factor, was performed. All spots with a significant score for one of the factors or for the interaction between the two factors (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) were considered as spots of interest, and a total of 283 spots were submitted to MS-based identification. The ratio between control and treated spots was calculated as follows. Ratio treated/control is the ratio of the normalized log-intensities of each spot. However, to allow straightforward comparison of the fold changes, two different calculation modes were used. When the ratio is bigger than 1, the fold change is equal to this ratio. In the case that the ratio is smaller than 1 or the spot is of lower intensity in the treated samples, then the fold change is (−1/ratio).

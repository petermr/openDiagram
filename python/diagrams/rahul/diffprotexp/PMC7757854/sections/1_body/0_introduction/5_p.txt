0: In the current study, adipogenesis in MEFs transcriptome profiles was explored using generated DEGs at different timepoints.
1: DEG lists relevant to adipose were generated based on statistical significance and used for an RRA method, and in construction of PPI and gene networks.
2: Therefore, this study aims to utilizes transcriptome analysis methodology to acquire resourceful understanding in gene expression changes in MEFs that underlie adipocyte differentiation.

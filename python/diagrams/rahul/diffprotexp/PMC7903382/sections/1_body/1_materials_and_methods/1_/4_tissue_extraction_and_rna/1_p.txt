0: In total, three rats in the MIRI group and three from the sham group were anesthetized, and the T1-T4 spinal cord segments were quickly extracted.
1: Total RNAs were collected from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord using TRIzol  reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) based on the manufacturer's instructions.
2: The RNA concentration and purity were examined using a spectrophotometer (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) ( 32, 33).
3: Equal amounts of mRNA (1 g) from one rat with the same treatment was mixed as one sample after these tests.
4: A total of six samples were selected for microarray analysis.

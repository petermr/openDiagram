<p>The efficiency of protein extraction from tissues or environmental samples is dependent on sample preservation, available sample amount, and composition. Adequate sample preservation during collection is critical to avoid protein degradation during storage. Some preservatives have been tested to ensure sample integrity without freezing when necessary [

Similar to other meta-omics approaches such as metagenomics, much progress has been made in reducing the input amounts needed for sample preparation. Current filter-aided or cartridge-based sample preparation protocols can work with just a few milligrams of sample (e.g., tissue or stool), while also efficiently removing interfering compounds. Some cell types are more easily disrupted, such as animal cells or gram-negative bacteria, whereas others, such as fungi, plant cells, or gram-positive bacteria, require harsher treatments for cell lysis. To reduce bias against specific cell types during extraction, it is critical to optimize protein extraction protocols for specific samples. For example, cell lysis by ultra-sonication in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer has been shown to work well for metaproteome analyses of intestinal communities [

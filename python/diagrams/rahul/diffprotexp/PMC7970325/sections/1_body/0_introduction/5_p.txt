0: RNA sequencing is currently a method of choice for generating cancer gene expression data [ 28].
1: The Genomic Data Commons portal at National Cancer Institute (GDC) [ 29] provides limited access to 502 RNA sequencing profiles of thyroid cancer samples (accessed at June 30, 2020).
2: Nevertheless, GDC dataset can be used for only a limited number of applications because it contains data for only papillary histotype of thyroid cancer (PC) and does not provide immediate open access to raw reads, thus complicating data analysis and limiting its usefulness.

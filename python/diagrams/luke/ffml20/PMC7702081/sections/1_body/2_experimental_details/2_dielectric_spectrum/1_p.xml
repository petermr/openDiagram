<p>The complex dielectric spectra of aqueous MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solutions were obtained by measuring 1024 equally‐spaced points in the logarithm scale over the frequency range 0.01–110 GHz, using an open‐ended coaxial probe (850070E, Keysight Inc.) connected to Anritsu model MS4647B vector network analyzer (VNA) with 3739C broadband test set. Open‐ended coaxial probe was immersed into a sample solution with a temperature of 25±0.1 °C. Temperature was controlled by the Finepcr ALB 6400 thermostat. Conductivity measurements were conducted using the Toledo Compact Conductivity meter S230 with Cond probe InLab 731‐ISM. Density of all solution was measured by using DMA 500 density meter under accuracy with 0.001 g cm
 <sup>3</sup>. All experiments were carried out after 2 ml of sample was stabilized for more than one hour in a 25 °C heat bath.

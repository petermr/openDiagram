The lowest content of aristolone is obtained when the duration of the extraction and the state of division are at high levels and when the residual water content is low, which corresponds to a variation in the average content of 41.10% to 36.98% (a decrease of 4.12%). However, this interpretation must integrate the fact that the distillation time and the state of division are weak influences.</p>

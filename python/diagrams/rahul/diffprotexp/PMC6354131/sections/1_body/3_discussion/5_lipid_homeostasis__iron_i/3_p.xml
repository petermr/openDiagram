<p id="p0125">TTR (transthyretin) is a carrier protein that transports thyroid hormones in plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as retinol (vitamin A) in plasma. Raju M S reported a delayed increase in Hp, A1AT, ORM1, S100A9 and SAA levels, whereas TTR levels increased during the early stages of sepsis in non-survivors (NS). Therefore, a weaker acute phase response in early sepsis stages, combined with an inefficient inflammatory response, may contribute to mortality in NS.

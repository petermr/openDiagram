 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The luminal dimensions of the coronary arteries were measured by echocardiography; KD-CAL was defined as Z score &gt;2. During the acute phase, all KD patients were treated with IVIG (2 g/kg) and aspirin (30–50 mg/kg/day) initially. IVIG resistance was defined as sustained or recurrent fever (&gt;38°C) at least 36 h after IVIG infusion. Sera from KD patients were collected before IVIG treatment, and sera from healthy children were collected as healthy control (HC). The study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the Children's Hospital affiliated with Chongqing Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all subjects. All samples were preserved at −80°C.

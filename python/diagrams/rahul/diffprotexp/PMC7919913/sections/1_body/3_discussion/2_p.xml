<p>In the present study, we first induced the injury of renal tubular epithelial cells with TGF-Î²1 and collected the conditioned medium. MVs were extracted and observed under electron microscope (

In general, cell membrane phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), are located inside of the cell membrane. When the intracellular calcium concentration is increased, PS turns from the inside of the cell membrane to the outside [

In this study, donor cells were labeled with fluorescent dye Dil-C18, because Dil-C18 is a type of lipid dye, which can be used to label the cell membrane of donor cells. The lipid membrane structure of MV usually contains the cell membrane from donor cells. When donor cells secrete MVs, the MVs are also labeled with Dil-C18 [

In our present study, the recipient cardiomyocytes treated with MVs could be labeled with Dil-C18, and the longer of the treatment, the more MVs entered the cells. These results showed that MVs could be transmitted from tubular epithelial cells to cardiomyocytes (

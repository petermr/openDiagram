<p>During the progression of cervical cancer, from normal cervical tissues to CIN 1, 2 and 3, the gradually down‚Äêregulated genes we confirmed were CRISP3, CRISP2, PPP1R3C, and DSG1. CRISP2 (gene ID: 7180) also belonging to the CRISP family, is strongly expressed in male reproductive tissues, including the testis, prostate and epididymis,

 </xref> Those results suggested that the decrease in CRISP2 expression may lead to decreased sperm motility. As there is no evidence of a connection between CRISP2 and cervical cancer to date, so, our finding that CRISP2 is specifically expressed at low levels in HSIL is novel.

<p id="Par8">The progression from one developmental stage to another in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> involves drastic changes in gene expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and infectivity of the parasites to human hosts can also vary greatly depending on the stage. For instance, while oocyst sporozoites are highly infectious for the mosquito salivary gland, they are non-infectious to mammalian hosts; on the contrary, salivary gland sporozoites exhibit specific infectivity for mammalian liver, but correspondingly loose infectivity for mosquitoâ€™s salivary gland [

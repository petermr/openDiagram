<p id="Par12">A deeper investigation on the differential expression of the RPGs was performed considering all the 137 yeast genes (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>), where ohnologs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup> are indicated as consecutive couples. Focusing on gene expression in non-treated samples, an increment in the three-time point of the ribosomal protein gene expression is evident in 134 RPGs (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Only three genes (RPL15A, RPL15B, and RPS14B) slightly decrease their expression at 200 min. The RPGs expression in treated samples shows a completely different pattern. A general decrease of expression is indeed reported in 115 RPGs along the three time points (Supplemental Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Moreover, comparing the expression levels at 45 min, 56 RPGs show a higher expression in treated samples than in non-treated samples (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>: “yes” in the column log2 CPM Treated/Control &gt;1). It is worth to note that for 30 RPGs the higher expression concerns only one of the two paralogs. At 120 min, in 6 RPGs the expression is higher in treated samples than in non-treated ones and, in all the cases, only one of the two paralogs is involved. At 200 min, in 3 RPGs the expression is still higher in treated samples than in non-treated ones, and, again, all the 3 RPGs involve only one of the two paralogs (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In summary, among the 137 RPGs, 56 have a higher expression in the treatment compared with the relative control experiment, and in 30 out of 38 couples of ohnologs, only one of the two paralogs shows this behavior.

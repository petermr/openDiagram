<p>By contrast, hASIC3 appears to be more evenly distributed throughout the human nervous system (DRG, spinal cord and brain), with ASIC1a being the most dominant form in DRG [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, the relative contribution of ASIC3 in humans compared to rodents with respect to CNS expression might be different. One difference of potential clinical significance is the elevated expression of hASIC3 in GABAergic interneurons of the temporal lobe identified in epileptic patients [
 <xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This is because inhibition of ASIC3 with the sea anemone 
 <italic>Anthopleura elegantissima</italic> toxin 2 (APETx2), in rat models of epilepsy leads to: shortened latency to seizure, increased incidence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and significantly decreased frequency of action potential firing in interneurons; thus, ASIC3 may play a protective role through dampening action of potential frequency in post-synaptic neurones [

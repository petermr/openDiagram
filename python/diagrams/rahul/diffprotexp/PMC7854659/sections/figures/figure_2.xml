  <p>Tissue-to-tissue co-expression network of the bovine fetal organ transcriptome. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Heat map of 553 tissue-specific genes from the liver, muscle, and cerebrum tissues. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Co-expression network of 992 significantly co-expressed genes. Only nodes with a correlation greater than |0.9| are shown. Overlapped genes between analysis were colored based on the tissue with its maximum expression. Transcription factors are represented by a diamond shape. Nodes with few connections not linked to the main network are not showed. Heat map was constructed using pheatmap v.1.010.

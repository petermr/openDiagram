<p>In the present work, co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride nanoemulsions were developed using soybean lecithin and olive oil in addition to surfactants. F3 that displayed small droplet size, low PDI, applicable Zeta Potential and enhanced in vitro drug release was selected as the prime nanoemulsion. The loratadine and sulpiride release of from F3 followed the Higuashi Diffusion and Baker–Lonsdale models. F3 presented a good stability over a month upon storage at 4
 <bold> </bold>°C and 25
 <bold> </bold>°C. The biological study revealed enhanced downregulation of inflammatory parameters; TNF-α, TGF-β and IL-1 in rabbit models of ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis compared to corresponding emulsion formulation. These findings support that the co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride nasal nanoemulsion as a new approach can provide an encouraging effect in handling the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

<p>Our simulated stable 1 W hydration state was nearly monoclinic, with average UC dimensions of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 0.511, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 0.295, and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.705 nm and angles of α = 90.0, β = 104.0, and γ = 89.8°. These results are in line with reported dimensions of Na-birnessite by Newton and Kwon
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>
 </sup> and are within 4% of the values of two previous studies.

 </sup> We also find that K
 <sup>+</sup> and water oxygens were positioned in the center interlayer region (

  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>), in between basal oxygens of the birnessite lattice. This symmetric interlayer structure deviates from previous simulation studies,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
 </sup> possibly due to contrasting water contents and forcefield parameters. Still, our results show similar positions of K
 <sup>+</sup> and its coordinating water, as was previously shown with MD for Na-birnessite.

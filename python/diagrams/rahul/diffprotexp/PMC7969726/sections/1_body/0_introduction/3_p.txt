0: Alternative polyadenylation is mediated by a group of constant proteins that constitute the CPA multicomponent complexes, including four core components: cleavage and polyadenylation specific factors (CPSFs), cleavage stimulation factors (CSTFs), cleavage factor I (CFI), and CFII, along with numerous dynamic partners ( Tian and Manley, 2017).
1: CPSFs are site-specific cleavage subunits composed of CPSF1, CPSF2, CPSF3, CPSF4, and Fip1.
2: As the largest component of the CPSFs complex, CPSF1 (also known as CPSF160) is primarily located in the nucleus and functions in pre-mRNA 3UTR processing by recognizing a conserved AAUAAA polyadenylation signal near the polyadenylation site (pA site) ( Murthy and Manley, 1995).
3: Differential expression of CPSF1 has been reported to be closely associated with the progression of multiple human diseases.
4: For example, CPSF1 binds to influenza virus NS1, resulting in the inhibition of wild-type influenza A virus replication ( Du et al., 2020).
5: CPSF1 expression decreases in diabetic retinopathy and mediates retinal vascular dysfunction  via the MAPK/ERK pathway ( Zhang et al., 2020).
6: CPSF1 mutations are associated with early onset high myopia and involved in retinal ganglion cell axon projection ( Ouyang et al., 2019).
7: In tumors, CPSF1 plays an oncogenic role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( Sakai et al., 2020), ovarian cancer ( Zhang et al., 2017), and prostate cancer growth ( Van Etten et al., 2017).
8: However, its potential role in HCC has not been fully investigated.

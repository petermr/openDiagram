<p>In this study the influence of the contact tube to work piece distance (CTWD) was investigated in the context of energy reduction in wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Investigations on electrical properties such as energy input per unit length

As a result, the formation of increasing droplet sizes was observed. However, the adaptation of CTWD affected geometrical properties of the deposited layers as well as microstructural properties of the investigated steel. It was shown, that the grain size could be influenced by the adjustment of CTWD due to differing cooling rates. As a result, modified material hardness in the structure emerges.

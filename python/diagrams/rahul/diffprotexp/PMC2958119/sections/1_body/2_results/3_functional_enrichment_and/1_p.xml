<p>Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, which provides 3 detailed, structured terms including molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components, are now widely used in the analysis of large proteomic and genomic datasets, where significantly overrepresented GO terms are examined to determine hypotheses for the biological events behind the data and to provide a broad overview of the principal characteristics of a proteome. In order to enrich the identified proteins to specific functional terms, protein lists were analyzed by CluoGo software. Accordingly, our protein list was significantly enriched to two major functional groups i.e., carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, and antioxidant proteins (

The leading term in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production was carbohydrate catabolic process in which transketolase, enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase were significantly enriched. And the leading term in antioxidant was peroxiredoxin 2540 and thioredoxin peroxidase 1.

<p id="Par31">Compared to ethylene pathway, the number of miRNAs with targets on auxin pathway was at least two times higher (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c,d). Between the cultivars, the miRNA number with targets in ethylene pathway was higher in both apical and basal spikelets of SR-159 than in SR-157 on day 0. On day 5, the number was higher in apical spikelet of SR-157 over SR-159, but there was no difference between the cultivars for basal spikelets. The situation changed on day 10 post anthesis, where the number of miRNAs was higher in SR-159 than in SR-157, especially in the apical spikelet.

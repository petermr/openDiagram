 <italic>ob</italic> mice that had fasted for 16 h. We collected liver, skeletal (gastrocnemius) muscle, and blood from the mice. Some of the liver and blood data were those reported in our previous study (

 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice were significantly higher than those of WT mice, indicating that 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice exhibit the expected hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (

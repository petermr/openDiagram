<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant pathway was studied as described by Monteiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), the NO scavenger, hydroxocobalamin (3.10<sup>&#8722;5</sup> M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), and the competitive cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (3.10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) for 20&#160;min prior the contraction with Phen (1&#160;&#956;M), then, the cumulative concentration&#8211;response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.</p>

<p id="Par41">Because the majority of gene sets positively enriched by 12-h exposure to DCVC contained substantial core enrichment of ISR-associated genes in HTR-8/SVneo cells, we verified DCVC-induced ISR activation in cells using western blot analysis to measure phosphorylation levels of eIF2α and protein concentrations of ATF4, key regulators of ISR activation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Exposure to 20 µM DCVC for 12 h increased the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated eIF2α protein by 61% compared to non-treated controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.031), indicating ISR activation. Furthermore, DCVC increased ATF4 protein concentrations by more than fourfold compared to controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.027), consistent with activation of the ISR.

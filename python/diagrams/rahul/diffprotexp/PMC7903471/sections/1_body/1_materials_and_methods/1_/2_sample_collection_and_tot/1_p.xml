<p>Approximately 5 g of cartilage tissue was collected from each patient and stored at -80˚C until further analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue suspension using the TRIzol
 <sup>®</sup> reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The tissue was homogenized prior to RNA extraction. The amount and purity of the total RNA were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and RNA integrity was analyzed using an RNA Nano 6000 kit from the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).

<p id="Par42">This study sought to identify biomarkers of adalimumab TNFi therapy. We observed a disease-relevant panel of transcriptomic changes in good-responders. In particular, significant differential expression was observed in good-responders between pre-treatment and 3â€‰months, attributed to genes in RA-associated pathways that are responsive to relevant upstream regulators including TNF and CSF2 (otherwise known as Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)), a promising target for therapy in RA [

<p>To more precisely evaluate TAGLN2, TPI-1, and ENO1 expression by gynecological cancers, western blotting was carried out using proteins extracted from the 3 primary and 3 metastatic tumors. In endometrial and ovarian cancers, the expression of TPI-1 and ENO1 was higher in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors; this finding was consistent with the reported role of these proteins in promoting tumor cell survival and proliferation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the expression of TAGLN2 was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors; this finding was consistent with the reported role of TAGLN2 as a tumor suppressor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further, in cervical cancer, the expression of TAGLN2 and TPI-1 was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors (Fig.Â

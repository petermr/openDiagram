 </sup>. These forms of post-transcriptional gene regulation generate multiple transcript isoforms from the same gene by differential selection of splice sites and 3′ end poly(A) sites, respectively. Both mechanisms are widespread in multicellular eukaryotes; more than 90% of human genes produce transcripts that are alternatively spliced

 </sup> and ~80% of human genes have multiple poly(A) sites

 </sup>. The importance of coordinated regulation of neural-differential AS is highlighted by the concentration of AS programs in genes that function in key processes associated with nervous system development and function, such as neurogenesis, axonogenesis, synaptic biology, neurotransmitter trafficking, and signaling. It has been estimated that approximately one-third of neural-regulated exons function in the remodeling of protein–protein interaction networks

 </sup>. Moreover, to-date, dozens of individual neural-differential exons, and the trans-acting factors that control them, have been functionally characterized and shown to play critical roles in these processes

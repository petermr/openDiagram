<p>The following considerations were pointed out:

   <p>Pulse width has a significant effect on the pulsed laser surface hardening process. With increasing pulse width, the hardness value and hardened depth increase.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(2)</label>
   <p>Decreasing LSS causes the hardness value to increase. There is a lower ferrite phase in the laser hardened layer.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(3)</label>
   <p>By decreasing the focal plane position, laser energy density increases, which causes the hardness value to increase. The surface of samples #2, #3, and #4 were melted due to lower focal plane position distance, which led to higher energy concentration.</p>

   <label>(4)</label>
   <p>Sample #9 with the higher martensitic phase percentage had more hardness and higher MHD values. Additionally, in the laser hardened zone, some ferrite phase with some retained austenite was observed.</p>

   <label>(5)</label>
   <p>The maximum hardness value for the LH cases is 673 Vickers while this value for the furnace hardened cases is 572 Vickers, because there is a minor ferrite phase in LH cases compared to furnace hardened cases.</p>

   <p>The results of the numerical model show that the heat source model can predict with accuracy the temperature profile and the size and the shape of the hardened region. The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curve for AISI 4130 steel confirmed the validation of the numerical model at metallurgical transformation.</p>

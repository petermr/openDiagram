<p>Afterwards, studies were conducted to reveal the mechanism of CE resistance in Kazakh sheep, and most of our research was focused on intestinal tissue. It has been found that when sheep were infected with oncospheres (larvae of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>), the small intestine tissue was the first mucosal immune barrier that must be passed through, where various antibodies, cytokines, and other immune molecules are expressed in response to exogenous stimuli [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These molecules could be involved in stopping larval growth of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> at the very first stages [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, we were interested to see the molecular mechanisms of CE resistance in Kazakh sheep with the resistant haplotype, at the very first stage of infection. Against this background, we previously performed microRNA sequencing, and found several microRNAs in the intestinal tissue, which were related to the inflammatory pathway and played important roles in CE resistance in sheep [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since microRNAs exert their functions by regulating the expression of target genes, we were curious to see whether genes related to inflammation and immune response were varied in these sheep, including innate immune cells activation, chemokines, and tumor necrosis factor. It is, therefore, necessary to conduct genome-wide characterization of transcriptome profiles involved in resistance to CE infection in sheep, especially in sheep with different CE resistance.

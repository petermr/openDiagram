<p id="Par25">HTR-8/SVneo cells were seeded at a density of 400,000 cells per well in a clear 6-well culture plate and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were treated with medium alone (control) or DCVC (20 µM) for 12 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing both protease and phosphatase inhibitors or protease inhibitors alone and then centrifuged at 14,000×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were heated with loading buffer at 85 °C for 2 min. Samples were loaded into commercially available Novex 4–20% Tris–Glycine Mini Gel cassettes (Invitrogen) and proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run at 140 V for 1.5 h. SeeBlue Plus2 pre-stained protein standard (Invitrogen) was used as a reference for protein molecular weight. After separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 75 V for 4 h at 4 °C. Membranes were first blotted with Revert Total Protein Stain (Li-Cor Biosciences) and washed with Revert wash. Membranes were then blotted at room temperature using ATF4 (molecular weight 49; catalog no. 11815; Cell Signaling Technologies; RRID: AB_2616025), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha subunit -phosphorylated (p-eIF2α) or non-phosphorylated (eIF2α) [molecular weight 38; catalog nos. 3597 or 9722; Cell Signaling Technologies; Research Resource Identifier (RRID): AB_ 390740 and AB_ 2230924]. Antibody complexes were detected by Alexa Fluor anti-mouse and anti-rabbit fluorescent-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen) and visualized using an Odyssey CLx image scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences; Lincoln, NE, USA). Blots were quantified using LI-COR
 <sup>®</sup> Image Studio software (version 5.2) and normalized to Revert Total Protein Stain (Li-Cor Biosciences).

 <caption> Representative histological appearance of chondrogenic culture. MSC (3A and 3B) and AC-alginate constructs (3C and 3D) were stained with type-II collagen (3A and 3C) and safranin O (3B and 3D) at day-21. ECM of both MSC-alginate and AC-pellet constructs were present with type-II collagen (3A and 3C; magnification 400X) and proteoglycan (3B and 3D; magnification 400X). </caption>

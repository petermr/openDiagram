0: In our previous research, hippocampal quantitative proteome profiling was used to explore distinct and common proteins related to CMS-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors 22.
1: Based on the behavioral testing data, the depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups were obtained to be used as the three different CMS responses.
2: In the present study, the prefrontal cortical tissues from this sample of CMS model rats 22 were utilized to further explore stress-induced depression and anxiety disorders.
3: The proteomes of the prefrontal cortex from the depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, insusceptible, and control groups were comparatively profiled, providing the molecular basis correlated to adaptive and maladaptive phenotypes of depression or anxiety.
4: Our present results can provide a window to understand the specific and common molecular mechanisms that underlie stress-induced depression or anxiety and stress resiliency.

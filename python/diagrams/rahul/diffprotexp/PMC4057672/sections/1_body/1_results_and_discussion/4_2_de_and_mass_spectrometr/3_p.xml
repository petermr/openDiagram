<p>In this study, an animal model for ricin aerosol exposure was established and the differential protein expressions in lung tissues were determined using proteomic analysis. Eight proteins associated with respiratory injury were successfully identified, which were involved in functions such as cellular transportation, cytoskeletal development, signaling pathways and anti-oxidation. The causality relationship between ricin poisoning and the biological functions of proteins Apoa1 apolipoprotein, Ywhaz 14-3-3 protein, Prdx6 Uncharacterized Protein, Selenium-binding protein 1, HMGB1, and DPYL-2 was discussed.</p>

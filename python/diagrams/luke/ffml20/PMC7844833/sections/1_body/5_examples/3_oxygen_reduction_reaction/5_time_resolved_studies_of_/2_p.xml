<p>With the advances in XAS instrumentation, time-dependent information on the structural changes taking place at Pt electrodes during electrochemical reactions can be monitored on the time scale of seconds. In 2007, a pioneering study by Tada et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">96</xref>
 </sup> employed time-grating QXAFS (essentially a pump-and-probe technique) to monitor the changes in the Pt valence and Pt–O and Pt–Pt bonds with 1 s time resolution. A comparable time resolution was achieved also by energy-dispersive XAFS.

 </sup> In 2012–2013, technical advances in the QXAFS method allowed to improve the time-resolution first up to 500 ms,

 </sup> Moreover, while in the earlier works a reasonable XAS signal could only be achieved for a catalyst loading several-times higher than that used in catalysis applications,

 <xref rid="f4-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> the profiles of program- and sample-temperature are plotted corresponding to the right ordinate. Additionally the first derivative of sample-temperature with respect to time, which represents the actual scanning rate, is plotted corresponding to the left ordinate, both as function of time. The alloy-specific critical cooling rate (which further depends on high- or low-temperature-reactions) is denoted by a dash-dot horizontal line.

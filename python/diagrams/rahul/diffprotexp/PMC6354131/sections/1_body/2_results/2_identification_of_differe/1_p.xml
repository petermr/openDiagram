<p id="p0055">Spots representing the differentially expressed proteins were excised from stained gels, 
 <italic>in situ</italic> digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOFMS. The identified proteins using MASCOT scores, MS/MS matched sequences, apparent and theoretical MWs, pI values, sequence coverage and regulation are listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">TableÂ 2</xref>. There were 9 differentially expressed proteins. Among them, 6 proteins (SAA1, APOL1, CP, HP, SERPINC1 and F2) were upregulated, while another 3 proteins (IF, TTR, and A2M) were down regulated in the shock group compared with the non-shock group.

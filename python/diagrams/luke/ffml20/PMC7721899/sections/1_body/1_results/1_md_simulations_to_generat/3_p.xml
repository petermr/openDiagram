<p id="Par9">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the ternary plot of elastic constants with respect to the CaO, SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O present in different C–S–H compositions. The general trend from the figures suggests that for the same concentration of water, the modulus decreases with an increase in CaO concentration. This is due to the fact that as the content of CaO concentration increases, the structure becomes more disordered, and depolymerization of the network structure increases (as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) resulting in a decrease in the elastic modulus. On the other hand, an increase in H
 <sub>2</sub>O concentration for constant molar fraction of CaO results in a decrease in the modulus value. However, with an increase in H
 <sub>2</sub>O concentration and the same molar fraction of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> the elastic modulus increase. It can be observed that the variation of moduli with composition is non-systematic and coupled effects exist. For example, C
 <sub>33</sub> value initially increases with an increase in SiO
 <sub>2</sub> content up to a 0.4 molar fraction beyond which the value decreases with a further increase in water concentration. Similarly, from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, it is evident that C
 <sub>11</sub> and C
 <sub>22</sub> are greater than C
 <sub>33</sub>. This is due to the presence of interlayer spacing in layered C–S–H structure where the load is applied perpendicular to the interlayer plane. Similarly, for the same reason, in the case of shear deformation C
 <sub>66</sub> values are found to be higher than C
 <sub>44</sub> and C
 <sub>55</sub>. Overall, the stiffness moduli exhibit a non-linear relationship with variations in composition, which prevents any assumption of a linear model to predict the stiffness moduli in the C–S–H system.

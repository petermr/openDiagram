0: Differentially expressed proteins observed from 2-DE gels and identified by mass spectrometry were also assayed by western blotting.
1: The housekeeping protein GAPDH was used as an internal control.
2: The proportion of the protein of interest to GAPDH was normalized to the undifferentiated group.
3: The primary antibodies rabbit monoclonal anti-PKC- and anti-GAPDH were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA); while rabbit polyclonal anti-UKHC and rabbit monoclonal anti-NM23-H1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Abcam, respectively.
4: Primary antibodies of PKC-, NM23-H1, UKHC, and GAPDH were used at dilutions of 1/5000, 1/1000, 1/200, and 1/1000, respectively for Western bolting.

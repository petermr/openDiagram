<p>Finally, we validated the expression of the hub genes in clinical samples. As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5F</xref>, the relative expression level of 
 <italic>CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, FYN, GRAP2</italic> and 
 <italic>ITK</italic> in TNBC samples were significantly lower than in non-TNBC samples (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and this result was consistent with the differential expression analysis.

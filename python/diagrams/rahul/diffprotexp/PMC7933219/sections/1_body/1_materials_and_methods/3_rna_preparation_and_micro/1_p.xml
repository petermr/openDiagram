<p>For Affymetrix microarray profiling, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Canada) and purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), including a DNase digestion treatment. RNA concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm, and the quality control standards were A260/A280 = 1.8–2.1, using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo, America). The cDNA of PC-3M-adhered HUVECs (TC-EC) or from HUVEC controls (EC) was hybridized to Human Gene 2.0 ST GeneChip
 <sup>®</sup> arrays (Affymetrix, America) according to the user manuals. Affymetrix
 <sup>®</sup> Expression Console software (version 1.2.1) was used for the microarray analysis.

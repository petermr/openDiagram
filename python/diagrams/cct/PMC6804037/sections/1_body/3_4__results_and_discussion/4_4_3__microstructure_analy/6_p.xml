<p>The microstructure of the laser surface hardening (sample #9) is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f015">Figure 15</xref> in different magnitude by using FESEM. These pictures were taken at the center of the hardened zone, which was 50 micrometers under the sample surface. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f015">Figure 15</xref>b shows the ferrite and martensite phases in the hardened zone. In

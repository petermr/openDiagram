<p>(2) With high austenitizing temperatures, full acicular ferrite transformation could complete between 660 °C and 561 °C during 2 °C/s cooling. The oxide particles introduced by Ti–Ca deoxidation play an important role in promoting AF transformation. The particles are featured by an oxide core rich in Ti and a lesser amount of Ca, with MnS precipitation on the local surface. These particles show a strong ability to promote AF nucleation and the Mn-depleted zone is the operative mechanism.</p>

<p>We collected data from a prerecorded video from 15 December 2017 to 9 February 2018. The video was recorded using XProtect
 <sup>®</sup> Smart Client 2017 software (Brøndby, Denmark). Six observers were trained to collect data, and all demonstrated &gt;90% inter-observer reliability based on the percent difference in behaviors scored during three video observations. Inter-observer reliability was rechecked every three months during the video-coding process.

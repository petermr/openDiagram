<p>Since miRNAs play a regulatory role in expression and translation [
 <xref rid="B27-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the consequence of differential miRNAs’ expression depends on particular mRNA targets. To determine the possible functional role of DEMs in a high-throughput approach covering multiple miRNA–mRNA interactions, we predicted the putative mRNA targets for each DEM, followed by calculating the correlation coefficient for the expression levels of matched miRNAs and mRNAs. With this procedure, we mostly identified miRNA–mRNA pairs with negative correlation between expression levels where a high level of a particular miRNA corresponded with a low expression of its target gene. This relationship is concordant with a generally accepted concept that miRNAs are negative regulators of gene expression. Still, a notable part of the identified putative target mRNAs showed positive miRNA–mRNA correlation, indicating an activating role of miRNA. Activating action was previously reported for many miRNAs [

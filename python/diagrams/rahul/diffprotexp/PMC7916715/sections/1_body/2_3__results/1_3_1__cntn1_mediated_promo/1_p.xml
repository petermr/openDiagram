<p>We have observed that CNTN1 promoted DU145 cell-derived xenograft formation and lung metastasis along with facilitating AKT activation [
 <xref rid="B34-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; CNTN1 also enhanced the invasive ability of C4-2 cell, a derivative of LNCaP cell, in vitro [
 <xref rid="B34-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To further examine CNTN1â€²s oncogenic actions in PC, we stably expressed an empty vector (EV) or CNTN1 in LNCaP cells (

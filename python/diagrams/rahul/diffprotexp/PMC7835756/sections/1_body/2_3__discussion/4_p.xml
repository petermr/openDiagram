<p>Additionally, it has been demonstrated that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> has a strong link with calcium signaling on gene expression regulation, antioxidant defense, and development modulation. Crosstalk among them is given in stress responses when H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> can activate calcium channels and calcium-dependent protein kinases. [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> can play a key function on DNA methylation for the activation of genes related to calcium as it is suggested by the presence of DmC-DEG in genes as the calcium-binding protein 39, the gelsolin, calmodulin-binding heat-shock protein, calcium-dependent protein kinase. Calcium participates in the cell signaling pathways, and it is considered as a sensor to external stimulus. Moreover, some DmC-DEG genes were associated with membrane transport, as the adaptor protein complex involved in the protein transport and related to the recruitment of clathrins and recognition of cargo molecules. In the study of Atighi et al. it was suggested that DNA hypomethylation is part of the general plant pattern-triggered immunity defense responses due to their inverse association with susceptibility to nematodes [

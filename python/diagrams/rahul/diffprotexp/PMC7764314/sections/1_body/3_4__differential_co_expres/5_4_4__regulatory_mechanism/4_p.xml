<p>To facilitate these investigations, the method LncSubpathway has been specifically designed to address the change in crosstalk between mRNAs and lncRNAs across conditions [
 <xref rid="B155-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], identifying lncRNA-regulated modules, while MACPath [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] searches for pairs of pathways regulated by a ceRNA mechanism, integrating the additional knowledge of transcriptsâ€™ miRNA responsive elements.

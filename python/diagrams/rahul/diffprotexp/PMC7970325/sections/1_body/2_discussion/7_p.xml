<p id="p0250">Another key point of this study deals with the expression patterns of tumor-adjacent pathologically normal tissues learned from the literature dataset PRJEB11591. We showed that activation levels of DNA repair pathways strongly correlated between the tumor and adjacent normal tissues (R Pearson = 0.8492, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16,

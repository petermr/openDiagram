0: A fascinating characteristic of macrolides is that even when they can tightly bind to wild-type bacterial ribosomes, they cannot block the synthesis of all proteins.
1: Kannan and coworkers 14 have identified protein sequences in  E. coli and  S. aureas that can bypass the drug-obstructed tunnel to become partially or fully synthesized.
2: A key finding is that the ability to bypass macrolides does not depend on the entire sequence of the synthesized protein, but rather on its N-terminal sequence 14.
3: The N-terminal segment of H-NS can be synthesized even when erythromycin is bound in the exit tunnel, although its movement is slowed down 10,  14,  21.
4: Furthermore, while the synthesis of a protein known as OsmC is inhibited by erythromycin, this inhibition is overcome when various lengths of H-NSs N-terminal residues are covalently attached to the N-terminus of OsmC, saturating at 12 H-NS residues 14.
5: Erythromycin is still bound in the tunnel after translation of the entire H-NS protein 14, indicating that H-NS peptide bypasses erythromycin.
6: Despite the important role of macrolide resistance in antibiotic development, motifs of peptides that are stalled by erythromycin, telithromycin and azithromycin have been extensively studied 13,  21 while the identification of motifs that can bypass macrolides has received less focus.

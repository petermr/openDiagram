<p>In cells, intrinsic endogenous DC EFs serve as morphogenetic cues and are necessary for several important cellular responses, including activation of multiple signaling pathways, cell migration, nerve regeneration, and wound healing [

 <xref rid="B37-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Further, DC EFs are known to induce asymmetry in the distribution, arrangement of membrane receptors, and activate intracellular signaling cascades in the cathode-facing side, resulting in the growth of neurites in the cathode direction [

 <xref rid="B39-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In contrast, in vitro stimulation with small AC EFs has no effect on neural progenitor cell alignment, viability, differentiation, or proliferation, similar to control unstimulated cells [

 <xref rid="B20-genes-12-00299" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on these observations and due to the presence of the highest number of free nerve endings in the cornea, along with the existence of stem cells in the corneal limbus, it is also necessary to study the consequences of the application of AC EFs on corneal cells. Since epithelial cells are mainly accountable for the corneal wound healing process and as the effects of external AC EFs in modulating the epithelial cell function is presently not known, this study was carried out to understand the influence of external AC EF stimulation on corneal epithelial cell function.

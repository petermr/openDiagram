<p>As a side note, we would like to mention that the formation of carbides results in a similar expansion of the palladium lattice as the formation of hydrides, and these two effects can be hard to distinguish through the analysis of Pd K-edge EXAFS data, or even by XRD. The differences between these phases can be however detected from XANES data analysis, as demonstrated by Bugaev et al., highlighting the complementarity of EXAFS, XANES, and XRD techniques.

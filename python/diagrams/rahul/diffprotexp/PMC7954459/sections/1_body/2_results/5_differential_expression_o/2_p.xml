<p>To understand the role of miRNAs in determining seed size/weight, we estimated the differential expression of miRNAs between the two chickpea cultivars at all the stages of seed development analyzed. In total, 33 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between the two cultivars at all the seed development stages (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Majority (23) of them were detected at the S5 stage. However, 1–11 miRNAs exhibited differential expression at other stages. Differentially expressed miRNAs included members of miR156, miR167, miR170, and miR319 families, which are known to regulate seed development and reproductive processes in various plants (Rodrigues &amp; Miguel, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). At least 10 novel miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between the two cultivars. Interestingly, genes encoding transcription factors belonging to 
 <italic>SPL, ARF, HB,</italic> and 
 <italic>MYB</italic> families were found to be the targets of many of these differentially expressed miRNAs between the cultivars.

0: In the present study, the effects of metformin on the human EC cell line HEC-1A were investigated using an affinity proteomic approach.
1: HEC-1A cells were derived from a moderately differentiated grade 2 endometrial adenocarcinoma of a 71-year-old woman and are characterized by a poor expression of estrogen receptor  (ER) [ 40,  41].
2: However, HEC-1A cells express ER and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) and therefore maintain a low estrogen sensitivity.
3: Therefore, HEC-1A cells represent a postmenopausal model with low sensitivity for -estradiol (E2), which are able to form E2 from estrone (E1) to some extent [ 42].
4: Cells were treated long-term with metformin over a period of 7 days and changes in the expression pattern of 1,300 different proteins were compared to the expression in untreated control cells as well as insulin-treated cells.
5: Insulin treatment was incorporated into the study in order to implement a model for insulin resistance and related hyperinsulinemia, conditions that are often observed in obese and prediabetic patients [ 43].
6: Although the HEC-1A cell line is characterized by low estrogen sensitivity, cells were additionally provided with E2 in order to mimic increased estrogen levels in the present study.
7: Elevated estrogen levels represent a common risk factor for EC development and progression and are therefore essential for a realistic  in vitro simulation of the environment in EC patients and women with increased risk for EC development [ 9 11].
8: It was shown that E2 stimulates cellular proliferation, migration and growth of HEC-1A cells independent of ER via a GPER-mediated activation of diacylglycerol kinase  (DGK) [ 44].
9: With the presented data, we contribute to a better understanding of the anti-cancer activity of metformin as well as its underlying mechanism of action in EC cells.

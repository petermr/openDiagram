<p id="Par42">The immune cell analysis of this study showed that monocytes and resting mast cells were significantly overexpressed in VTE, while regulatory T cells were significantly lower expressed. A study suggested that monocyte-related inflammatory mechanisms may be involved in the pathophysiological processes of VTE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Monocytes, platelet aggregation, and C-reactive protein are associated with VTE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which supports the conclusion that VTE is associated with inflammation. GO enrichment analysis found that DEGs are mainly involved in the composition of ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The occurrence of VTE is related to the ribosomes, cytochrome C oxidase activity, and the oxidoreductase activity on heme. It has been reported that the heme released by the large amount of erythrolysis in early thrombus is the main source of vascular endothelial cell oxidation, which can further lead to endothelial cell dysfunction and thrombosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Since heme is an inflammatory substance, the inflammatory process is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism for regulating thrombosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, heme can also promote the transformation of LDL into cytotoxic oxidation products. Elevated oxidized LDL is a known risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and it is also a common independent risk factor for VTE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As can be seen, the oxidoreductase acting on heme plays an important role in VTE.

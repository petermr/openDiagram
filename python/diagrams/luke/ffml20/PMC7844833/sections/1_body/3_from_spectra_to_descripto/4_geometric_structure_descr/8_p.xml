<p>An alternatives to the cumulant expansion is the so-called regularization approach, where

  <italic>p</italic>

 </sup> This method, which approaches the reconstruction of

 </sub>(
 <italic>R</italic>) as an ill-defined problem, necessarily relies on additional assumptions about the RDF shape such as non-negativity and smoothness.

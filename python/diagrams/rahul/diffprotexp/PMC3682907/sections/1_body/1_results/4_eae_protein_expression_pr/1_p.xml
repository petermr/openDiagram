<p>The clinical appearance of EAE is of an ascending myelitis, the severity of which is scored on a scale from 0 (normal animal) to 5 (moribund state). SELDI mass spectra were determined for mitochondrial fractions obtained from brain tissue from one mouse (labeled E1) at EAE disease stage 1 (animals display tail paralysis with mild meningeal inflammation), and four mice (labeled E2 – E5) at EAE disease stage 3 (animals display complete paralysis of one or both hind limbs with severe meningitis, and parenchyma infiltration with multiple perivascular infiltration), as well as from brain tissue from three controls (labeled C1 – C3). The mitochondrial subcellular fractions were further fractionated on anion exchange beads to give six fractions (Q1- Q6) for SELDI-MS analysis. A total of 241 protein peaks (clusters) were identified in these six fractions which met our selection criteria. A total of 39 protein peaks were found to be differentially expressed (p≤ 0.05) (see Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Eleven proteins were found at greater levels in EAE brains relative to controls and 28 proteins were found at lower levels in EAE brains relative to controls. As shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, the differentially expressed proteins are seen in all six anion exchange fractions (Q1-Q6) and include proteins with mass/charge ratios from 3,006 to 49,085 Da. This represents a large fraction (16%) of the observed peaks, and it is possible that some proteins have been counted twice (i.e. they are observed under both the LMW and HMW acquisition conditions employed here), for example, the protein peaks at mass/charge ratios of 13,365 (HMW) and 13,331 (LMW) in fraction Q2; 12,448 (HMW) and 12,493 (LMW) in fraction Q3; 16,910 (HMW) and 16,878 (LMW) in fraction Q5; and 13,854 (HMW) and 13,809 (LMW) in fraction Q6. In addition, some peaks with different m/z ratios may represent proteolytic fragments of the same protein.

0: All samples were homogenized with solubilization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.3% SDS, 150U/ml Benzonase and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) in a Retsch Mixer Mill MM400 (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) homogenizer.
1: The protein sample was centrifuged for 60 min at 20,000 g to pellet any debris.
2: Thereafter, methanol/chloroform precipitation was performed  [13] and protein samples were solubilized in denaturation buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0).
3: The protein concentration of the samples was determined according to Bradford  [14].
4: The proteins were reduced by adding 350 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and alkylated by 55 mM iodoacetamide.
5: The protein samples were then treated with 0.5 g/l lysyl-endopeptidase (Lys-C) (Wako Chemicals) and 0.5 g/l Trypsin (Promega).
6: The protein samples were prepared for LCMS/MS analysis using Stage tips according to Rappsilber et al.
7: [15].

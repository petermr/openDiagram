<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Platelet aggregation was performed using an aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA, USA). In a special tube containing 400&#160;&#956;l of washed platelets at 37&#160;&#176;C with continual stirring at 1000&#160;rpm, the aggregation was stimulated with aggregating agents, thrombin (0.1 U/ml) and ADP (1&#160;&#956;M). For test studies, platelets were preincubated with different concentrations of AcEO (0.1, 0.5 and 1&#160;mg/ml) for 1&#160;min in the cuvette before the stimulation by the aggregating agents cited above. In all experiments, the platelet aggregation was then recorded during 5&#160;min. AcEO was dissolved in 0.5% DMSO. Control experiments demonstrated that the concentrations of DMSO had no significant effect on the aggregatory effect.</p>

<p>To date, few studies have investigated the effect of AAS in GnRH neurons. In this regard, electrophysiological studies have shown that AAS modulate the activity of these cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, the AAS 17α-methyltestosterone (17α-meT; 7.5 mg/kg), increased presynaptic GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA
 <sub>A</sub>R) currents of mPOA steroid-sensitive neurons, resulting in inhibition of GnRH cells [

Although these studies demonstrated neuroendocrine modulation by AAS, there is still a lack of a complete protein profile on GnRH neurosecretory cells after AAS exposure, which has the potential to reveal specific alterations in regulatory processes of the reproductive axis. In this study, we characterized the proteomic profile of GnRH neurons after exposure to supraphysiological levels of 17 α-meT.

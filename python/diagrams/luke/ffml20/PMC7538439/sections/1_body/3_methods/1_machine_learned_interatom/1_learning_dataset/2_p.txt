0: The PBE functional was chosen because it has become the de facto standard in studies of molecular systems, and high-pressure hydrogen.
1: PBE has been criticised for overstabilising the metallic phases: this is due to its behaviour at high electron density gradients 53, and not vdW corrections.
2: In this work we only consider molecular phases, so this is not a concern.

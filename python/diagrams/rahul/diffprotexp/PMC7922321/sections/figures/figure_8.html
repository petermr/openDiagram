 <caption> KEGG enrichment analysis of individual regulons and their ( A). positively and ( B). negatively regulated targets. KEGG analysis was performed by clusterProfiler with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. The gene ratio indicates the number of genes enriched with corresponding KEGG pathways among the total gene number introduced into the enrichment analysis. </caption>

0: Search results were binned according to inferred timing of evolutionary origin: Either originating in the LECA (Group A), in an amorphean ancestor of Metazoa (Group B), or much later within either Metazoa or Euglenozoa (Group C).
1: Results in Group A included both those with orthologs nearly universally conserved among eukaryotes and those with orthologs not identified in several major taxonomic groups.
2: Data from comparative genomics searches were converted to the Coulson plot format using CPG version 1.6.1 ( https://github.com/mfield34/CPG [ 57]) and finalized using Illustrator ( https://www.adobe.com).

 <caption> Detection of protein expressions by immunohistochemistry. Expression of HBME-1, S100A13, ANXA3, and CMBL showed in cPTC (left), normal thyroid (middle), and benign thyroid lesions (right) (magnification x60). Up-regulation of HBME-1 in 100% of cPTC cells as compared to accompanying normal thyroid cells is shown together with negative immunoexpression of HBME-1 in a follicular thyroid adenoma. Microphotographs demonstrate moderate-to-strong expressions of S100A13, ANXA3, and CMBL in cPTC, surrounding normal thyroid cell and in colloid goiter. </caption>

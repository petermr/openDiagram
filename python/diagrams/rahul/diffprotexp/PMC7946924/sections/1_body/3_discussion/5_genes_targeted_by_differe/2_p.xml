<p id="Par42">Analysis in psTarget server database identified miRNA398B and miRNA820C having targets on Os04t0624600-01 (similar to starch synthase DULL1) and Os05t0485800-00 (similar to pollen specific protein NTP303). Additionally, high expression of miRNA2877 and miRNA530-5p was noticed in basal spikelet of cultivars on day of anthesis. These miRNAs had Os11t0141000-02 and Os07t0239400-01 (PP2A regulatory subunit-like protein and ethylene-responsive small GTP-binding proteins) as targets with highest probability. Irrespective of cultivar difference, ethylene production climaxes at anthesis

 </sup> and in all probability, these miRNA participated in the process of ethylene biosynthesis for both high and low sterile cultivars used. Further, our study identified expression of MIR396h on day 5 post anthesis, that had multiple targets, such as, Os02t0776900-01, a transcription activator involved in gibberellin induced stem elongation, Os01t0643300-02, an auxin efflux carrier protein and Os01t0643300-01, a PIN1-like auxin transport protein with maximum probability. In contrast to our study, Peng et al.

 </sup> reported 5 highly conserved miRNA related to auxin homeostasis and signal transduction, namely miR160, miR164, miR167, miR390 and miR393, of which miR164 and miR167 expression is more abundant during grain filling of superior and inferior spikelets of rice panicle. In particular, miR164e expressed 80 and 40 times higher in superior compared to inferior spikelet of rice panicle on days 10 and 15 post anthesis, respectively. In our work, based on high read count, p values and fluctuation dynamics in fold change, the expression of miR396h was higher in basal spikelet of SR-159 compared to SR-157 on day 5 post-anthesis and it was validated in qRT-PCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Fold change values of DGE matched with pattern of expression (relative transcript level) in the qRT-PCR studies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and consolidated strong linkage of miR396h to functions of auxin efflux carrier protein and PIN1-like auxin transport protein; the functions were suppressed in SR-157 compared to SR-159 in the first 5 days of grain filling. There are instances, where perturbation of miR396 regulation greatly increases grain size and yield by modulating development of spikelets through direct induction of the growth regulating factor genes

 </sup>.A high auxin concentration at early post anthesis stage can induce an attractive power leading to increased level of cytokinin for promotion of endosperm cell division and stabilisation of sink strength resulting in greater mobilisation of resources for grain filling

 </sup>. It is also possible that attenuated ethylene action generates greater sink strength for grain filling in the dominant apical spikelets because they possess higher ABA concentration and content ratio of ABA/ethylene

 </sup>. Profuse up-regulation of expression of genes encoding receptor proteins like ERS1, ERS2, ETR2 and ETR3 and messenger proteins like EIN2, EIN3, ERE2, ERF3, EREBP1 and EREBP5 have consolidated the stance for retrograde action of ethylene in grain filling of the failing spikelets

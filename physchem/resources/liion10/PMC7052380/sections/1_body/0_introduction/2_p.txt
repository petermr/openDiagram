0: Small particle size can decrease the migration distance of lithium ions from the interior to the surface and increase the diffusion rate (Lim et al.,  2008; Hai et al.,  2019; Li et al.,  2019; Xiao et al.,  2019).
1: Various techniques, including solid-state reaction (Zheng et al.,  2008), sol-gel (Zhang et al.,  2011) hydrothermal (Kiyoshi et al.,  2008; Chang et al.,  2014), co-precipitation (Park et al.,  2003; Wang et al.,  2013), and microwave heating (Wang et al.,  2007; Beninati et al.,  2008; Guo et al.,  2010), are adopted to control particle size.
2: Moreover, surface coating with conductive material can increase the electronic conductivity between particles (Wang et al.,  2010; Fathollahi et al.,  2015; Ahn et al.,  2019) and provide paths in all directions for the fast transmission of electrons (Wang et al.,  2009; Jang et al.,  2011; Fan et al.,  2014).
3: Graphene with high electrical conductivity has been adopted to improve the cycling stability and rate capability of cathode material (Ding et al.,  2010; Zhou et al.,  2011; Shi et al.,  2012; Tang et al.,  2012; Chen et al.,  2018; Wang et al.,  2018).

6: Shi et al.
7: ( 2012) prepared graphene-wrapped LiFePO 4/C using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, followed by sintering at 600C for 2 h under H 2/Ar flow.
8: Zhou et al.
9: ( 2011) first synthesized LiFePO 4 nanoparticles by a hydrothermal method and then synthesized LiFePO 4/graphene from LiFePO 4 nanoparticles and graphene oxide nanosheets by spray-drying and annealing processes.
10: Tang et al.
11: ( 2012) synthesized LiFePO 4/graphene by mixing three-dimensional graphene prepared by chemical vapor deposition and LiFePO 4 prepared by solid-state reaction in a N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) suspension.
12: The above experimental methods are very complicated, and most of them require long-term high-temperature treatment and atmosphere protection, which lead to high energy consumption and cost.
13: Additionally, the graphene and active materials agglomerate easily and distribute unevenly.
14: Therefore, simplifying the preparation technology and obtaining a product with a small and homogeneous distribution remain great challenges for preparing LiFePO 4/graphene composites.
15: Microwave heating is a convenient, economical, and environmentally friendly route for the preparation of graphene composites in a way that addresses the deficiency of graphene modification.
16: Microwave heating can simplify the reduction step of graphene oxide, as, due to the microwave-absorbing properties of graphene oxide, microwave irradiation can restore it into graphene directly without any reductive agent and atmosphere.

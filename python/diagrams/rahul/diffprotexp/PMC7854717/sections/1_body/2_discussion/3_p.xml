 </sup>, we have shown that expression correlations with one gene predicts with &gt; 80% accuracy the regulation of its coordinately expressed partners when the expression of the target gene is significantly altered. Therefore, according to our results from Fig.

 </sup>, Our hypothesis does not contradict but complements the widely accepted view that the anti-hypertensive effects of calcium blockers and regulation of the atrial rhythm result from changes in the heart electrophysiology and hemodynamics. We speculate that the increase of the atrial contraction strength acts synergistically with the reduction of the ventricular hypertrophy following an anti-hypertensive treatment to lower the atrial difficulties in filling with blood the ventricle from the same side. This hypothesis goes along with the reported differences in Ca

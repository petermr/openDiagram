0: cDNA synthesis was performed for equal quantities of total RNA in all samples employing the kit of RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis (#K1632, Thermo Scientific Fermentas, St. Leon-Ro, Germany).
1: Real-time PCR was performed with single-stranded cDNAs.
2: PCRs were accomplished by SYBER Green [#K0251, Thermo Scientific Fermentas St. Leon-Ro, Germany-Maxima SYBER Green qPCR Master Mix (2X)] using the detection system of StepOne Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystems).
3: The set of primers used for IL-1  (GenBank accession NC_013670.1) were as follows: forward primer was 5-AGCTTCTCCAGAGCCACAAC-3, and reverse primer was 5-CCTGACTACCCTCACGCACC-3.
4: Primers for GAPDH (GenBank accession NC_013676.1) were 5-GTCAAGGCTGAGAACGGGAA-3(forward primer) and 5-ACAAGAGAGTTGGCTGGGTG-3(reverse primer), and primers for TGF- (GenBank accession NC_013672.1) were 5-GACTGTGCGTTTTGGGTTCC-3 (forward primer) and 5-CCTGGGCTCCTCCTAGAGTT (reverse primer).
5: primers for TNF- (GenBank accession NC_013680.1) were 5-GAGAACCCCACGGCTAGATG-3(forward primer) and 5-TTCTCCAACTGGAAGACGCC-3 (reverse primer).
6: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using 20  l of RealMOD Green qRT-PCR Mix kit (iNtRON biotechnology) with 0.02  g RNA per reaction containing 10 Pmol of specific primers, for 30 runs for 10  sec of 95  C and 1  min of 60  C. Threshold cycle or comparative Ct method was employed to establish the relative products amounts.
7: The relative expression was computed employing the formula 2 (-Ct) (Mullou et al.,  1995).
8: They were scaled in relation to controls whereas control samples had a value of 1.

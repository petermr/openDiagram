<p id="Par26">An Agilent Multiple Affinity Removal LC Column (Human 14) (Agilent, CA, USA) was used to remove high-abundance proteins in accordance with the protocol to obtain a low-abundance component solution in the serum sample. A 5 kD ultrafiltration tube was used for ultrafiltration and concentration, and one-fold volume of SDT lysis was added into the system, which was incubated in a water bath at 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was extracted for protein quantification using a BCA kit, and the samples were subpackaged and stored at −80 °C.</p>

<p id="Par24">This study has identified and associated various genes/proteins and their network pathways for the tail tissue regeneration of lizard which were also found to be associated with epimorphic regeneration of organs in other animals as in

 </sup>. The manner of association and dissociation of genes/proteins during tail regeneration in 
 <italic>Hemidactylus frenatus</italic> is attractive to study further. Although detailedÂ understanding of the differential expressed genes/proteins and their regulation might lead to better insight in understanding the regeneration of the gecko tail.This study of transcriptome and proteome profile will benefit future studies in 
 <italic>Hemidactylus frenatus</italic> species.

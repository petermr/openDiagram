<p>We apologize if that this figure was unclear and thank the reviewers for pointing out this problem, which we did not appreciate. We note that we are unable to determine duplication status for some genes in Proboscideans because of assembly gaps in ancient genomes; these genes appear to be independently duplicated in extant species (African Forest, African Savanah, and Asian elephants) because they are missing from ancient genomes leaving their ancestral duplication status unresolved. Thus, some of these apparently independent duplication events are because those genes are missing in the ancient genomes because of assembly gaps. We did not mean for this figure to suggest that there is a rapid turnover of tumor suppressors.</p>

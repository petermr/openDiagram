<p>The 80 selected proteins were subjected to STRING analysis and protein networks were generated. Characteristic biological processes and molecular functions that were affected by the treatments were identified and proteins were assigned to clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248103.g003">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0248103.s001">S1 Table</xref>). A total of 53 proteins were allocated to four different clusters of biological processes, of which 12 proteins were summarized in a subset related to cell population proliferation (e.g. CD81, MKI67, FGF2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248103.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Another two clusters contained 20 (e.g. CD63, CDH5, CEACAM8) and 23 proteins (e.g. CDH2, COL1A1, VEGFA) that were associated with cell adhesion and cell migration, respectively. A total of 29 proteins were related to immune response (e.g. CD3E, IL2, IL4). The remaining 27 proteins are not directly related to any of the above-mentioned biological processes.

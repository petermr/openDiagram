<p>Zeta potential, a measure of electric charge of a dispersed particle, correlated with the oxidized species on the MWCNTs surface and their impact on the suspension behavior. The values of zeta potential as a function of pH for aqueous suspension of pristine MWCNTs and carboxylate MWCNTs are shown in

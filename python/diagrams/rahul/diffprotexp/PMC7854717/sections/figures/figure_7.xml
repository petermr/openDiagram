  <p>Correlation of the expressions of genes encoding ion channels and transporters (ICT). (
   <bold>a</bold>) Examples of synergistically (
   <italic>Kcnj5</italic> = potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 5), antagonistically (
   <italic>Kcna6</italic> = potassium voltage-gated channel, shaker-related, subfamily, member 6) and independently (
   <italic>Kcnj3</italic> = potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 3) expressed genes with 
   <italic>Vdac1</italic> (voltage-dependent anion channel 1) in the left atrium. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Percentage of synergistically expressed ion channel and transporter gene pairs within each chamber. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Synchronous expressions of ICT genes between two chambers. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Synchronous expressions of sodium channels in paired heart chambers are indicated by red lines linking the gene symbols. The correlation was computed for each ICT gene with each other ICT gene within the same chamber. 
   <italic>ICT</italic> percentage out of all 17,020 pairs that can be formed with the quantified ICT genes, 
   <italic>ATP</italic> transporting ATPases (1378 pairs), 
   <italic>ORG</italic> transporters through organelle (mitochondria, lysosomes) membranes (903 pairs), 
   <italic>CA</italic> calcium channels (153 pairs), 
   <italic>CL</italic> chloride channels (91 pairs), 
   <italic>NA</italic> sodium channels (91 pairs), 
   <italic>K</italic> potassium channels (1596 pairs). Note the significantly larger percentages of synergistically expressed pairs of ion channels and transporters in the ventricles.

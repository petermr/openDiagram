<p id="Par5">Osteoporosis (OP) is a common skeletal metabolic disorder hallmarked by a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture. This frequently leads to a significant elevation susceptibility to fracture because of increased bone fragility [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Osteoporotic fractures in the forearm, hip, and lumbar spine were reported to be associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially in the aged population and postmenopausal women [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Multiple heritable and nonheritable risk factors are involved in primary OP development, including aging, sex steroid deficiency, oxidative stress genetic mutations, and lifestyle-related factors such as physical inactivity, diet, and alcohol abuse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Concerning pathogenesis, the development of OP may result from inadequate bone formation during growth, excessive bone resorption, and bone remodeling deregulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The maintenance of bone homeostasis largely depends on the coordinated genesis and apoptosis of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and the decline and dysfunction of osteoblasts have been established as major pathogenic mechanisms underlying OP development [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although remarkable advances have been achieved during the past decades in OP treatment through the application of estrogen, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin, their overall efficacies remain limited because of multiple side-effects, high expense, and long treatment courses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recently, the transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) represents a promising strategy for treating OP because of their pluripotent potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Such treatments are urgently needed to effectively promote BMSC osteogenic differentiation toward osteoblasts.

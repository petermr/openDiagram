0: Data presented in this study were captured in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 2016) and statistical analysis conducted in GraphPad Prism software (Graphpad Prism version 6.01, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA).
1: Data are represented by the mean  standard error of the mean (SEM).
2: All data were normally distributed, as determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test and thus the unpaired Students t-test was used to test for significant differences between STD and CD groups.
3: P  0.05 were considered statistically significant.
4: A one-way analysis of variance for the  Slc27a3 pyrosequencing was performed to calculate statistical significance of methylation between the two diet groups and at which CpG site methylation differed in CD vs STD fed rats.

<p id="Par22">The effect of translocation stress on the freshwater mussel immune system is worthy of further investigation. In addition to differential expression of immune related transcripts, we noticed that the subset of up-regulated transcripts had a surprising number of BLAST hits to ciliates such as 
 <italic>Paramecium</italic> and 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. It may be that the compromised immune system of the chronically stressed mussels allowed for increased bacterial growth on the mucosal gill surface and thus to greater concentration of bactivorous ciliates. Water in the facility may also carry a higher ciliate load compared to that of the natural river environment from which these mussels were collected. Most studies have described no adverse effects of ciliate presence in freshwater mussels

 </sup>. However, it is important to note that genomes of freshwater mussels are poorly understood, and these BLAST hits could be due to a paucity of comparative genomic resources and knowledge of horizontal gene transfer in bivalves

 </sup>. Only 19% of our transcriptome received BLAST hits, leaving most assembled transcripts with no known putative function, a direct consequence of a lack of fully annotated freshwater mussel genomes. Nevertheless, future work on the interplay between freshwater mussel immune response and microbiome could provide useful information about stress-induced changes in freshwater mussel health.

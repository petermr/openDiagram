0: The gels were captured at 300 dpi with an Image Scanner (Amershan pharmacia biotech, Piscataway, NJ).
1: The spot intensities were determined by Image Master 2D platinum 7.0 (GE).
2: All the experiments were done in triplicates to ensure reproducibility.
3: Statistical analysis of protein variations was carried out in 2D gels prepared from three replicates in each group.
4: In each group, matched spots with coefficient variation less than 50% on vol.
5: % were included for further between group analyses.
6: Student's  t-test analysis on vol.
7: % of matched spots between groups was done to find out significant expressional changes ( P< 0.05).
8: Proteins determined to be differentially expressed were selected for MS identification.

<p>The XIAP interference target of the present study was based upon that in the study by Bilim 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b18-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which had verified that there were no homologous sequences between this fragment and other genes, and that the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) containing this fragment effectively downregulated the expression of XIAP. The target sequence was 5′-AGGTGAAGGTGATAAAGTA-3′. The BLOCK-iT™ U6 RNAi Entry Vector kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was applied for construction. Based upon the selected target sequence, the oligonucleotide sequences of shRNA used were: Top strand, 5′-CACCGAGGTGAAGGTGATAAAGTACGAATACTTTATCACCTTCACC-3′, and bottom strand, 5′-AAAAGGTGAAGGTGATAAAGTATTCGTACTTTATCACCTTCACCTC-3′.

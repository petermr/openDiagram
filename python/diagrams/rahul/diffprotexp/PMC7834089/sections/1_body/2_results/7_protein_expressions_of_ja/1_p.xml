<p>Based on above results, inhibiting or activating CAP by vagotomy or pnu282987 regulates differentiation of Th cell subsets, but the underlying mechanisms whereby this occurs are unknown. The NF-κB signaling pathway is critical for the activation of immune cells and formation of inflammatory cytokines [

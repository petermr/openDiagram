<p id="Par34">For small proteins with less than 200 amino acids, the structures were predicted using an ab initioÂ structure prediction tool QUARK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], which has shown top-ranking performance in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments consistently [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Since template-free, ab initio methods work best on small proteins, QUARK has a size limit of 200 amino acids, and larger proteins were predicted using the template-based I-TASSER [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] instead.

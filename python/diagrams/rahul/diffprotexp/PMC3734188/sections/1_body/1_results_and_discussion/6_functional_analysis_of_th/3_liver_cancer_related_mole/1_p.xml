<p>The main diseases in which the non-secretory proteins participated were liver hyperplasia/hyper-proliferation, liver hepatitis, liver steatohepatitis, liver steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). These proteins included PAK1, SOD1, BZW1, IQGAP1, GSTO1, MAT1A and FASN. Certain cancer-related pathways were over-represented, such as the PI3, Ras, EGF, FGF and angiogenesis pathways (data not shown). The proteins involved in these pathways were PAK1, Grb2, Ywhab and Ppp2r1a. Most of these proteins showed a higher relative abundance in cancer perfusates and may be involved in metastasis.

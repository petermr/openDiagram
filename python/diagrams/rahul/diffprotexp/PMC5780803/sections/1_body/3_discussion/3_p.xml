<p>XIAP may affect cell transformation and tumorigenesis through the p53 and Wnt pathways in RCC. p53 protein serves an important role in coping with different types of stress, including DNA damage, oncogene activation and hypoxia. However, the mutant p53 gene has emerged as a proto-oncogene that can promote the occurrence and development of a tumor (

The Wnt signaling pathway also serves an important role in embryonic cell development, proliferation, transformation, cell adhesion, cell survival and apoptosis. A recent study demonstrated that inappropriate activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in the occurrence and metastasis of tumor invasion (

The present study revealed that the expression of the protein, S100A4, which can regulate the p53 pathway, was significantly different in the two cell lines. Furthermore, the fold-change of UDGH demonstrated that XIAP has other biological functions through the Wnt signaling pathway.

<p>Therefore, accurately depicting a biological system such as a cancer cell requires knowledge about elements’ interactions, and in particular about the regulatory layer described as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Gene regulatory networks, like all biological networks, represent biological components as nodes and their interactions, either physical or functional, as edges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09461-f001">Figure 1</xref>). GRNs are the ideal reconstruction of interactions between genetic elements, comprising the activity of transcription factors (TFs) on their targets’ expression, post-translational modifications influencing a protein’s impact on other elements of the network, epigenetic modifications altering transcription and many additional levels of regulation. While the overall goal of most biological network studies is the inference of GRNs, this is a complex and laborious task that is generally approached by setting some simplifying assumptions and by analysing one kind of relationship at a time, based on physical or other kinds of interactions, as described below.

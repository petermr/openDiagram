<p>lncRNAs do not encode proteins and they function through cis- or trans-regulation of protein-coding genes (
 <xref rid="b27-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). For the target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs, the functions of these lncRNAs were indirectly predicted according to the target genes. GO and KEGG pathway analyses of the target genes of the differential lncRNAs were then performed.

<p>In order to more accurately explore the mechanisms of Th cells differentiation, we isolated and cultured the splenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from CVB3-induced mice on d 7. The α7nAChR agonist Pnu and the α7nAChR antagonist MLA were administered to active and block CAP. MLA was used in vitro experiments instead of vagotomy. A selective NF-κB inhibitor PDTC and a STAT3 inhibitor NSC were used to detect the effect of signal pathways. According to the groups, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were cultured with different treatments for next 5 d. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7a</xref>, the phosphorylation protein expression ratios of p-JAK2/JAK2 and p-STAT3/STAT3 were decreased by 0.35- and 0.38-fold, and the phosphorylation ratios of p-P65/P65 and p-IκB-α/IκB-α were increased by 1.39- and 1.78-fold in MLA group compared with PBS group (

 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). These results were similar with those 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, administering PDTC significantly reduced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκB, while administering NSC decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 and increased phosphorylation of JAK2 in Pnu or MLA group, respectively (Pnu+PDTC versus Pnu, MLA+PDTC versus MLA, Pnu+NSC versus Pnu, MLA+NSC versus MLA,

<p>Pre-incubation of cells with the K

 <sub>i</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3d,g</xref>), but eliminated peak SOCE responses larger than 300 nM and shifted the maximum of the distribution of peak SOCE values from 130 nM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>, control) to 70 nM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3e</xref>, ShK-223). The difference between the values of peak SOCE in control cells and cells preincubated with ShK-223 was significant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3h</xref>). The relationship between resting [Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>]
 <sub>i</sub> and peak SOCE still displayed a mild positive correlation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">figure 3f</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that similarly to T lymphocytes, blockade of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 channels significantly reduces SOCE in LPS differentiated microglia. The extent of the inhibition varied among cells with a greater effect on cells expressing large magnitude (&gt; 300 nM) SOCE. The specific characteristics of the cells with high and low peak SOCE remain to be determined.

<p>Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction induced by a disordered host response to infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sepsis is identified in up to 39% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 26% ICU patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A normal host response to infection involves activation of phagocytic cells and production of inflammatory mediators, and contributes to the repair of injured tissue. Uncontrolled generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which exceeds the boundary of local infected environment and leads to a more generalized response, will give rise to the initiation of sepsis [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common disorder which gives rise to approximately 1.7 million deaths and affects about over 13 million people annually, among which patients living in developing countries account for the majority [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. AKI is associated with considerable morbidity and high costs since patients who have survived though are likely to suffer from long-term impacts of AKI such as development of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Septic AKI is a commonly diagnosed AKI syndrome which occurs in nearly half of all AKI cases and is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The pathogenic mechanisms of septic AKI involve the direct interaction of resident renal cells with circulating pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators, and apoptosis is one major cellular injury induced during sepsis [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although there are consensus definitions of sepsis and AKI, the molecular mechanisms for the pathogenesis of septic AKI remain largely undiscovered.

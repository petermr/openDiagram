 <caption> Calculated Raman signals of solid and liquid H 2 as a function of pressures. a Pressure dependence of vibron frequencies from the solid H 2 at T = 150 K, arrows emphasise the turnover of the peak frequency. b Pressure dependence of vibron frequencies from the liquid H 2 at T = 1000 K. c The mean H–H bond length as a function of pressures, the dotted horizontal line is to guide the eye. d The pressure-dependent E2g phonon frequency compared with our DFT, recent experiments 58, 46 , and Silvera–Goldman potential 43, 44 . </caption>

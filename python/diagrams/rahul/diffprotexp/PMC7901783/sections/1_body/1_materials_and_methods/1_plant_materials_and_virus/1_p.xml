 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] were surface-sterilized in 1% hypochlorite solution (v/v) for 3 minutes followed by three rinses with sterile deionized water. Seed were sown in greenhouse growing media (Promix) and grown in growth chambers under controlled conditions [60% humidity; 16/8 hours (light/dark); 23°C]. Freeze-dried CMV (strain Kaper S) infected tobacco tissues were obtained from ATCC (PV-242). 
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> cv T.R.Madole was used as the propagation host. Leaves of seven-week-old quinoa plants were mechanically inoculated with CMV-infected tobacco leaves or mock-inoculated with phosphate buffer (pH:7.0). Inoculated leaves were harvested at 1 or4 days post infection (dpi). The experiment was designed as a 3×2×2×3 factorial [three varieties; two treatments (virus or mock); two sample times (1 or 4 dpi); three biological replicates]. Samples times were chosen because in preliminary studies, no symptoms were observed at 24 h and symptom development typically began by Day 4 (data not shown). Excised leaf samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until RNA extraction. To verify successful inoculation, virus- and mock-inoculated tissues were tested by CMV AgriStrips (Bioreba, Reinach, Switzerland) according to manufacturer’s instruction.

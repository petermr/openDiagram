Peroxides generated by the oxidation of fatty acids can affect the quality of oils and also food containing them. Oxidation can be promoted by proxidant metals such as iron and copper, temperature, light, sensitizers such as chlorophyll. Olive oil can have very high PV among oils used in this study. Commercially available virgin olive oils can have PV values of up to 15 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg oil.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, flaxseed oil can also oxidize very fast and can have very high PV because they contain high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

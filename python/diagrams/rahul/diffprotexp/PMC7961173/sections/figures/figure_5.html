 <caption> Time-dependent differential gene expression after DCVC treatment in HTR-8 SVneo cells. Comparison of differential gene expression across DCVC treatment durations (6 versus 12 h) was evaluating by calculating pairwise correlation coefficients of logFC estimates ( P &lt; 1.0 × 10 –15). Spaghetti plot depicting time-dependent expression levels for differential expressed genes meeting FDR and logFC criteria (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) for a 10 µM DCVC and C) 20 µM DCVC treatment. Tan dots represent individual genes differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) with 12-h treatment. Lines connecting yellow dots to tan dots represent the same respective genes with 6-h expression levels. Venn diagrams depicting overlap in differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35[FC &gt; 1.3]) between 6 and 12 h DCVC treatment for: b 0 (control) vs.10 µM DCVC and d 0 (control) vs. 20 µM DCVC </caption>

<p id="p0060">To assess the potential clinical utility of fluoxetine in the prevention or mitigation of cytokine storm syndromes, and to investigate the mechanism by which fluoxetine realizes its anti-inflammatory effect, we generated differential gene expression signatures produced by fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, or dexamethasone drug treatments. We also generated differential gene expression signatures produced by genetic knockdown of inflammatory genes related to the initiation and maintenance of IL6-mediated cytokine storm. We then compared the drug treatment signatures with the genetic knockdown signatures to generate concordance scores which measure the degree to which a given drug treatment parallels genetic knockdown of a given inflammatory gene. When a drug treatment signature is highly concordant with a genetic knockdown signature, we surmise that this drug and this gene knockdown induce a similar pattern of gene expression changes

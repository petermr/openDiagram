<p>Gene ontology is a comprehensive approach, which indicates properties of genes and gene products in organisms. In order to get a detailed description, GO was further categorized into three components e.g. biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Biological process-related GO terms between Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice disclose 401 differentially expressed proteins that mainly participate in 28 distinct functions. The biological process was found to be highly enriched in the ‘metabolic process’ (17.66%) and 17.52% for the ‘cellular process’ (

Cell and cell part were found to be enriched (26.00%) in the ‘cellular component’ category, while ionic binding (42.52%) and catalytic activity (40.63%) were most significantly expressed in ‘molecular function’. The differential GO analysis of Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice demonstrates a greater number of down-regulated genes than up-regulated ones.

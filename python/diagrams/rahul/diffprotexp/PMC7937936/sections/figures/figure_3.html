 <caption> Analysis of genes affecting the TME and their associated GO and KEGG enrichment. (A, B) Venn plots showing 260 up-regulated DEGs and 15 down-regulated DEGs shared by ImmuneScore and StromalScore (thresholds for differential gene expression set at an FDR adjusted P-value &lt;0.05 and log2FC&gt;1). (C, D) GO enrichment analysis for 275 microenvironmentally relevant DEGs, the statistical threshold set at P-value &lt; 0.05 with an FDR adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05. (E, F) KEGG enrichment analysis for 275 microenvironmentally relevant DEGs, the statistical threshold set at P value &lt; 0.05 with an FDR adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05. </caption>

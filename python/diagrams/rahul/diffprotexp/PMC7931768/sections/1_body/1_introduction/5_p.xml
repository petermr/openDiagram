<p>This pilot research study assessed whether an adhesive tape device (

To compare RNA tape gene signature results with a traditional sampling method, from each skin lesion, paired tape RNA and punch biopsy samples were taken. Using punch biopsies, protein immunoreactivity from semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) was correlated with gene signature scores from tape RNA.

<p id="Par10">Results of the GO analysis for H1 vs H3 and H3 vs H8 following GO terms; cellular components, biological processes and molecular functions were markedly associated with ovary development and hormone production (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The 3 top biological processes consisted of progesterone metabolic process, ovarian follicular development and germ cell development (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>a). In terms of molecular function, H1 vs H3 were mainly enriched in growth factor binding, insulin-like growth factor receptor binding, estrogen receptor binding, and cyclin-dependent protein activity. The cellular components identified were significantly enriched in high-density lipoprotein particle, voltage-gated calcium channel complex and RNA polymerase transcription factor complex (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>a).

<p id="Par39">It is believed that cell wall associated proteins i.e. expansins, xyloglucan endo-β-transglucosylases/hydrolases, endo-1,4-β-D-glucanase, play a key role in cell wall expansion and enlargement. Along with these extensibility proteins, some cell-modifying proteins are also important for the cell wall plasticity which involves polygalacturonase, pectin acetylesterase, pectin methyl esterase, cellulase etc.

 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN29442_c0_g1_i1), cellulase (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN42285_c4_g3_i5) with the higher level of salinity. The cell wall components such as cellulose and hemicellulose are the major components which are responsible for the characteristic thickness of secondary cell wall. In the process of secondary cell wall formation, the precursor of lignin get cross-linked into the cell wall which depends on the presence/absence of cell wall peroxidases and laccases

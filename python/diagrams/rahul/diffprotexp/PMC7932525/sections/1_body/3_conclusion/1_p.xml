<p>Overall, our data confirm that directional RNA deep sequencing is a more thorough method of analyzing transcriptional regulation in heterocysts and vegetative cells by cell separation procedures, providing a systematic view of transcriptome level differences between heterocysts and vegetative cells under conditions of nitrogen step-down. Our results show that heterocysts and vegetative cells function by coordinating activities related to photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. This direct comparison of transcript levels in NVs, NDVs, and NDHs revealed many characterized genes that are differentially regulated in the three cell types which should be further studied in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria under nitrogen deprivation conditions.</p>

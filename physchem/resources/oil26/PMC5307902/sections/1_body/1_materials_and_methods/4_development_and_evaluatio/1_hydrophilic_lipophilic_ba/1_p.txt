0: The emulsions were prepared following the spreadsheet design shown in  Table 1.
1: This spreadsheet includes two surfactants: one of a lipophilic nature [Span 80 , HLB=4.3] and the other of a hydrophilic nature [Tween 20 , HLB=16.7].
2: The final HLB value of each system varied according to the relative proportion of each surfactant.

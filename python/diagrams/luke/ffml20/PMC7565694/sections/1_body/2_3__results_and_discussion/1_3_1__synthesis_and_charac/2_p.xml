<p>The conventional two‒step thermal imidization method was used to prepare polyimide, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="polymers-12-02048-sch002">Scheme 2</xref>. The 2,7-CDA was reacted with PMDA in DMF to form a precursor PAA, which was then converted to 2,7-CPI by thermal cyclodehydration. GPC was employed to measure the molecular weight of PAA. The weight-average molecular weight (

 <sub>w</sub>) of the PAA was 3.67 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>, with a polydispersity index (

  <sub>w</sub>

 </italic>) of 1.96. The FT-IR was used to confirm the formation of 2,7-CPI in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S8</xref>. Compared with 2,7-CDA, the absorption peaks at 3318–3390 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (N‒H stretching) and 1617 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <italic>δ</italic> N‒H) disappeared in 2,7-CPI, meanwhile the characteristic peaks of the imide group at 1359 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (stretching of C‒N) and 1775, 1713 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (stretching of carbonyl) were observed, suggesting the successful reaction between 2,7-CDA and PMDA, and the complete imidization reaction of the PAA.

<p id="Par17">On further analysis, correlation between expression of viral entry genes and antiviral response genes was well-preserved during non-severe COVID-19, but was less prominent during severe COVID-19 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). A multiple linear regression model was fitted to determine the statistical significance of the relationship between viral entry gene 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> and viral defense genes. For patients with COVID-19 who were not admitted to ICU, there was a statistically significant relationship between viral defense genes and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> expression, the four predictors (
 <italic>MX1, TRIM25 SAMHD1</italic> and 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic>) accounted for 65.56% of the variance (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.656, p-value = 8.796
 <sup>–11</sup>). For patients with more severe symptoms (i.e. COVID-19 patients who were admitted to ICU), there was still a significant relationship between the four predictors and CTSL expression; however, these only accounted for 35.78% of the variance (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.3578, p-value = 7.086
 <sup>–05</sup>). There was no significant association between viral response genes and viral entry genes in control patients who did not have COVID-19.

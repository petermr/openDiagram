<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To visualise how low resource availability during the drought influenced body temperature and activity of our aardvarks, we graphed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) aardvark activity and body temperature, as a function of time of day, for a winter and summer month, during a drought year (rainfall in the lowest quartile of a 33-year record) and during a non-drought year (rainfall in the highest quartile of a 33-year record). In the absence of drought, body temperature assumed a bimodal rhythm, with elevated temperatures at night, coinciding with aardvarks&#8217; nocturnal activity, and a lower plateau (February 2014, summer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) or depression with slight decline (August 2014, winter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) coinciding with daily inactive phases inside the burrows. Over the winter month, which followed a non-drought summer, aardvarks shifted their activity to slightly earlier times of day than in summer, becoming partly diurnal, and the nocturnal peak in body temperature occurred somewhat earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

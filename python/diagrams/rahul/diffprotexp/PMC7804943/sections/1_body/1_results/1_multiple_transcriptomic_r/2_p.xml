<p id="Par8">To initially investigate global patterns in the data, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to each individual RNA-Seq analysis output. This analysis distinguishes datasets based on regional identities of neuronal subpopulations (Supplementary Fig.Â

 </sup>. Furthermore, APA, AS, and IR differences captured additional variation between subtypes. For example, APA differences defined a distinct cluster of neurons belonging to the proximal-distal axis, which is further explored below. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that different layers of post-transcriptional regulation differentially contribute to the spatial identity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

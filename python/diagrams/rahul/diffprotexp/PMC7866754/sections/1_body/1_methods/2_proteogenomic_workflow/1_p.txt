0: The novelty of proteogenomic analysis comes from matching the MS/MS spectra against a customized database constructed [ 28] based on the transcript information, instead of limiting the searches to known proteins as in the analysis by Lindner et al.
1: [ 37] and in most proteomic analyses [ 41].
2: In this work, a customized database was constructed from the transcripts assembled from the HISAT2-StringTie pipeline as described by Pertea et al.
3: [ 42] (Fig.
4: 1b).
5: However, one should be aware of the limitation of discovering novel ORFs using this approach, as it is just a computational prediction.

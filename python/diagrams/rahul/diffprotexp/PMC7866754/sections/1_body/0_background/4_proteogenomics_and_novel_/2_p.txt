0: The use of proteogenomic approach has gained its popularity given the increasing amount of transcriptome data available thanks to next-generation sequencing [ 31,  32], as well as the improved accuracy and resolution in MS data for proteomics [ 33].
1: For the larger human genome, it has been used to identify novel coding regions in normal tissues and cancer cell lines, where a significantly larger number of novel peptides were discovered in the latter, indicating the biological importance of unannotated coding sequences [ 34].
2: The proteogenomic methods are particularly valuable for non-model organisms like  P. falciparum, whose genome assembly and annotation tend to be incomplete, and protein database construction is difficult owing to the lack of close sequence relatives [ 35].
3: Previous successful examples include  Thermococcus gammatolerans, an archaea extremophile whose genome was sequenced and annotated using proteogenomic analysis [ 36].

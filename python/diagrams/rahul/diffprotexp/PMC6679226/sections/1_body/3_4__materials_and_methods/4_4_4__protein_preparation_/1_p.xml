<p>Equal amount of proteins (60 μg per BALF sample) were prepared for trypsin digestion by reducing the cysteines with dithiothreitol followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide. After chloroform-methanol precipitation, each protein pellet was digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. The digested product was labeled using a TMT 10-plex Reagent set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and stored at −80 °C until further use. The 10 samples analyzed included control (I.T. saline,

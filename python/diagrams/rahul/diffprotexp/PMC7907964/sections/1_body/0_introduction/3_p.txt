0: Glucocerebrosidase (GCase; Enzyme Commission 3.2.1.45), also known as acid- glucosidase (GBA) and glucosylceramidase, is a lysosomal enzyme that is responsible for the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside, an intermediate in the glycolipid metabolism and an abundant sphingolipid present in the plasma membranes.
1: It is encoded by the  GBA gene, which is located on chromosome 1q21, spans ~7.6 kb and contains 11 exons.
2: Mutations in the  GBA gene cause Gaucher's disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is characterized by the accumulation of glucocerebrosides in macrophages referred to as Gaucher cells.
3: There are three clinical subtypes of GD that have been recognized: Type 1 is non-neuronopathic, whereas types 2 and 3 are acute and chronic neuronopathic, respectively.
4: Based on the Human Gene Mutation Database, >400 mutations have been reported in the  GBA gene ( hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/gene.php?gene=GBA; accessed July 2020).
5: The majority of these mutations are missense, followed by small deletions, splicing defects, complex rearrangements and small insertions.
6: Of note, a highly homologous pseudogene ( GBAP) is located ~16 kb downstream from the  GBA gene and shares 96% sequence identity to the functional  GBA gene ( 8).
7: The presence of this pseudogene at the same locus causes recombination events between the  GBA and  GBAP genes, thus resulting in several different mutations in GD ( 9, 10).

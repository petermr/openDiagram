<p>Differentially expressed genes identified from the PCR arrays were further assessed by qRT-PCR using Taqman probes. Complementary DNA was generated by reverse transcribing a total of 20 ng RNA using the High Capacity Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies, CA, USA) following instructions from the manufacturer. Taqman gene expression probes and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) were used to measure the transcriptional status of 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> (Rn01455596_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) in SAT and VAT from STD and CD-fed rats. Relative expression levels were calculated using the standard curve method. B2m (Rn00560865_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and Rplp1 (Rn03467157_gH, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) were selected as the two best endogenous controls from the PCR array using Norm finder [

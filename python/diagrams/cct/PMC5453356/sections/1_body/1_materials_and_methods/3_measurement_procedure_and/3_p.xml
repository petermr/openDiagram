<p>For the investigation of weak precipitation reactions within aluminum alloys, the alloyed sample was scanned in the DSC and compared to an inert reference sample [
 <xref rid="b27-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This reference ideally should have the same absolute heat capacity as the sample, and pure aluminum is commonly used.

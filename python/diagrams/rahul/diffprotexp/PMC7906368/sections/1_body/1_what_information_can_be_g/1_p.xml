<p>Basic metaproteomes can provide diverse types of information about microbiomes, including composition, abundance dynamics, and the metabolism and physiology of individual members, including the host. Additionally, gene expression responses to changing conditions, localization of potential host–microbe interaction proteins within a host–microbe system, and the uptake of substrates labeled with heavy carbon or nitrogen can be determined [

0: Protein pellets were solubilized in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.8) (Sigma Aldrich) before reduction in 5 mM dithiothreitol followed by alkylation in 10 mM iodoacetamide in the dark (with alkylation quenched with 5 mM dithiothreitol).
1: To remove interfering reagents, proteins were precipitated via the methanol/chloroform approach [ 95] and transferred to 8 M Urea in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.8) and protein concentration quantitated by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce).
2: A 2-stage digestion was performed first with Lys-C (Wako) overnight at 30C (1 g enzyme to 100 g protein), followed with Trypsin (Promega) digestion at 37C (1 g enzyme to 100 g protein) for 6 hours.
3: Samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to 1% concentration acid and then desalted using solid phase extraction (SPE) with in-house tips packed with styrene divinyl benzene (3M Empore).
4: Peptide extracts were dried by vacuum centrifuge, reconstituted in 200 mM N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N  -(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 8), followed by quantification via Micro BCA (Pierce).

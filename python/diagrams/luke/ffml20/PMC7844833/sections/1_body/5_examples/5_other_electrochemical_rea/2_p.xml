<p>In addition to CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR, ORR and OER, catalysts for other electrochemical reactions have also been actively studied by XAS. For example, 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS studies have been carried out on catalysts used in the reactions taking place at the fuel cell anode, that is, oxidation of hydrogen, alcohols, or other small organic molecules. Commonly, Pt-based catalysts are used for these reactions. Applications of XAS for studies of the electrochemical oxidation of ethanol over Pt-based catalysts recently were reviewed by Marinkovic et al.

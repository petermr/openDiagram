<p>Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that was first described by Tomisaku (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The coronary arteries are the most affected vessels (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), now the leading cause of acquired heart disease in developed countries (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The incidence of coronary artery lesion (CAL) varies from regions and races (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) [19% in the UK (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), 3.2% in the USA (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), 3.5% in Canada (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), 15.9% in Shanghai (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and 9.7% in Japan (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)]. Although the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to be effective in decreasing the incidence of CAL formation in the acute phase (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the pathophysiological mechanism of CAL formation remains unknown. Orenstein et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) demonstrated three interrelated processes of CAL formation in autopsy specimens from patients who died of KD with cardiovascular events. The studies showed that the infiltration of neutrophils in the vascular wall was stimulated by the damage of endothelial cells at an early stage, resulting in a dysfunction of vascular barrier functions (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The infiltration of inflammatory cells depends on adhesion molecules and selectin family, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and E-selectin, etc. (

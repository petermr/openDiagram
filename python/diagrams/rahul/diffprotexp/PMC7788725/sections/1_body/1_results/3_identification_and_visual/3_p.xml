<p id="Par38">For the target genes of nucleoplasmic LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes in control (SICER), we also identified 183 genes, of which 85 were up-regulated and 98 were down-regulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Similar to the above results, we obtained 60 candidate genes. The binding genes of nucleoplasmic LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes in DCM (SICER), 9 DEGs were displayed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). However, there was no overlap gene between DEGs analysis and functional enrichment analysis. Here, we noticed that even though there were unique genes in the DCM groups through the ChIP-seq, the candidate genes were not obtained because the unique binding genes to euchromatin in DCM were not changed by RNA-seq analysis. In the final phase, we constructed the interaction network between LMNA mutation and its candidate genes through Cytoscape database. The correlation network revealed that LMNA mutation is mainly associated with 65 candidate genes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b shows possible LMNA regulatory and co-expression networks. Four genes were up-regulated, while 1 was down-regulated in 5 candidate genes identified by MACS. Among the 60 genes identified by SICER, 24 of them were up-regulated, while 36 were down-regulated. We selected 65 candidate genes to visualize their expression patterns and chromosome locations, and found that chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 16 contained the most candidate genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

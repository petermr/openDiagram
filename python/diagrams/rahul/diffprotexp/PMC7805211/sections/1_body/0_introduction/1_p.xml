<p id="Par2">Approximately 1 in 3000 live births are affected by the tumor predisposition condition, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) making it the most common single gene-inherited condition in humans. One of the clinical hallmarks and diagnostic sine qua non of NF1 is the formation of benign peripheral nerve tumors called neurofibromas. Neurofibromas are a major cause of disfigurement, pain, and morbidity in NF1. These issues are predominantly attributable to two types of neurofibromas: dermal or cutaneous neurofibromas (CNFs) that develop in the skin, and plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) that arise from nerves situated in deeper anatomic compartments. Even though CNFs and PNFs share similar histology, they are pathophysiologically distinct. NF1-related PNFs are associated with the development of high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are the leading cause of death of NF1 patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although CNFs do not become malignant, these benign tumors are often painful and disfiguring. These critical distinctions between CNFs and PNFs are not explained by genomic and transcriptomic studies that failed to identify consistent alterations in these tumors [

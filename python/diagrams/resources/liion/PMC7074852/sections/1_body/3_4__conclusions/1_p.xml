<p>In this work, Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanowires, with high electrochemical performance, have been synthesized by a simple and scalable hydrothermal approach. The material shows initial specific discharge and charge capacities of 1120 and 972 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at current density of 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. After 50 cycles, its discharge capacity maintains 880 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the coulombic efficiency is close to 100%. After a high current charge/discharge test, the reversible specific capacity can still be restored to 780 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is ca. 88% of the initial capacity. EIS and CV tests have proved that co-doping with appropriate amount of Cu and Ni could significantly enhance ion diffusion and electron conduction during charge-discharge process. We attribute the high performance to relatively low activation energy for electron transfer between Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>/Ni
 <sup>3+</sup> and Co
 <sup>2+</sup>/Co
 <sup>3+</sup>, the electronic conductivity and structure stability for Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanowires are improved greatly. Therefore, it is important to further research into other multi-component transition metal oxides as anode materials in lithium battery.

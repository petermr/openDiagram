<p>The process of tuberization is largely dependent on photoperiod [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], phytohormones [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and day and night temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The exact mechanism of potato tuberization and the effect of temperature on potatoes is not well understood. However, heat stress can lead to reduced yield due to less photosynthate available for plant growth and partitioning into potato tubers [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Heat stress causes physiological changes in tubers like early sprouting, altered tuber shape, tuber cracking, changes in texture, taste formation, low dry matter, etc. Also, heat stress can induce necrosis, loss of chlorophyll with reduced stem thickness, and an increase in the quantity of reducing sugars [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Henceforth, a detailed understanding of the regulatory network is needed to develop lines that provide resistance/tolerance to heat stress. In the present study, we identified fifty-four 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> expressed during heat stress (heating at 35 Â°C for 24h), and out of these, a total of twelve 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> had FC &gt;5. The 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> 1, 5, 7, 8, 15, 19, 23, 30, 37, 41, 62, 66 and 82 had positive expression of &gt; 2 FC, whereas 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 3, 24, 27, 32, and 53 were negatively expressed. The overall expression study of 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> during abiotic (heat, water, salt, mannitol) stress conditions led to the identification of a total of 33 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> stresses (

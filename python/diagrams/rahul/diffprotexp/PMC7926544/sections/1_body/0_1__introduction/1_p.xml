<p>The electroneutral solute carrier family 12A (SLC12A) transport family encompasses several branches of homologous genes [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; each of them encodes unique cation-chloride co-transporter (CCC). The kidney Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC2), which is encoded by the SLC12A1 gene [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is expressed in the apical membrane of ascending limb of Henle epithelial cells (TAL) and the macula densa [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NKCC2 is the pacemaker of TAL sodium chloride reabsorption which accounts for 20â€“30% of the filtered load of NaCl [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It plays therefore a pivotal role in urinary concentration and regulation of the blood pressure [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given its high reuptake capacity, changes in NKCC2 transport activity can significantly alter renal NaCl reabsorption, leading eventually to disruption of the homoeostasis of salt and water handling [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Such changes in NKCC2 activity may be associated to the co-transporter itself (i.e., gain or loss-of-function mutations) or to alterations in the regulatory pathways that control NKCC2 trafficking and activity [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, loss of function mutations in 
 <italic>SLC12A1</italic> can cause Bartter I syndrome, a rare genetic kidney disease marked by severe natriuresis with normal or low blood pressure, hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidism, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Opposite to genetic inactivation of NKCC2, enhanced NKCC2 activity has been associated with salt-sensitive hypertension in animal models and in humans, in particular African-Americans [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. NKCC2 is the target of loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, commonly used to lower BP [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, a large genetic screening in participants of the Framingham Heart Study revealed that rare and subtle heterozygous mutations of the 
 <italic>SLC12A1</italic> gene, protect against hypertension, further proving that factors regulating the activity of NKCC2 are key determinants of the control of BP in the general population [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All of these data emphasize the important role of NKCC2 in electrolytes homeostasis and blood pressure control in normal physiology and in pathogenesis of Bartter syndrome. Despite the major role of NKCC2 in the regulation of sodium balance and blood pressure, the underlying mechanisms and respective protein networks regulating its transport activity at the molecular level namely in its trafficking, targeting, and turnover remain largely unidentified.

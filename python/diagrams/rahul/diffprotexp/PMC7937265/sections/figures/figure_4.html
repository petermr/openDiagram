 <caption> Differential methylation analyses. a Methylation patterns across genomic features in the hypothalamus (HYPO; left column) and nucleus taeniae of the amygdala (TnA; right column), including the 2 Kb region upstream of the transcription start site (TSS), gene body, and the 2 Kb region downstream of the transcription termination site (TTS). Shading indicates 95% CI. b Genes with differential expression and CG methylation in the HYPO. Genes in quadrants I and IV show an inverse pattern of expression and methylation. Descriptions of gene symbols can be found in Supplementary Table S7, Additional file 1 </caption>

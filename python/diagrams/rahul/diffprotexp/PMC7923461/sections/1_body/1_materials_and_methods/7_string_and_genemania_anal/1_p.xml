<p id="Par43">To obtain the information on protein–protein interaction, most scientists prefer using the following two datasets: STRING and GeneMANIA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The protein–protein interaction network of TUBA1C was predicted with the help of STRING and GeneMANIA datasets.

<p>All dilatometers utilize measurement of dimensions (length and/or diameter) and temperatures during heating and cooling. Each material consists of millions of atoms that are interconnected, and due to the increase in temperature, these atoms begin to move (oscillate). The total volume of material begins to change, which is associated with a change in the length of the material. The thermal expansion of all crystalline substances is directly related to the action of internal atomic forces in the crystal lattice [

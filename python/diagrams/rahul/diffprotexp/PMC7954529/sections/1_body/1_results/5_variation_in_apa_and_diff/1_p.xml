<p>Given the well-characterized molecular connection between APA and the regulation of protein translation, we hypothesized that genes with inter-species differences in APA are also more likely to be differentially translated between the species (

Genes with significant inter-species differences in isoform diversity, but without significant differences in the usage at individual PAS, are enriched among the differentially translated gene set (1.21×, hypergeometric test, p=0.011;

<p id="Par36">In order to confirm regulatory action of MIR on auxin and ethylene dynamics in the early stage grain filling qRT-PCR studies targeting genes for auxin and ethylene synthesis, perception and signal transduction were conducted. Although the expression of auxin pathway genes was not encouraging many of the genes controlling ethylene biology expressed profusely. Genetic expression for ethylene receptors ERS1, ERS2, ETR2 and ETR3 and signal transducers EIN2, EIN3, ERF2, ERF3, EREBP1 and EREBP5 far outstripped in basal corresponding to apical spikelet and cultivar SR-159 in comparison to SR-157 in the first 5 days of grain filling (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The expression increased significantly between 0 and 5 days after anthesis and came to below detection level on day 10 post anthesis. Similar to ethylene receptors and signal carrier proteins, expression DAO (Dioxygenase for Auxin Oxidation) was higher in basal verses apical spikelet and V1 verses V2 cultivar (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). According to UniProtKB–Q01IX6 (DAO_ORYSI) BLAST Align Format, DAO is essential for auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis in reproductive organs of

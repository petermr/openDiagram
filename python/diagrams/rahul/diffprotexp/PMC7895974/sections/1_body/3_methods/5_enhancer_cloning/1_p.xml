<p id="Par34">Chick genomic DNA (gRNA) was extracted from HH14 embryos using Invitrogen Purelink gDNA extraction kit (Cat no. K1820-00). Human genomic DNA was isolated from HeLa cells. Putative enhancers were amplified using primers with specific sequence tails to enable cloning into reporter vector using a modified GoldenGate protocol

 </sup> under the following conditions: 94 °C, 3 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s; 55 °C, 15 s; 68 °C, 3 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s; 63 °C, 15 s; 68 °C, 3 min; and final step of 72 °C, 4 min. Amplicons were purified using Qiagen PCR Cleanup (Cat no. 28104) and pooled with pTK nanotag reporter vector with T4 DNA ligase (Promega) and BsmBI (NEB) restriction enzyme. This reaction was prepared for T4-mediated ligation and BsmBI digestion under the following conditions: 25 cycles of 37 °C, 2 min; 16 °C, 5 min; a single step of 55 °C, 5 min; and a final step of 80 °C, 5 min. For mutagenesis of specific sites in enhancers we utilised FastCloning methodology

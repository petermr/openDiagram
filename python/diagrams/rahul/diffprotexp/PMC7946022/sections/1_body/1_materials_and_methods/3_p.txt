0: In vitro S. aureus vancomycin susceptibility testing in single and mixed biofilms .
1: Single- and mixed-species biofilms were grown in the wells of 96-well polystyrene flat-bottom plates as we previously performed [ 29].
2: C. albicans and  S. aureus cell suspensions were adjusted to a final concentration of 1  10 6 cells/ml in RPMI 1640-HEPES medium and 100 l of cell suspensions were seeded in the wells individually or in combination.
3: Plates were incubated for 90 mins at 37C, then washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells.
4: Fresh medium (100 l) was added to each well, and biofilms were allowed to form for 24 hrs at 37C.
5: Following incubation, wells were gently washed with PBS to remove non-sessile cells.
6: Vancomycin (800 g/ml) was added to wells, and plates were incubated for 24 hrs at 37C.
7: Following incubation, wells were sonicated to disrupt biofilms, and cell suspensions were diluted and plated on  S. aureus-specific and  Candida-specific chromogenic medium (CHROMagar; DRG International, Inc.) for CFU (colony forming units) enumeration.
8: Control wells with no vancomycin were included; vancomycin concentration used was determined based on our previously published work on mixed biofilm assays [ 29].

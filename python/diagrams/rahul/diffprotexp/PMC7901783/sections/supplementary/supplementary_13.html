 <caption> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on gene expression of quinoa varieties during time-course cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection. The treatments are infected quinoa inoculated with CMV or control as mock-inoculated samples; in varieties, ‘Jessie’ is low saponin (sweet variety), ‘QQ74’ is the medium saponin (sweet variety), and ‘Red Head’ is high saponin (bitter variety); and the time (1 or 4) is the harvesting time post CMV inoculation (dpi).

<p>The increasing proliferation of SARS-CoV-2-infection cases and the lack of specific therapeutics and vaccines have caused concern among public authorities and international agencies, resulting in the mobilization of the scientific community to understand the disease and clinical outcomes aiming to improve treatments and find ways to prevent COVID-19 cases.

<p>We further attempt to measure the correlation between the number of hydrogen bonds and the parameters logBB, logPS, and TPSA as we did previously in the case of 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> and 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>neq</sub>. Although in the latter cases we had found a remarkable correlation, the correlation between the number of hydrogen bonds and the experimental logBB and logPS seems weaker (e.g., see 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>, where the case of GROMOS54a7 force-field for the DOPC membrane model and pulling velocity 
 <italic>v</italic> = 0.5 nm/ns is illustrated. Similar results we have obtained for all cases considered in our study). This is clearly manifested by the values of the correlation coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.24 and 0.42, for the number of hydrogen bonds vs logBB and logPS, respectively; 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>), which however clearly indicate that the number of hydrogen bonds decreases as the values of logBB and logPS increase. On the contrary, the number of hydrogen bonds increases with the increase of the TPSA with the correlation coefficient being 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.48, which is consistent with the correlation observed for the 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> and 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>neq</sub>. Our results show that compounds with low logBB and logPS and high TPSA are able to form a larger number of hydrogen bonds with the lipids, which may suggest that the low BBB permeability be related to the ability of hydrogen-bond formation between the compounds and the lipids or the solvent. However, our results also suggest that this correlation be rather weaker than the one observed between 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> and 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>neq</sub>, and logBB and logPS, which suggests that other factors might contribute to this correlation.

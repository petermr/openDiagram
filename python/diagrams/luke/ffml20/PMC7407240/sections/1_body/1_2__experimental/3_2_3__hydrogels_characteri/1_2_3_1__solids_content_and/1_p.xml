<p>The solids content, i.e., the percentual dry weight (
 <italic>SC</italic>, %) of the hydrogels was determined as the percentage ratio between the mass of the oven-dried gels (105 Â°C, 5 h) and the mass of the as-obtained gels before drying (

 <xref rid="B28-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Three determinations were employed for both the solids content, respectively. The gel content for each type of material, and the average values were presented in

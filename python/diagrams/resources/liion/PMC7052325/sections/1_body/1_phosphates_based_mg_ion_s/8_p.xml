<p>Inspired by the fabrication of amorphous solid conductor for LIBs, such as Li
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, Su and Tsuruoka proposed a plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition method to fabricate amorphous oxygen-deficient Mg
 <sub>2.4</sub>P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5.4</sub> thin film in 2019 (Cengiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Su et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It exhibited an ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 500°C. The hopping conduction of Mg ions in the disordered amorphous phosphate matrix was believed to result in the conductivity.

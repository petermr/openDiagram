<p>Top 100 DEGs and differential metabolites (top 50 upregulated and top 50 downregulated) were selected for further correlation analysis by calculating Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients on the relative gene expression and metabolite content data between different VASCs with SASCs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS9">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). The correlation value and 
 <italic>P</italic>-value were used to assess the relationship between metabolites with genes which are shown by Heatmap and association analysis network diagram.

<p id="Par29">Besides the genes associated with cell cycle, numerous genes associated with DNA replication, such as

 <italic>MCM3</italic>, 
 <italic>MCM4</italic>, 
 <italic>MCM5</italic>, 
 <italic>POLE</italic>, 
 <italic>FEN1</italic>, 
 <italic>RFC4</italic>, were also found to be differentially expressed between Gp and Gd cells. MCM2 and MCM7 load as a double hexamer to encircle double-stranded DNA at the origin of replication during G1 phase

 </sup>, and they form a part of the replicative CMG helicase complex (comprising CDC45, MCM2-7 and GINS) which is essential in the final ligation step of cell cycle
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. 
 <italic>POLE</italic>, which functions as the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase involved in DNA replication and repair
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. FEN1, which removes the 5′overhanging flaps in DNA repair, processes the 5′ ends of Okazaki fragments in lagging strand DNA synthesis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. RFC4 is found to be stimulated by PCNA and forms a core complex involved in DNA-dependent ATPase activities

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Higher expression levels of these genes associated with DNA replication in Gp cells, also suggest that G1p cells undergo more active DNA replication than G1d cells in the largest F1 follicle. Our findings are in accordance with previous studies showing a higher

<p>The amino acid sequence tags obtained from each peptide fragmentation in LC-MS analyses were used to search for protein candidates using Mascot online sequence matching software (Matrix Science, London, UK; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>). The searches for peptide mass fingerprints were performed against rodent taxonomy in the LudwigNR database (305,368 entries; last updated on 20 September 2012). Variable modifications included were oxidation of methionine, allowing up to one missed cleavage site. The search parameters are as follows: peptide tolerance ± 1.2 Da; MS/MS tolerance ± 0.6 Da; peptide charge +1, +2 or +3; monoisotopic mass value. Identification was accepted as positive when a minimum of two matching peptides and more than 10% of the peptide coverage sequences have matched. Probability scores were significant at

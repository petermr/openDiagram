Here, we test whether changes in beta frequency are related to the preparation of adapted movements in human, and whether such effects generalise to other species (cat). Eleven healthy adult humans performed a joystick visuomotor adaptation task. Beta (15&#x02013;25&#x000a0;Hz) scalp EEG signals recorded over the motor cortex during a pre-movement preparatory phase were, on average, significantly reduced in amplitude during early adaptation trials compared to baseline, late adaptation, or aftereffect trials. The changes in beta were not related to measurements of reaction time or reach duration. We also recorded&#x000a0;local field potential (LFP) activity within the primary motor cortex of three cats during a prism visuomotor adaptation task. Analysis of these signals revealed similar reductions in motor cortical LFP beta frequencies during early adaptation. This effect was present when controlling for any influence of the reaction time and reach duration. Overall, the results are consistent with a reduction in pre-movement beta oscillations predicting an increase in adaptive drive in upcoming task performance when motor errors are largest in magnitude and the rate of adaptation is greatest.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Motor control</kwd><kwd>Motor cortex</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G1100626</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J014400/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darch</surname><given-names>Henry T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Motor adaptation, the ability to modify movements in response to changes in the environment to maintain accuracy, is a fundamental feature of most types of goal-directed behaviour. Motor adaptation is supported by a supraspinal neural network that includes (but is not limited to) the cerebellum and motor cortex. These brain regions are thought to serve different, but complementary roles during motor adaptation. For example, a large body of work indicates the cerebellum is critically involved in the generation of sensory prediction errors that drive the adaptation process, as well as online control of complex movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast, the motor cortex appears to support memory of different environment dynamics: Transcranial magnetic disruption of the motor cortex in humans does not influence learning of a new perturbing force, but leads to a deficit in behavioural performance compared with controls in a delayed re-test of the same force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and non-invasive electrical stimulation of the motor cortex can improve retention of motor adaptation performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings suggest that motor cortical areas support a long-term memory trace of established motor programs, into which newly learned dynamics (potentially computed initially in the cerebellum) are integrated.</p><p id="Par3">Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in the beta frequency band are usually defined as being between 13 and 30 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. They are a prominent feature of motor areas in both human and other mammalian species (including primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and cats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> cited in Ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). There is now a well-established link between beta frequencies and movement-related processing in the sensorimotor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Typically, beta frequency EEG responses in the motor cortex are reduced in amplitude during movement (event-related desynchronization)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and increased at cessation of movements (beta rebound)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Beta amplitude also increases during periods of sustained holding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and has been linked to various kinematic parameters including reaction time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and movement speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In the context of motor adaptation, only a limited number of&#x000a0;studies have examined motor cortical beta signals in peri-movement time periods. The beta rebound has been observed to be attenuated during trials in which large errors are made<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and this has been attributed to a reduction in the subject&#x02019;s confidence in the motor program, prompting subsequent adjustment or exploratory movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This is considered to reflect a role in feedback error processing to modify subsequent motor actions, possibly indicating an <italic>adaptive drive</italic>&#x02014;defined here as neuronal signals generated in response to an increase in behavioural error specifically computed to support modification of subsequent motor actions. Motor cortical beta signals have also been reported to be attenuated prior to movement initiation in both a forcefield and a visuomotor adaptation task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This pre-movement reduction in beta power was interpreted to reflect a predictive updating of the upcoming motor command in response to a previous error, and thereby signalling an adaptive drive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, this idea was challenged by a subsequent study that used an interlimb cooperative adaptation task to decouple adaptive drive from altered motor commands and found that premovement beta modulation might be a result of higher-level processing of sensory information that updates upcoming movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The present study sought to clarify whether changes in pre-movement beta oscillations are consistent with an increase in adaptive drive.</p><p id="Par5">The results outlined above relied on recording EEG signals obtained from scalp electrodes. The EEG signal of individual electrodes are thought to reflect a spatial sum of a large neuronal population subjacent to them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. It remains to be established whether any adaptation related changes in motor cortical signals present in scalp EEG are also present in neural population activity recorded directly from the brain as a local field potential (LFP). LFP recordings from the motor cortex are not available in healthy human participants during motor adaptation, so in addition to recording EEG signals over the motor cortex in healthy humans, we also recorded LFP directly from the motor cortex in an animal model of visuomotor adaptation, using a previously established reach-retrieve task in cats. This allowed us to test whether changes in beta activity in motor cortex could be related to adaptive drive, and whether such changes are generalizable across species. We focus on beta activity in the pre-movement period when adaptive drive is greatest for upcoming task performance. This pre-movement period has the advantage that it is not confounded by the execution of the movement (which differs across the motor adaptation tasks in the two species), allowing a direct comparison of results between the two lines of experiment.</p><p id="Par6">We found that beta frequency power recorded over the motor cortex as scalp EEG in humans, or directly from the primary motor cortex as LFP activity in cats, was reduced prior to movement in trials in the early adaptation phase of a joystick visuomotor adaptation task (humans) or when target mis-reaches occurred in a prism visuomotor adaptation task (cats). These changes in beta power were&#x000a0;not related to kinematics of the reach, consistent with a role of reduced beta activity in the motor cortex reflecting adaptive drive. Interestingly, in both cases the effect was restricted to early adaptation, but not the early phase of the aftereffect (in which targeting errors also occur), suggesting a dissociation in neuronal activity between adaptation and washout periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par7">Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 regulation and were reviewed and approved by the University of Bristol Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body.

Each trial was initiated by the participant depressing the joystick trigger. One of four possible black target dots (45&#x000b0;, 135&#x000b0;, 225&#x000b0;, or 315&#x000b0; from vertical) immediately appeared at the edge of an invisible boundary circle centred on the starting position of the user-controlled green dot, forming the task arena (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,B). Targets were pseudorandomly presented in blocks of 20 trials, with each target location presented 5 times within each block. Participants were instructed to move the joystick as quickly and accurately as possible to the target, so the movements were effectively ballistic. Trials that exceeded 750&#x000a0;ms between target presentation and completion elicited an on-screen prompt to speed up the movements. The joystick was positioned in front of the dominant (right) hand to the right-hand side of the screen, enabling a comfortable grasp whilst removing the hand from the participant&#x02019;s view whilst engaged in the task. The task was run with Matlab using Psychtoolbox version 3. Task code was modified from that made publicly available by D.

The first block consisted of &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; trials in which the participants performed the joystick task as normal. The second block induced visuomotor adaptation by implementing a clockwise 35&#x000b0; rotation transformation of the on-screen joystick (green) cursor, requiring participants to modify their outward movement to overcome this perturbation. The final block, identical to the first, was used to probe the participants&#x02019; behavioural adaptation to the transformation through the presence of an aftereffect. Participants were not informed of the rotation transformation or the ordering of each block, and none reported explicit awareness of the rotation transform other than that their performance had worsened. Participants did not report the use of an explicit aiming strategy.</p><p id="Par11">Measurements of behavioural error were calculated as the angular displacement relative to the target when reaches crossed the boundary of the task space (endpoint error)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Movement initiation was determined when the joystick cursor exceeded a Euclidian distance of 5 pixels from the starting position. Reaction time was measured between the time of target presentation (joystick trigger press), and movement initiation. Reach duration was measured between the time of movement initiation and crossing of the task boundary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Animal experiments</title><p id="Par12">Three adult male cats (B, S and G) were trained to perform a left forelimb reach-retrieve task. The target was a Perspex tube (diameter 3&#x000a0;cm) placed at eye level at a comfortable reaching height and distance (approximately 20&#x000a0;cm) in front of the animal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Reaches were cued by an opaque vertical covering on the Perspex tube which was operated manually by the researchers when the cat was attending to the door and had the reaching limb resting on the ground. The time taken between the door opening and the paw lift-off was considered the reaction time. The reach duration was also recorded as the time between the paw lift-off and entry into the tube, detected by infra-red beams. Reaches were always positively rewarded with a fish morsel within the Perspex tube and no negative training or food restriction was used. Video recordings of the behaviour were made using webcams running at 30 fps, synchronised with the neural data acquisition using the open source software Bonsai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These videos were assessed offline to classify reaches (see below).</p><p id="Par13">Once the animals had learnt the reaching task (typically 4&#x000a0;weeks training) surgical implants of recording electrodes were made (see below). Following full recovery from the surgery, daily recording sessions commenced in which the cats performed approximately 80&#x000a0;food-rewarded reaching trials before they became sated and the session was stopped, and they were returned to their home pen. The progression of each recording session followed that of the human study and was divided into three stages. Stage 1: twenty baseline trials were obtained in which unperturbed reaching was performed and animals rapidly and smoothly placed their forepaw into the target reward tube. Stage 2: visuomotor adaptation trials in which a set of custom made 40 dioptre Fresnel laterally displacing prism glasses were placed in the animal&#x02019;s line of sight (approximately 2&#x000a0;cm in front of the eyes). Initial trials in the presence of the prism glasses led to reaches laterally missing the entrance of the target reward tube. Adaptation to successfully reach into the target occurred after approximately 10 trials. After 20 consecutive accurate reaches, the prism glasses were removed. Stage 3: immediately after removal of the prism glasses the cats exhibited lateral misses to the opposite side of the tube, indicative of a motor adaptation&#x000a0;aftereffect.</p><p id="Par14">Based on experimenter observation during the recording session and offline verification by examining a video record of task performance, individual reaches were divided into three categories: (i) &#x02018;Hits&#x02019; when the cat rapidly and smoothly reached to place its forepaw into the target reward tube. (ii) &#x02018;Misses&#x02019; were the same as hits for the reach component of the movement, but the forepaw failed initially to enter the target, hitting the Perspex fa&#x000e7;ade&#x02009;~&#x02009;1&#x000a0;cm to the left or right of the reward tube entrance&#x000a0;(ie. opposite to the original prism glasses displacement). A subsequent lateral adjustment was required for the paw to enter the tube to retrieve the reward. (iii) &#x02018;Rejected&#x02019; trials were all reaches that either had a reaction time shorter than 150&#x000a0;ms; a reach duration (time between paw lift-off and target/fa&#x000e7;ade hit) more than 2 standard deviations of the mean computed for each animal; reaches that displayed a corrective adjustment near the end of the movement, prior to contact with the Perspex fa&#x000e7;ade, in order for the forepaw to enter the reward tube; or trials with large electrical noise artefacts in the neural data. Rejected reaches accounted for approximately 20% of all trials and are not considered further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial epochs</title><p id="Par15">For the human experiments, data from five epochs, each of 72 consecutive trials, was extracted from each participant. The five epochs were: baseline&#x02014;the final trials of the baseline period; early adaptation&#x02014;the set of trials following the visuomotor rotation, in which endpoint errors were greater than 2SD from baseline; late adaptation&#x02014;final trials under the visuomotor rotation condition; early aftereffect&#x02014;the 72 trials following the removal of the visuomotor rotation, in which endpoint errors were&#x000a0;greater than 2SD from Baseline; and late aftereffect&#x02014;the final 72 trials of the task.</p><p id="Par16">For the cat behaviour, &#x02018;Hits&#x02019; made prior to the prism perturbation were taken as equivalent to the baseline condition in the human experiments.

A veterinary anaesthetist was present to administer anaesthetic agents and monitor vital signs. Stereotaxic surgery involved a craniotomy over the left motor cortex (approximate coordinates: AP&#x02009;+&#x02009;23, ML&#x02009;+&#x02009;8). An area corresponding to the distal left forelimb motor cortex was identified through microstimulation (11 pulse 330&#x000a0;Hz trains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>) of the cortical surface around the cruciate sulcus. Next, a 16-site silicon probe (NeuroNexus) was implanted into the identified area. The probe consisted of sixteen 2&#x000a0;mm shanks, spaced 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m apart, with a single recording site at each tip. Sites were referenced to a skull screw situated contralateral to the craniotomy. Additionally, EMG recording leads (multistranded stainless steel, Teflon insulated, diameter 0.3&#x000a0;mm, Cooner, Chatsworth, CA, USA) were implanted into the left forelimb Cleidobrachialis Flexor, as well as the long and lateral heads of Triceps Brachii Extensor muscles. A Teflon insulated lead was also implanted into connective tissue in the left forepaw wrist. This lead was used to carry a 400&#x000a0;mV 30&#x000a0;kHz sine wave transmitted through the paw when in contact with a copper baseplate on the floor of&#x000a0;the recording environment, enabling the detection of paw lift-off at the initiation of each reach.

The time-series were then decomposed into the time&#x02013;frequency domain using a Morlet wavelet transform (k&#x02009;=&#x02009;6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and spectral power computed by taking the log normalised squared magnitude of the wavelet transform.</p><p id="Par23">Based on our interest in motor preparation, we computed the mean spectral power during the reaction time between target presentation and movement initiation. In the case of the cats, as we had access to electromyographic (EMG) data from the Cleidobrachialis Flexor, responsible for lifting the forelimb, we were able to determine a suitable location for the window from the trial averaged EMG traces. The flexor muscle is consistently quiescent when the animal is sitting quietly but has a robust ramping activity during reaching that onsets prior to the timestamp of the paw lift (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Thus, a 200&#x000a0;ms window was positioned immediately prior to this ramping activity (Cats B and G: 400&#x02013;200&#x000a0;ms prior to paw lift.

The inclusion of reaction time and reach duration as covariates in the analysis suggests that the adaptation specific modulation of beta is not related to these reach kinematics, and the lack of significant modulation of EEG data during the Early Aftereffect epoch also suggests that the beta modulation is not related to error feedback signals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">In this study we show that EEG beta frequencies in humans, recorded at a scalp location classically associated with motor cortical signals, are attenuated immediately prior to movement initiation specifically during early stages of visuomotor adaptation, and returned to baseline levels when behavioural performance (endpoint errors) had returned to baseline performance: i.e. when adaptative drive is greatest. Further, we provide evidence that beta activity recorded as local field potential activity directly from the motor cortex in cats exhibits similar motor adaptation related changes.</p><p id="Par37">Our results are consistent with previous work in human subjects which show a decrease in pre-movement motor cortical EEG beta power during early stages of forcefield, and visuomotor adaptation task&#x02014;involving perturbing forces being applied to the limb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Forcefield adaptation normally involves the integration of visual and proprioceptive information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, whereas visuomotor adaptation relies on visual feedback to monitor performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. This would suggest the change in beta activity within the motor cortex is independent of the mode of sensory feedback. However, previous studies indicate that forcefield and visuomotor adaptation may involve different neural pathways/processes within the cerebellar cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. One possible explanation to unite these findings is that signals arising from distinct cerebellar cortical regions are integrated within the cerebellar nuclei and/or thalamus before being forwarded to the motor cortex for the preparation of subsequent limb movements.</p><p id="Par38">Our data are also consistent with the finding that ipsilateral beta power is reduced prior to target presentation when participants expect a change in required motor program during a go/no-go task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. This reinforces the possibility that this phenomenon is not related to kinematic features of the motor programs themselves, but instead indicate an increased drive of adaptive mechanisms promoting motor flexibility.</p><p id="Par39">Our results from three cats performing a prism visuomotor adaptation task provide additional evidence that a similar pre-movement modulation in beta power can also occur in motor cortical LFP signals. Individual differences observed within the animal data may indicate differences in neural population activity at a more local scale due to topographical differences in electrode positioning in relation to motor cortical maps. Nevertheless, two out of the three cats displayed the same adaptation related modulation of pre-movement beta power, suggesting that the effects are generalizable across species, and that the effects seen in the human EEG data are at least in part driven by motor cortical activity.</p><p id="Par40">Reaction time and reach duration have previously been associated with beta oscillations in both humans and primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. In our human data, the bilateral reduction in pre-movement beta activity in Early Adaptation trials was present when controlling for these parameters, suggesting that the change in beta activity is independent of these kinematic properties. Moreover, in the human data there was no significant change in beta power during the Early Aftereffect epoch, in which motor errors are equal in magnitude to the Early Adaptation epoch. This suggests that the beta modulation was not related to error feedback processing per se, which is thought to occur largely in the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Instead, the beta modulation was present only when adaptation occurred to a <italic>novel</italic> environment dynamic, indicating a more categorical indicator that adaptation of the motor programs are required (perhaps similar in nature to the decreased beta power when expecting a rule change in a Go/No-Go task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>). The difference in beta activity between the Early Adaptation and Early Aftereffect epochs raises the possibility that the neuronal processes underpinning adaptation and aftereffect are distinct, and that the adaptation effect is not related to error magnitude. Such a possibility is consistent with the idea that, whilst initial adaptation is supported principally by a recalibration of internal models, the aftereffect can be more easily supported with a strategic influence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Neural circuit basis of beta modulation</title><p id="Par41">Simultaneous EEG, LFP and multi-unit spiking activity recording in area F5 (ventral pre-motor cortex) of macaques has previously shown an inverse relationship between multi-unit activity and LFP and EEG beta power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, the present pre-movement beta modulation could reflect an increase in motor cortical spiking activity at times of increased adaptive drive. Indeed, beta oscillations have been linked with antidromic activity within pyramidal tract neurons of the motor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, as well as the balance of inhibition/excitation (with elevated levels of endogenous GABA enhancing both baseline beta oscillations and the magnitude of the movement-related desynchronisation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Furthermore, studies of non-human primates during motor tasks has revealed that many cortical neurons synchronise their activity to beta rhythms during periods of oscillation, limiting their spiking rate to a narrower range than that present outside of oscillatory episodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Together, this raises the possibility that the decreased pre-movement beta power observed here and in previous studies reflects altered inhibitory control during times of increased adaptive drive.</p><p id="Par42">An alternative (but not mutually exclusive) view of the origins of LFP oscillations is that they reflect synchronous activity of synaptic inputs to neurons local to the recording site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, occurring in bursts of one beta cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. The observed modulation of beta power could then be interpreted to represent changes in the amount of neural synchrony in afferent signals to the motor cortex as proposed by Torrecillos and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par43">In conclusion, our results show an adaptation related attenuation of beta oscillations during movement preparation, recorded by scalp EEG over the motor cortex in humans and as motor cortical LFP signals in cats. Our findings are consistent with the reduction in beta power being a result of increased afferent input to the motor cortical PTNs in the early stages of adaptation, which could correspond to changes in the excitatory/inhibitory balance disrupting the ongoing beta oscillations, thus enabling modifications to established motor programs in response to error signals detected by other brain regions such as the cerebellum. Further work is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms supporting this beta phenomenon.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a BBSRC funded SWBio DTP studentship (Grant&#x000a0;BB/J014400/1), and MRC Grant G1100626.

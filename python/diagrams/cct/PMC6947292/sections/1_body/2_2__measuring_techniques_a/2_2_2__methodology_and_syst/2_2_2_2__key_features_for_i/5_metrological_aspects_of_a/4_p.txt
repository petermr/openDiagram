0: In the DSC analysis, the measure of the fraction of precipitates is the specific precipitation heat (or enthalpy) released by the precipitation.
1: On reaching the UCCR, the enthalpy change by precipitation is obviously zero.
2: This leads to a metrological problem: in a range of cooling rates close to the UCCR, we need to determine whether no precipitation heat is detectable in the measured curves.
3: Thus, the challenge is to decide when a precipitation signal is above the device-specific noise level.

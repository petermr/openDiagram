 <bold>Effect of biofilm DNAse treatment on vancomycin susceptibility of lrgA and lrgB 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> mutants
 </bold>. Effect of biofilm DNAse I treatment on vancomycin susceptibility was evaluated as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with modifications. 24 hr-preformed biofilms of the WT, ∆lrgA and ∆lrgB strains were grown as described above; following removal of non-biofilm cells, DNAse I (0.625 mg/ml), vancomycin (200, 100, 50 and 25 µg/ml) or a combination of both were added to appropriate wells. Following 24 hrs incubation at 37°C, metabolic activity of biofilm cells was measured using MTS-assay. Control wells with no treatment were included; DNAse I optimal activity concentration was pre-determined in a dose–response assay (data not shown).

<p id="par0130">As indicated by the pathway analysis, differentially expressed proteins in CV-PTC (n = 25, FDR p-value &lt;0.0005) showed an enrichment of actin cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton regulatory proteins. Specifically, there was strong expression of several members of Arp 2/3 complex in CV-PTC. Arp 2/3 complex is a major regulator of actin polymerization and increased expression of Arp 2/3 members were detected in several cancer types 
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Our finding is supported by a very recent publication by Martinez-Aguilar et al., in which the authors used data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to show that proteins regulating the cell to cell contact and actin cytoskeleton dynamics—especially members of Arp 2/3 complex—were altered in papillary thyroid carcinoma

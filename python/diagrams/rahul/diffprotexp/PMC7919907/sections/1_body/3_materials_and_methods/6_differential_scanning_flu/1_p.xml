<p>The binding of heparin and BLF was monitored by DSF using a Thermal Fisher QuantStudio
 <sup>™</sup> 5 Real-Time PCR System as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] with minor modifications. TSA plates were prepared by mixing BLF (final concentration of 100 μg/ml) with different concentrations (0.02–200 µg/ml) of heparin and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. 1 × SYPRO orange (Thermal Fisher) were added and the fluorescence of the plates were taken under a temperature gradient ranging from 20 to 95 °C (incremental steps of 0.05 °C/s). The melting temperature (

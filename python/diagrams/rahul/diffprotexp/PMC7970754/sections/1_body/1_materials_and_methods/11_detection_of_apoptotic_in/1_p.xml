<p>The cells in logarithmic growth phase were taken and adjusted to a cell concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/ml, after which they were inoculated in 96-well plates (200 µl per well). Next, they were divided into 5 groups with 5 replicates in each group and incubated overnight in a 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. After the cells adhered, the medium was removed, and the experiment was divided into a control group, a virus no-load control group NC, a no-load control group NC + RSV group, a POLD1 overexpression + RSV group, and a POLD1 overexpression group. Incubation continued under the same conditions for 36 h, after which 10 µl of CCK8 solution was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 3 h. A microplate reader was then used to measure absorbance (A) at 450 nm, and the survival rates of the four groups of cells were compared. The experiment was repeated three times, and the experiment was divided into control group, a virus no-load control group NC, a POLD1-OE group, a POLD1-OE + RSV group, and a no-load control group NC + RSV group. After 36 h of processing, detection was performed using flow cytometry using the AnnexinV APC-7AAD kit (Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA) double standard method.

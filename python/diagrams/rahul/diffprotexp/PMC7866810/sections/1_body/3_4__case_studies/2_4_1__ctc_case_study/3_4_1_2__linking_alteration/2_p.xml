<p>Here, the CTC dataset was used to link Golgi alterations with cancer progression based on a list of 164 genes that are known to cause Golgi fragmentation (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01399">Supplementary Data S1</xref>). These 164 genes were considered to filter the CTC dataset. From 164, only 97 genes were expressed. Silencing each of these genes is known to cause Golgi fragmentation [

 <xref rid="B83-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Using the k-means clustering approach based on these 97 genes, cells were classified in four stable clusters (

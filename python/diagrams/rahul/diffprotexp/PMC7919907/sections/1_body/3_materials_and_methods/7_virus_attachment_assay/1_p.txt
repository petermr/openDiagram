0: Viral attachment assay was performed as previously described [ 58].
1: RD cells or Vero E6 cells at 8090% confluency were precooled at 4 C for 30 min, followed by infection with HCoV-OC43 (MOI of 40) or HCoV-NL63 (MOI of 30).
2: After 2 h incubation at 4 C, unbound viruses were removed by washing the cells two times with ice-cold PBS.
3: The infected cells with viruses attached on cell surface were harvested for quantification by real-time qPCR or fixed for visualization by immunofluorescence staining.

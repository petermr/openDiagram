 <xref rid="B122-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] proposed a selective pre-leaching of LFP electrode in NaOH solution to dissolve Al current collector. The solubilized Al was recovered as Al(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> via the addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The black mass pre-leach residue was submitted to H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> leaching at 60 °C with 30% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. After 2 h, 82% of Li and 97% of Fe were solubilized, leaving a solid residue that contained PVDF and carbon. Then, Fe was precipitated out of the sulfate mother solution as iron oxide-hydroxide using NaOH—the same problem as in previous process flowsheet. Lastly, the well-known Li carbonate precipitation was performed using soda ash; sodium sulfate waste solution would also form [

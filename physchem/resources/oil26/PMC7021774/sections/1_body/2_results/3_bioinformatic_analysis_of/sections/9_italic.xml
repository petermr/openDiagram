<italic>Tsc2</italic> region in &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; (Supplementary Table 6). Details of all &#8216;W9784&#8217; genes and candidate genes are summarised in Supplementary Table 6. As the contig size of the &#8216;W9784&#8217; assembly is very low, with an N50 of 6.7&#160;kb, we did not undertake further characterisation of its genic content. Nevertheless, this information provides a starting point with which to undertake future studies.

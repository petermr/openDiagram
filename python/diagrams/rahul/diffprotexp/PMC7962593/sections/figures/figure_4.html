 <caption> Biological functions and KEGG pathways enriched in common genes. ( A) Common genes of sepsis patients relative to controls involved in up- or down-regulated biological processes, as quantified by gene set variation analysis (GSVA). FC, fold change. ( B) Common genes of sepsis patients relative to controls involved in up- or down-regulated KEGG pathways, as quantified by single-sample GSVA. FC, fold change. ( C) Common genes involved in up- or down-regulated KEGG pathways of GSEA results in sepsis patients relative to controls. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. </caption>

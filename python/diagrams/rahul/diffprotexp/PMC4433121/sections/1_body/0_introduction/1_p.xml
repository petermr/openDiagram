<p>Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common form of thyroid malignancy. The tumor is usually well-differentiated and is characterized by typical cytological and histopathological features [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The cystic variant of PTC (cPTC) constitutes 4–13% of all PTCs [

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It exhibits classical histopathological features of PTC, but different morphological properties due to its presentation as a mural nodule within a thyroid cyst. The diagnosis is challenging, since the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a cystic thyroid nodule usually results in a relatively large volume of cyst fluid, but may contain insufficient amounts of representative tumor cells. This may lead to cytological reports in which malignancy is not recognized [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Attempts have been made to identify diagnostic markers for thyroid cystic lesions by using biochemical, immunohistochemical or genetic markers [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The most frequently used immunohistochemical markers to confirm a PTC diagnosis are cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) and Hector Battifora mesothelial antigen-1 (HBME-1) [

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although these proteins are commonly up-regulated in PTC, they can also be expressed in benign thyroid lesions, leading to difficulties in establishing the preoperative diagnosis [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Routine cytological investigation is performed mainly on the cellular component of the FNAB specimen, and less attention is given to the fluid component [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Identification of novel diagnostic markers to distinguish cPTC from benign cystic thyroid lesions is warranted and could be based on protein-based screening approaches.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">B</xref>, a fold change &gt;2 and p-value &lt;0.05 were the screening conditions, and 1207 differentially expressed mRNAs in MH7A cells after stimulation with TNF-α were found, of which 793 were upregulated genes and 414 were downregulated. The top 10 upregulated mRNAs and the top 10 down-regulated mRNAs are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Based on interactions with combined scores ≥ 0.4,
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the PPI network analysis constructed interaction networks with differentially expressed mRNA genes, as shown in

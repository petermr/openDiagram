<p>Canonical pathway gene sets analysis of all rare functional SNVs revealed that the HIF-1 TF pathway had a significant correlation with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease. A recent study implied that in vitro influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 induced nuclear translocation of HIF-1α without altering the expression of HIF-1α, which may promote the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines during influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It is well-known that the over-secretion of inflammatory cytokines is considered to be a key contributor to the severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51–53</xref>]. More importantly, another study has confirmed that deficiency of HIF-1α enhanced influenza A virus replication

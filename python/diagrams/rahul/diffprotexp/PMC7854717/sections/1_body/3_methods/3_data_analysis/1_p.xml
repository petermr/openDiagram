 </sup>, profiling four biological replicas provides for the expression of each gene three independent measures: level, variability and correlation with each other gene from the same chamber or with the same gene in adjacent chamber. The three features are as independent and complementary as are the impressions on the same movie of a blind person and a deaf one.

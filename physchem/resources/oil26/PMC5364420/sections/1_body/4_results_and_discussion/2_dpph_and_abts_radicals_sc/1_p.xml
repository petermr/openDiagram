<p>The scavenging activity of essential oil from

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of essential oil on DPPH and ABTS radicals were 75.0 and 36.1 μg/mL, respectively. The scavenging activity of essential oil on DPPH radicals was far lower than that of Trolox (EC
 <sub>50</sub> was 13.1 μg/mL), however, its scavenging activity on ABTS radicals was significantly higher than Trolox (EC
 <sub>50</sub> was 84.7 μg/mL). These differences in data between DPPH and ABTS assays were likely due to different experimental conditions. Similarly, essential oil showed a concentration-dependent scavenging of the DPPH and ABTS radicals at certain concentrations, indicating the antioxidant activity of essential oil may be mediated through direct trapping of the free radicals through transfers of hydrogen or electron

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> reported the antioxidant activity of essential oil determined by DPPH assay and superoxide anion-generating system, showing an inhibition percentage of 40% on DPPH radical at 0.1 mg/mL of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> essential oil; while Essaidi

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> also reported its antioxidant activity determined by DPPH assay and β-carotene bleaching test, indicating an inhibition percentage of 20% on DPPH radical and a dose-dependent effect. Unfortunately, they did not further determine the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of essential oil on DPPH radicals. In the present study, the scavenging rate was 57.6% at 0.1 mg/mL of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> essential oil on DPPH radicals (no shown). This difference in scavenging percentage could be explained by difference in the chemical composition and experimental conditions.

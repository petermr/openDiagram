<p>We also analyzed PcATP2 and PcCdc50B association by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC). We used the GFP fluorescence to monitor the elution profile of DDM/CHS-solubilized PcATP2 in a gel-filtration column, and analyzed the degree of monodispersity (or stability) in detergent micelles of PcATP2 in the presence or in the absence of PcCdc50B. Detergent-solubilized PcATP2-GFP-BAD eluted as a nearly symmetric wide peak centred at ∼11.5 ml (

The second peak at ∼16 ml elution corresponded to the light-scattering of empty DDM/CHS micelles, visible in the chromatogram because the instrumental settings used to detect PcATP2-GFP-BAD. DDM/CHS-solubilized membranes expressing no GFP-tagged protein (shadow chromatogram in 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and the FSEC profile of 1% DDM 0.2% CHS confirmed this. PcATP2’s elution profile did not change significatively when PcCdc50B-His was co-expressed (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, solid line). However, the western blot analysis of the eluted fractions along the PcATP2-GFP-BAD elution peak confirmed that PcCdc50B-His co-eluted with PcATP2-GFP-BAD (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, upper panel) following a similar elution profile than PcATP2-GFP-BAD. Since the theoretical molecular mass of PcATP2-GFP-BAD and PcCdc50B-His are, respectively, 205 and 47 kDa, the co-elution of both proteins supports their association in detergent micelles. No significant shift in the retention time of PcATP2-GFP-BAD was observed when PcCdc50B-His was present (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, solid line), likely due to the low-resolution of the column at the range of molecular weights where PcATP2-GFP-BAD elutes. To discard the elution of free or non-associated PcCdc50B at the same retention time than PcATP2, we fused the GFP at the C-terminal end of PcCdc50B (PcCdc50B-GFP-His) and performed FSEC analysis of DDM/CHS-solubilized membranes expressing only PcCdc50B-GFP-His. The elution profile of PcCdc50B-GFP-His (Mw 76 kDa) in the absence of PcATP2 showed a main peak at ∼14.3 ml (dashed line in 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), far from the PcATP2-GFP-BAD main elution (∼11.5 ml, dotted line 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, the relatively broad and asymmetric shape of the chromatogram suggested a poor stability of PcCdc50B-GFP-His in DDM/CHS when PcATP2 is absent. Collectively, immunoprecipitation studies revealed the association of PcATP2 with either PcCdc50A or PcCdc50B. Moreover, FSEC experiments also confirmed the association of PcATP2 with PcCdc50B.

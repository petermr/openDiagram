<p>Cell activity was monitored using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction as our previously described
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. HEK293 cells were pretreated with or without exogenous ETHE1 (CUSABIO) (100 ng/ml) or ACY-3 (DAKEWE, Bejing, China) (100 ng/ml) for 0.5 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. The CCK-8 solution (10 μL) was added to each well (100 μL) followed by incubation for 1 h. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a microplate reader (BioRad). The cell viability is expressed as the percentage relative to the control cultures. In addition, a Calcein-AM and PI double staining kit (Dojindo) was used for the double staining and analysis of the living cell and dead cell levels as our previously described
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The living cells (yellow-green fluorescence) and dead cells (red fluorescence) were measured by a fluorescence microscope (IX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 490 nm excitation filter.

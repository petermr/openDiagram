<p>For the conversion of pristyl aldehyde to pristanic acid no aldehyde dehydrogenases were significantly differentially expressed during growth on pristane. An aldehyde dehydrogenase (ABO_0087) was expressed on all substrates tested meaning it may be constitutively expressed. Also, catalysis of sequential oxidation reactions is usual in cytochrome P450 reactions particularly with xenobiotics (Guengerich

 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). P450 enzymes catalyse a notably diverse range of oxidative transformations on a very wide range of substrates (Meunier 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). P450 enzymes can oxidize aldehyde to carboxylic acids through a well understood mechanism (Newcomb 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) and examples include the oxidation of aliphatic α,β‐unsaturated aldehydes and anthraaldehyde to the corresponding acids by the latter enzyme (Guengerich 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). This means the cytochrome P450 could potentially functionally substitute an aldehyde dehydrogenase generating a fatty acid, which is further degraded through β‐oxidation.

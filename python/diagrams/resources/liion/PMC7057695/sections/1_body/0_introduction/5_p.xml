 <italic>T</italic>, is determined by measuring the OCV of the electrochemical cell at different temperatures. Ideally, the cell needs to be relaxed for a period of time before the open-circuit voltage is measured to reach equilibrium. The entropy change in the electrochemical reaction can be obtained by measuring the change in open-circuit voltage at different temperatures and calculated using

 </sup> The increase or decrease in entropy means the decrease or increase in the degree of order of the lithium ion in the lattice, respectively. More importantly, the entropy change can also affect the thermal behavior of electrochemical reaction and then change the temperature of the battery, which greatly affects the performance of lithium-ion batteries.

<p>Additionally, a control problem within the DSC measurement at high quenching rates must be considered. The maximum cooling rate possible is dependent on the temperature difference between the DSC furnace and the cold block, which necessarily decreases during the cooling process. Therefore, the scan rate may fall to below the programmed value. When the actual cooling rate of the experiment switches from the cooling step to zero during isothermal soaking, it is inevitable that cooling becomes slower than any critical cooling rate. Hence, a reasonable starting point must be defined.</p>

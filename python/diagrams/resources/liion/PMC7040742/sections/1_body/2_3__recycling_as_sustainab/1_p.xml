<p>Considering the average specific energy (Average capacity of the five major types of Li-ion considering only 18,650 cells format) of 180 Wh/kg [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the global LIB market of 120 GWh [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the weight of the LIBs sold in 2017 was estimated to be approximately 670,000 tons. Once reaching the end-of-life, spent batteries will generate large amounts of hazardous waste that should be managed and treated. The disposal of spent LIBs using the standard MSW management system poses great safety risks as wasted LIBs could catch fire or explode owing to internal short-circuiting leading to the evolution of O
 <sub>2(g)</sub> from the decomposition of cathodic material, the fast release of heat, and ignition of organic solvents [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Consequently, fire incidents caused by LIBs frequently occur in waste management facilities [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and have caused up to 65% of the fires in waste facilities in California in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Environmental Services Association attributed a quarter of the fire incidents in the UK waste facilities to spent LIBs [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, fire incidents caused by LIBs have been reported occasionally in landfill operations [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These incidents represent major safety risks considering the generation of heat, evolution of methane gas, and presence of combustible materials. The transport regulations for LIBs have been summarized by Gaines et al. in their review paper on LIBs recycling [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

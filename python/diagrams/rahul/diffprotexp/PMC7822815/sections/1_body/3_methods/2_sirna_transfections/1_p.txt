0: Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells (5  10 5 cells/ml) were transfected with 200 nM siRNA in standard culture medium at 330 V (Kasumi-1) or 350 V (SKNO-1) for 10 ms using 4 mm electroporation cuvettes and a Fischer EPI 2500 electroporator (Fischer, Heidelberg, Germany) 64.
1: After 15 min at room temperature, cells were diluted in standard medium to a concentration of 5  10 5 cells/ml.
2: In all the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 knockdown experiments, the previously established anti-RUNX1/RUNX1T1 active siRR and mismatch control siMM were used 28.
3: All siRNAs used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table  2.

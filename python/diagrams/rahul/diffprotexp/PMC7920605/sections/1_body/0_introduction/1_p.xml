<p>N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common means of RNA modification, accounting for 0.1–0.4% of adenosine, and its biological significance has been gradually revealed.
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> RNA m6A modification is widely found in the mRNAs of eukaryotes, specifically, m6A methylation means that RNA has been modified by methylation at the N6 site of the adenine base, and the modified adenosine is m6A adenine.

 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Similar to DNA or histone methylation, RNA m6A methylation is also mainly catalyzed by methyltransferases and demethylases.
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This means that the m6A methylation modification is a dynamic reversible process.
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Various m6A methyltransferases, known as “writers,” including methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), METTL14 and Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), catalyze the m6A methylation of mRNA.

 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Various m6A demethylases are called “erasers”, including fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and ALKB family member 5 (ALKBH5), which function is to reduce the modified RNA to the original RNA.
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition, m6A binding protein acts as a “reader” and mainly includes the YT521-B homology (YTH) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (HNRNP) families, such as HNRNPC, YTHDC1, YTHDC2, YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, which recognize m6A-modified RNA and thus regulate mRNA metabolism and function.

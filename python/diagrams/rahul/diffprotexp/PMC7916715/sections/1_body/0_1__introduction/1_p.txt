0: Prostate cancer (PC) ranks one of the top commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the developed world [ 1].
1: Organ-confined PCs can be managed by active surveillance, prostatectomy, and radiation.
2: Treatment decisions are based on several factors such as disease severity, and patient age and preference.
3: The disease severity is commonly graded with Gleason score (GS) and GS-based grading system, World Health Organization (WHO) PC grading system (WHO grade group I-V) or ISUP (the International Society of Urological Pathology) grade [ 2, 3, 4].
4: At the molecular level, PCs can be classified into three integrative clusters (iClusters), iCluster 1, iCluster 2, and iCluster 3 [ 5]; this classification is based on alterations occurred in genome, methylation, and gene expression [ 6].
5: While iCluster 1 PCs are enriched with  TMPRSS2-ETV1 and  TMPRSS2-ETV4 fusions, iCluster 2 PCs are featured with  TMPRSS2-ERG fusion [ 5].
6: Fusion of the androgen receptor (AR) target gene  TMPRSS2 to the ETS (E26 transcription-specific) gene family ( ERG,  ETV1, and  ETV4), particularly the  TMPRSS2-ERG, commonly occurs in PC and plays important role in PC initiation and progression [ 7, 8].
7: While PC severity can facilitate therapy decision making, current management of PC patients needs significant improvement; as approximately 30% of patients undertaking the curative surgery treatment will have PC relapse or biochemical recurrence (BCR), evident by increases in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) [ 9].
8: The relapsed PCs are at significantly higher risk of metastasis [ 10].
9: Metastatic PCs (mPCs) are commonly managed with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); resistance nonetheless commonly develops in the form of castration-resistant PC (CRPC) [ 11, 12].
10: Although multiple therapeutic options are available for CRPCs, including taxane-based chemotherapy [ 13], AR-targeting therapy involving either abiraterone or enzalutamide [ 12, 14, 15, 16], and immunotherapy [ 17, 18], effective control of CRPC remains the major challenge [ 12, 19, 20].
11: This reflects the complex mechanisms underlying PC progression.

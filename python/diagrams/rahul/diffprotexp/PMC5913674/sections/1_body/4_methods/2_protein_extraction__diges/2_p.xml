<p>Protein pellets were solubilized in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.8) (Sigma Aldrich) before reduction in 5 mM dithiothreitol followed by alkylation in 10 mM iodoacetamide in the dark (with alkylation quenched with 5 mM dithiothreitol). To remove interfering reagents, proteins were precipitated via the methanol/chloroform approach [

A 2-stage digestion was performed first with Lys-C (Wako) overnight at 30°C (1 μg enzyme to 100 μg protein), followed with Trypsin (Promega) digestion at 37°C (1 μg enzyme to 100 μg protein) for 6 hours. Samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to 1% concentration acid and then desalted using solid phase extraction (SPE) with in-house tips packed with styrene divinyl benzene (3M Empore). Peptide extracts were dried by vacuum centrifuge, reconstituted in 200 mM N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N
 <sup>΄</sup>-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 8), followed by quantification via Micro BCA (Pierce).

<p id="Par50">All samples were acquired by the LC-MS system followed machine orders. Chromatographic separations were performed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters, USA) and a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer SYNAPT G2 XS QTOF (Waters, USA) was used to detect metabolites as the methods described by Huang et al. [

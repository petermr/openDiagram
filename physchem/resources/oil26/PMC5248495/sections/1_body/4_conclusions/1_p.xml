The presence of thyrosinase inhibitory activity is enhances the pharmacological value of these oils. They had also high antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activity and could be used as good sources of natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents, with possible application in food industry, cosmetics or medicine.</p>

0: Biomarkers play an important role in the implementation of personalized medicine in clinics with respect to defining subtype phenotypes, predicting clinical course and prognosis, and determining the appropriate therapeutic approach.
1: In this respect, a comprehensive pool of molecular markers from different biological levels (hub proteins, receptors, miRNAs, mRNAs, reporter TFs, and metabolites) were presented from a systematic integrative biology perspective with the potential to provide in-depth knowledge into the disease mechanisms in RCC subtypes [ 7].
2: On the other hand, the limited diagnostic and prognostic performance of a molecular biomarker revealed the need for system biomarkers to be obtained with approaches that consider interactions between critical molecules such as the differential protein interactome [ 8, 9].

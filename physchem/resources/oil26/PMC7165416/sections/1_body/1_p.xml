<p>Evidence, to date, indicates that the spectral tuning of M/LWS pigments (499 nm to 571 nm) (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), measured by the wavelength of maximum sensitivity (λ
 <sub>max</sub>), is mainly controlled by amino acid identity at five critical sites (positions 180, 197, 277, 285, and 308) (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), although other sites (e.g., 213 and 294) may also affect spectral tuning via epistatic interactions (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Predicted λ
 <sub>max</sub> values from known critical sites imply spectral shifts in M/LWS pigments during the diversification of mammals (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), yet these have rarely been validated (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and their ecological significance is not known.

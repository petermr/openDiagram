<p id="Par4">COVID-19 can range from asymptomatic and mild disease in most cases (~ 80%) to severe respiratory dysfunction and critical multi-organ failure (~ 20%), with an overall fatality rate of 2–3%

 </sup>. COVID-19 can progress in patients through three stages, beginning with an initial 2- to 14-day incubation period, with or without detectable virus, during which time asymptomatic transmission can occur. The second stage consists of a non-severe symptomatic period with detectable levels of virus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Symptoms can be more evident, characterized by fever, fatigue, cough and shortness of breath, with many patients developing lymphopenia and pneumonia

 </sup>. Initially, effective restriction of severe disease progression by the host relies primarily on innate immunity and the type I interferon (IFN) response that can be triggered by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition
 <sup>

 </sup>. Type I IFN robustly activates antiviral defense via over 200 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3)

 </sup>. In contrast, the virus expresses proteins that can delay or inhibit the early type I IFN response. Deregulation of innate immunity can lead to a hyperinflammatory response with over-production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α

<p>Cobalt can also be precipitated as cobalt oxalate prior to purification using ammonium oxalate, as demonstrated by Nan et al. [
 <xref rid="B151-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], or using oxalic acid as in Sohn et al. process [
 <xref rid="B152-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. However, to minimize coprecipitation of other elements, the deposition rate should not exceed 90%. Frequently, Co(II) is precipitated as carbonate, hydroxide, or oxalate from a solution purified from Fe(III), Al(III), and Cu(II). For manganese and nickel, precipitation as carbonate or hydroxide is usually performed after recovering cobalt.

<p id="Par42">Based on the above analysis of genomic locations of LMNA and LAP2α-lamin A/C complex binding sites, we found that LMNA mutation influenced transcription factor binding at the promoter regions in euchromatin (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). We further performed the de novo transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) analysis to identify TF binding motifs in the LMNA and LAP2α-lamin A/C complex binding regions located at the promoters in cardiac myocyte euchromatin. Motifs were sorted along with the corresponding p values, the top 8 predicted motifs are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b. The results demonstrated that the enriched motifs were extraordinary differences. SREBP1A motif (a novel lamin A interactor and the coactivator of CREBBP) was discovered in the control group of MACS (LMNA alone bind to euchromatin). Meanwhile, IRF4 (a factor associated with CREBBP) and TCF3 (a β-catenin-binding effector to repress of WNT signaling) were unique to control of SICER (LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes bind to euchromatin), which is in accord with the previous research [

0: The scatter diagram of the module membership (MM) and gene significance (GS), respectively representing intramodular connectivity and genetic phenotype, was plotted using the verboseScatterplot function [ 41].
1: We selected the modules with the strongest positive or negative correlation with phenotypes to construct the global regulatory network in the STRING database (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes,  https://www.string-db.org/) [ 42].
2: The visualization of global regulatory network and BDNF intersection pathways were accomplished by using the cytoscape software [ 43].

<p>As stated previously lung pathology is described elsewhere for this study. To briefly summarize here: the mean percent lung consolidation for each treatment group, as determined by a board certified veterinary pathologist (FRC), was: group 1–22.5%; group 2–33.1%; group 3–31.5%; group 4–24.5%; group 5–25% and group 6–9.3%. Histological observations when scored as absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) for nine different lesions in six compartments (pleura, alveolus, septum, interstitium, bronchiole, and bronchus) demonstrated significant differences for both treatment drug(s) and start times that were significant, including highly significant lower scores for group 6, treated with both FPI and ibuprofen from day 3 when compared to other groups. Specific histological findings that were scored for each compartment varied by compartment and included: monocytic infiltrates, neutrophilic infiltrates, syncytial cells, epithelial transmigration, peribronchiolar lymphoid and monocytic infiltrates, epithelial cell necrosis, deciliation and lymphoid nodules, as well as other compartment specific observations.</p>

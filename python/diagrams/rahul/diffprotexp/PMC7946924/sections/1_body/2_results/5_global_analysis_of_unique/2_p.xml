<p id="Par30">Compared to the unique miRNA searched by psRNA target server, less number of miRNAs with targets in ethylene metabolism pathway was detected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). In apical spikelet of SR-159, the number of miRNAs declined sharply in the first 5 days of anthesis and recuperated to the same level in the following 5 days. In comparison, the number increased in the basal spikelet in the first 5 days after anthesis and declined later in the following 5 days. At anthesis stage, SR-157 had less number of miRNAs than that of V1 in apical spikelet. The number increased by 50% on day 5 before declining to a level lower than that of the initial position on day 10. For basal spikelet, the number was low at anthesis. It increased by two fold at day 5 and remained unchanged thereafter on day 10. Overall, higher numbers of miRNAs with targets in ethylene pathway were detected in spikelets of SR-159 compared to SR-157 during the period of observation. In SR-159, the number of miRNAs was significantly higher in basal compared to the apical spikelet on day 5 post anthesis and the numerical gradient was not as large between the two spikelet types of SR-157 on this occasion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c).

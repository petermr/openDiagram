<p id="Par33">The ER serves as a site of protein folding as well as transport [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For PEDV infection, researchers demonstrated that the viral structural proteins including envelope protein (E) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], membrane protein (M) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and nucleocapsid protein (N) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] could cause ER stress, resulting in activation of pathways distinct from NF-kB activation. In our gene profiling, we could not find any activation in the NF-kB signaling pathway. Stimulation of immune responses could be studied further in future work.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by first identifying the reciprocal best (DNA sequence) BLAT hits in the elephant and manatee genomes, which allowed us to determine conservation and presence of premature stop codons in the each open reading frame (ORF). We translated the ORF for each hit into amino acid sequences and grouped up hits for each gene into one FASTA file along with the UniProt protein sequences for the human, dog, cat, and cow orthologs.

<p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of CNTs in cell culture medium support protein coating of nanoparticles (data not shown). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry found the CNTs associate with proteins forming a protein corona after incubation with PBS-DMEM cell culture media [

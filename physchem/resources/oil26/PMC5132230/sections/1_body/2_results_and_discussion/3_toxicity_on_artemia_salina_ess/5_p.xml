However, the high toxicity observed (8.90 &#956;g.mL<sup>-1</sup>) can be related to the synergism between monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, present in the essential oil from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suaveolens</italic>. Studies pro Boscardin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166684.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] on cytotoxic activity of volatile oil <italic>Eucalyptus benthamii</italic> in four tumor lines showed that the essential oil showed better results than the single compounds (&#945;-pinene and &#947;-terpinene) to Jurkat, HeLa, and B16F10 cells.</p>

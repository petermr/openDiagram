<p id="Par4">Chicken ovaries also contain numerous developing follicles in different size, including cortical follicles (&lt; 1 mm in diameter), white follicles (1–5 mm), yellow follicles (5–8 mm), and five to six large preovulatory follicles (10–40 mm) which are under a clear hierarchy in ovulation. The largest preovulatory follicle (named F1 follicle) is ovulated first, while the second to fifth/sixth preovulatory follicles (F2 to F5/F6) will be ovulated sequentially at an interval of 24–26 h

 </sup>. Owing to the large amount of lipid-rich yellow yolk accumulation in these preovulatory follicles, the nuclei and 99% of the ooplasm concentrate in a small region of 1–2 mm in diameter, thus is designated as the germinal disc (GD), which can be observed as a small white plaque at the surface of the large oocyte under the microscope

 </sup>. Relative to the position of the GD, GC encircling the oocytes can be sub-divided into two subpopulations: Gp cells which are located proximal to the GD, and Gd cells which are distal to the GD

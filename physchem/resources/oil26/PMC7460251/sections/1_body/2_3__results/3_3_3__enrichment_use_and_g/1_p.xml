Although the aardvarks varied how much they used the enrichment between the two-week periods, only one item showed significant changes in use when the first two weeks of the study were compared with the last two weeks of the study. Slow feeders were used for a higher percentage of the time during weeks 7–8 compared to weeks 1–2 (t

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but counts of events using slow feeders were lower in weeks 7–8 compared to weeks 1–2 (t

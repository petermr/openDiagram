<p id="Par38">Among the differentially expressed genes in AVM vascular structures, the CYR61, one of the retinoic acid target genes, was highly deregulated in the cerebral AVM-associated astrocytes and vascular cells. The CYR61 protein controls the critical regulators of the angiogenesis process. Angiogenesis is under the control of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which in turn is regulated by CYR61 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The CYR61 facilitates angiogenesis by inducing the mitogenic activity of various growth factors, promoting endothelial cell migration, adhesion, etc. The CYR61 also induces the expression of Î±v integrin subunit and matrix metalloproteinase, other genes involved in angiogenesis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The CYR61 is not only involved in physiological angiogenesis but also in increased angiogenesis associated with pathological conditions such as tumors, where its increased expression promotes vascularization [

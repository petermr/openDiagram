<p>The genome of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes three Cdc50/LEM3 proteins: PfCdc50A (VEuPathDB ID: Pf3D7_0719500), PfCdc50B (VEuPathDB B ID: Pf3D7_1133300) and PfCdc50C (VEuPathDB ID: Pf3D7_1029400). Like ATP2, each Cdc50 protein has close homologs in other 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (between 50â€“60% amino acid identity between 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, depending on the Cdc50 protein, see as example the alignments of Cdc50B orthologs in Figure supplement 2), as well as in other apicomplexan parasites. All these sequences contain the two predicted TMs connected by a large extracellular (or luminal) domain, as well as the four well-conserved cysteines, known to participate in two disulphide bridges [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These disulphide bridges are important for the association of the Cdc50 protein with the P4-ATPase and for the activity of the complex [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

<p>Finally, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) as a method used for identifying module patterns and contextualizing and grouping DE genes at the systems/module level. We describe how DE genes map to WGCNA co-expression modules in Figure 2 and focus on DE genes and specific modules in Figures 3-5. This approach enabled association of DE genes to major acute and secondary transcriptional changes. Overall, our paired use of DE (here via GLM) and WGCNA is a standard approach in the field to link gene-level DE changes with systems-level signatures in transcriptomics data.</p>

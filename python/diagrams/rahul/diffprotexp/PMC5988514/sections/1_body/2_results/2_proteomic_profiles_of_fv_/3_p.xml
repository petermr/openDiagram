<p id="par0085">Hierarchical cluster analysis of protein expressions in all sample groups demonstrated a clear separation of CV-PTC from benign tissues whereas FV-PTC lesions showed no obvious distinction between CV-PTC and benign tissues (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Interestingly, unsupervised clustering analysis demonstrated that the only NIFTP case (denoted as FV1) was clustered with CV-PTC cases. Besides, detailed comparison of FV-PTC and benign proteomes showed remarkable similarities. For example, out of 308 differentially expressed proteins in FV-PTC cases, 233 proteins seemed to be increased (fold-change fc ≥ 2) in FV-PTC. However, after Benjamini Hochberg correction none of these proteins showed differential expression between FV-PTC and benign tissues. The Venn diagram in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B shows the intersection of proteins identified in all three groups. The common proteins between benign tissues and FV-PTC (n = 2252) are remarkably higher than common proteins between benign tissues and CV-PTC (n = 1671) (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Higher number of common proteins identified in FV-PTC and benign cases are consistent with the hierarchical cluster analysis.

<p>Crystallographic data for 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> were collected on a CCD diffractometer with Mo-K
 <sub>α</sub> radiation. The CrystalClear-SM 1.4 SP1 program (Rigaku) was used for integration of the diffraction profiles. The crystal data were solved by directed methods using the SHELXT program and were refined with SHELXL. Anisotropic thermal parameters were used to refine all non-hydrogen atoms.

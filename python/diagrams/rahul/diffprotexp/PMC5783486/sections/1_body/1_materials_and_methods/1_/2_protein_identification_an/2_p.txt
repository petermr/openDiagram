0: iTRAQ-labelled samples were firstly diluted to 100 l with H 2O buffer (NH3H 2O, pH=10) prior to high performance liquid chromatography on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 25C on a Gemini-NX 3u C18 110A; 1502.00 mm Phenomenex column, and Gemini 3u C6-Phenyl 110A; 1002.0 mm column (all from Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA).
1: The flow rate used for reversed-phase column separation was 0.2 ml/min with H 2O (mobile phase A) and 80% acetonitrile (mobile phase B) with the following gradient system parameters: 510% B for 015 min, 1528% B for 1548 min, 2537% B for 4860 min, 3795% B for 6065 min and 95% B for 6570 min.
2: The elution was monitored by absorbance at 214/280 nm and the fractions were collected every 50 sec; these were pooled for each sample and dehydrated by centrifugation at 6,000  g for 4 h at 25C in vacuum centrifugation.

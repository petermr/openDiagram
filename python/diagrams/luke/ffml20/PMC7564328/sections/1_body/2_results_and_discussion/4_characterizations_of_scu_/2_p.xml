<p id="p0160">The CD-MOF was cubic crystal with particle size of 1–5 μm, suitable size for inhaled administration, whereas SCU as free drug was long flaky crystals (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, when the SCU loading was 15.68% (the loading molar ratio of SCU to CD-MOF was 0.6:1), the shape of SCU@CD-MOF remained cubic and almost no particles on the surface of CD-MOF could be observed, indicating most of SCU molecules were embedded in CD-MOF. Remarkably, when the maximum loading of SCU was 27.74% (the loading molar ratio of SCU to CD-MOF was 1.24:1), the morphology of SCU@CD-MOF was still cubic with some tiny adhering particles, which are possibly excessive free SCU.

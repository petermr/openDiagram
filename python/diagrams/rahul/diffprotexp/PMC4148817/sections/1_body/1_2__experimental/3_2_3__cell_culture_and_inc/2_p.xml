<p>Cells maintained and amplified in plastic tissue culture plates were trypsinized and seeded directly onto the permeable filters of the Transwell cell culture inserts with media on the apical and basolateral sides. Two days after inoculation, the medium was removed from both sides and replaced only on the basolateral side. This cell culture technique, called air interface culture (AIC), mimics the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. The Calu-3 cells secrete a sufficient amount of fluid and mucus to remain hydrated. Cell monolayers were used on days 12â€“14 after being seeded on the Transwells, the time at which the cells form confluent, electrically tight monolayers with tight junctions and show a high resistance phenotype.

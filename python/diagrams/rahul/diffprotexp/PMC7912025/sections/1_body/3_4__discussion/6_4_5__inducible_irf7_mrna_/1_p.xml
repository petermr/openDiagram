<p>In this work, we focused on IRF7, a highly NFκB-inducible transactivator of the mucosal type I IFN response [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Previous mechanistic work has found that the 
 <italic>irf7</italic> gene encodes four isoforms, IRF7A, IRF7B, IRF7C, and IRF7D (IRF7H) [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. One mechanistic study examining IRF7 processing described that inducible expression of alternatively spliced IRF7 transcripts with a GC-rich intron and a weak 5′ splice site occurred. This study established alternative splicing decreased mature IRF7 transcripts and protein levels [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Here, expression of the intron-retained IRF7-isoform-dampened type I IFN response to single-stranded virus infection. The role of intron retention in controlling the expression of fully spliced gene expression will need to be further developed.

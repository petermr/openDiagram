<p>In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, PPI analysis revealed a total of 126 RBPs, including Top30 Hub RBPs and their first stage nodes. To further investigate the prognostic significance of these RBPs, we performed a univariate cox regression analysis and obtain 13 prognosis-associated candidate RBPs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). We subsequently performed the multiple stepwise cox regression analysis to investigate the impact of these 13 prognostic-associated candidate hub RBPs on patient survival time and clinical outcomes. PGK1, SLC20A1, LEPR, CYP19A1, ZC3H12D, and PFKM were found to be independent predictors in tongue cancer (Figure

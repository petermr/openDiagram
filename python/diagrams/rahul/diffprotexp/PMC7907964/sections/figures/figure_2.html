 <caption> PPIs of the top 25 proteins differentially expressed in skin fibroblasts of patients with PD carrying (A) heterozygous acid-Î² glucosidase variants and (B) heterozygous parkin variants. PPIs were mapped using STRING and categorized by biological processes based on Gene Ontology analysis. Yellow indicates proteins involved in negative regulation of macromolecular metabolic processes; purple indicates proteins involved in an mRNA metabolic process; cyan indicates proteins involved in targeting to the membrane; red indicates proteins involved in the regulation of biological quality; blue indicates proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization; and green indicates proteins involved in an NAD metabolic process. Red circles are proteins with differentially altered expression (&gt;1.5-fold change) in the PD fibroblast group. Abbreviated protein names correspond to the full protein names shown in Table II. PPI, protein-protein interaction; PD, Parkinson's disease; STRING, using Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes. </caption>

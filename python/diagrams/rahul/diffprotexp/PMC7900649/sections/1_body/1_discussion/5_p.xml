In our study, DEGs and APA switching genes could be mapped to the cell cycle pathway, suggesting the cellular state may serve an important role in PEDV replication. The focus genes exhibiting both APA switching and changes in expression levels may act as more important functional genes. CCNB1, CDK6, ANAPC7 and CDKN2C are main regulators of cell cycle progression, while E2F1 and PCNA participate in DNA replication [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f011">Figure 11</xref> shows the resulting wall structures consisting of 70 layers. Apparently, the structures increase in height with extended CTWD as described before (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f009">Figure 9</xref>). At the same time, surface roughness increased due to the described droplet diameter, transferring frequency and wetting properties. The resulting mean structure height and mean layer height are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-02491-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Herein, the values for mean structure height were measured on three points of the wall structures and the values for mean layer height calculated by the division of mean structure height by the total number of layers. Furthermore, the results were compared to preliminary manufactured wall structures with 10 layers (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The deviation is also shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-02491-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A CTWD of 12 mm results in a structure height of approximately 107 mm, respectively a mean layer height of 1.53 mm (compare 
 <xref rid="materials-13-02491-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Increased CTWD of 44 mm led to a structure height of approximately 134 mm (1.92 mm layer height), which was an increase of 25%. Little deviations &lt; 5% compared to structures in preliminary investigations confirmed process stability and the effects of increasing CTWD on geometrical layer properties on large-volume structures.

<p id="Par22">Lastly, though the model complexity is high for NN as it is associated with two hidden layers and each layer has 9 hidden nodes. Overall, NN by far performed the best in terms of the accuracy for both train and test set for individual outputs. This shows the superiority of the NN for multiple outputs when enough data is trained. One of the drawbacks of NN is that it requires huge computation resources and takes a larger amount of time to train the model.</p>

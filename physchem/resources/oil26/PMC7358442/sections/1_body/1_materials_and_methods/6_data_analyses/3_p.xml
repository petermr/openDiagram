<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To assess changes in activity patterns, we calculated the duration of activity between time of emergence from and return to the burrows each day. On occasion, aardvarks did not emerge from their burrows and remained inactive (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>); foraging duration was assigned a zero value for these days. For each aardvark, we also calculated the proportion of each active phase that occurred between sunrise and sunset, to quantify diurnal activity of aardvarks. We used a series of GLMMs to determine which independent variables influenced duration of active phase, proportion of diurnal activity, time of emergence and time of return to the burrows relative to time of sunset and sunrise, respectively. Independent variables included minimum 24-h body temperature, minimum 24-h air temperature, EVI, and photoperiod (time between sunrise and sunset) or time of sunset or time of sunrise. Again, we used each 24-h period as a sampling unit in the GLMMs, and added a first order autocorrelation structure to account for temporal autocorrelation. We confirmed VIF &lt;2 for all independent variables in each model and aardvark identity was included as random factor. For time of emergence and return, camera trap data supplemented the dataset on days when no logger data were recorded (May to September 2015).</p>

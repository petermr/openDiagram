<p>A proxy for direct experimental validation may be represented by genome-wide interference experiments, followed by transcriptomics or functional assays. At least three screenings (the DepMap, Score and DRIVE projects) have profiled the relevance of each gene for the survival of hundreds of cancer cell lines [

 <xref rid="B162-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], while the impact on the transcriptome is provided by the Connectivity Map, even if on a restricted panel of cell lines [

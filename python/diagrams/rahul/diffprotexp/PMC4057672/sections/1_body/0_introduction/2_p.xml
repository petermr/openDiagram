<p>Ricin, a glycoprotein derived from the castor bean, is extremely toxic if taken in through oral, respiratory, or percutaneous routes. In fact, ricin has been used in multiple assassination attempts because of its high toxicity [
 <xref rid="b1-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Ricin is a putative lethal agent of biological warfare because it can be easily extracted from the waste mash of castor oil production and from the widely available castor beans. With a molecular weight of 62-kDa, ricin consists of two glycoprotein chains linked through a disulfide bridge: 32-kDa A chain and 34-kDa B chain. The 34-kDa B chain, a lectin that binds primarily to galactose-containing surface proteins, facilitates the internalization of the 32-kDa A chain, the toxic moiety. Following endocytosis and retrograde transfer through the endosome, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, the A chain of ricin enters the cytosol where it depurinates a single adenine (A4324 in mouse) in the 28S rRNA ribosomes. The depurination of the A4324 is directly responsible both for the inhibition of protein translation and for the initiation of upstream events that lead to inflammatory responses [

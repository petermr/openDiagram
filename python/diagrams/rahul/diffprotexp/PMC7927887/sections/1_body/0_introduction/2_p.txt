0: The spliceosome comprises a multi-component enzyme system that facilitates the splicing of pre-mRNA.
1: The spliceosome removes an intron and subsequently ligates the proximal 5 and 3 exons.
2: An intron is identified by the spliceosome through the recognition of four consensus elements which include: the 5 splice site; the 3 splice site; a branch point located upstream of the 3 splice site; and lastly a polypyrimidine tract located between the splice site and branch point, which aids the recruitments of splicing factors.
3: 9,  10 SF3B1, a component of the spliceosome, is essential for correct binding and splicing of pre-mRNA.

<p id="Par45">Integrated miRNA and its target mRNA expression analysis could be helpful in understanding the function of miRNAs and identifying the functional miRNA-mRNA pairs related to seed development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. To our knowledge, there was no integration analysis of miRNA and target mRNA performed in previous studies of plant seed development. In this study, we identified 65 significantly negatively correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs (
 <italic>R</italic> ≥ 0.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), which consisted of 25 miRNAs and 65 corresponding target genes. Based on homologous queries of these miRNAs corresponding target genes, 56 miRNA-mRNA pairs obtained functional annotations. These miRNA-mRNA pairs are involved in different aspects, most significantly cell differentiation and proliferation, cell elongation, hormones response and balance, organogenesis, embryo and endosperm development, mineral elements transport and accumulation, and flavonoid biosynthesis. These suggested that these identified miRNA-mRNA pairs were the key miRNA-mRNA pairs related to Tartary buckwheat seed development.

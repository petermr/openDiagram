0: To further complicate the annotation challenge, antisense transcription events have widely been discovered in  P. falciparum and are thought to be important for gene expression regulation and parasite development between life cycle stages [ 24].
1: Of particular interests are the antisense transcripts reported in the  var gene regions [ 25], which represent a gene family that encodes for roughly 60 different variants of  P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1).
2: PfEMP1 is a virulence factor that adhere to human receptors and hence enable the parasite to evade from the host immune system.
3: To avoid recognition by antibodies,  P. falciparum switches between the variant forms of PfEMP1 in a mutually exclusive manner [ 26].
4: However, the tightly controlled mechanisms underlying  var gene transcriptional control remain largely unknown.
5: It was recently shown that antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) derived from intronic region of  var can activate the corresponding  var gene [ 27], which may shed light on  var gene expression control.
6: Unravelling the regulatory roles of these noncanonical regions, such as their coding potential, will require novel approaches that are specifically tailored to them.

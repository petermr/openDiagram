<p>The number of bulk‐like and slow‐orienting molecules in the water subpopulations of the 0.6 mol kg

 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. Here, we define the hydration number (
 <italic>h</italic>) as the number of water molecules per dissolved MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> units that no longer participate in bulk‐like reorientation dynamics. This definition yields an 
 <italic>h</italic> value of 15 for the 0.6 mol kg
 <sup>−1</sup> MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution, which corresponds to approximately 6 slow water molecules in the first shell of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and 9 slow water molecules that are beyond the first shell of this ion. The hydration numbers identified using our computational procedure is independent from the structural definition of the hydration shells and corresponds slow water molecules within or outside the first hydration shells of magnesium and chloride ions.

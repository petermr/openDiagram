<p>In the present study, two histone proteins were altered. Not only does histone modification regulate gene expression, but it also recruits the protein complex, affecting the downstream proteins and thereby participating in cell division, cell apoptosis and memory formation, as well as affecting the immune system and inflammatory response. The phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination of histone proteins can be used as a marker of DNA injury, and recruited repair proteins serve an important role in the process of DNA repair (

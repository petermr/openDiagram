  <p>Correlation of 
   <italic>CCR8</italic> expression with immune cell fraction in tumor tissues in TCGA-HNSC. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Patients were divided into high- and low-expression groups based on the median value of 
   <italic>CCR8</italic> gene expression. There were significant differences in the fraction of some immune cells in the tumor tissue (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Correlation analysis of 
   <italic>CCR8</italic> and immune cell content was used to validate the above differential analysis results. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Wayne plots showed that the expression of 
   <italic>CCR4</italic>, 
   <italic>CCR8</italic>, and 
   <italic>P2RY14</italic> was associated with the fraction of several immune cells, respectively.

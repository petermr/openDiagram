<p>Retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) is a ubiquitous cytosolic DEXD/H box RNA helicase required to detect non-self RNA with important role in innate immune response against most RNA viruses including JEV and 
 <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (DENV) [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Upon detection of viral RNA, RIG-I activates transcription factors such as IRF-3, IRF-7 and NF-κβ resulting in the expression of type I IFN [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In turn, type I IFNs are secreted by virus-infected cells and bind to the heterodimeric type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) which is expressed by most (if not all) cell types [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. IFNAR activation leads to the transcription of several ISG such as OASL, ISG15, ISG20 and RIG-I Itself, which play roles as antiviral effectors [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. IFNγ is the single type II IFN. IFNγ is mostly secreted by T lymphocytes and Natural Killer cells (NK) and is considered an important component of antiviral and inflammatory responses. IFNγ is traditionally associated to protection against viral infections such as dengue [

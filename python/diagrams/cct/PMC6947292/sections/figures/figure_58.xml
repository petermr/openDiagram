   <bold>A</bold>) Specific precipitation enthalpy after cooling from solution annealing of alloy 7150, as a function of cooling rate measured by DFSC. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Specific precipitation enthalpy after cooling from solution annealing and Vickers hardness after subsequent ageing (120 Â°C 24 h) of alloy 7150, as a function of cooling rate. The enthalpy values obtained by DFSC are shown as average values and standard deviation for six samples. The solid lines are model predictions from Ref. [

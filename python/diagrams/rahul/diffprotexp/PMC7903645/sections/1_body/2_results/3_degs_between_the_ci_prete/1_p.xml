<p id="Par43">Based on pregnancy outcomes, we further divided the patients in the CI group into CI-term (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) and the CI-preterm (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) groups and investigated the DEGs between them. Comparison of clinical characteristics between the two groups is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A total of 338 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05 and fold-change ≥2) between the CI-term and CI-preterm groups (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Among these, 194 genes were significantly upregulated and 144 were downregulated in the CI-term group compared to in the CI-preterm group. Immune response and defense response to organism-associated genes, such as DEFA3, CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), RNASE3, and CRISP3, were upregulated in the CI-term group, whereas genes involved in myeloid leukocyte-mediated immunity, neutrophil activation, such as FOLR3 (folate receptor gamma), MCEMP1 (mast cell-expressed membrane protein 1), and CD177, were upregulated in the CI-preterm group. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were enriched in 84 terms in the category of biological process, and the terms of defense response and immune response were the most significantly enriched. The DEGs were enriched in 32 terms in the cellular component category and in five terms in the molecular function category (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d–f). Further, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the most significantly upregulated pathways were influenza A, NOD-like receptor (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor), and RIG-I-like receptor (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptor) signaling pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g).

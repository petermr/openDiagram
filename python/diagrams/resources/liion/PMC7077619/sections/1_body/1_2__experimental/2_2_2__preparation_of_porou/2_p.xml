<p>Because it was optimized in terms of its physical status and ionic conductivity, the sample contained 90:10 ratio of PVdF and SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and exhibited favorable values. Therefore, PVdF and SiO
 <sub>2</sub> (90–10 wt.%, 0.9 g PVdF–0.1 g SiO
 <sub>2</sub>) were taken by dissolving this mixture in 10 mL of NMP solvent by stirring vigorously for 3 h at 60 °C. Transparent white gel was obtained and casted on a glass pate, later it was immersed into deionized water for overnight. Then, the membrane was peeled out from the glass plate automatically. The obtained white sheet membrane was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for overnight to remove the residual solvent before use. The dimension of the obtained membrane was 10 cm × 5 cm (l × b). Finally, the membrane was stored in glove box towards the cell preparation.

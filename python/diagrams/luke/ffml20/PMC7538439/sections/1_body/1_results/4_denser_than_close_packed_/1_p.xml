 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a shows the equation of state for both solid and liquid phases, with the crossover indicating where the liquid is denser than the solid. The HMLP predicts a negative thermal expansion, which is consistent with DFT

 </sup>. The normalised radial distribution function (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) shows that the liquid structure is essentially unchanged with pressure up to the pressures where bond breaking becomes a factor. We therefore deduce that the denser liquid is not related to the molecular–atomic transition.

<p>On d 5, the percentage of Th subsets in cultured CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from CVB3-induced mice was analyzed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8</xref>, the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells were lower in Pnu group and higher in MLA group than in PBS group, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). Whereas, the percentages of Th2 and Treg cells were increased in Pnu group and decreased in MLA group compared with PBS group (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). Inhibiting NF-κB pathway reduced the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas inhibiting STAT3 pathway reduced the proportions of Th2 and Treg cells in the Pnu or MLA group, respectively (Pnu+PDTC versus Pnu, MLA+PDTC versus MLA, Pnu+NSC versus Pnu, MLA+NSC versus MLA, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05).

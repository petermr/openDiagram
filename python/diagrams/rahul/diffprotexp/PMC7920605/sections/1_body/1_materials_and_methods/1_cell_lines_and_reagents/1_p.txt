0: MH7A cells were provided by JENNIO Biological Technology (Guangzhou, CHN).
1: MH7A cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco), which 10% FBS (Gemini) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) were added and maintained at 37C, 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
2: MH7A cells were stimulated with TNF- (10 ng/mL), which was defined as the TNF- group, and unstimulated MH7A cells were defined as the control group.
3: After culturing for 24 h, MH7A cells were collected for the subsequent experiment.

0: The extracellular pH was measured by Shao  et al.
1: [ 43] method.
2: The extracellular pH of  F. sporotrichioides was determined by eutech pH meter.
3: The fungal suspension 10 5 CFU/mL were added to 20 mL PDB and incubated in a moist chamber at 28C  2C for 2 days.
4: The mixtures were centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was collected, washed for 23 times with sterilized double-distilled water, and resuspended in 20 mL sterilized double-distilled water.
5: After the addition of the MPE, the extracellular pH was determined.

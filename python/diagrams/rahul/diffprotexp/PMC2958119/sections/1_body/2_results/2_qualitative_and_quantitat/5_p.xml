<p>In addition to qualitative differential protein expression, the two larvae were also compared based on quantitative differential protein expression levels. As the two larvae upregulated some important proteins in common at both developmental stages, this method is particularly useful to support the results of the qualitative studies. Accordingly, the expression level for most of the functional classes at both developmental stages showed differences between the two larvae. There was over-expression in queen larvae at 72 hours in transketolase, aldehyde reductase, enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, imaginal disc growth factor 4, proteasome subunit alpha type 5 and long-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase as compared with the worker larvae. Likewise, worker destined larvae over-expressed ATP synthase ÃŸ subunit, aldehyde dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase, peroxiredoxin 2540, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, lethal (2)37, 14-3-3 protein epsilon and fatty acid binding protein (

At 120 hours, queen larvae over-expressed phosphoglycerate mutase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, larval serum protein 1, ornithine aminotransferase precursor, long-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase, 14-3-3 protein epsilon, imaginal disc growth factor 4, glutathione S transferase S1, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, ERp60, heat shock protein 3 and translation controlled tumor protein as compared with the worker larvae. Worker larvae over-expressed larval serum protein 2, fatty acid binding protein, arginine kinase, cathepsin D, actin-87E isoform 2 and short chain dehydrogenase/reductase l as compared to the queen larvae (

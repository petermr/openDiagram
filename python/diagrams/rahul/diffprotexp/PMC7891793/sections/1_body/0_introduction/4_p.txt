0: It has been previously demonstrated that NSAIDs help to improve clinical outcomes of specific antiviral agents and combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy of the acute RSV infection looks most promising, as it was previously demonstrated with the combination of anti-RSV antibody therapy with NSAID or corticosteroids [ 16].
1: Besides the antibody therapy, the RSV fusion protein inhibitor (FPI) has been recently developed as a specific anti-RSV therapeutic.
2: It blocks virus entry by inhibiting the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.
3: The BRSV model was used to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of this therapeutic agent, GS-561937 (or GS1).
4: It is a close structural analog of GS-5806, RSV FPI, developed for humans.
5: GS1 demonstrated clear therapeutic effect by reducing the viral load, disease symptom score and lung pathology in experimental calves [ 17].
6: Similarly, in a challenge study of healthy adults, treatment with GS-5806 reduced the viral load and the severity of clinical presentation [ 18].
7: These promising results raised a question regarding the efficacy of combined FPI and COX inhibitor therapy and the possible benefit of this combination suggesting that the combination of a NSAID and a specific antiviral agent can improve the outcome of the disease even more than one treatment alone.

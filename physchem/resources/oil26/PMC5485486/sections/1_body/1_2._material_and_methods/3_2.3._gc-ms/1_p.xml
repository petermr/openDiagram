<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The obtained essential oil samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph Trace GC Ultra equipped with a FID detector and a capillary column (30&#8201;m &#215; 0.25&#8201;mm, 0.25&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>m film thickness) DB-5 (methyl polysiloxane with 5% phenyl); the injection volume was 1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>L. The gas chromatograph was coupled to a mass spectrometer Q Polaris MS that performs the analysis of the mass spectrometry (70&#8201;eV with an ion trap). The temperature program was 40&#176;C for 2&#8201;min and then heated to 180&#176;C at a rate of 4&#176;C/min. The carrier gas was helium (1.4&#8201;ml/min).</p>

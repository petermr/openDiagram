<p id="Par42">In the Tartary buckwheat genome, 278 miRNAs have been predicted through a genome-wide bioinformatics analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In our study, a total of 230 miRNAs, including 101 known and 129 novel miRNAs, were identified during Tartary buckwheat seed development. Among the miRNAs, more than two-thirds were expressed at high and moderate levels. These indicated that most miRNAs in the Tartary buckwheat genome were involved in the seed development, and further suggested that Tartary buckwheat seed development was an extremely complex biological process. Notably, the fta-miR159 exhibited the highest expression in the developmental Tartary buckwheat seed. In strawberry, Fa-miR159b and Fa-miR159b were more highly expressed in developing fruit and played a key regulatory role in fruit development [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In rice, osa-miR159 was also more highly expressed in developing seed and positively regulated grain length and width [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, our results suggested that fta-miR159 might also possess a crucial regulation role in the Tartary buckwheat seed development.

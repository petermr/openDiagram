<p>Li–B–Mg composite with in situ formed 3D LiB fiber network is successfully manufactured and introduced as a potential anode for LMBs. On the one hand, the fibrillar conductive LiB skeleton not only contributes to the reduction of the local current density, but also acts as a host for the storage of Li; on the other hand, the stronger affinity to Li of the skeleton due to the introduction of Mg regulates the incoming Li
 <sup>+</sup> flux and helps to reduce Li ion concentration gradient during Li deposition. Besides, Li(Mg) alloy with large solid solution is also beneficial to maintain the integrity and stability of the structure during Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition. As a result, the proposed 3D Li–B–Mg composite anode shows less volume change and a dendrite‐free feature during electrochemical cycling. In addition, the Li–B–Mg composite assembled symmetrical battery achieves a long and stable cycle lifespan of more than 500 h at 0.5 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with a low overpotential. Moreover, full batteries assembled with the proposed 3D Li–B–Mg composite display improved electrochemical performance compared to that assembled with pure Li. The pouch‐type battery also shows outstanding safety properties. Therefore, on the basis of current research, it is suggested that the Li–B–Mg composite is a promising candidate to substitute Li metal anode in LMBs and it may significantly propel the advancement of LMB technology from laboratory research to industrial commercialization.

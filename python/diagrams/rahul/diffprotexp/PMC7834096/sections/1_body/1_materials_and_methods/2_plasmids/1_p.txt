0: All plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2 and all primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
1: The structural genes coding for the different AAF allelic variants were amplified from clinical isolates (see Supplementary Table S1) by PCR using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S3 and cloned into the expression vector pBAD24 [ 26].
2: The integrity of all cloned AAF encoding gene clusters was afterward confirmed by Sanger sequencing of overlapping segments.

<p id="Par54">To further investigate the prognostic value of these eight hub RBPs in BLCA, we plotted their Kaplan–Meier survival curves to assess their relationships with overall survival (OS). Six hub RBPs (gem nuclear organelle associated protein 7 [
 <italic>GEMIN7</italic>], 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 [
 <italic>OAS1</italic>], apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3H [
 <italic>APOBEC3H</italic>], aspartyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial [
 <italic>DARS2</italic>], YTH domain containing 1 [
 <italic>YTHDC1</italic>], and RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 3 [
 <italic>RBMS3</italic>]) were correlated with OS in BLCA patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Furthermore, we used immunohistochemistry results from the HPA database to further explore the protein expression levels of these hub RBPs in BLCA. The results showed higher tripartite motif containing 71 [TRIM71] expression in BLCA tissues compared to that in non-tumour tissues, while DARS2 and RBMS3 expression levels were downregulated in tumour tissues. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in the expression levels of OAS1, APOBEC3H, and YTHDC1 between tumour and normal tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). No data were available for elongation factor Tu GTP binding domain containing 2 [EFTUD2] and GEMIN7 in the HPA database.

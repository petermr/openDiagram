<p>Protein aggregates can arise from specific mutations that cause defects in the folding of proteins that are otherwise structured. However, it is estimated that 41% of proteins contain unstructured regions and unstructured proteins are more prone to aggregation (

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Proteasome degradation is the main mechanism to prevent protein aggregations while autophagy can eliminate existing aggregates. However, since inhibition of autophagy in motor neurons specifically does not impact disease progression in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the proteasome appears to be the main mediator of protection against proteotoxic stress in these cells (

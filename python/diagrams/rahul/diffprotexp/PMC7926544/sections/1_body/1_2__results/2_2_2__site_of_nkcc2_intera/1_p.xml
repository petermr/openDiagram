<p>Previous studies indicated that STCH is localized mainly in the ER [

 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] which is in line with its interaction with the immature form of NKCC2. To verify this hypothesis, we next compared the subcellular distribution of NKCC2 and STCH with the ER marker calnexin. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, in HEK cells co-transfected with Myc-NKCC2 and GFP-STCH, both proteins largely colocalized with the ER marker calnexin, supporting therefore further the notion that STCH binds to the immature form of the co-transporter and that the main site of interaction between the proteins is the ER. However, the fact that STCH interacts only with the immature form of the co-transporter cannot exclude the possibility that this interaction may also take place outside the ER. Indeed, given that the N-glycan of glycoproteins at the entrance of the Golgi apparatus is still of high mannose type, it is conceivable that the interaction of the two proteins may also take place at the cis-Golgi network. In support of this notion, Sleat et al. reported that STCH protein possesses an N-linked glycosylation site containing Man-6-P which per se, clearly indicates that STCH is not only N-glycosylated but it is also processed at least in the cis-Golgi network [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, lysosomal proteins such as the hydrolases are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and move to the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi network, where they are covalently modified by the addition of the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) group [

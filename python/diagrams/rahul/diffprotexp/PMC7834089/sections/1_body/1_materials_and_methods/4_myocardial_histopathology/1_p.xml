<p>Heart tissue was embedded in paraffin. Samples were then sectioned into 5-μm-thick slices and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Each heart was cut into an average of three slices, and each slice was used to observe three visual fields. Two independent observers blind to the experimental conditions assigned pathological scores based on the following semi-quantitative scale: 0 = no lesion; 1 = lesion involving &lt;25% of the myocardium; 2 = lesions involving 25% to 50%; 3 = lesions involving 50% to 75%; and 4 = lesions involving 75% to 100%, as previously described [

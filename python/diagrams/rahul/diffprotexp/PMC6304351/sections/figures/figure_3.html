 <caption> (A) Spectral counts (means ± SE; n = 4) of differentially expressed subterminal alkane oxidation proteins during growth on a medium-chain alkane ( n-C 14,), a long-chain alkane ( n-C 28,) and a non-hydrocarbon control (Tween 80) in Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1. ∗ denotes spectral counts significantly greater ( P &lt; 0.05) during growth on n-C 28 relative to growth on n-C 14 and TW. (B) Subterminal oxidation of an n-alkane by the identified proteins. An alkane monooxygenase (AM) introduces oxygen into the alkane at a subterminal carbon converting it into a secondary alcohol. The secondary alcohol is converted to the corresponding ketone by an alcohol dehydrogenase (AD). This ketone is then oxidized by a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) to render an ester. The ester is then hydrolysed by an esterase (E), generating an alcohol and a fatty acid that then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. </caption>

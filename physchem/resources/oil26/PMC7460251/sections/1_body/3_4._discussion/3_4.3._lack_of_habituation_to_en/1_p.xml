This lack of habituation may have been influenced by the week between presentations of the same item. Intermittent presentation of enrichment has been shown to help maintain enrichment use [<xref rid="B27-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B31-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The overall lack of habituation may also provide further evidence that the enrichment was motivating for the aardvarks, and that through enrichment use, the aardvarks were reinforced to perform meaningful behaviors throughout the study.</p>

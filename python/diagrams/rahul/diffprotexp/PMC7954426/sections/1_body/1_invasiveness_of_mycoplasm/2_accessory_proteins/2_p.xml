<p>The most extensively studied mycoplasma for accessory proteins is 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, which incorporates two groups of accessory proteins, the first including P90 and P40, and the second including HMW1â€“3 and P65 [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. P90 and P40 are surface-exposed proteins located in the terminal organelle near P1. Both P90 and P40 mutants result in P1 scattered on the cell surface rather than anchored at the tip structure [

 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In contrast, HMW1 and HMW3 are not located on the surface of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> but are involved in maintaining the morphology and stability of the tip structure, and in clustering other adhesins to this structure. HMW2 may be located at the base of the tip structure and is crucial to promote the stable and fully functional cell surface output of HMW1, HMW3, and P65 [

 <xref rid="cit0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Furthermore, the loss of HMW1 also decreases the level of P65 [

<p>The continuous cooling precipitation diagram of the batch of aluminum alloy 6005A investigated here is available [
 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Out of this diagram, one can read the critical cooling rates. Two main temperature ranges exist that must be considered: high-temperature (HTR) and low-temperature (LTR) precipitation reactions [
 <xref rid="b27-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Each of those has its own known critical cooling rate [
 <xref rid="b27-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The critical cooling rates of 6005A are 6.3 K/s for the LTR and 0.67 K/s for the HTR.

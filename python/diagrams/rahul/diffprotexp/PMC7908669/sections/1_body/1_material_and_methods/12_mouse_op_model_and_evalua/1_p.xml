<p id="Par20">The mouse OP model was established by ovariectomy surgery as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Usage Committee of the Sun Yat-sen University (Guangdong, China). The LV5-sh_NC and LV5-sh-hsa_circ_0003865 lentiviruses were packaged and prepared by the Vigene Biosciences company (Jinan, Shandong, China). Thirty female SPF-grade C57BL/6J mice between 6 and 8 weeks old were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) and randomly divided into a sh-NC group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), an OP + sh-NC group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), and an OP + sh-hsa_circ_0003865 group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). The sh-NC group was injected with 10 μl empty vector at the distal femur (10
 <sup>13</sup> copies/mouse) before the sham operation. Mice in the OP + sh-NC group were injected with a 10 μl empty vector (10
 <sup>13</sup> copies/mouse) in the distal femur, followed by ovariectomy surgery. Mice in the OP + sh-hsa_circ_0003865 group were injected with 10 μl of sh-hsa_circ_0003865 (10
 <sup>13</sup> copies/mouse) in the distal femur and then subjected to ovariectomy. Bone microstructure analysis by micro-CT examination was conducted as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the relative expression of circ-0003865, 
 <italic>ALP</italic>, 
 <italic>RUNX2</italic>, 
 <italic>OPN</italic>, 
 <italic>GAS1</italic>, and miR-3865-3P in bone tissues. The relative abundance of RFP (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), ALP, RUNX2 OPN, and GAS1 proteins in bone tissues was measured by immunofluorescence using the Immunol Fluorescence Staining Kit (#P0179; Beyotime Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

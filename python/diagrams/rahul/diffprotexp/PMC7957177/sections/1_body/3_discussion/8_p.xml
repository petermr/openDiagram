<p>In summary, using a gene‐level to protein‐level analysis, our results demonstrate that KRT17 and CRISP2 are specifically expressed in various histological stages of cervical carcinoma. Therefore, combined analysis of KRT17 and CRISP2 expression is greatly helpful for early histological diagnosis of cervical precancerous lesions. Some novel methods may provide more convenient indicators, including serum biomarkers, circulating auto‐antibodies against P16,

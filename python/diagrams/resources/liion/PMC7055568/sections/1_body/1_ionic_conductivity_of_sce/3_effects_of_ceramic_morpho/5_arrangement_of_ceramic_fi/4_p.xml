<p>Furthermore, the ordered 3D ceramic electrolytes were also prepared by 3D printing technology as an effective method to construct 3D ceramic framework. For instance, Zekoll et al.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref> constructed 3D ordered ceramic electrolyte (LAGP) with bicontinuous microchannels in polymers such as epoxy polymer and polypropylene using 3D printing templates with ordered cubic, gyroidal, diamond‐shaped structure as well as bijel‐derived microarchitecture (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1507-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f). The SCE with gyroidal architecture presents a total ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at room temperature, only slightly lower than a dense ceramic pellet with 2.8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, the gyroidal hybrid electrolyte has much higher mechanical strength than pure LAGP pellet, and presents a better restriction for lithium dendrite growth. Therefore, the SCEs with well‐integrated structure could effectively enhance Li ion conduction and effectively prevent the agglomeration of fillers even at high concentration.

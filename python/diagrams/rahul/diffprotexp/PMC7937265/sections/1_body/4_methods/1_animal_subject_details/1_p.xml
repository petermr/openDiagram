<p id="Par45">Male and female zebra finches from our breeding colony at the University of Georgia were randomly assigned in breeding pairs. Pairs were individually housed in standard cages (43 × 43 × 38 cm) with a light dark cycle of 14:10 h. They received two perches, a nest-box, and burlap ribbon as nesting material. They were provided with a mixed seed diet, water, and cuttlebone ad libitum. Food and water were checked and refreshed daily. Offspring were reared in the parental cage until their sexually dimorphic adult plumage was visible (~ 50 days post-hatch), at which point they were placed in same-sex flocks in standard cages. This study was approved by the University of Georgia’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP #A2014-03-014-Y2-A0).</p>

<p>In conclusion, the present study identified five candidate proteins differentially expressed in patients with KD and CAD/CAA: CFH, MBL2, KNG1, FN1 and SERPINC1. These five proteins provide a basis for understanding the differences between CAD and CAA in patients with KD. The alterations in MBL2 and CFH indicated that responses to pathogen infections and the innate immune system may be closely associated with the development of CAD. Decreased levels of KNG1 and SERPINC1 revealed that dysfunctions in coagulation accompanied the development of CAA. Decreased FN1 expression levels in the two conditions indicated that the pathways, including cell adhesion, migration, wound healing and blood coagulation may serve a role in the occurrence of CAD and CAA. The five proteins investigated in the present study may also serve to distinguish CAD and CAA in the early diagnosis of KD.</p>

<p>Amino acid and fatty acid metabolizing proteins are vital for larval rapid growth and are used in the process of metamorphosis

 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Barchuk3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Their upregulation in worker larvae at late developmental stages and in queen larvae at early developmental stages agree with previous studies

 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> Furthermore, the over-expression of arginine kinase and fatty-acid binding protein which function as an energy transporter from mitochondria to high energy demanding areas for the development of honeybee brain, thorax, compound eye and antennae, during the late developmental stage in worker larvae 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Kucharski1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> is in agreement with previous reports 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Evans2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Barchuk3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The upregulation of long-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase only in queen destined larvae at both developmental stages suggests a high demand for lipid metabolizing enzymes to cope with the high metabolic rate and development of queen destined larvae via food degredation to the release of stored energy and synthesis of primary stored energy.

<p>X-ray absorbing atoms often coexist in the sample in different chemical state or environment. For example, under reaction conditions, the coexistence of reduced and oxidized species is common. In fact, in some cases it has been shown that the coexistence of metal atoms in different oxidation states is beneficial for the catalyst activity, as for example, in the case of Pt-based catalysts for ORR,

 </sup> The ability of the XAS method to quantify the populations of different species in heterogeneous mixtures is thus essential for studies of catalysts at work. At the same time, the need to disentangle contributions of different species to the sample-averaged XAFS spectrum is one of the most significant challenges for

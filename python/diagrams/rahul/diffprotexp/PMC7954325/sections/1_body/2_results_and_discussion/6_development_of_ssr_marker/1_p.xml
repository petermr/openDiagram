<p>Mining existing diversity and functional validation in a large population are vital for germplasm conservation and crop improvement. bZIPs play crucial roles in plants in stress and developmental processes. Therefore, it is important to develop molecular markers that can be used in breeding programs [

 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Out of 30 candidate 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic>, only sixteen had SSR containing sequences from which 22 SSRs were identified (
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The highest number of tri repeats was eleven among these SSRs. Detailed information regarding SSR-like motif frequency and frequency of classified repeat types are available in 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247864.s007">S6 Table</xref>. It is important to note that these SSR markers were derived from 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> which were differentially regulated in a stress-specific manner. For example, 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>2, 4, 7, 23, 38, 71, 75 were differentially regulated under salt stress, 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>25, 54, and 82 under mannitol stress, 
 <italic>StbZIP38</italic> under water stress, 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>7 and 25 under ABA stress, 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>5 under IAA stress, and 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>23 under GA3 stress (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247864.s007">S6 Table</xref>). These candidate 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> and SSRs add to the list of known genes and markers and after validation can be further used in the marker-trait analysis to breed potato for tolerance to abiotic stresses. A similar approach was adopted to identify candidate 
 <italic>bZIPs</italic> and develop SSR markers in 
 <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and wheat [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

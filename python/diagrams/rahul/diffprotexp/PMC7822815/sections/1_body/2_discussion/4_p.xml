<p id="Par49">In addition, we found a sub-set of splicing-related genes that were differentially expressed upon RUNX1/RUNX1T1 knockdown. This sub-set includes genes encoding classical splicing regulators (for example, 
 <italic>RBM28, RBFOX2, HNRNPLL</italic>), as well as multifunctional genes (for instance, 
 <italic>DYRK1A</italic>) encoding proteins with different activities, including components of the nuclear speckles, which are considered an area of intensive splicing

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The results of our phytochemical analysis showed consistent differences in the content of Palestinian <italic>T. bovei</italic> when compared with the only study which was conducted on the similar species by Tepe et al. 2011. Trans-geraniol, &#945;-citral and &#946;-citral were identified as major components of the Palestinian <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil while the major components of the Turkish <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil were carvacrol, p-cymene and thymol. This may be due to the differences between the two geographic and topographic areas, which may greatly affect their constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

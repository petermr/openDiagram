<p>The ratio of immune and stromal cells in the TME of each sample was calculated using the ESTIMATE package (Version 1.0.13) based on the R software version 3.6.1. The data used were HTSeq-FPKM RNA-seq expression data. Results are presented in the form of three scores, including ImmuneScore, StromalScore, and ESTIMATEScore.The higher the respective score, the greater the ratios of the corresponding components in the TME. If the overall score is higher, the proportion of tumor cells in the tumor tissue is lower with lower tumor purity.</p>

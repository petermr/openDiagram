<p>Adipose tissue is a very attractive tissue in plastic surgery used for remodelling, as it is easily manipulated and gained. Yet, adipose tissue is not an inert tissue but indeed a potent endocrine organ that can actively trigger inflammation[
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Many studies underline the injurious effects adipose tissue has in obesity regarding the development of the metabolic syndrome. Adipose tissue has a tremendous modulatory power as it secretes diverse cytokines and triggers inflammation. During fat transplantation, this tissue is not only mechanically manipulated but also imposed to the transplantational stress. Moreover, in some cases even its microenvironment changes when lipofilling is performed into a muscle[
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Adipose-derived stem cells have been shown to improve the graft volume retention in lipofilling, and it is supposed to happen through secretion of growth factors by ADSCs[
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Considering the adipose tissue capacity to secrete cytokines, react on micro environmental changes and interfere in inflammation, we aimed to analyse the effect of transplantation on the transplanted adipose tissue.

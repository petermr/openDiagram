0: The essential oil of  T. bovei was investigated for its antibacterial and antifungal activities.
1: The antibacterial activity was examined against the growth of four reference bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC);  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) as well as against the growth of a diagnostically-confirmed Methicillin Resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates.
2: The antifungal activity of  T. bovei essential oil was examined against the growth of a diagnostically-confirmed  Candida albicans clinical isolate.
3: The antimicrobial activities of  T. bovei oil used in this study were determined by using broth micro-dilution method as described previously by Wikler 2007 [ 15].
4: The essential oil of  T. bovei was dissolved in 5 % Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 132 mg/ml.
5: The prepared oil solution was filter-sterilized and then was serially micro-diluted (2 folds) 11 times in sterile nutrient broth.
6: The dilution processes were carried out under aseptic conditions in 96 well plates.
7: In the micro-wells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the oil, the concentration of this oil ranged from 0.129 to 66 mg/ml.
8: While the concentrations of this oil in the micro-wells assigned to evaluate their antifungal activities ranged from 0.065 to 55 mg/ml.
9: In these plates, micro-well number 11 contained essential oils-free nutrient broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth.
10: On the other hand, micro-well number 12 contained essential oils-free nutrient broth that was left un-inoculated with any of the test microbes.
11: This well was used as a negative control for microbial growth.
12: Micro-wells numbers 1 to 11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes.
13: At the time of inoculation, the final concentrations of microbial cells were about 5  10 5 and 0.52.5  10 3 colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml for the tested bacterial pathogens and  Candida albicans, respectively.
14: Each of the included microbes in this study was examined in duplicate for being inhibited by the obtained  T. bovei essential oil.

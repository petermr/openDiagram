0: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using differential gene expression at transcript-level using DESeq2 R library 51,  52.
1: To facilitate kallisto output import, transcript-level estimated counts, length, and abundance were extracted using  tximport function 53.
2: As described by Michael Love group, transcript-level differential gene expression enhances analysis resolution 52.
3: Using  DESeqDataSetFromTximport, a DESeq2 object was created and filtered using rows with sum of all counts bigger than 10.
4: Next,  DESeq function was used with default values.
5: Using the  results function, we selected all genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01 and fold change (FC) > 1.3.
6: We also used RIN and PMI as covariates (linear regression).

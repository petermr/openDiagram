<p>The HCC TMA blocks were cut into 4-μm slices and mounted onto glass slides. These slides were then dewaxed and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol and blocked with a Biotin-Blocking Kit (DAKO, Glostrup, Germany). HE and IHC staining of CPSF1 (1:200, Bethyl, A301-580) were then performed, and the slides were assessed by two independent pathologists who calculated the respective IHC scores. The IHC scores were determined by multiplying the staining intensity by the proportion of stained nuclei. The staining intensity was scored as four grades (0, 1, 2, and 3), which indicated a staining intensity from blank to strong staining. The proportion was scored as five grades (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), which indicated a staining area of 0, 1–25, 25–50, 50–75, and 75–100%, respectively. The median IHC score was used as the cutoff value to separate patients into high and low CPSF1 expression groups.</p>

<p>In summary, our study demonstrated for the first time the comprehensive analysis of m
 <sup>5</sup>C modulators in GI cancer. The dysregulation of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators in GI cancer was shown, its association with patient survival and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed, and the main downstream pathway and major target were determined. Besides, the compound termed streptozotocin may be a key candidate drug for targeted therapy in GI cancer. This is a pioneer study of the relationship between m
 <sup>5</sup>C dysregulation and cancer, but our results lack experimental verification, which warrants further validation of the involvement of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators and their downstream targets in GI cancer.

0: Western blotting analysis was performed as previously described in 71 with slight modifications.
1: For the analysis of A and SNCA oligomers, samples were loaded under non-reducing and non-denaturating conditions.
2: For the analysis of the remaining proteins, the samples were resuspended in 6  sample buffer (4  TrisCl/SDS, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.6 M DTT, 0.012% bromophenol blue) under reducing conditions.
3: Depending on the protein molecular weight, samples were loaded onto accordingly % SDS-PAGE gels.
4: After transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), the membranes were incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered solution (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% BSA, followed by an overnight incubation with the respective primary antibodies at 4 C with gentle agitation.
5: The primary antibodies used were the following: 1:1,000 polyclonal anti-alpha-SNCA, oligomer specific Syn-33 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: ABN2265); 1:1,000 polyclonal anti-LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 3868); 1:16,000 monoclonal anti-acetylated -tubulin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: T7451); 1:1,000 monoclonal anti-synaptophysin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: S5768); 1:1,000 anti-PSD95 (postsynaptic density protein 95) antibody from Abcam (Cambridge; UK) (cat number: ab18258); 1:1,000 anti-Lamp2A (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A) from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA) (cat number: ab37024); 1:750 anti-Tau Acetyl K280 from AnaSpec (Fremont, CA, USA) (cat number: AS-56077); 1:1,000 anti-Beclin1 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 3738); 1:1,000 anti-p62 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: P0067); 1:1,000 anti-Lamp1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 3243); 1:750 anti-phospho-Tau Ser396 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) (cat number: sc-101815); 1:1,000 anti-A from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 8243); 1:1,000 anti-cathepsin D (CatD) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) (cat number: sc-377124); 1:1,000 anti-Hsp60 from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA, USA) (cat number: 611563); 1:1,000 monoclonal anti-Tau, clone Tau46 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: T9450); 1:1,000 anti-BiP/GRP78 (78-kDa Glucose-regulated protein) from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA, USA) (cat number: 610979); 1:1,000 anti-ATF4 (Activating transcription factor 4) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 97038).
6: Monoclonal anti--tubulin (1:10,000) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: T 6199) was used for loading control.
7: Human brain alpha-synuclein was recognized by mass spectrometric detection.
8: Membranes were washed with TBS containing 0.1% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween three times (each time for 10 min), and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation.
9: After three washes, specific bands of interest were detected by developing with an alkaline phosphatase enhanced chemical fluorescence reagent (ECF from GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
10: Fluorescence signals were detected using a Biorad Versa-Doc Imager, and band densities were determined using Quantity One Software.
11: Membranes were revealed using Biorad Versa-Doc Imager.
12: Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using Quantity One Software and expressed relative to alpha-tubulin.
13: Full length blots are presented in Supplementary Information.

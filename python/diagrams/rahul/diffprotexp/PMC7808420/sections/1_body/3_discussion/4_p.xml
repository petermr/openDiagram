<p>Our data indicates that glial cells depend on an intact type I IFN response to restrict SLEV replication, as glial primary cell cultures (microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) from ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice show increased viral load when compared to WT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>). Cytokine levels were also increased in the supernatant of infected ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> glia cell cultures in comparison to WT glial cell cultures. Therefore, we suggest that increased proinflammatory cytokine production from ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> glial cell cultures is a consequence of increased viral replication, as greater viral replication would result in greater stimulus for proinflammatory cytokine production. We could not determine if SLEV preferentially infects microglia, oligodendrocytes or astrocytes 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. While IBA-1-positive microglial cells showed clear morphological signs of activation in SLEV-infected brains, the microglia in the brains of infected ABR
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice were largely unchanged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that proinflammatory cytokines would be expressed by oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Whether the expression of proinflammatory cytokines take place in SLEV-infected glial cells or is an indirect effect of infection is still unclear.

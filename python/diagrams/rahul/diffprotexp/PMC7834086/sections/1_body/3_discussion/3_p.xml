<p>Nucleosomes comprise of DNA complexed with histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The PirB toxin protein could interact with histone H4 in shrimp hemocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002 f0003">Figs. 2 and 3</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis also identified histone H3 as a putative PirB interacting protein (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), while PirB was found to specifically interact with histones isolated from Drosophila S2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4</xref>). These results thus confirm that PirB proteins can enter hemocytes to interact with nucleosome proteins. As essential components of nucleosomes, histones are targets of bacterial or viral toxins. The interaction between toxins and histones could disrupt nucleosome assembly, thereby affecting the modification of nucleosomes and repair of host DNA, which eventually leads to apoptosis [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For instance, the nonstructural protein ICP11 of WSSV binds with histone H2A and H3 to prevent DNA binding, hence destroying the assembly of nucleosomes [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Similarly, the 5-methylcytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase, Rv2966c, secreted by 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> can bind to histone H3 and H4 to affect their methylation and therefore assist in invading host cells [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The ability of PirB to interact with histones, as observed in this study, suggests that upon entry into shrimp hemocytes, PirB binds to histones to induce apoptosis. Under both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, rPirB was found to induce hemocyte apoptosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>), synonymous with the studies reported by Nimsanor et al. [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

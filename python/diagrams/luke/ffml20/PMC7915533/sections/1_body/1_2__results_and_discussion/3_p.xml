 <xref rid="marinedrugs-19-00095-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was very simple, with only six resonances being observed. Edited HSQC correlations (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-19-00095">Figure S5</xref>) indicated that two of the proton singlets could be assigned to 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl groups δ
 <sub>H/C</sub> 3.66/31.3 and 3.46/30.3 and two were methylene groups δ
 <sub>H/C</sub> 3.65/40.6 and 3.34/26.3, while the remaining two signals were due to protons that were not attached to carbons. COSY correlations (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-19-00095">Figure S4</xref>) between the methylene resonance at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 3.65 and both the methylene resonance at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 3.34 and an amine signal at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 8.15 indicated that a CH
 <sub>2</sub>CH
 <sub>2</sub>NH moiety was present in the molecule. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts for the methylene at 3.34/26.3 were consistent with it being substituted by a sulfur atom [

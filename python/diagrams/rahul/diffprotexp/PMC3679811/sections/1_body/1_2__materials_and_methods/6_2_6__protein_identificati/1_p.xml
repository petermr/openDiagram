<p>The tryptic digests of the proteins were separated and identified using a flow rate of 400 nL/min with an RP-nano-UPLC system (nanoACQUITY UPLC, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Discovery Hybrid FTMS, Thermo, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. For RP-nano-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS, a sample (2 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) of the desired peptide digest was loaded into the reverse phase column (Symmetry C18, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, 180 
 <italic>μ</italic>m × 20 mm) by an autosampler. The RP separation was performed using a linear acetonitrile gradient from 99% buffer A (100% D.I. water/0.1% formic acid) to 85% buffer B (100% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) in 45 min using the micropump. The separation was performed on a C18 microcapillary column (BEH C18, 1.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, 75 
 <italic>μ</italic>m × 100 mm) using the nanoseparation system. As peptides eluted from the microcapillary column, they were electrosprayed into the ESI-MS/MS with the application of a distal 2.1 kV spraying voltage with heated capillary temperature of 200°C. Each cycle of one full-scan mass spectrum (

0: RT-qPCR was performed using another set of NFPA samples to verify the credibility of the bioinformatics analyses.
1: According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, five cases of NFPAs with recurrence within 1 year and four cases of NFPAs with recurrence after 5 years were randomly selected from the patients who underwent surgical resection in Beijing Tiantan Hospital between August 2009 and November 2014 as the validation set.
2: The total RNA of validated samples was extracted and purified as aforementioned.
3: Reverse transcription into cDNA was performed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (cat.
4: no.
5: 0049472; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions.
6: Next, a Power SYBRTM Green PCR Master Mix (cat.
7: no.
8: 4367659; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used for qPCR with a total reaction volume of 20 l. Amplification was performed as follows: 95C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95C for 15 sec and 60C for 60 sec, and a final extension at 72C for 5 min.
9: GAPDH was used as an internal control gene.
10: All primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.
11: The level of mRNAs was determined using QuantStudio 3 and 5 systems (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).
12: For relative quantitation, expression levels were calculated expression levels were calculated using the 2 Cq method ( 41).
13: The sequences of the primers are as follows: GAPDH forward, 5-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA-3 and reverse, 5-CCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCA-3; NOL6 forward, 5-ATTCGGGAAGCTGTGGTCTG-3 and reverse, 5-ATGTCAGCATGGAGTGCCAA-3; and LL21NC02-21A1.1 forward, 5-CTGCCCGATCTCACCTCTTC-3 and reverse, 5-TCAGGGAAGGACTCCAGGTT-3.

0: Antibacterial potential of the essential oil of  T. minuta flower was tested against four Gram-positive bacteria reference strains which were  S. aureus,  M. smegmatis,  S. uberis and  L. ivanovii and three Gram-negative bacteria namely  E. cloacae,  Vibrio spp.
1: and  E. coli following CLSI [ 28] guideline.
2: The bacterial suspensions were made by inoculating a fresh stock culture of the test bacteria strains into tubes containing 5 mL of sterile Luria- Bertani broth and incubated for 24 h at 37 C. Active cultures grown overnight in sterile Luria- Bertani broth were inoculated into Mueller-Hinton Agar (MHA) incubated for 24 h at 37 C. After incubation, single colonies were transferred from MHA plates into 4 mL of normal saline solution determined spectrophotometrically at 580 nm as previously reported by Duarte et al., [ 29] adapted by Omoruyi et al.
3: [ 24], and the dilutions matching with 0.5 Mc-Farland standard were used for the assay.

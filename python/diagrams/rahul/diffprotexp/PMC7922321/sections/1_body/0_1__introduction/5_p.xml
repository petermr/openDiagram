<p>Malignant gliomas are the most common and lethal primary tumors of the brain. Grading of diffuse gliomas is based largely on the mitotic activity and vascular proliferation states, and molecular markers are also used as diagnostic entities. Still, further molecular information will be important in a more detailed description and categorization of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, in particular for reliable and reproducible classification of grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas [

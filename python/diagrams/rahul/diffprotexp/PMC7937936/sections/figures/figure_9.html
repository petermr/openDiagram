 <caption> Relationship between the expression levels of hub genes in tumor tissues and clinical characteristics of patients. (A–C) The expression of CCR4 (A), CCR8 (B), and P2RY14 (C) were all significantly correlated with the T staging. The expression levels of these genes all decreased gradually with the progression of the T stage. (D–F) Similar results were seen with the pathological staging in all three hub genes, but not as significant as for T staging. (G–I) All of these genes were less expressed in males than in females, with no significant difference was shown in CCR4 ( P&gt;0.05), and significant differences were demonstrated in both CCR8 and P2RY14 ( P&lt;0.05). </caption>

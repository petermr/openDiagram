0: Electron microscopy analyses revealed that Gp cells might vary in their width, while the shape of Gd cells was mostly uniform 7  9.
1: In addition, Gp cells have a greater percentage of cells in mitotic stage with columnar shape, while Gd cells display cuboidal shape 7  9.
2: In addition to their morphological difference, Gd cells and Gp cells differ in their total protein content and mitotic activity.
3: Gp cells showed lower protein content and higher mitotic activity, with a relatively higher proportion of cells in S and G2/M phase, whereas Gd cells demonstrated a higher protein content and a higher proportion of cells in G1 phase, as detected by flow cytometry 10.
4: In the largest F1 preovulatory follicle, Gp cells show a higher  3H-thymidine incorporation rate 11,  12, however, Gd cells show a greater responsiveness to LH and produce more progesterone 13, which is likely associated with the higher mRNA levels of LH receptor therein 14.

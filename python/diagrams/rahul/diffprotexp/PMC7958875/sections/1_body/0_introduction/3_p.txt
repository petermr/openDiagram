0: Single-cell technologies provide the possibility to understand clonally variant transcriptional patterns in unicellular parasites by deconvoluting the contribution of each individual and allowing for precise ordering of parasites in developmental time ( Poran et al., 2017;  Brancucci et al., 2018;  Notzel et al., 2018;  Reid et al., 2018;  Howick et al., 2019).
1: In  Plasmodium, a large proportion of the transcriptome is differentially expressed between parasite stages through tight regulation of transcription  via a small number of ApiAP2 transcription factors ( Bozdech et al., 2003;  Modrzynska et al., 2017).
2: These large changes in expression make it difficult to understand what proportion of variation observed is a result of developmental heterogeneity in a sample versus variable patterns of expression at a single point along this developmental trajectory when using bulk transcriptomic approaches ( Llora-Batlle et al., 2019).
3: In this study, we built a framework to minimize the effects of development in single-cell RNA-seq data by identifying the most mature populations of parasites and statistically controlling for developmental timing in our analyses.

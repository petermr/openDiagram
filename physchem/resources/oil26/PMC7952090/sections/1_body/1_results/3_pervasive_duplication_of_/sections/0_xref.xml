We directly compared our simulated and observed enrichment results by lineage and gene set size, and found that Afrosoricida, Cape golden mole, tenrec, Elephantidae, elephant shrew, Asian elephant, African Savannah elephant, African Forest elephant, Columbian mammoth, aardvark, Paenungulata, Proboscidea, Tethytheria, and manatee had enriched cancer pathway percentages above background with respect to their gene set sizes, that is expected enrichments based on random sampling of small gene sets (

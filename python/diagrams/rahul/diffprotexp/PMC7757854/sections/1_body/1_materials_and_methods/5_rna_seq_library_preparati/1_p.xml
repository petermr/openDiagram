<p>Total RNA quality was estimated based on RNA integrity number (RIN) using Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100™. RNA samples with a RIN&gt;8 was used for library preparation. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using an Illumina® TruSeq Stranded mRNA Prep Kit accordingly with the manufacturer’s LS protocol. Samples were barcoded, multiplexed and sequenced (100 bp pair end) using the Illumina® NextSeq 550 platform at NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) Genomic Core facility (Abu Dhabi, U.A.E).</p>

<p>Remarkably, pathway and network enrichment studies have identified the IIR and cell cycle regulation as being two major biological processes involving mRNA processing and DIU in RSV-infected epithelial cells. While not a focus of this study, RSV infection induces cell cycle arrest through autocrine regulation of TGFβ1 secretion, a phenomenon that is associated with enhanced RSV replication in primary lung epithelial cells [

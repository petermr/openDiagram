 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f023">Figure 23</xref>, it can be seen that even in lean pure binary Al-Si alloys, quench-induced precipitation is separated into high-temperature (HTR) and low-temperature (LTR) reactions. For Al0.26Si, the HTR is detected only after extremely slow cooling at 3 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> K/s (seen as a two stage dissolution reaction during reheating in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f022">Figure 22</xref>C). The UCCR of Al0.72Si was found to be 1 K/s [

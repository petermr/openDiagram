<p>According to the analyses of results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00420-f005">Figure 5</xref>, in the twin-roll casting process, one of the most important factors is the melt level 
 <italic>L</italic>. The influences to the temperature distribution under different conditions were discussed as below. Casting conditions are as follows: pouring temperature 981 K, casting speed 32 m/min, strip thickness 0.1 mm, and melt levels under the two pouring mode are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00420-t003">Table 3</xref>. For the one side pouring mode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00420-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), it has a strip shell thickness of 1 mm (i.e., d = 1 mm).

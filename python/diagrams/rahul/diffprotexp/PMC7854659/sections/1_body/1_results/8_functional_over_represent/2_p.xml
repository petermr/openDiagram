<p id="Par17">Regarding the muscle, the identified GO terms pointed out the muscle structure development and myotube and myoblast differentiation as common BP among the gene lists. Similarly, TS and TF genes included skeletal system morphogenesis and regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter (Table

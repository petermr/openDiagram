<p id="Par78">To identify the biological processes with significant molecular differences between high-grade and low-grade cartilage, we carried out gene set enrichment analyses based on the differential expression on RNA, protein and cross-omics levels. We tested for association of the differentially expressed (DE) genes on RNA and/or protein levels at 5% FDR, with robustness checks using more stringent FDR thresholds (1, 0.5 and 0.1%). We restricted this analysis to genes with unique mapping between Ensembl gene ID and Gene Name in Ensembl38p10, and Ensembl gene ID and Entrez ID in HUGO (

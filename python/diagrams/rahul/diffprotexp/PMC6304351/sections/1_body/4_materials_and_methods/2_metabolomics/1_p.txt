0: T. oleivorans MIL-1 (DSM 14913) was grown in sterile 160 ml Nunc Cell Culture Treated Flasks containing 100 ml of ONR7a media ( Dyksterhouse et al., 1995).
1: Cultures were enriched separately with the medium-chain alkane  n-tetradecane ( n-C 14), or the long-chain alkane  n-octacosane ( n-C 28).
2: Cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker (16C, 60 rpm) over a period of 7 days.
3: Each day triplicate cultures of  n-C 14 and  n-C 28 were agitated through water sonication for 30 min and pre-concentrated through solid phase extraction (SPE) by Supel-Select HLB cartridges (Supelco, 200 mg, 6 ml) and eluted with 12 ml of chloroform.
4: Samples were further concentrated through evaporation of the chloroform to 200 l with nitrogen.
5: The concentrated solvent was analyzed to detect the alcohols produced from the oxidation of the alkanes used as growth substrates.
6: GC-MS analysis was carried out as previously described ( McKew et al., 2007b).
7: The mass spectrometer scanned m/z values from 10 to 550, with identification of target analytes based on retention times of analytical standards; 1-tetradecanol, 2-tetradecanol and 1-octacosanol (Sigma-Aldrich).

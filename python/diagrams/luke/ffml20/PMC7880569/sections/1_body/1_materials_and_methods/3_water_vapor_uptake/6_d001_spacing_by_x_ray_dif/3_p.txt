0: Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio obtained in the transmission mode, humidity-dependent  d001 values were determined with Braggs law after fitting a Gaussian function of the background-corrected 001 reflection.
1: These analyses produced  d001 data for AcidBir only.
2: Diffractograms of the considerably smaller -MnO 2 particles were of insufficient quality to extract reliable  d001 values, and are therefore not reported.

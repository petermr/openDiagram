0: The synthesis protocol for CD-MOF was adapted from a previously reported procedure 43.
1: In a nutshell,  -CD (64.8 g) and KOH (22.4 g) were dissolved in purified water (2000 mL) with a molar ratio of  -CD to KOH of 1:8.
2: After adding methanol (1200 mL), the reaction mixture was kept in water bath (60 C) until a clear solution was obtained.
3: PEG 20,000 (12.8 g) was added, conducing to the rapid sedimentation of crystalline particles after further heating the solution for 20 min.
4: The suspension liquid was incubated in ice water overnight, then the CD-MOF crystals were harvested by centrifugation (2826 g, 3 min) and washed with anhydrous ethanol (4% acetic acid) to neutralize the alkaline CD-MOF.
5: Finally, CD-MOF was washed with methanol till reaching a pH about 6.57.5, and then dried at 60 C for 5 h to obtain white powders of cubic crystal particles.

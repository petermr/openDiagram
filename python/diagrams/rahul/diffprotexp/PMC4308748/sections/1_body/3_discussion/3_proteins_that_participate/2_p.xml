<p>Voltage-dependent anion channel 1, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane of all eukaryotic cells and cerebral presynaptic membranes, can regulate the current direction of a series of anion metabolites and strengthen outer membrane permeability, playing an important role in mitochondrial metabolism and cell apoptosis. Evidence exists that voltage-dependent anion channel 1 participates in the process of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal injury. Over-expression of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 can produce pathological lesions due to an imbalance of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the mitochondrial matrix and cytoplasm. After spinal cord injury, spinal cord blood flow progressively decreases, spinal cord ischemia and hypoxia is aggravated, and there is an influx of high Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> levels. After a series of biochemical reactions, pathological free radicals are produced, leading to intracellular lipid peroxidation.

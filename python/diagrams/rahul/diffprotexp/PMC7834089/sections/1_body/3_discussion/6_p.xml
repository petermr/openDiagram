<p>We measured levels of CVB3 RNA and proinflammatory cytokines in the six groups in the heart tissues. Vagotomy reduced the viral abundance in VMC on d 7, which might be related to activation of Th1 cells differentiation. Previous studies showed that Th1 cells inhibited viral replication but increase the systemic inflammatory response. Our study revealed that vagotomy increased the proportion of Th1 cells and IFN-Î³, enhancing the anti-virus effect and systemic inflammatory response, which resulted in a net a deteriorating effect [

Additionally, the levels of CVB3 RNA, inflammatory cytokines, and Th cell-related transcription factors were not significantly different among the five myocarditis groups on d 14, which might be related to the progression of viral myocarditis. The virus is nearly cleared from the myocardium in VMC on d 14; at that time, it is progressing into the chronic phase [

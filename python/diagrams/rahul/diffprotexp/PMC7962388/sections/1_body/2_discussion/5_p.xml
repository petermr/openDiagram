<p id="Par73">We found 11,417 antisense transcripts expressed in flowers, and hundreds of them were differentially represented in sexual and apomictic genotypes. These results confirmed the evidence reported in previous articles, in which both sense and antisense transcripts were detected in apomictic and sexual genotypes at variable representation levels or altered localization [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Several of these transcripts, like those homologous to

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] where found here represented by antisense strands and thus, a regulatory mechanism based on complementary hybridization might be associated with them. The confirmation of such a modulation process will require further functional analysis. Interestingly, a methylation-mediated silencing mechanism was reported to control parthenogenesis in other species of the 
 <italic>Paspalum</italic> genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. We detected a higher number of DEATs occurring at anthesis, in comparison with other developmental stages. Moreover, the anthesis DEATs have a tendency (59%) to appear downregulated in apomictic plants. Our results indicate that: 1) antisense-mediated regulatory mechanisms might be particularly active at anthesis in sexual plants; and 2) silencing of a considerable number of DEATs occurs in apomictic plants at this particular stage. It will be interesting to investigate the influence of genome methylation in the down-regulation of DEATs during apomixis, and its consequences on the representation of DETs and the emergence of autonomous embryos in the absence of fertilization.

0: The preparation of whole cell lysates and western blot analysis of protein expression were performed according to the previous routine procedure [ 11].
1: In brief, total protein was extracted from H9C2 cells and protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid protein detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
2: The whole cell lysis buffer was mixed with SDS loading buffer.
3: After centrifugation at 13,000 g at 4 C for 20 min, the supernatants were collected.
4: Equal amounts of proteins (50 g) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 or 5% pre-casted gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
5: The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 g at 4 C for 20 min.
6: According to the previously established protocol, protein expression was detected [ 11].
7: The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-SORBS2 (1:200, SAB4200183, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-ENH (1:200, SAB2101761, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-actin (1:500, A5385, Sigma-Aldrich).
8: The secondary antibody used were anti-mouse IgG (1:10000, A5385, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000, B7389, Sigma-Aldrich).
9: Quantification was performed by measurement of the intensity of the signals with aid of ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

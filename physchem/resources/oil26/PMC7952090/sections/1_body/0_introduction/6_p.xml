<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Here we trace the evolution of body mass, cancer risk, and gene copy number variation across Afrotherian genomes, including multiple living and extinct Proboscideans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), to investigate whether duplications of tumor suppressors coincided with the evolution of large body sizes. Our estimates of the evolution of body mass across Afrotheria show that large body masses evolved in a stepwise manner, similar to previous studies (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">O Leary et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Springer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">O Leary et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Puttick and Thomas, 2015</xref>) and coincident with dramatic reductions in intrinsic cancer risk. To explore whether duplication of tumor suppressors occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, we used a genome-wide Reciprocal Best BLAT Hit (RBBH) strategy to identify gene duplications and used maximum likelihood to infer the lineages in which those duplications occurred. Unexpectedly, we found that duplication of tumor suppressor genes was common in Afrotherians, both large and small. Gene duplications in the Proboscidean lineage, however, were uniquely enriched in pathways that may explain some of the unique cancer protection mechanisms observed in elephant cells. These data suggest that duplication of tumor suppressor genes is pervasive in Afrotherians and preceded the evolution of species with exceptionally large body sizes.</p>

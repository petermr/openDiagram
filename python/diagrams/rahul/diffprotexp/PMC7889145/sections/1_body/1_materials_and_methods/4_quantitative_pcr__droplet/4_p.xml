<p>Primers were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST, with selection for ideal target specificity, PCR product size (less than 200 bp, and when possible less than 100 bp), primer annealing temperature (60°C), and PCR product melting temperature (less than 93°C). When possible, primers were designed to either span exon/intron junctions or have an intervening intron greater than 1000 base-pairs. Primers were experimentally validated for mRNA and target specificity and optimized for efficiency (92–99%) across 6-logs input template concentration. Primer panel sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Sequencing analysis is described in Supplemental Methods.</p>

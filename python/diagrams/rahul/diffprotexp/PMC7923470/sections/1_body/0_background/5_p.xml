 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Unbiased modern high-throughput technologies such as whole transcriptome and metabolome have geared up the discovery of genetic factors controlling different traits in plants including, biotic and abiotic stresses, and agronomic traits [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the combination of multiple omics techniques has resulted in the elucidation of different pathways in banana such as peel ripening and the effect of melatonin on delaying anthracnose incidence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this study, we aimed at identifying the differentially expressed genes and metabolites in pseudostems of Pisang Awak Aifen No. 1 dwarf wild type and its semi-dwarf mutant. The transcriptome and metabolome responses involved hormonal signaling including GA, auxin, BR, ABA, and ethylene, and cell prolification and elongation.

   <bold>Subcutaneous catheter model for 
    <italic>in vivo</italic>-grown polymicrobial biofilms
   </bold>. (i) A small incision is made in a shaved area in the dorsum of the back; 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> catheter fragments are inserted within a subcutaneous tunnel; 
   <bold>(iii)</bold> incision is sealed with vet glue; 
   <bold>(iv)</bold> catheters with formed polymicrobial biofilms are harvested from euthanized animals 2–6 days post-implantation. (b) 
   <bold>Scanning electron micrographs of explanted catheters with Sa-Ca mixed biofilms. (i)</bold> Yellow arrows pointing to biofilm consisting of fungal and bacterial cells embedded in a polysaccharide matrix formed within the lumens of catheters after 8 days; 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> longitudinally cut catheter fragment with biofilm. Bars = 400 µm (i) and 500 µm (ii). (c) 
   <bold>Time-course experiments for evaluation of microbial recovery from catheter biofilms</bold>. Based on comparative assessment of CFUs from processed harvested catheters, 3 days post-implantation was selected as the optimal time-point for biofilm formation

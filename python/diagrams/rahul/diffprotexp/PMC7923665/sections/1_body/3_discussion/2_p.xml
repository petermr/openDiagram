<p id="Par35">Gene expression profiling studies strongly support the identification of differentially expressed genes in the AVM and thus the discovery of potential marker genes that can be used in the diagnosis and predicting the prognosis of this disease. No targeted study has been done in human cerebral AVMs to identify the potential pathways and genes involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. We have identified 37 commonly differentially expressed genes (CDEGs) in AVM nidus tissues. These CDEGs could be classified into two groups: 1) genes related to inflammation and immune response and 2) genes regulated by retinoic acid signaling. Earlier reports have suggested the presence of inflammatory cells in AVM tissues. Although not considered as an inciting event in cerebral AVM pathogenesis, the role of inflammation in the clinical course of this disease is widely recognized. Inflammation is associated with disease progression and rupture of AVM [

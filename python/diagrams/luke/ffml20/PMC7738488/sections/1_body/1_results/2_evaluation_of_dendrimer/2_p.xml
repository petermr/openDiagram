<p id="Par11">The inquisition detailed here affirm the termination of each synthetic step included in the preparation of the PAMAM dendrimer. A startling change in color was noticed after admixture of carboxyl/amine terminated dendrimer with copper sulfate solution. The observation led researchers to conclude the formation of complex on combination of copper with terminal groups. Consequently, the blue precipitate is formed due to the reaction of hexaaquacopper(II) complex ion â€“[Cu(H

 <sup>2+</sup> present in copper sulphate solution with terminal amine group. Similarly, admixture of carboxyl terminated dendrimer and copper sulfate solution produced the purple color precipitates.

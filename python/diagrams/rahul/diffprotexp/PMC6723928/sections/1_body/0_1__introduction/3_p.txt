0: Several new methods for evaluation of protein expression have been developed.
1: Proteomic approaches using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), coupled with protein identification by mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics, offer a high-throughput means to study different protein expression profiles relating to a particular pathophysiological condition [ 6].
2: Proteomic techniques are now widely accepted as an important tool for identifying potential biomarkers and studying the mechanisms involved in cell differentiation [ 9].

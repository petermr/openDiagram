<p id="Par36">Likewise, DCVC treatment for 12 h downregulated numerous biological and molecular signaling pathways. With 10 µM DCVC, 6 pathways were downregulated, half of which were associated with the most common category, embryonic development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Twenty micromolar DCVC treatment downregulated 13 pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). Similar to 10 µM DCVC, the majority of these pathways (7) were associated with embryonic development. Representative pathways included epithelial–mesenchymal transition (NES = − 2.12, FDR &lt; 0.001), myogenesis (NES = − 1.66, FDR = 0.021) and hedgehog signaling (NES = − 1.61, Other categories represented among the pathways downregulated with 12-h 20 µM DCVC treatment included proliferation (3), cellular organization (2) and response to stress stimuli (2). Summarizing the overall pattern of pathways affected by DCVC treatment, pathways involved in cellular response to stress stimuli were upregulated and pathways related to embryonic development were downregulated.

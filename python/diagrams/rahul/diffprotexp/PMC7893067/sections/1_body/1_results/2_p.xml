<p id="Par8">To further investigate the relative distribution of transcripts across the cytosolic and nuclear fractions and identify genes that show differential abundance between nucleus and cytosol, we first investigated how different classes of transcripts are distributed. We found that protein-coding genes were similarly distributed between the nuclear and the cytosolic fractions, whereas lncRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), as previously shown

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C,D). We could confirm the nuclear localization of a number of highly expressed lncRNAs with known nuclear localization (including

 <italic>MALAT1</italic>). We observed similar distribution patterns when each brain tissue was analyzed separately, as well as in SHSY-5Y (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). However, the most skewed distribution was exhibited by snoRNAs, which are well-known to have their primary function in the nucleus. Some snoRNAs, for example, SNORD113-8 and SNORD114-12, were observed to have extreme nuclear association (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Overall, the PCA and distribution of the different transcripts are in agreement with previous findings and indicate that our analysis readily identifies transcripts with a previously demonstrated cytosolic or nuclear localization

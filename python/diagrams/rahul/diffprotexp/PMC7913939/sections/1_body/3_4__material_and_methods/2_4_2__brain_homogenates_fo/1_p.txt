0: After euthanization by cervical dislocation, mouse brains were dissected on ice and collected cortices were lysed and homogenized in 350 L lysis buffer (RLT Buffer, Qiagen) using the VWR Pellet mixer (VWR, Dietikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: Total RNA was isolated on spin columns with silica-based membranes (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland), following the manufacturers instructions.
2: RNA was eluted with 30 L of H 2O.
3: Two hundred ng of purified RNA was reverse transcribed in a volume of 50 L using the RT High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).
4: Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on cDNA obtained with the Applied Biosystems ViiA TM7 (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) Real-Time PCR System using Power SYBR Green Taq polymerase master mix (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).
5: Primer sequences used for mRNA quantification were directed against  LDH-A,  LDH-B,  basigin,  Na  +/K  +ATPase 2  subunit,  MCT1,  MCT2 and  MCT4 mRNAs, as well as  -Actin mRNA used as an endogenous control (See  Table 1 for sequences).
6: For data analysis, the raw threshold cycle (CT) value was first normalized to the endogenous control for each sample to obtain the  CT value.
7: The normalized  CT value was then calibrated to the control cell samples to obtain the 2 CT.

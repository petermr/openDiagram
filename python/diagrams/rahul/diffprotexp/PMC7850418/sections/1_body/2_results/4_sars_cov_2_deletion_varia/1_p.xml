<p>Two genomes representative of ORF6 deletion variants found in this regional circulation were selected for replication tests: hCoV-19/France/ARA22647/2020 (EPI_ISL_508919; D34 variant) and hCoV-19/France/ARA0731/2020 (EPI_ISL_508941; D26 variant). These genomes were compared against the reference genome hCoV-19/France/ARA24023/2020 (EPI_ISL_508931; devoid of any deletions), which was the most similar isolated variant sequenced available in the laboratory at the time of the investigation. The reference genome had 1â€“3 SNPs compared with D26 and D34 variants (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

<p id="Par5">Cell type- and tissue-differential GE patterns have been largely conserved during vertebrate evolution, whereas differential AS patterns, overall (with the exception of conserved sub-networks of AS events) have evolved rapidly and display increased complexity during evolution, particularly in the nervous system

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, increasing examples have been reported of functionally important neuronal subtype-specific AS patterns
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. APA also shows extensive variation between tissues and species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, with pronounced changes in neural cells that predominantly result in longer 3′ UTRs to facilitate extensive post-transcriptional regulation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. For example, changes in the expression of 3′ UTR sequences through APA can regulate the localization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to dendrites and axons, in part to facilitate localized translation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. APA has been implicated in the regulation of long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, in conjunction with differential GE, AS and APA are important and complementary regulatory layers that contribute to the specification of neuronal subtypes. Yet, the relative degrees to which these regulatory layers contribute to cell-type specification in the nervous system has not been systematically investigated.

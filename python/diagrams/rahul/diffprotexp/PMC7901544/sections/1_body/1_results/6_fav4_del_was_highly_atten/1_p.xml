<p>To evaluate the viral replication and pathogenesis of FAV4_Del 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, SPF chickens were infected with FAV4_Del and wild-type FAdV-4 at the same dose. The clinical symptoms and mortality of the infected chickens were monitored daily, and the liver, spleen, kidney and the cloacal swabs were collected for viral titration at different time points post-infection. At 2 dpi, the chickens infected with FAdV-4 began to show clinical signs characterized by depression, sleepiness, and huddling together with ruffled feathers. As described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7a</xref>, 10%, 90% and 100% of chickens infected with FAdV-4 were died at 3 dpi, 4 dpi and 5 dpi, respectively. However, all the chickens infected with FAV4_Del did not show any clinical signs and death throughout the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7a</xref>). Necropsy analysis demonstrated that the chickens in FAdV-4 group showed hydropericardium, hepatitis with hemorrhage, kidney and spleen swelling, and hemorrhage whereas no gross lesion in heart, liver, spleen, or kidney were observed in the chickens infected with FAV4_Del (Data not shown). The HE staining further demonstrated that the degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, and the intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatocytes were observed in the chickens infected with FAdV-4 whereas no histopathological symptoms were found in the chickens infected with FAV4_Del (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7b</xref>). For virus shedding, the viral titers in cloacal swabs from the chickens infected with FAdV-4 could reach to 10
 <sup>3</sup>–10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at 2 dpi-5 dpi but the virus could not be detectable in the cloacal swab samples in the chickens infected with FAV4_Del at 2 dpi-8 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7c</xref>). For virus loading in tissues, the viral titers in liver from the chickens infected with FAdV-4 could reach to 10
 <sup>5</sup>–10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at 2 dpi-5 dpi whereas those in the chickens infected with FAV4_Del were less than 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at 2 dpi-5 dpi as described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7d</xref>. Notably, very similar data were found in the kidney and spleen tissues as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7e,f</xref>. Therefore, the data from the virus cloacal shedding and tissue loading were consistent with the data for the clinical signs and survival. All these data demonstrate that the 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAV4_Del virus was highly attenuated in chickens.

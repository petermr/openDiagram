0: For construction and sequencing of the sRNA libraries, two replicates were performed for each sample.
1: Firstly, sRNAs were isolated from total RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).
2: Next, the isolated sRNAs were added to a 5 RNA adaptor and a 3 RNA adaptor by using T4 RNA ligase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China).
3: Then, sRNAs with added 5 and 3 RNA adaptors were reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using RT-PCR.
4: Follows, the single-stranded cDNA was further synthesized into double-stranded cDNA by PCR amplification using adapter primers.
5: Finally, the PCR product was purified and subjected to high-throughput sequencing by using the Illumina SE50 system at Biomarker Technologies Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).

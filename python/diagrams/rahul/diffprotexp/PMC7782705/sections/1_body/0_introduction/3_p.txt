0: Another important aspect to consider is the descriptive relevance of gene expression analysis based solely on the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEG), which fails to detect dynamics in the expression of multiple related transcripts 10.
1: Recently, new approaches using transcripts-level analysis, so-called differential transcript usage (DTU), enables identification of alternative splicing and isoform switches with the prediction of functional consequences 11,  12.
2: Therefore, important gene expression modifications in the AD brain could occur at the transcript level and be overlooked in classical DEG analyses.

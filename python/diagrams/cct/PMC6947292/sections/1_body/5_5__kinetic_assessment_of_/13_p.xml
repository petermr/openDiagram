<p>The model was also validated through comparison with the measured volume fractions of quench-induced Î²-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si precipitation for different AlMgSi alloys (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f080">Figure 80</xref>). It can be observed that using this data, the model also provides an excellent fit to the measured values. Another validation of the predictions of the model is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f058">Figure 58</xref>, which shows the specific precipitation enthalpy of 7150. In this case, experimental data were obtained one year after the model was derived. The excellent correspondence is further evidence that the model is genuinely predictive for unseen data.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The SoEO was assayed on <italic>S. littoralis</italic> larvae and <italic>T. castaneum</italic> adults. The percentage of mortality produced by each strain at different SoEO concentrations was shown in Figure 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>. Mortality increased by increasing the SoEO concentration, which revealed a dose-dependent effect. The LC<sub>50</sub> of SoEO was also calculated for each pest species. The fumigant assay indicated that SoEO showed interesting insecticidal activity against the third instar larvae of <italic>S. littoralis</italic> and adults of <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, with an LC<sub>50</sub> value of 55.99 &#177; 7.95 &#181;l/L air and 97.43 &#177; 11.85 &#181;l/L air, respectively. To our knowledge, there is limited information concerning the activity of SoEO against Lepidopteran larvae <italic>S. littoralis. </italic>Ben El Hadj Ali et al. (2015[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) reported an approximately similar toxicity exhibited by <italic>Thymus algeriensis</italic> EO against the third instar larvae of<italic> S. littoralis</italic>. The high insecticidal potency of SoEO could be attributed to monoterpenoids compounds such as camphene, &#945;-pinene and &#947;-terpinene, which were well known for their strong insecticidal activity against <italic>T. castaneum</italic> adults (Kim et al., 2010[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). In addition, 1-8-cineole and limonene possessed fumigant toxicity against this insect (Lee et al., 2004[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). These monoterpenoids are known for their inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase, a key enzyme in the insect central nervous system (Abdelgaleil et al., 2009[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Zarrad et al., 2015[<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]). Caryophyllene oxide, a sesquiterpene compound, also showed high fumigant toxicity against this pest. Its high toxicity may result from the inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport system because changes in the concentration of oxygen or carbon dioxide may affect respiration rate of <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, thus eliciting fumigant toxicity effects (Emekci et al., 2004[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).</p>

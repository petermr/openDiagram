<p id="Par12">We found 284,738 DC gene pairs by applying the same approach to the cerebrum. To reduce the data dimensionality, these pairs were then filtered by DEG, TS, or TF genes. Based on that, 14,423 DC pairs (4676 unique genes) (
 <italic>q</italic> ≤ 0.05) remained for further analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The TS genes 
 <italic>ELAV4</italic>, 
 <italic>PAK5, SLC17A6, GPR12</italic>, and 
 <italic>CLVS2,</italic> were the most differentially co-expressed ones (hubs). Among the 61 genes classified as hubs (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 21 were TFs identified as putative regulators of brain gene expression. From these TFs, 
 <italic>ZNF207</italic>, 
 <italic>ETS2</italic>, and the novel gene 
 <italic>ENSBTAG00000003447</italic> were highlighted as targeting 412, 250, and 248 genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Unlike the muscle, no clear pattern of correlation was observed for TFs and DEGs differentially co-expressed between conditions.

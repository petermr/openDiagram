0: The lizard,  Hemidactylus frenatus were collected and maintained in a well-ventilated cage with adequate proper diet, optimum temperature (~ 25 C) and the 12 h light and dark cycle.
1: Amputation of tail tissue were performed on batches of animals (n = 5) in replicates using sterile scalpel blade at 1 cm preceding the distal end of the tail.
2: Regenerating tail tissues preceding the amputation site (3 mm) were collected for each time points i.e., 0-day post amputation (dpa) (control), 1-dpa, 2-dpa and 5-dpa.
3: The amputation and collection of regenerating tissues were performed during the morning hours post feeding (10.00 AM).
4: The collected control and regenerating tail tissues were washed with 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pooled as batches and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and was stored at  70 C until use.
5: The animal experiment was performed in accordance with the protocol approved by the Institutional animal ethics committee of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (IAEC/CCMB/Protocol # 66/2014).

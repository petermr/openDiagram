<p>Total RNA was extracted from queen and worker larvae at 72 and 120 hours using TRIzol regent (Takara bio). Reverse transcription was performed using a RNA PCR Kit (Takara bio), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nine differentially expressed proteins were examined to detect the corresponding mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR, based on the sequences in honeybee cDNA library. Gene names, accession number, forward and reverse primer sequence and amplification size were listed and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as the reference gene (

Every sample was analyzed individually and processed in triplicate. Each reaction volume was performed in a total of 25 µl containing 1 µl of cDNA template and 5 pmol of primer, 12.5 µl SYBR Green Supermix (dNTPs, iTaq DNA polymerase, 6 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> , SYBR Green and 6.5 µl double distilled water, fluorescent and stabilizers, RNase-free water) (Bio-Rad). The real-time PCR was performed as 1 cycle of denaturation at 95°C/10 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95°C/30s, 60°C/30s, 72°C/45s) where the fluorescence was automatically measured during PCR. The specificity of the amplified product was monitored using its melting curve. Gene expression data was normalized by GAPDH. After verifying amplification efficiency of the selected genes and GAPDH in approximately equal level, the difference in gene expression levels were calculated using the

<p>The fatty acids generated by oxidation of 
 <italic>n‐</italic>alkanes are further metabolized by β‐oxidation. The β‐oxidation proteins detected have putatively been assigned functions for their potential role in straight‐chain alkane degradation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> A, C, E and G, left side) or branched‐chain alkane degradation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, D, F and H, right side) based on their pattern of expression. Before a fatty acid can enter any metabolic pathway, it must first be activated to form acyl‐CoA. This reaction is catalysed by acyl‐CoA synthetases, generating AMP. No acyl‐CoA synthetase was differentially expressed on 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> compared to pristane. ABO_0985 was initially annotated as an acid thiol ligase but a BLASTP search found it is identical (100% identity) to long‐chain acyl CoA synthetases in multiple 
 <italic>Alcanivorax</italic> sp. (97CO‐5; 97CO‐6; NBRC 101098). This protein was expressed equally across the three growth substrates with high spectral counts (&gt;75, Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) and could potentially be constitutively expressed, suggesting it can potentially use branched and linear fatty acids as substrates. Two acyl‐CoA synthetases potentially catalysing this reaction, fadD/ABO_0367 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.041) and alkK/ABO_2748 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.046) were differentially expressed on pristane compared to 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> but also similarly expressed on pyruvate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase creates a double bond between the second and third carbons down from the CoA group on acyl‐CoA producing trans‐delta 2‐enoyl CoA and in the process, uses FAD as an electron acceptor reducing it to FADH
 <sub>2</sub>. Four acyl‐CoA dehydrogenases were significantly differentially expressed during growth on pristane, including ABO_0571 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024), ABO_1264 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.023), acdA/ABO_2223 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.046) and ABO_2453 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.017) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D), while three other acyl‐CoA dehydrogenases were significantly differentially expressed during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). These include fadE/ABO_2098 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), ABO_2102 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) and ABO_2739 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Enoyl CoA hydratase removes the double bond in trans‐delta 2‐enoyl CoA adding a hydroxyl group to the third carbon down from the CoA group and hydrogen on the second carbon down from the CoA group producing L‐3‐hydroxyacyl CoA. Four enoyl CoA hydratases were significantly differentially expressed during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> compared to pristane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E), including/ABO_0526 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005), ABO_1238 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006), fadC/ABO_1645 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and eno/ABO_2556 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.020). No specific enoyl CoA hydratases were differentially expressed on pristane. However, 
 <italic>fadB</italic> (ABO_1566, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), which was up‐regulated on pristane, from the 
 <italic>fadAB</italic> operon codes the α‐subunit of a β‐oxidation multifunctional enzyme complex possessing both 3‐hydroxyacyl‐CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl‐CoA hydratase activities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F). 3‐hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase removes the hydrogen in the hydroxyl group added to L‐3‐hydroxyacl CoA producing 3‐ketoacyl CoA, using NAD as an electron acceptor reducing it to NADH. In the final step of β‐oxidation ketoacyl‐CoA thiolase attaches a CoA group on the third carbon down from the CoA group resulting in the formation of two molecules, an acetyl‐CoA and an acyl‐CoA that is two carbons shorter. Only one ketoacyl‐CoA thiolase was detected (ABO_2452, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.446), which was not expressed on pyruvate but was not significantly differentially expressed on either 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> and pristane due to detection of very low spectral counts. The 
 <italic>fadAB</italic> operon consisting of 
 <italic>fadB</italic> (ABO_1566, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) previously mentioned above and 
 <italic>fadA</italic> (ABO_1567, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024), which codes for the β‐subunit of the complex with 3‐ketoacyl‐CoA thiolase activity, was significantly differentially expressed on pristane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>H). The 
 <italic>fadAB2</italic> operon consisting of 
 <italic>fadB2</italic> (ABO_1652, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011), which was differentially expressed on both 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> and pristane, and 
 <italic>fadA</italic> (ABO_1653, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022), which was significantly differentially expressed on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G).

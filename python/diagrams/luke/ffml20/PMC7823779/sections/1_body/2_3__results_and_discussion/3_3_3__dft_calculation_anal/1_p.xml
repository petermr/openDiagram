<p>From the structure analysis above, we could know the epoxy and hydroxyl groups reacted with NO
 <sup>2+</sup> to produce C–NO
 <sub>2</sub> and O–NO
 <sub>2</sub> groups. However, the reaction process cannot be reflected. In order to research the nitrification, a simplified GO model only consists of epoxy and hydroxyl groups were built, which is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. The calculation result of the electrostatic potential diagram shows that the density of the electron cloud at the oxygen atoms is greater, and these sites attract cations more easily. Fukui function is the index to assess a priori reactivity of chemical species from their intrinsic electronic properties. The electrophilic Fukui function

 <italic>r</italic>) is used to measure the sensitivity of the reaction with the electrophilic attack as shown in Equation (1).

0: DEX was determined using HPLCMS/MS, which consisted of an Agilent 1260 liquid chromatograph and an Agilent 6460 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies).
1: The detection by the Acquisition software (Agilent Technologies) was as follows: ESI, positive-ion mode, capillary voltage 3500 V; gas temperature 300 C, gas flow 8 L/min; sheath gas temperature 35 C, flow 10 L/min; Nebulizer 35 psi.
2: The optimized precursor to product ion transition monitored for DEX was  m/ z 393.2/373.
3: The mobile phase consisted up acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water (30:70,  v/ v), a running time of 7 min, 35 C column temperature, flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and 10 L as injection volume.

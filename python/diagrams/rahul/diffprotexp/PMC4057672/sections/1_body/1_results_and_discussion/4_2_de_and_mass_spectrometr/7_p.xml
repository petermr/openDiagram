<p>Selenium-binding protein (SBP) is a protein that binds to selenium in the body and is highly expressed in lung, liver, pancreas and thyroid. SBP1 can prevent peroxide-induced DNA damage, boost the expression of P53 and Cox genes, induce apoptosis, and inhibit tumor cell proliferation. However, little is known about the mechanism of the SBP1 bioactivity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Studies have shown that SBP1 expression is reduced in a variety of tumor cell lines, making SBP1 a diagnostic indicator for malignancy [

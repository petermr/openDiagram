0: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules >200 nucleotides in length that are the by-product of RNA polymerase II transcription, and were previously thought to have no biological function ( 16).
1: lncRNAs do not encode proteins, but play a critical role in gene regulation and epigenetic modifications ( 17-19).
2: lncRNA affect cartilage matrix production and metabolism, synovitis, autophagy and apoptosis of chondrocytes ( 20, 21).
3: Gaballah  et al ( 18) reported that ZNF1 antisense RNA 1 can promote chondrocyte proliferation and inhibit apoptosis by regulating the expression level of Wnt family member 3A.
4: A previous study by Wang  et al ( 22) suggested that nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 can act on microRNA-181c to promote the proliferation of human synoviocytes and accelerate the progression of osteoarthritis ( 22).
5: Although the specific function of lncRNAs has not been elucidated, previous studies have reported that the abnormal expression of lncRNAs is closely related to osteoarthritis ( 23, 24).

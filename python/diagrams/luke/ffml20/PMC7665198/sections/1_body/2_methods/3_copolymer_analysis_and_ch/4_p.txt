0: Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA Instrument Hi-Res TGA 2950.
1: Prior to analysis, copolymer films were cut into 3  3-mm squares with a thickness of 200300 m and immersed in deionized (D)I H2 O for 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 1440 min (24 h).
2: A typical TGA experiment was carried out from 25 to 150 C at a heating rate of 20 C/min.
3: The resulting data were processed using TA Universal Analysis vs. 5.4 software.

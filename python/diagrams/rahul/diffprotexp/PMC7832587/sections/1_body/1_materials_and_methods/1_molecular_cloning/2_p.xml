 <italic>Single expression vectors</italic>: The cDNAs encoding the three ATP2 orthologs were cloned in the pYeDP60 expression vector [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] between the 
 <italic>EcoRI</italic> and 
 <italic>NotI</italic> restriction sites, yielding the pYeDP60-ATP2-TEV-BAD plasmid that contains in downstream position the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage-site coding sequence followed by the biotin acceptor domain (BAD) coding sequence. To obtain the N-terminal BAD tagged ATP2 constructs, pYeDP60-BAD-TEV-ATP2, we amplified by PCR the ATP2 sequences incorporating the 
 <italic>PmeI</italic> and 
 <italic>SacI</italic> restrictions sites at both, the 5′ and 3′ ends, and cloned into the pYeDP60 vector. The PcATP2-D596N mutant was obtained using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The nine Cdc50 subunits sequences were cloned in the pYeDP60 vector between the 
 <italic>EcoRI</italic> and 
 <italic>BamHI</italic> restriction sites. The resulting pYeDP60-Cdc50-TEV-10xHis vectors contain the TEV site followed by a 10xHis tag at the C-terminal end of the proteins.

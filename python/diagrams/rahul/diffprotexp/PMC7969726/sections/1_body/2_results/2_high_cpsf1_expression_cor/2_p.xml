<p>To identify the correlation between CPSF1 expression and patient outcomes, TCGA data were categorized into high and low groups based on the median CPSF1 mRNA level. Furthermore, the median IHC score of CPSF1 was selected as the cutoff value to group the HCC patients into two groups in the SYSUCC cohort. Survival analyses revealed that CPSF1 overexpression was significantly correlated with worse OS and DFS in TCGA patients (

Stratified survival analysis revealed that the high CPSF1 group was associated with shorter OS in the larger tumor size (â‰¥5 cm), single or multiple tumors, high AFP levels, poor differentiation, TNM grades, and HBV-positive cases in

<p id="Par50">Based on the two-fold change between P3 and P30, laminin subunit alpha-1, bone sialoprotein 2, and myelin proteolipid are the most highly expressed proteins on P30. In contrast, vimentin, myosin-9, and protein disulfide-isomerase A3 are the most highly expressed proteins on P3. When comparing P3 to P14, there are 4 proteins exclusively expressed on P14, including alpha-2-macroglobulin-P, coagulation factor X, prothrombin, and elongation factor 1-alpha 2. Conversely, there are 200 proteins exclusively expressed on P3. Table

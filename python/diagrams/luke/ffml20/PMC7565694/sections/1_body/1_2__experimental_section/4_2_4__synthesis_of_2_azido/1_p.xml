<p>Sulfuric acid (10 mL, 6 mol/L) was added into a three-necked flask, and then cooled to 0 °C to remove oxygen. After that, DPNA (0.518 g, 2 mmol) was added with stirring at 0 °C for 0.5 h. Subsequently, NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.207 g, 3 mmol) and NaN
 <sub>3</sub> (0.195 g, 3 mmol) aqueous solutions with a concentration of 1 mol/L were slowly added with stirring at 0 °C for 3 h. Then, the intermediate (DPNN
 <sub>3</sub>) was extracted by 30 mL of dichloromethane, and washed by saturated salt water to remove impurities. The yield of the product was about 72% (0.411 g). IR (KBr,

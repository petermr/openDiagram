0: Here, we examine the molecular interactions that allow H-NS to bypass erythromycin and prevent ErmCL from progressing through the exit tunnel using steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations.
1: In SMD simulations, segments from these two proteins are pulled along the ribosome exit tunnel using an artificially imposed force at a constant velocity in the presence and absence of ERY.
2: We find that while ERY makes it harder to pull either peptide through the tunnel exit, a much larger force and work is required to move ErmCL compared to H-NS.
3: Decomposing the energetic components, we find the interaction energy of ErmCL with ERY is more favorable than that of H-NS.
4: These results indicate that the differential impact of ERY on these two proteins arises from stronger intermolecular interactions between ERY and C-terminal residues of ErmCL than H-NS.

<p>Keratinocytes produce type I IFNs including IFN-κ,
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> important in the potentiation of epidermal IFN production in CLE skin lesions.
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In addition to IFN-I, keratinocytes produce type III IFNs.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In an IHC study, epidermal immunoreactivity for IFN-λ and the IFN-λ receptor was increased in SCLE and DLE lesions versus lesions from other inflammatory skin diseases and healthy participants.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As an additional source of IFN-λ, it has been shown in a study with 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures that TLR9 ligand (CpG-A)-induced IFN-λ secretion is decreased on treatment with BIIB059,
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> which binds to BDCA2,
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> a receptor unique to pDCs. In keratinocytes, both IFN-κ and IFN-λ signal via their receptors through the Jak/STAT pathway in common with IFN-α, resulting in overlapping IFN gene response signatures, so both IFN-I and IFN-III could contribute to the differential gene expression in CLE-affected skin versus blood reported here.

<p>Because of the requirement to specify the initial structural model, and the large computational resources required to process each spectrum by the RMC method, it is challenging to apply this method to the interpretation of 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> EXAFS data for catalysts at work. This is due to the fact that the structure of the material can be ill-defined and that one is often interested in processing in a systematic way large sets of data corresponding, for example, to different states of the catalyst at different moments of time or different experimental conditions. In particular, it is challenging to apply the RMC method in the cases where different species coexist at the same time, that is, when the experimental signal cannot be interpreted in terms of a single structural component. Moreover, EXAFS data collected 
 <italic>in situ</italic> or under 
 <italic>operando</italic> conditions are often of limited quality, which may result in ambiguities of the structural models constructed by RMC.

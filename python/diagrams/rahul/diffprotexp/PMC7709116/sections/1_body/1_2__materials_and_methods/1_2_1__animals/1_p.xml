<p>In all experiments, mice were between 4â€“8 weeks old and were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Transgenic Drd1a:EGFP-L10a or Drd2:EGFP-L10a bacTRAP lines were maintained on a C57BL/6J background. The eight D1 and eight D2 mice were killed by rapid decapitation and striatal tissue was rapidly dissected. After pooling the tissue obtained from two mice as described below, the resulting four D1 and four D2 biological replicates were frozen on dry ice before being homogenized and subjected to FANS isolation. Animals for all studies were handled in accordance with Yale IACUC and NIH guidelines (approval code: 10922 May 2020). They are in accordance with FELASA guidelines and the National law for Laboratory Animal Experimentation</p>

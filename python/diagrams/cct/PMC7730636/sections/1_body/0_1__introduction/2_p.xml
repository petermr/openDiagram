<p>Experimental steel AISI 4340 shows the presence of several types of carbides in the material microstructure. These carbides are mainly based on Fe, Ni, Cr, Mo and V. The occurrence of mainly these types of carbides M
 <sub>2</sub>C, M
 <sub>7</sub>C
 <sub>3</sub>, M
 <sub>23</sub>C
 <sub>6</sub> and M
 <sub>3</sub>C is mentioned [

 <xref rid="B8-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These hard carbide particles contribute to grain refinement by retarding the recrystallization of austenite and causing the strengthening by this mechanism [

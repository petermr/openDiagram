  <p>Molecular interaction networks for premeiosis and anthesis stages. The interaction predictions were established with the STRING database, based on DETs involved in the stage-specific KEGG pathways for: 
   <bold>a</bold> premeiosis (onset of apospory initials) and 
   <bold>b</bold> anthesis (parthenogenesis)

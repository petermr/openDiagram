<p id="Par6">RNA expression of three critical SARS-CoV-2 entry genes (
 <italic>ACE2, TMPRSS2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic>) were analyzed across 20 different normal tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Portal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Normal tissues spanned the human body from head to toe and covered all major organs and tissue types including the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, breast and gynecological organs, respiratory tract, endocrine system, muscle, skin, and blood. The mean expression in log
 <sub>2</sub> (transcripts per million) of each viral entry gene was calculated for each tissue and ranked from highest to lowest (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The top expressing tissue for all three of the critical viral entry genes were observed in the normal genitourinary tract (testis for 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, prostate for 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>, and bladder for 
 <italic>CTSL</italic>). Other high expressing tissues were observed in the gastrointestinal tract (colon, pancreas, stomach); of note, brain, muscle, and blood were among the lowest expressing tissues.

First, all of the extant very large-bodied animals form a single clade, with the hyrax as the sole small-bodied member of that clade. And since the titanohyrax is extinct, among the extant organisms (an available large-bodies species with genomes) there is then a true large-bodied clade of the Sirenia and elephants and relatives. We understand that other evolutionary data make it clear that these represent two (three including titanohyrax) independent transitions to large-body sizes. But with only the modern or nearly modern genomes to work with, we are not sure that the duplication inference procedures and their coupling to the body size analysis statistically represent more than a single observation (e.g., a default of a single transition to large size along the tethytheria branch).</p>

<p>The quantitative analysis of the essential oil was carried out using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 6,890 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20 m × 0.18 mm; 0.18 μm). The oven temperature was programmed to 50°C for 3.2 min, then heated to 300°C at a rate of 10°C/min. The temperatures of the injector and the flame ionization detector (FID) were maintained at 280°C. The essential oils were diluted in acetone to 3.5% (v/v) and injected in split mode (1/60); hydrogen was used as the carrier gas (1 ml/min), and the injection volume was 1 μl. At the same time, a solution of 
 <italic>n</italic>‐alkanes (C8‐C30) was analyzed under the same conditions to calculate retention indices (RI) using the Van den Dool and Kratz equation (Van Del Dool &amp; Kratz,

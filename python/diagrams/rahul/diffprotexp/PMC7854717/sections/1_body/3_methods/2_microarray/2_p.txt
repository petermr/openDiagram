0: Agilent microarrays and Illumina NextSeq 500 (equally available to us) provide similar expression ratios 84.
1: However, in addition to being considerably cheaper, microarrays were preferred because their open protocol allowed optimization to significantly reduce the technical noise.
2: More importantly, microarray raw data are of reasonable size to allow the extensive COR analysis with the available computer resources.

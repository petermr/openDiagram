<p>Distinct expression of miRNAs appears to have a limited effect on differential gene expression in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors. Less than 10% of predicted target genes with correlated miRNAâ€“mRNA expression levels have significantly different expression in corticotroph tumors with and without mutation. The mRNA level of only 25 out of over 1600 DEGs could be considered as related to a different miRNA expression. This means that factors other than miRNA are responsible for the previously described highly different gene expression profile in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt PitNETs.

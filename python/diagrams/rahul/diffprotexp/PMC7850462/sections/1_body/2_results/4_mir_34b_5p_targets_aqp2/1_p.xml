<p>Plasmids inserted with wild and mutated three prime untranslated region (3′-UTR) of AQP2 were constructed for dual-luciferase reporter assay of the binding between miR-34b-5p and AQP2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). Luciferase activities of the mimic + mut-AQP2 group, mimic NC + mut-AQP2 group, and mimic NC + wt-AQP2 group had no significant differences. The mimic + wt-AQP2 group obtained a significantly reduced luciferase activity (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, vs the mimic NC + wt-AQP2 group). qRT-PCR and Western blotting were applied to detect the expression of AQP2 in LPS-induced HK-2 cells after transfection with miR-34b-5p inhibitor or miR-34b-5p mimic. AQP2 was up-regulated in the LPS + inhibitor group while down-regulated in the LPS + mimic group (

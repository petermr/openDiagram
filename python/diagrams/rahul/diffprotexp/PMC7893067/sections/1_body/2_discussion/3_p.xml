<p id="Par19">It is becoming increasingly evident that subcellular localization of lncRNAs is strongly associated with their function. In light of this, ongoing efforts such as the LncATLAS and RNALocate are aiming to establish a complete map for subcellular localization of lncRNAs in various tissue types

 </sup>. So far, these databases rely on data from cell lines and lack knowledge about the subcellular localization of lncRNA in tissues and during development. Studies that have investigated cellular localization of lncRNAs during development were mainly performed in drosophila and zebrafish

 </sup>. Therefore, in this study, we sought to provide global data of lncRNA subcellular localization in the human brain for two developmental stages. In accordance with previous studies, we found that the majority of lncRNAs are more abundant in the nucleus than in the cytosol

 </sup>. We further validated previous findings of tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of lncRNAs in the adult frontal cortex, fetal frontal cortex, and cerebellum. The higher number of cytosolic and nuclear-enriched lncRNAs detected in the adult frontal lobe compared to the fetal samples is most probably due to the larger number of adult brain samples used in this study, as well as a more homogeneous expression in the adult brain compared to the fetal samples (represented by 14 and 38-week embryos), providing better power to detect significant differences in localization.

0: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with RNA to form ribonucleoprotein complexes that regulate RNA expression and function [ 4].
1: As important participants in post-transcriptional regulation, RBPs are involved in almost all post-transcriptional regulation processes, including RNA splicing, translation, transport, localisation, degradation, and stabilisation [ 5].
2: RBP dysregulation has been reported in multiple cancers, which affects tumorigenesis and development [ 5].
3: However, the knowledge of RBP-related mechanisms in the development of cancer remains rudimentary and inconclusive.
4: Therefore, clarification of the roles of RBPs in BLCA will help us to better understand tumour pathogenesis and develop prognostic and response biomarkers.

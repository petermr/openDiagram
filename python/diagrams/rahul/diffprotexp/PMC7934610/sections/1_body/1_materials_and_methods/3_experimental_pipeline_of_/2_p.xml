<p>During the RNA-seq process, after DNase I treatment, magnetic beads with Oligo (dT) were used to isolate mRNA. Mixed with the fragmentation buffer, the mRNA was fragmented into short fragments. Then, cDNA was synthesized using mRNA fragments as templates. cDNA fragments were purified and resolved with EB buffer for end reparation and adenine addition. After that, the fragments were connected to adapters. After agarose gel electrophoresis, the suitable fragments were selected for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification as templates. During the quality control (QC) steps, an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System were used for the quantification and qualification of the sample library. In this process, the intestinal tissue of every sheep in the CE-R group was prepared to an individual paired-end library for RNA-seq, like in the CE-NR group. Each library was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (BGI, Huada Genomics Institute, Shenzhen, China).</p>

<p>X-ray absorption is intimately linked to X-ray fluorescence and emission. The vacant state created in the core level of the absorbing atom after the electron is excited by the X-ray photon is eventually filled by an electron from some occupied level with higher energy. Subsequently, the excess energy is released through the emission of a photon, or by creating secondary excitations in the electronic system (e.g., the emission of Auger electrons). In the case of radiative transitions, due to the large energy difference between the core levels, the emitted photon will also have its energy in the X-ray range, and the intensity of the resulting X-ray fluorescence

 </sup> The spectrum of the X-ray fluorescence depends on the density of occupied states and the created secondary excitations, which may be captured in complementary X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and resonant elastic and inelastic X-ray scattering (REXS and RIXS) experiments.

 <caption> (a) Comparison of Mn K-edge XANES for as-prepared MnO x catalyst and those for the catalyst under ORR and OER conditions, at 0.7 and 1.8 V (vs RHE) applied potentials, respectively, in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The corresponding structure motifs are shown in the insets. Reproduced with permission from ref ( 518). Copyright 2013 American Chemical Society. (b–f) Structure–property relationship in NiFe MOF bifunctional catalysts. (b) Shift and unoccupied states in the Ni 3d band for pristine MOF and lattice strained MOF with lattice expansion 1.7, 3.6 and 4.3% obtained from Ni XAS analysis. (c) Comparison of mass activities for the MOF catalysts and a Pt reference catalyst under ORR conditions and (d) of the MOF catalysts and RuO 2 reference catalyst under OER conditions. Operando Ni L 2,3-edge XAS collected under (e) ORR and (f) OER conditions, with characteristic features attributed to Ni 4+ species appearing at ∼859 eV.

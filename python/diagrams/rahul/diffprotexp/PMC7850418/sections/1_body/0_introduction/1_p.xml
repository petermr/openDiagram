<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has continued to spread globally since its emergence in China in late 2019 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Countries and localities have implemented various levels of public health mitigation measures with debatable success in an effort to control virus propagation [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>]. The challenge in better understanding the fundamental characteristics of this novel virus includes the heterogeneous disease reports in conjunction with no clear treatments or vaccines yet available or approved [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>]. Epidemiological tracking is paramount in the context of this current pandemic [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In particular, the genomic surveillance of circulating virus variants, such as with the seasonal epidemics of the influenza virus or even with the 2003 SARS epidemic, has brought useful information in understanding their respective evolutionary dynamics [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent tracking reports have discussed the high frequency and global distribution of a variant harbouring the D614G substitution located on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While higher infectious titre and increased protein stability have been associated with this variant, a clear fitness advantage has not been unequivocally established [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Historically, evolution of the related SARS-CoV virus is defined by deletion regions that impact the open-reading frames (ORF) of its genome [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Several deletions of large variations in size and prevalence have already been described in the SARS-CoV-2 genome [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref>].

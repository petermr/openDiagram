<p>In our combined multi-omics analysis of SASCs and EASCs, the hub gene 
 <italic>Acat2</italic> was found to be associated with nine metabolites in 10 metabolic pathways. 
 <italic>Acat2</italic> is a cellular enzyme that converts cholesterol and fatty acids into cholesterol esters and is mainly expressed in the liver and intestine (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1998</xref>). Studies have shown that atherosclerosis is reduced in mouse atherosclerosis models when 
 <italic>Acat2</italic> is deficient (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Willner et al., 2003</xref>); 
 <italic>Acat2</italic>-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia or cholesterol stone formation (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Buhman et al., 2000</xref>). Lower levels of 
 <italic>Acat2</italic> activity in the human liver can delay the development of atherosclerosis (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Parini et al., 2004</xref>); therefore, improving the stability of 
 <italic>Acat2</italic> may be an effective treatment strategy for type II diabetes (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the above findings, the higher expression of 
 <italic>Acat2</italic> in EASCs rather than SASCs may be more related to fat metabolism and insulin resistance.

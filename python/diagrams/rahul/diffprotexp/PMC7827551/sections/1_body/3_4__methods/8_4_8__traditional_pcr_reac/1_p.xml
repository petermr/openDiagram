<p>The 12 genes responsible for the production of the 12 differential proteins identified between the two phases were detected by PCR. The amplified products were analyzed in a 2.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized in UV light. PCR amplicon of each band was determined by comparison to the corresponding band in the low molecular weight ladder. Primers for 12 genes were outlined using the publicly available Primer3 software, as shown in

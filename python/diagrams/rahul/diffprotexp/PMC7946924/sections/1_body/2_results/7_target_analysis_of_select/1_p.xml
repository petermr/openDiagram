<p id="Par34">Target analysis in the psRNA target server database showed that miRNA398B and miRNA820C have targets respectively, on Os04t0624600-01 (similar to starch synthase DULL1) and Os05t0485800-00 (similar to pollen specific protein NTP303) among the maximum probability prediction (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). On the 5th day, MIR398b and miRNA396h showed highest FC in the apical and basal region respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). miR 396 h had multiple targets of Os02t0776900-01, a transcription activator involved in gibberellin induced stem elongation, Os01t0643300-02, an Auxin efflux carrier protein and Os01t0643300-01, a PIN1-like auxin transport protein with maximum probability. On the 10th day, MIR2106 showed highest up-regulation of 1.46 and 1.38 folds in the apical and basal spikelets respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c,d). Its target was identified to be Os02t0738900-01, a Dynamin related protein involved in secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

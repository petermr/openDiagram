<p>Grain size plays a significant role in determining the strength and toughness of materials. During the welding process, austenite tends to grow thermally and the austenite grain size provides the initial condition for the subsequent phase transformation during cooling and then affects the final microstructure and resulting mechanical properties [

 <xref rid="B2-materials-11-02127" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is reported that increasing the austenite grain size shifts the continuous cooling transformation diagram to longer reaction time and increases the possibility of martensite formation. Martensite formation may lower the toughness [

 <xref rid="B5-materials-11-02127" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Large austenite grain size is of particular concern during welding where the HAZ experiences rapid thermal cycles with high peak temperature which give rise to austenite grain growth, especially in the region adjacent to the fusion zone (coarse-grained heat-affected zone, CGHAZ). Therefore, the austenite growth behavior has aroused much interest in the past several decades [

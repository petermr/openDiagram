<p>In the first step, the temperature and times at which a distinct precipitation reaction starts and finishes need to be determined. This can be measured by DSC: the onset or end temperature of the reaction can be read directly from the DSC curves, and the associated time values are derived from the cooling rates applied. The obtained values for the onset or end temperatures and times of the reaction are inserted into the related cooling rates. In this way, the single values for any relevant cooling rate can be graphically connected by splines, to illustrate the regions of the specific precipitation reactions. In the second step, the intensity of the distinct precipitation reactions (or at least the total overall precipitation) at this cooling rate needs to be determined. This relates to the amount of the fraction transformed, i.e., the atomic or volume fraction of precipitation. Although this question might be hard to answer in detail, the specific precipitation enthalpy measured by DSC at least gives a value that is directly proportional to the fractions transformed. In the third and final step, the nature of the micro- and nano-structural changes related to the different DSC peaks needs to be determined, i.e., we need to determine which phases are precipitating. This involves several additional scientific aspects, for instance the chemical composition, crystal structure, particle morphology, active nucleation mechanism, particle size distributions and particle densities depending on the cooling rate. In some cases, several of these aspects cannot be revealed with high accuracy; however, any information generated in this respect helps to complete the CCP diagrams.</p>

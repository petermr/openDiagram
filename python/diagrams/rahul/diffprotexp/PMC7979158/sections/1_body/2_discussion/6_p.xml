<p>While significantly subtler in overall effects compared to earlier time-points, we also see evidence for altered neuronal transcription and lasting immune activation at P0. By P0, these signatures were reduced, which suggests a transient or attenuating effect on cortical patterning. It is also possible that biological variability in neonatal mice or technical variability impacted detection of gene expression changes in these P0 samples. Nonetheless, the subtle changes in gene expression at P0 are consistent with deficits in synapse formation that require changes in expression of immune molecules in neurons from newborn MIA offspring (

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The degeneration and/or loss of some morphological structures (such as limbs, teeth, and eyes, etc.) is a complex process that may result from the relaxation of the negative selection (neutral evolution), adaptive evolution (direct natural/positive selection to conserve energy and/or eliminate the disadvantageous effects of morphological structure), and/or gene pleiotropy (indirect selection on another traits) (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Grus &amp; Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Krishnan &amp; Rohner, 2017</xref>). In some conditions, evolutionary change also results from differences in the reproductive success of individuals with different genotypes (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Olson, 1999</xref>). <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al. (2018)</xref> revealed that evolutionary gene losses are not only a consequence, but may also be causally involved in phenotypic adaptations. By estimating the inactivation time of pseudogenes, and comparing with oldest fossil records, we might be able to speculate whether gene inactivation is due to the adaptive or neutral selection after the loss of phenotype.</p>

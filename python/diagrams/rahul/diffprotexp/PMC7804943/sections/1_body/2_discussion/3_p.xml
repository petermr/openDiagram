<p id="Par26">Unexpectedly, we observed that the underlying variation between proximal and distal neurons involves coordinated programs of GE and APA changes, involving the differential expression of ribosomal protein genes and differential 3′ UTR isoform usage of other gene sets, respectively. In the latter case, genes associated with 3′ UTR isoform changes significantly overlap genes encoding transcripts previously reported to localize to dendrites and axons

 </sup>. This raises the question of how these two correlated patterns combine to specify spatially distinct neuronal functions. Previous studies have demonstrated extensive heterogeneity in ribosome composition and function (reviewed in ref. 
 <sup>

 </sup>). These ‘specialized ribosomes’ enable spatial and temporal translational control of selective mRNAs under different physiological conditions and tissue types

 </sup>. Moreover, this specialization is important in neurons, where dendrites and axons are distant from the cell body

 </sup>. Although ribosome assembly generally occurs in the nucleolus, it has been observed that components of the translational machinery can be transported in the form of large ribonucleoprotein particles or granules, and select ribosomal protein mRNAs are locally synthesized

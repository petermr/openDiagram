<p id="Par59">Increasing evidence has confirmed the role of RBPs in carcinogenesis and some studies have consistently emphasized the association of RBPs as candidate biomarkers for patient prognosis and response to therapy in different cancer types [

In the present study, we first screened 385 RBPs differentially expressed between BLCA and normal tissues from the TCGA database. Then, we systematically analysed the biological pathways and constructed PPI networks for these differential RBPs. Subsequently, we performed univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses to further identify eight independent prognosis-associated RBPs. To further understand their biological functions and clinical significance, we also conducted survival and ROC analyses of the eight hub RBPs. Finally, we constructed a risk model based on these eight prognostic hub RBPs to predict the prognosis of BLCA patients. The results of our study provide new biomarkers for prognostic assessment of BLCA patients.

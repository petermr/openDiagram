<p>Close observations of microstructural characteristics of 1.0C-1.5Cr steel after various processes were performed in a Tecnai G2 20 transmission electron microscope (TEM), operated at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV. The sample was cut into slices with a thickness of 500 μm and then mechanically thinned to 50 μm, subsequently electropolished by using twin-jet equipment in an electrolyte consisting of 10% perchloric acid and 90% ethanol at the temperature of −25 °C. It should be mentioned that the characterized regions were close to the surfaces of both cold rolled and cold drawn steels.</p>

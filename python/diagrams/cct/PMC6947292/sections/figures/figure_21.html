 <caption> Schematic development of the enthalpy levels of three different heat treatment states in a medium-strength AlMgSi alloy obtainable by reheating to a certain maximum temperature. Values are based on those of 6005A in [ 120]. The shaded area signifies the heating rate range covered by DSC in Ref. [ 120]. </caption>

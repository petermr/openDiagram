<p>The pROC function was utilized to evaluate the performance of target gene in distinction of HD and non-dementia. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves exhibit the performance of dichotomies with sequential output, showing the sensitivity and specificity as output thresholds move into the range of all possible values [

 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. An AUC value of 100% indicated complete prediction and 50% represented random selection. All P values were bilateral and statistical significance was set to the threshold less than 0.05.

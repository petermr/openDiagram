<p>We next explored morphological differences in SAT and VAT depots in response to CD-feeding. We measured adipocyte area in H&amp;E stained SAT and VAT harvested from rats fed either the CD or STD (Figure S3A). Results showed that three months of CD feeding resulted in a significant increase in adipocyte area within VAT, and although an increase in SAT adipocyte area was also observed (Figure S3A), these changes were not significant (Figure S3B). These findings suggest that CD-induced hypertrophic adipocyte expansion, which was more pronounced in VAT compared to SAT.</p>

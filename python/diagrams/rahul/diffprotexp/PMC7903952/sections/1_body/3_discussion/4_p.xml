<p>PPP1R14B is required for cell migration and retraction, which is an inhibitor of protein-phosphatase 1.
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The abnormal expression of PPP1R14B has been proved in some types of cancer including melanoma and ovarian clear cell carcinoma.

 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> PPP1R14B was also thought to have relationship with the development of tumor. In this study, RIP combined with the experiment of luciferase reporter assay verified PPP1R14B was direct target of miR-137. Furthermore, the results of our research proved the up-regulation of LINC00466 promoted the expression of PPP1R14B by downregulating miR-137. These results implied that LINC00466 promoted the malignant progression and resistance to TMZ of glioma by regulating miR-137/PPP1R14B axis.

 <caption> Results of survival analyses of hub genes. The expression of CCR4 (A), CCR8 (B), and P2RY14 (C) were all significantly correlated with patient prognosis in the TCGA data set, and the higher the level of gene expression, the better the patient’s prognosis. (D–I) Survival analysis of two randomly distributed subsets showed results consistent with the original data set, with the expression of all of the three hub genes significantly correlated with survival. (J–L) Survival analysis was performed on another validation data set GSE41613. </caption>

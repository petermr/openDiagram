<p>The differential effects of Hsp70 and STCH on NKCC2 biogenesis strongly suggest, per se, that their action on the co-transporter are specific. To further corroborate the differential regulation of NKCC2 by STCH and Hsp70 and the specificity of their effects on the co-transporter, we next examined the role of endogenous STCH and Hsp70 on NKCC2 protein expression. Consequently, we studied the effect of STCH and Hsp70 knockdown on NKCC2 using small interference RNA (siRNA). To this end, a sequential transfection in HEK cells was performed. Cells were first transfected with siRNAs for at least 24 h, before transfection with Myc-NKCC2 plasmids for 48 h. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>, upon STCH knockdown, the steady state level of NKCC2 was increased in a dose dependent fashion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>A). In contrast, Hsp70 knockdown had the opposite effect by decreasing NKCC2 protein abundance in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>B), illustrating again the specificity of STCH and Hsp70 actions on the co-transporter. Given that a plateau was reached with the dose of 40 pmol of each siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,B), this dose was used to study in parallel the effects of STCH and Hsp70 knock-down on total NKCC2 protein abundance. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>C, when the dose of 40 pmol of each siRNA was used, STCH know-down increased NKCC2 protein abundance by 52% (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003), illustrating again the reciprocal control of NKCC2 by STCH and Hsp70. To further support the notion that endogenous Hsp70 promotes NKCC2 biogenesis, we also tested the effect of YM-01, an allosteric inhibitor of Hsp70 [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>D, YM-01 reproduced the effect of Hsp70 knock-down by downregulating the steady state level of NKCC2 (âˆ’34 %, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Hence, these data are fully in agreement with a role of endogenous of Hsp70 and STCH in the regulation of NKCC2 protein expression. Most importantly, these results are consistent with STCH and Hsp70 having differential and antagonistic effects with regard to NKCC2 biogenesis.

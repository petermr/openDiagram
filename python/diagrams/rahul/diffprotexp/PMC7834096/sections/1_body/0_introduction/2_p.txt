0: AAF were proposed to have significantly contributed to the exceptional pathogenicity of the outbreak strain, e.g.
1: by increasing the amount of Stx2 molecules absorbed through the colon epithelial cells by the tight adherence of a high number of bacterial cells [ 4, 10].
2: Up to date, five different AAF subtypes are known.
3: In addition to the EHEC outbreak strain [ 4] and a recently discovered EAEC/EHEC hybrid strain [ 11], AAF are limited almost exclusively to EAEC.
4: They are typically encoded on the large EAEC virulence plasmid pAA [ 5, 1215] and are activated by AggR [ 16, 17], which is a central virulence regulator in EAEC [ 18, 19].
5: AAF have been described as surface structures that mediate aggregative adherence to eukaryotic cells, other bacteria, and abiotic surfaces in a characteristic stacked-brick or honeycomb adherence pattern [ 15].

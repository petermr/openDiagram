<p>HUVECs were cultured in 96-well dishes coated with 1% gelatin. When HUVECs reached an approximate confluence of 100%, PC-3M cells were washed and resuspended in culture medium (10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml). One hundred microliters of the tumor cell suspension was added to HUVEC monolayers in 96-well dishes and cocultured with HUVECs for 30 min at 37Â°C. At the end of the incubation, the wells were washed three times with PBS to remove adherent and non-adherent PC-3M cells (

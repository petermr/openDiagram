<p>Another noteworthy branch point existed in germ cell trajectory. In the comparative analysis, the heatmap of gene expression dynamics from State 4 to State 3 or 1 comprised two large gene sets (

 <italic>Taf7l</italic>,
 <italic> Sycp1</italic>,
 <italic> Sycp3,</italic> and 
 <italic>Smc1b</italic>; while the other included more key genes (
 <italic>Dppa3, Zp3,</italic> and
 <italic> Padi6</italic>) critical to PF assembly. Importantly, the gene expression level along with pseudotime indicated that State 4 was almost equidistant between States 1 and 3 (

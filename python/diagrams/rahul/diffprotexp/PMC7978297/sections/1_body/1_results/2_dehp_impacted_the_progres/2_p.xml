<p>Furthermore, gene differential expression was carried out at the three identified stages (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). At the pre-stage of PF formation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S3</xref>), there were 214 down- and 131 up-regulated genes for PD0-DEHP 
 <italic>vs.</italic> PD0, and 65 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the PD3-DEHP and PD3 groups (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A left). For the early-stage (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S4</xref>) with DEHP treatment, there were 202 up- and 218 down-regulated DEGs at PD0, and 142 up- and 416 down-regulated DEGs at PD3, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A middle). At the late-stage (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S5</xref>), DEHP significantly increased 202 and 181 DEGs, and decreased 176 and 374 genes at PD0 and PD3, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A right). Furthermore, the representative genes involved in PF assembly and oocyte growth dramatically declined (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>D). These results implied that DEHP tended to influence the transcription of germ cells during PF assembly. In addition, 13, 191, and 223 key DEGs (this refers to the common genes in Venn diagrams that were both affected by DEHP at PD0 and PD3) were produced at the pre-, early-, and late-stages of PF formation, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Enrichment analysis demonstrated that key genes at the pre-stage were related to “Ribosome”, “DNA repair”, and “Regulation of cellular response to stress” (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>E); 191 key DEGs at the early-stage were mostly enriched in the biological processes of “oxidative phosphorylation”, and “mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton transport” (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Meanwhile, at the late-stage, DEHP largely affected “regulation of protein stability” (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D), as well as “energy coupled proton transport”. Moreover, both were enriched in “cytoplasmic translation” and “mitochondrial transmembrane transport”.

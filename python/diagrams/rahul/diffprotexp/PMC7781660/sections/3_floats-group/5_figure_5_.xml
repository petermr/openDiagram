  <p>Novel types of lncRNA transcripts. According to the position of the lncRNAs on the genome relative to the protein-encoding genes, the novel lncRNAs can be divided into five categories: intergenic lncRNAs, which locate between annotated protein-coding genes and are at least 1 kb away from the nearest protein-coding genes; bidirectional lncRNAs, which are oriented head to head with a protein-coding gene within 1kb; introns lncRNAs, which overlap with the intron of annotated coding genes in either sense or antisense orientation; antisense lncRNAs, which are transcribed from the antisense strand and overlap in part with well-defined spliced sense or intronless sense RNAs; sense-overlapping lncRNAs, which are considered transcript variants of protein-coding mRNAs, as they overlap with a known annotated gene on the same genomic strand</p>

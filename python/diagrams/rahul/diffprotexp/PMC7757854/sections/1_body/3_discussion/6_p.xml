<p>Expression changes in key genes in the DEGs list of the GO term fat cell differentiation were further analysed for expression after treatment. 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> and 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic> were selected based on their identification early in landscaping adipogenesis [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and showed expression consistent with RNA-Seq data. These transcription factors play an essential role in promoting adipogenesis, along with the master regulator 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, these genes can also be detrimental to the expression of subtype specificity [
 <xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Such effects may be due to differential expression in a time-dependent manner, as observed in this study. Specifically, some genes show variable interaction profiles with one CEBP factor depending on timepoint (day 3 vs day 5). For instance, 63 and 34 gene interactions for C
 <italic>ebpa</italic> were observed to be differentially expressed with MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min, respectively. Nine genes were observed to be common, and 54 and 25 genes were distributed uniquely with MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min conditions, respectively (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="t0009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). For 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic>, 11 and 8 gene interactions were observed to be differentially expressed with MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min, respectively. Five genes were common, and six and three genes were distributed uniquely in MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min, respectively (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1b</xref>; Table 10).

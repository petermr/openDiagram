<p id="Par11">Similarly, differentially expressed mRNAs in H3 vs H8 were mainly enriched in the estrogen metabolic process, ovarian follicle development from the ovarian fold, meiosis I, oocyte development, oogenesis, regulation of insulin-like growth factor receptor signalling pathway, transforming growth factor-beta production and ovulation cycle. In terms of molecular function, DEGs were enriched in transforming growth factor beta binding, insulin-like growth factor binding, estradiol 17 beta dehydrogenase activity and calcium dependent ATPase activity. Also, GO terms associated with vesicle membrane and laminin complex were identified as cellular components (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>b). GO analysis showed that, the differential mRNAs were primarily enriched in oocyte development.

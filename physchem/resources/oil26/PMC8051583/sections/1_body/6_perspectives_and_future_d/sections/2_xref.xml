<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) yet new discoveries and insights have been gained from the analysis of the rapidly increasing amount of genomic data. Studies into the evolution of the genes for the insulin receptor, enzymes involved in producing the mature hormone and downstream signaling partners should also improve our understanding of the biology of insulin. Genomic sequences, together with improved bioinformatic search algorithms, allow unbiased searches for sequences with similarity to insulin (or your favorite protein) in genomes, revealing sequences that might not have been found in more directed searches for bioactive peptides. As we complete more genomes and microbiomes, it is certain that we will discover more insulin-like sequences with novel aspects to their sequences, structures, and functions. However, sequence will not tell us function. Experimental work is still needed to identify the functions of these novel insulin-like sequences, which may uncover new roles for insulin in biology.

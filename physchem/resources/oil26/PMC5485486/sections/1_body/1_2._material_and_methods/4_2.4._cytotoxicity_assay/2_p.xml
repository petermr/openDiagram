<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All experiments were performed with twice PBS washed cells at a density of about 1.5 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well (1.5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>&#8201;cells/ml), in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>l complete medium per well. Then 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>l of complete culture medium containing different concentrations of the tested essential oils (dissolved in DMSO) was added to each well. After 48&#8201;h exposure of cells to these concentrations of tested essential oils at 37&#176;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>l of medium was carefully aspirated from each well and replaced with 20&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>l of MTT solution (5&#8201;mg/ml of PBS). After incubation in the same conditions for 4 hours, the plates were treated with 80&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>l of an HCl/isopropanol (24&#8201;:&#8201;1) solution to dissolve the blue intracellular formazan produced by living cells. One hour later, the absorbance (optical density OD) of the plates was determined by a Multiskan EX spectrophotometer reader at two wavelengths (540 and 630&#8201;nm). DMSO (0.5%) was used as the negative control and methotrexate (MTX) as the positive one.</p>

<p id="Par30">We subsequently used an RNA pull-down assay to show that circ_0003865 was directly associated with miR-3653-3p in human BMSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f). The dual-luciferase reporter assay also revealed that circ_0003865 could directly bind to miR-3653-3p in human BMSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>g). Additionally, we showed that hsa-miR-3653-3p was directly bound to the 3′ UTR region of the GAS1 gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>h). Thus, we have discovered a circ_0003865/miR-3653-3p/GAS1 interaction that substantially modulates the osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs.

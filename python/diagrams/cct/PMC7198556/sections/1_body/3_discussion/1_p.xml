<p id="Par17">As stated in the introduction, the presented method represents an approach for obtaining temperature data of a surface hardening heat treatment process where there is no 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> measurement possible or available. The thorough investigation of the microstructure in the surface hardened region supplies rather precise ranges of the transition from one microstructural region to another. It is important to note that the transitions are not sharp but rather transitional areas due to local differences in chemistry because of production related segregations and possible variations in the temperature distribution imposed by the inductive heat generation. However, the evaluated transition depths in combination with a TTA-recording for the process conditions supply the transition temperatures for the considered heat treatment quite precisely on a macro scale. The actual transition temperatures in the bearing journal may be somewhat higher, since the TTA-information is drawn from tiny samples with diameter 4 mm that experience homogeneous heating in the dilatometer compared to the 50 mm diameter of the bearing, where a certain degree of overheating is necessary since its core acts as a heat sink during the heating process.

<p>Microstructures of AISI 4340 for all deformation temperatures and two limiting values of deformation rates are in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f016">Figure 16</xref> (
 <italic>φ</italic>’ = 0.001 s
 <sup>−1</sup>). The deformation temperature has a significant influence on the grain size [
 <xref rid="B46-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In both shown cases of strain rates, grain size increases in proportion to temperature. This effect is more noticeable as the deformation rate decreases.

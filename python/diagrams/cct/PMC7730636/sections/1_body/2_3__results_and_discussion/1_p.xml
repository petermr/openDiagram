<p>The first results we focused on in our research were aimed at finding two initial temperatures: 
 <italic>Ac</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>Ac</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. The heating of all eight samples took place under the same conditions, i.e., the heating rate was set to 1 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f004">Figure 4</xref>a explains how we initially determined the temperatures of 
 <italic>Ac</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>Ac</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. The results showed that in the experimental steel AISI 4340, the start temperature of 
 <italic>Ac</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> was 725 °C, and the final temperature of austenite formation 
 <italic>Ac</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> was 763 °C.

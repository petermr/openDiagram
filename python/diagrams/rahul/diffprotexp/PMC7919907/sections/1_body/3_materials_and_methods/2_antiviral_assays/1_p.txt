0: Antiviral activities of BLF or HLF against 229E, NL63 and OC43 were tested in CPE assays as previously described [ 52] with minor modifications.
1: Briefly, cell cultures at near confluency in 96-well plates were infected with 100 L of viruses at desired dilutions and incubated for 1 h. Unabsorbed virus was removed and different concentrations of LF (0, 3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.3, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 g/ml) were added.
2: Remdesivir was included as a positive control.
3: The plates were incubated for another 35 days when a significant cytopathic effect was observed in the wells without compound (virus only).
4: Cells were stained with 0.1 mg/ml neutral red for 2 h, and excess dye was rinsed from the cells with PBS.
5: The absorbed dye was eluted from the cells with buffer containing 50% ethanol and 1% glacial acetic acid.
6: Plates were read for optical density determination at 540 nm.
7: Readings were normalized with uninfected controls.
8: EC 50 values were determined by plotting percent CPE versus log 10 compound concentrations from best-fit dose response curves with variable slope in Prism 8.
9: Toxicity of LF at each concentration was determined in uninfected cells in the same microplates by measuring neutral red dye uptake.

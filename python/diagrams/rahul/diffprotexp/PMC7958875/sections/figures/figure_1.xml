  <p>Approach to find differentially expressed genes in 
   <italic>P. berghei</italic> ookinetes dependent on vector species. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Five cell clusters were identified according to marker genes for the cells collected from 
   <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and 
   <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> midguts, with cluster 1 representing mature ookinetes, based on marker genes expressed in this cluster (

   </xref>,

    <bold>Table S1</bold>
   </xref>). Percentage of total cells for each cluster are indicated. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Cells were staged using the Malaria Cell Atlas (MCA) data as a reference index for scmap-cell. Cluster 1 represents mature ookinetes. Each stage is indicated in different colors (topcell). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Ookinetes from cluster 1 with pseudotime-corrected gene expression show additional details. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Ookinetes from cluster 1 can be clustered into three additional clusters after pseudotime correction. Cluster 1.3 was used for the analysis to investigate the effect of vector species on gene expression, as it mostly contained the ookinetes that were collected 24Â h post feeding. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Selection of the three most prominent ookinete genes that are variantly expressed depending on vector host. GAPM1 (glideosome associated protein with multiple membrane spans 1), also known as PSOP23, ISP3 (inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3) and UFD1 (ubiquitin fusion degradation protein).

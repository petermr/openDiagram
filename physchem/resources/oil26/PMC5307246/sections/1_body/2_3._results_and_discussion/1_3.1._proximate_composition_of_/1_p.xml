<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The results of proximate analysis of<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seeds are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The moisture content of seeds was 3.61%, which is low and therefore beneficial for prolonging the shelf life of the seeds. The seeds contained significant amounts of crude oil (57.85&#8201;g/100&#8201;g), crude protein (26.39&#8201;g/100&#8201;g), and ash (2.08&#8201;g/100&#8201;g). The ash and crude protein were in the range of those reported for<italic> Arachis hypogaea</italic> L. and<italic> Pentaclethra macrophylla</italic> Benth. [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The crude oil content was higher than those of some commercial seed oils, namely, soybean, cotton seeds, and rubber seeds [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seeds also contained significant amounts of minerals. The most abundant was potassium followed by magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron, and sodium. These results showed that<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seeds can be regarded as a good source of oil, protein and minerals.</p>

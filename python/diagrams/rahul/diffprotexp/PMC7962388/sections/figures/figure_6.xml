  <p>Plant hormones associated transcripts expressed from premeiosis to anthesis. Several hormonal routes are differentially regulated across the studied reproductive developmental steps (premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis and anthesis), with auxin and jasmonic acid pathways as the most represented. Both upregulated and downregulated members were detected in each case. DE Hormones stands for de-regulated hormone-related transcripts. DE: de-regulated. UP: up-regulated. DOWN: down-regulated. Ja: jasmonic acid. CK: cytokinin. GA: gibberelic acid. ABA: absicic acid. BR: brassinosteroids. SA:salycilic acid</p>

 <caption> Protein expression of steroids receptors and signaling pathway proteins in GT1-7 cells after AAS exposure. (A-E) Representative Western blots of AR, ER, GnRH, p-ERK and p-p38 from protein extracts of AAS or vehicle-treated cells. (F-J) Densitometry analysis of each protein normalized to β-actin represents the relative protein expression values for (A) Androgen receptor (AR), (B) Estrogen receptor (ER), (C) GnRH, (D) Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2; Thr202/Tyr204), and (E) Phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38), Error bars represent standard error of the mean. *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, unpaired t-test. n = three replicates of three (AR and ER) or four (GnRH, p-ERK and p-p38) independent experiments for each group. </caption>

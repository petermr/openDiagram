<p>First, we examined the genome alterations and expression of 22 major CPA factors that drive APA processing in HCC. As indicated by the HCC patient dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), CPSF1 mRNA was significantly increased in HCC compared to that in normal liver tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Corresponding genome copy number data indicated that CPSF1 amplification correlated with its mRNA upregulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). In 50 paired HCC tissues from the TCGA database, CPSF1 mRNA was relatively elevated in tumor tissues compared to the paired non-tumor tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further confirm the elevated mRNA expression of CPSF1 in HCC, we searched the data in other public databases. We found that CPSF1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to that in normal tissues in the GEO Roessler liver dataset (

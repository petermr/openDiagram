<p>2) "Indeed, we found that inter-species differences in the usage of intronic and 3' UTR PAS correlate with differences in expression effect size between the species at an equal magnitude, but in opposite directions (Figure 3B). Increased usage of intronic sites is correlated with increased expression levels, while increased usage of 3' UTR sites is correlated with decreased expression."</p>

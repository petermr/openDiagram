0: POAG and post-mortem TMs were analyzed in duplicate (spots/bands) and mean values (SD) were calculated from these replicates.
1: Individual biomarker expression was provided by GenePix software.
2: The row spot intensity data were entered into a Microsoft Excel database (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and duplicate spots outside the 10% coefficient of variability were refused from the statistical analysis.
3: FDR value of 0.01, as observed.
4: Protein response ratios were defined as the variation in a given marker and a cut-off of two fold (changes) was used for differential expression, in accordance with previously published methods [ 32,  33].
5: The non-parametric MannWhitney  U test was selected according to the small size population.
6: Statistical significance for intra-pair POAG analysis was set at  p < 0.00083 to control for multiple testing ( p = 0.05/60 targets) and at  p  0.05 for WB, Zymography and real-time PCR.
7: The SPSS 15.0 statistic package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all comparisons.
8: A specific REST/MannWhitney  U test coupled analysis was carried out for PCR experiments.

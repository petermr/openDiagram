<p>In pursuit of high energy density and long cycle life of all‐solid‐state battery, the migration of electron and ion inside cathode is as crucial as the cathode/electrolyte interface.

 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">104</xref> Constructing ion/electron conductive networks in both the cathode and interface is of great significance for reducing the polarization and delivering full capacity of the battery. Tao et al.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref> developed LLZO nanoparticle‐decorated porous carbon foam (LLZO@C) that was used as sulfur host. All‐solid‐state Li‐S battery was assembled using the LLZO@C/S as cathode, Li metal as anode, and LLZO‐P(EO)
 <sub>8</sub>/LiClO
 <sub>4</sub> as both electrolyte and cathode binder. The LLZO‐P(EO)
 <sub>8</sub>/LiClO
 <sub>4</sub> electrolyte constructs high‐efficient ionic transportation path among the sulfur particles, which can greatly reduce interfacial resistance between sulfur and LLZO‐P(EO)
 <sub>8</sub>/LiClO
 <sub>4</sub>, and enable the as‐assembled all‐solid‐state Li‐S battery to present remarkable cycling performance at 37 °C. Moreover, Zhu et al.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">103</xref> reported a flexible electrolyte/cathode bilayer framework consisting of a 3D carbon nanofiber/sulfur (CNF/S) cathode and 1D LLTO nanofiber‐PEO electrolyte. A mixed conducting behavior was achieved by infiltrating the LLTO‐PEO solid electrolyte onto the surface and into the pores of CNF/S nanofiber membranes, thus this bilayer framework demonstrated outstanding cycle performance with high coulombic efficiency of over 99% at room temperature.

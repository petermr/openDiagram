<p id="Par54">Subsequently, we performed GSEA analysis to explore the enriched biological pathways of the co-expressed genes. Most were enriched in the “extracellular matrix component,” “angiogenesis,” and “cell adhesion molecule binding,” which correlated with cancer pathogenesis. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the main component of the tumor microenvironment and is composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides [

Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play an important role in the interaction of cells with other cells and their surrounding intercellular environment. The role of CAMs in cancer involves angiogenesis, disruption of tissue architecture, and loss of contact with other cells and the ECM [

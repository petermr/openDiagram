0: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) analysis was performed on an AB SCIEX nano-LC-MS/MS (Triple TOF 5600 plus) system.
1: Samples were chromatographed using a 90 min gradient from 230% (buffer A; 0.1% ( v/ v) formic acid, 5% ( v/ v) acetonitrile: buffer B; 0.1% ( v/ v) formic acid, 95% ( v/ v) acetonitrile) after injecting into the AB SCIEX column system.
2: MS1 spectra were collected in the range 3501500  m/ z for 250 ms.
3: The 20 most intense precursors with charge state 25 were selected for fragmentation.
4: MS2 spectra were collected in the range 502000  m/ z for 100 ms; precursor ions were excluded from reselection for 15 s. The mass spectrometry results are shown in  Table 3.

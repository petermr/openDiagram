The video was recorded using XProtect<sup>&#174;</sup> Smart Client 2017 software (Br&#248;ndby, Denmark). Six observers were trained to collect data, and all demonstrated &gt;90% inter-observer reliability based on the percent difference in behaviors scored during three video observations. Inter-observer reliability was rechecked every three months during the video-coding process.</p>

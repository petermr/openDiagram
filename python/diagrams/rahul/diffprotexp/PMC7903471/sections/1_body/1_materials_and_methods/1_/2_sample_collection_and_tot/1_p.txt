0: Approximately 5 g of cartilage tissue was collected from each patient and stored at -80 C until further analysis.
1: Total RNA was extracted from the tissue suspension using the TRIzol  reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2: The tissue was homogenized prior to RNA extraction.
3: The amount and purity of the total RNA were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and RNA integrity was analyzed using an RNA Nano 6000 kit from the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).

 <caption> ( A) Oxygen−oxygen (O−O) radial distribution function, g O−O(r), for aqueous MgCl 2 solutions without Mg 2+−Cl − contact ion pairing. ( B) Radial distribution function for aqueous MgCl 2 solutions with Mg 2+−Cl − contact ion pairing. ( C) Average number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) in pure liquid water, aqueous MgCl 2 solutions and aqueous CsCl solutions. Geometric criteria defining an HB between two H 2O molecules: | O i - O j | &lt; 3 . 5 Å , | O j - H k | &lt; 1 . 2 Å , | O i - H k | &lt; 2 . 5 Å , θ O j O i H &lt; 30 ∘ ( O i is HB acceptor, O j is HB donor). ( D) Percentage of H 2O molecules engaging in n HBs in the first and second shell of Mg 2+ and in the bulk. Inset: Average number of HBs in pure water (blue dashed line) and in the solvation shells of hydrated Mg 2+, Ca 2+, K +, Na + and Cl − ions (isolated ions, no counterions). </caption>

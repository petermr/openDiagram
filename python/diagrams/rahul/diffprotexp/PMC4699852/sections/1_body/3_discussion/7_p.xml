 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> also shows the relationship between the synthesis of TrkB receptor and secretion of BDNF over time. In the NIM conditions, the TrkB receptor increased with time until 56 h. BDNF binding presumably stimulated phosphorylation of ERK, resulting in phosphorylated ERK reaching a peak at the same time. At this time, most cells started to gain neural-like morphology. This indicates that differentiated cells overexpressed TrkB receptors and binding BDNF in order to promote their functional maturation and survival. These results confirmed that BDNF can facilitate the maturation of MSC-derived dopamine progenitors [

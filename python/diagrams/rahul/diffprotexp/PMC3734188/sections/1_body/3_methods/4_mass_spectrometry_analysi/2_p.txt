0: All MS/MS spectra were searched against the rat IPI 3.49 protein sequence database (40,131 entries) using SEQUEST algorithm-based Bioworks 3.3.1 (Thermo Finnigan, Inc.).
1: The search parameters were set as follows: precursor mass tolerance, 2.0 amu; fragment mass tolerance, 1.0 amu; tryptic cleavage only at lysine or arginine, with up to two missed cleavage sites allowed; and a static modification of +57 amu on cysteine.
2: The search results were further processed with the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) (Institute for Systems Biology).
3: The SEQUEST results were validated using PeptideProphet [ 30], which also calculates the probability of peptide identification.
4: ProteinProphet [ 31] was applied to assemble the peptides into proteins and calculate the probability of protein identification.
5: The probability of protein identification was calculated based in part on the peptide probability and the SEQUEST Xcorr score [ 31].
6: Only proteins identified with a probability >0.9 were considered for further analysis, as this cutoff resulted in a calculated false discovery rate (FDR) of approximately 1%.

<p id="Par12">Alternative splicing events may have diverse functional consequences for protein expression, such as shifting the frequency of transcripts containing introns (noncoding) or mRNA stability (nonsense-mediated decay) or leading to gain/loss of protein domains, intrinsically disordered regions, or signaling peptides

 </sup>. Quantification of these consequences revealed some interesting differences between Mayo and MSBB BM36 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>), the two datasets with the largest numbers of gDTUs. Whereas in the Mayo dataset, a high number of isoforms showed loss of coding potential and protein domains, in the MSBB BM36 isoforms showed an even distribution of loss and gain of coding potential or protein domains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). These differences could be at least partly explained by the larger number of gDTUs detected in the Mayo compared to MSBB TL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and are likely related to the different median read depth of these datasets (Mayo—12.58 billion bases; MSBB BM22—3.23 billion bases; MSBB BM36—3.56 billion bases)

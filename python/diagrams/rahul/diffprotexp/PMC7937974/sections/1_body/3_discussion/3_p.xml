<p>Rowley's team performed RNA sequencing using the coronary artery tissue of KD with KD-CAL (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The results showed that T lymphocyte activation, antigen presentation and dendritic cell function, immunoglobulin production, and type I interferon response were the main significantly upregulated molecular pathways. However, in this study, the OXPHOS was significantly upregulated. The differences between the two studies may be complicated. Firstly, sources of samples are different, Rowley's study examined the total human coronary artery, the cell types are various, while the present study mainly focused on HCAECs and just 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Secondly, we compared the differences between the KD-CAL+ group, KD-CALâ€“ group, and HC group, while Rowley's study only focused on the KD-CAL+ group and HC group. Moreover, Rowley's study focused on the subacute or chronic stage of CAL, while the present study mainly focused on the acute stage. Although different conclusions have been drawn, all of them could be the potential molecular biological mechanism of KD CAL formation.

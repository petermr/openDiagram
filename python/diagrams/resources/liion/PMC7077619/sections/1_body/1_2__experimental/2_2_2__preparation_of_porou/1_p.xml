<p>The polymer sample of poly(vinylidene fluoride) and silicon dioxide was used for the fabrication of porous membranes by a simple phase inversion process. The various ratios viz, 50:50, 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10 of PVdF and SiO
 <sub>2</sub> have been taken to prepare the membranes. The physical status and nature of the prepared films were given in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-00405">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. It is understood that the flexible nature has been obtained for the low SiO
 <sub>2</sub> contents. Beyond 20 wt.% of SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, the films are turned to be brittle.

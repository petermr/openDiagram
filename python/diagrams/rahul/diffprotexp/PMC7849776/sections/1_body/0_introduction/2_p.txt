0: Recently, from the screening of 380 transposon insertion mutants of  S. aureus USA300 of Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library, we found that disruption of the  yjbI gene, lying upstream of the  yjbH gene in a two-gene operon, resulted in the loss of pathogenicity in silkworm and mice.
1: Pathogenicity was restored by the introduction of the  yjbIH operon and not of the  yjbI gene [ 14], suggesting that the  yjbH gene might have a role in pathogenicity.
2: Studies involving YjbH in  Bacillus subtilis [ 1517],  S. aureus [ 1821], and other Gram-positive bacteria [ 2224] have reported it to be an adaptor protein responsible for proteolysis of Spx, a transcriptional regulator, via ClpXP protease [ 1618, 2426].
3: However, the role of YjbH in the pathogenicity of  S. aureus is obscure.
4: In this study, we found that YjbH is essential to  S. aureus virulence in a whole-body animal infection model and involved in the expression of the broad range of virulence genes.
5: In addition, we found that YjbH affects the bacterial surface structure, and confers resistance to oxidative stress in the host.

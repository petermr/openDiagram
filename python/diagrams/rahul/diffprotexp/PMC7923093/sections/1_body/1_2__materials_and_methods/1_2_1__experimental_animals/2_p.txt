0: The basal diet fed was AIN-93G [ 15] (Nantong Trophy Co., Ltd. Nantong, China).
1: The basic dietary formula and nutrient content of the experiment group (basal diet plus 1-fold content of arginine) and the control group (as nitrogen balance is an important issue in nutritional study, to avoid the potential bias of unbalanced nitrogen amount, we added the non-essential and most common amino acid glutamate into basal diets with the same content of nitrogen as arginine) are reported in  Table 1.
2: The experimental period included a pre-experimental period (four days before parturition) and the experimental period of 17 days after parturition.

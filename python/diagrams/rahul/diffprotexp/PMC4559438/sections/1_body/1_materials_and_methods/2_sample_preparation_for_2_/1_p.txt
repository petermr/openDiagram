0: Samples for 2-dimensional electophoresis (2-DE) were suspended in 4x sample buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% ampholyte, 100 mM dithiothretol, 40 mM Tris, 0.002% bromophenol blue) and sonicated.
1: Then, 10M DNase solution was added and the sample was incubated for 30 minutes at 4C.
2: After incubation, samples were centrifuged (105,000 G) for 45 minutes.
3: Next, 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to obtain a final TCA concentration of 58%.
4: Samples were then incubated for 2 hours on ice.
5: After incubation, 200 L of cold acetone was added and the protein pellet was resuspended with a pipette.
6: Samples were again incubated on ice for 15 minutes and centrifuged (14,000 G) for 20 minutes, after which the acetone was discarded.
7: Finally, the protein pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 200 L sample buffer for quantification with Bradford methods.

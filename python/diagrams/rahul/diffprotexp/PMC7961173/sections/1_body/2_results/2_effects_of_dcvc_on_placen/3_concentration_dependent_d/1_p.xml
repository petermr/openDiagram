<p id="Par33">In order to evaluate patterns in gene expression caused by 12-h DCVC treatment, correlation of expression levels across DCVC treatment concentrations (10 versus 20 µM), were evaluated. Changes in gene expression levels (relative to control) were strongly correlated for cells exposed to 10 µM versus 20 µM DCVC after a 12-h treatment [

Furthermore, for genes that met the FDR criterion for significant differential gene expression (FDR &lt; 0.05) and had a logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3], 20 µM DCVC treatment-induced larger magnitude altered gene expression compared with 10 µM DCVC, further indicating a concentration-dependent response (Fig.

0: Purpose: Suitable ratio of essential fatty acids has an important role in maintaining good health.
1: There is no pure oil with an ideal fatty acid composition and oxidative stability.
2: The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the physical, chemical and nutritional properties of oil obtained by blending flaxseed oil as a rich source of   3 fatty acids with sesame and olive oils.
3: Methods: Three different ratios (65:30:5, 60:30:10 and 55:30:15) were prepared using olive, sesame and flaxseed oils.
4: These mixtures were stored at 4C and 24C and their quality and physicochemical properties were determined by measuring the fatty acid composition, phenolic compound, peroxide, anisidine values and schaal tests.
5: Results: Fatty acid composition indicated that adding 10% and 15% flaxseed oil into blends have suitable ratio of essential fatty acids.
6: The sample which contained 5% flaxseed oil had the highest phenolic content among treatments and these compounds showed a significant decrease during storage.
7: A significant increase (p<0.05) was observed in peroxide values of all samples during storage.
8: Increasing the flaxseed oil content in the blends, lead to an increase of the anisidine value.
9: Conclusion: Blending sesame and olive oils with flaxseed oil produced oil blends with a good balance of essential fatty acids.
10: Although peroxide and anisidine values increased during storage of the oil blends; the blends were of a good quality for home and industrial use.

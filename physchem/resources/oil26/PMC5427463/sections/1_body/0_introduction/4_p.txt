0: These properties make the SoEO very promising as a source of botanical insecticides.
1: This aspect has been largely exploited in the case of EOs from rosemary and other aromatic plants, which are effective against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae (El Abdouni Khiyari et al., 2014[ 12]; Santana-Meridas et al., 2014[ 46]).
2: At our knowledge, insecticidal activity of Tunisian SoEO has not yet been investigated.
3: Moreover, allelopathic properties of  Salvia genus were also reported and the first studies that demonstrated the presence of volatile growth inhibitors produced by  Salvia species were carried out on  S. leucophylla and  S. apiana by Muller and Muller (1964[ 37]).
4: The effects of EOs extracted from  S. hierosolymitana and  S. multicaulis on germination and initial radical elongation of  Raphanus sativus L. (radish) and  Lepidium sativum L. (garden cress) showed different activities against the tested species (Mancini et al., 2009[ 32]), while the phytotoxic activity of the SoEO from Tunisia has not been reported before.

<p>In summary, metaproteomics is a rapidly growing field that allows to characterize microbial communities and host-associated microbiomes on multiple levels. The enabling technologies (LC and MS/MS) see major improvements every year, while also the number of metaproteomics experts is growing, which will make metaproteomics measurements more broadly accessible on the near term. The nascent metaproteomics community has started to organize, and a first set of inter-lab comparison studies is under way to test and validate differing metaproteomics workflows, with the ultimate goal to consolidate and standardize some of the approaches. At the same time, new metaproteomics wet lab and computational methods are continuously being developed to provide additional capabilities. We are confident that metaproteomics will continue to grow in its importance as a tool for the study of host-associated microorganisms.</p>

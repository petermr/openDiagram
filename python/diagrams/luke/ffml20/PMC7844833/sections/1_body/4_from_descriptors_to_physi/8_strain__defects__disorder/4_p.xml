<p>In addition to particle–adsorbates interactions, particle–support interactions and interactions with ligands can also have a pronounced effect on disorder, especially for small NPs. Anomalies due to particle–support interactions in the temperature-dependencies of the Debye–Waller factor for small supported Pt and PtSn NPs were investigated by Vila et al.

 </sup> On the other hand, a systematic increase in the structural disorder of Au NPs with increasing number of ligands was described in the study by Yancey et al., where the results of experimental EXAFS measurements were confirmed also by 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD modeling.

 </sup> Broadening of the Au–Au bond-length distribution in the presence of ligands was observed and reproduced by DFT modeling also by Behafarid et al. As expected, the ligand effect on particle-averaged characteristics was more pronounced for smaller NPs.

 </sup> Note here that the asymmetric shapes of the bond-length distributions, induced by particle-ligand or particle-support interactions observed in the aforementioned studies, were found to pose challenges for the conventional EXAFS data fitting approaches, and it was recently shown that more advanced data analysis methods may be required.

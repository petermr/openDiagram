<p>Sodium hexafluoro phosphate (1 M (NaPF
 <sub>6</sub>)) solution was prepared with propylene carbonate as solvent. The ability of electrolyte absorption (
 <italic>EA</italic>) capacity of the membrane of size 20 mm in diameter was calculated by weight before and after dipped into the electrolyte solution for 30 min. Later, the separator membrane was carried out and sponged with filter paper to remove the excess amount of liquid electrolyte. Then, the polymer membrane with absorbed electrolyte was weighed again to calculate the liquid electrolyte acceptance based on the following equation [

 <italic>Bw</italic> and 
 <italic>Aw</italic> are the weight of the membrane before and after dipped into electrolyte solution in (g), respectively. The sodium ionic conductivity (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the as-prepared separator membrane were analyzed using BCS-815/Electrochemical Analyzer (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 10 kHz. The ionic conduction test with wide range of temperature was performed for the separator membrane, which was sandwiched between stainless steel disks like the electrode with heating mantle set-up in Metrohm Auto lab systems. The ionic conductivity σ (s/cm) calculated of as prepared PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membrane was calculated using the following.

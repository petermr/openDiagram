0: The coding sequences of candidate  StbZIPs were retrieved from the Ensembl plant reference database of potato, and the SSRs were predicted using MISA ( http://pgrc.ipk103%20gatersleben.de/misa/) with criteria of a minimum length of six for dinucleotide repeats and five for trinucleotide repeats, tetranucleotide repeats, pentanucleotide repeats, and hexanucleotide repeats.
1: Mix type SSRs were considered disrupted by a non-repetitive repeats length of 100 base pair sequence.

<p id="Par3">In the past, extensive trial and error used up valuable machine time to find new process parameters. Nowadays simulation techniques such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) take on much of the burden by predicting the distribution of heat generation during the heat treatment and inform design decisions before the first test run is scheduled

 </sup>. In general, several simplifications and assumptions are always made when simulating a problem (not least of which are estimates of unknowns, such as surface emissivity or heat transfer coefficients) and any simulation needs to be verified in order to produce meaningful data

<p>Furthermore, protein expression differences between the two castes were validated at mRNA levels for 10 selected key node proteins in the network. Accordingly, proteins as transketolase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and lethal (2) 37 at 72 hours, phosphoglycerate mutase, glutathione S transferanse S1, ERp60, phosphoglycerate kinase and thioredoxin peroxidase 1 at 120 hours, and enolase and imaginal disc growth factor 4 and were chosen at both time points. Generally, the changes in mRNA abundance of the genes at 72 hours of the two castes were similar to that of the 2-DE data, except for the transcripts of thioredoxin peroxidase 1 and lethal (2) 37 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013455-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Among these genes, mRNA abundance of enolase, transketolase and imaginal disc growth factor 4 genes were increased in queen larvae, and aldehyde dehydrogenase were increased in worker larvae. Likewise, at 120 hours, mRNA quantification further validated the protein differential expression results in the two larvae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013455-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In summary, 7 genes; namely, enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, imaginal disc growth factor 4, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, ERp60 and glutathione S transferase S1, were constantly upregulated at both protein and mRNA levels in queen larvae. The discrepancy of thioredoxin peroxidase 1 and lethal (2) 37 in their mRNA and protein level at 72 hours, is most likely due to the lack of a direct relationship between mRNA and protein expression, and/or other regulatory mechanisms, such as lack of synchronization. These data provide transcriptional information complementary to the differentially expressed proteins detected by proteomics analysis.

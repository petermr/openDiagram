0: The root powder sample (5.0 g) was refluxed with 6 M HCl (50 mL) at 110 C for 24 h for protein hydrolysis.
1: Then the solution was kept in an evaporating dish to evaporate HCl on a water bath.
2: The residue was again dissolved in 20 mL 0.1 M HCl and evaporation was repeated twice to remove excess of the acid.
3: It was then filtered through Whatman No.
4: 1 filter paper with 0.1 M HCl in a volumetric flask which was known as a stock solution.
5: Again, the stock solution was filtered through 0.45 m syringe filter with pressure for amino acid analysis [ 16].
6: Then the stock and standard solutions were run through Shimadzu amino acid analyzer with a fluorescent detector.
7: The sample amino acids were identified by comparing with standard amino acids retention times and calculated the percentage of their individual areas.

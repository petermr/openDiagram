<p>Library generation and sequencing was performed in the DNA technology &amp; Expression Analysis Core Laboratory at the University of California Davis. Barcoded 3â€™ Tag-Seq libraries were prepared using the QuantSeq FWD kit (Lexogen, Vienna, Austria) for multiplexed sequencing according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The fragment size distribution of the libraries was verified via micro-capillary gel-electrophoresis on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The libraries were quantified by fluorometry on a Qubit instrument (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA), and pooled in equimolar ratios. Forty eight libraries were sequenced per lane on a HiSeq 4000 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with single-end 100 bp reads. The sequencing generated more than 3 million reads per library.</p>

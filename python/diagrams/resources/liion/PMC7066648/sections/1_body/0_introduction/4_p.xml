<p>Herein, we adopted a simple and facile process of dipping-drying to fabricate the yarn-shaped LIB with the cathode and anode materials coated onto the highly conductive and flexible stainless-steel yarns (SSYs) which act as the current collectors. The assembled 7 cm-long yarn-shaped LIB eliminates the safety concerns, is capable of outputting a capacity of 0.45 mA h with bending deformation, and maintains a capacity retention rate as high as 54.2% after 50 cycles.</p>

<p>In endothelial cells regulated by PC-3M cells, the significantly changed KEGG pathways in which the upregulated mRNAs were enriched mainly included metabolic pathways, DNA replication, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and mismatch repair (

The alterative KEGG pathways associated with the downregulated mRNAs in endothelial cells included the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, acute myeloid leukemia, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and complement and coagulation cascades (

<p>The 131 candidate genes were priority ranked based on their annotations and networks through ToppGene software so that we could dive deep into the biological function and interrelation of these candidate genes identified by single gene testing. Because the candidate gene mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (
 <italic>MAVS</italic>) was included in the training gene set, it was automatically excluded from the priority analysis. The ranked result (Table S3) showed that the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (
 <italic>NOD2</italic>) gene had the highest priority, followed by unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (
 <italic>ULK1</italic>), interleukin-10 (
 <italic>IL-10</italic>) and bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (
 <italic>BST2</italic>) etc.

<p>The electrochemical performance of the gel electrolyte is scrutinized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The typical Nyquist plots are composed of one semicircle in a high-frequency range and a straight line in a low-frequency range. The radius of the semicircle in the high-frequency region represents the impedance of the electrode, namely, the impedance of lithium ions between the electrode and the electrolyte interface in this work. The slope of the linear line in the low-frequency region represents the ease of lithium-ion diffusion: the steeper the slope of the line is, the easier the lithium-ion diffusion is.

 </sup> When comparing the high-frequency semicircle of the gel electrolytes, it is clear that the radius of the gel electrolyte stored for 1 h (296 Ω) is much smaller than that of the one after 24 h of storage (5782 Ω), implying rapid electron transport and low charge transport resistance of the newly prepared gel electrolyte.

 </sup> Moreover, the performance of the prepared gel electrolyte is time-sensitive, possibly because of the volatilization of the plasticizer (EC/PC) over time. Typically plasticizers play a multitude of roles in the gel electrolyte such as reducing the crystallinity of the polymer and the activation energy of ion transport, increasing the mobility of the polymer segment and the concentration of free ions, promoting the dissociation of lithium salts, and so forth.

 </sup> Thus, retaining the maximum plasticizer content is the key to obtain the best electrochemical performance of the yarn-shaped LIB.

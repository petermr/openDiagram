<p>Additive manufacturing was carried out with a gas metal arc welding process. Therefore, a welding power source of the type Alpha Q 552 Puls (EWM AG, Mündersbach, Germany) and a water-cooled welding torch WH W 500 (Alexander Binzel Schweißtechnik GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Buseck, Germany) was used. The reproducible guidance of the welding torch was realized by a 6-axis industrial robot KR15-2 (KUKA AG, Augsburg, Germany). The GMAW process was carried out in short arc welding regime throughout the present case study. During WAAM, a temperature controlled strategy with flexible dwell time was implemented. Therefore, the welded layers were naturally cooling to 100 °C before the next layer was applied. The process was monitored with IR-camera of the type ImageR 8320 (InfraTec GmbH, Dresden, Germany). This strategy prevents excessive heat input and heat accumulation in the structure and enables comparable cooling conditions for the analysis of microstructural evolution. Therefore, cooling rates were simultaneously recorded by IR-camera in the range between 900 and 400 °C with a frequency of 50 Hz. The camera was positioned horizontally to the manufactured wall structures with a distance of 600 mm. The analysis of cooling rates was carried out with the software IRBIS 3 plus (InfraTec GmbH, Dresden, Germany). The experimental setup is shown in

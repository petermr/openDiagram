<p id="Par42">The graph learning-based dimensionality reduction analysis was performed to visualize the distribution of immune subtypes across individual patients using the reduce Dimension function of Monocle package with a Gaussian distribution. The maximum number of components was set to 4, and the discriminative dimensionality reduction with trees was used. Finally, the immune landscape was visualized with the function plot cell trajectory with color-coded immune subtypes.</p>

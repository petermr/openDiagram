<p>Given that bacterial toxins induce histone H3 dephosphorylation on Serine 10 during early infection and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we examined whether PirB from VP
 <sub>AHPND</sub> could also cause the dephosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser 10). Thus, primary hemocytes were treated with endotoxin-free His-rPirB or His-rPirA proteins for 2Â h before being lysed and the phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10) analyzed by Western blot. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>, in the His-rPirB-treated samples, histone H3 (Ser10) was dephosphorylated compared with control (untreated and His-rPirA treated). The dephosphorylation was, however, not dependent on the concentration of PirB. These results suggest that the apoptosis induced by PirB protein in hemocytes could result from the dephosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser 10) through interaction between PirB protein and histones.

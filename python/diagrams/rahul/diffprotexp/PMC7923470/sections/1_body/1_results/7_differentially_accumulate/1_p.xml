<p id="Par51">We also studied the WT and MT banana pseudostem metabolome to understand the role of metabolites in stem elongation. In total, we detected 412 metabolites. These detected metabolites could be grouped into 10 major classes (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>). For the evaluation of differences in metabolite ion intensity between WT and MT, we applied the PLS-DA model. The established PLS-DA model showed good fitness (Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Forty-eight metabolites were differentially accumulated in WT vs MT Aifen no. 1 banana pseudostem (Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>; Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Seventeen metabolites belonging to six classes i.e. amino acid and its derivatives (1), flavonoids (5), lignans and coumarins (4), organic acids (1), phenolic acids (3), and others (3), were higher in MT. The down-accumulated metabolites belonged to class alkaloids, amino acid and its derivatives, flavonoids, lignans and coumarins, lipids, nucleotide and its derivatives, organic acids, phenolic acids, tannins, terpenes, and others. The hierarchical clustering clearly differentiated the metabolites (Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The top-10 down-accumulated metabolites in MT were Asiatic acid (pmn001708), hydroxyanigorufone (XJ420P5484), cimidahurinine (pmn001553), coumarin (mws1012), isochlorogenic acid C (pmn001384), lumazine (mws1641), fer-agmatine (GQ512003), N-phenylacetylglycine (pme2743), 3-hydroxy-4-isopropylbenzylalcohol 3-glucoside (pmn001690), and plantainoside A (pmn001409). The top-10 up-regulated metabolites in MT were D-Xylonic acid lithium salt (mws0344), scutellarin (pmp000012), pinoresinol-hex (Qingke_Rfmb257-der01–3), pinoresinol-aceGlu (Qingke_Rfmb257-der14–2), tricin O-saccharic acid (pmb3041), terpineol monoglucoside (pmn001378), inositol (pme0516), tricin 5-O-hexoside (pmb3042), sudachiin B (pmp001081), and sudachiin C (pmp001082) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). We further functionally annotated the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in KEGG database and found that the most significantly enriched pathways were phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and tyrosine metabolism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).

0: A comprehensive understanding of the individual response to infection is necessary to develop effective and targeted therapies.
1: Additionally, biomarkers that predict outcome may be useful to guide patient management.
2: Evaluation of the entire transcriptome of cells offers both the possibilities of characterizing pathways activated in disease and identifying potential biomarkers.
3: In murine melioidosis, blood transcriptomic profiling reveals the regulation of many immune pathways, which reflect severity of disease [ 6] and can be used to identify a potential marker of acute lung infection [ 7] .
4: Transcriptomic changes have been reported in human melioidosis during acute infection, highlighting the involvement of host immunity against infection [ 8].
5: Recent studies based on microarrays showed that blood transcriptional profiles can distinguish  B. pseudomallei infection from sepsis caused by other microorganisms [ 9, 10].
6: These studies suggest that these transcriptomic profiles may be useful in understanding the immune response during infection and serve as informative biomarkers of infection.
7: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a unbiased approach and powerful tool to define the transcriptome [ 11].
8: However, to date, RNA-seq has not been used extensively to characterize human melioidosis.
9: The aims of this study were to use RNA-seq (i) to analyze whole blood transcriptomic profiles of acute melioidosis patients to define biological pathways associated with death, and (ii) to identify host prognostic gene biomarkers that are associated with mortality.

<p id="Par40">The anther was first ground in liquid nitrogen. The powder was transferred to a 5 mL centrifuge tube and sonicated three times on ice using a high-intensity ultrasonic processor (Sanchez-Puerto et al., 2015) in lysis buffer (containing 1% TritonX-100, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail, 50 μM PR-619, 3 μM TSA, 50 mM NAM, and 2 mM EDTA). Equal volume of trisaturated phenol (ph 8.0) was added, and then the mixture was further rotated for 5 min. After centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min, 5000×g), the upper phenol phase was transferred to a new centrifuge tube. Proteins were precipitated by adding at least four volumes of ammonium sulfate-saturated methanol, followed by incubation at − 20 °C for at least 6 h. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded. The remaining precipitate was washed once with ice-cold methanol and then with ice-cold acetone three times. Re-dissolve the protein in 8 M urea and use the BCA kit to determine the protein concentration according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

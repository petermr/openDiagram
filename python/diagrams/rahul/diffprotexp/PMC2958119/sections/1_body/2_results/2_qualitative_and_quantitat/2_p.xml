<p>From a qualitative perspective, the two larvae casts were compared based on the upregulated number of proteins at both developmental time-points. To do so, protein spots appeared on the gel with different numbers, but finally were confirmed as a single protein and were considered only one time. This is most likely due to the occurrence of some post-translational modifications (PTMs) for some proteins, such as phosphorylation and possibly alternative splicing or proteolysis that results in the shifting of 
 <italic>M</italic>r and p
 <italic>I</italic> of these proteins. Hence, 18 and 22 individual protein spots were recognized as upregulated at 72 and 120 hours, respectively in both larvae. Out of the upregulated proteins at 72 hours, both queen and worker larvae upregulated the same 11 individual proteins. From the 11 proteins in queen larvae, 5 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production (enolase spots 20, aldehyde reductase, spot 22, phosphoglycerate mutase, spot 23, Bellwether, spot 25 and transketolase, spot 27), 2 for metabolizing fatty acids and amino acids (long-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase, spot 21 and proteasome subunit alpha type 5, spot 16), 1 in development (imaginal disc growth factor 4, spots 24, 26), 1 for antioxidation (thioredoxin peroxidase 1, spot, 18), 1 for protein folding (heat shock protein 8, spot 19) and 1 protein of unknown function (GE14749, spot 17) (

Meanwhile, out of the 11 worker larvae upregulated proteins, 4 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production (aldehyde dehydrogenase, spots 6 and 13 and ATP synthase beta subunit, spot 3, phosphoglycerate mutase, spot 12, Bellwether, spot 11), 1 in fatty acid metabolism (fatty acid binding protein, spot 4), 2 antioxidant protein (peroxiredoxin 2540, spot 9, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, spots 5, 8, 14), 2 for development (14-3-3 protein epsilon, spot 2 and lethal (2) 37, spot 10) 1 in protein folding (heat shock protein 8, spot 7) and 1 in transcription/translation (translational controlled tumor protein spot 1, 15) (

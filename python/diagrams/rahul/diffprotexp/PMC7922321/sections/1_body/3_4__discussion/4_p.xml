<p>Although more physiologically relevant non-tumor controls are required to fine-tune the results in the future, this is a proof of concept study that shows that expression levels of ETS genes can be used as diagnostic markers for glioma grade identification, in addition to already existing molecular markers. In addition, the gene regulatory network analysis for ETS regulons can be used to identify target gene clusters in positively and negatively regulated pathways and processes, which can help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional redundancy among family members. We propose that such network analysis can also be extended to differentiate stages of tumorigenesis in other types of tumors, as well as to developmental stages of various tissues.</p>

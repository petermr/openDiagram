<p>A 2D-DIGE experiment was performed using four independent biological replicates per treatment (Control: n = 4; AAS: n = 4). Before AAS exposure, cells were grown in steroid-free serum (Hyclone Waltham, MA) during the log-phase growth (70–80% confluency). Thereafter, four (4) samples were treated with a supraphysiological dose of the AAS, 17α-methyltestosterone (17α-meT: 1 μM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 48 h as previously described [

<p>The workflow diagram of our study was presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. The mean ribose nucleic acid (RNA) expressions of BDNF in 157 HD cases (-0.12 ± 0.20) were significantly lower than that of 157 non-dementia controls (0.16 ± 0.23; P &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). After the removal of repetitive and unannotated genes, 19,414 background genes were included for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis. Significant changes in the expression of 2,294 genes (1,221 up-regulated and 1,037 down-regulated) were identified in HD versus non-dementia controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>); whilst 2,173 DEGs (1,028 up-regulated and 1,145 down-regulated) were determined in BDNF-low versus high group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thereafter, 1,675 overlapping DEGs were included between HD / control and BDNF-low / high cohorts. Heatmap of cluster analysis showed that the expression of the top 25 down-regulated and up-regulated DEGs distinguished HD from control samples (

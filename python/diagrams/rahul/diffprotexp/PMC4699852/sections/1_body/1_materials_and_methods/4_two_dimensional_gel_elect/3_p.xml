<p>Protein spots of interest were sliced from silver-stained gels followed by in-gel digestion. The resultant digested peptide samples were subjected to MALDI MS and MS/MS analysis. For protein identification, MS results of peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and peptide fragment fingerprinting (PPF) were searched against the NCBI database using the Mascot program [

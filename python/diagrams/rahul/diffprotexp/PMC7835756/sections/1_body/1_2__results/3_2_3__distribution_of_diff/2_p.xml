<p>In total, 9432 DmCs were found, among which 4765 were hyper-methylated, and 4667 were hypomethylated. The higher proportion of DmCs was identified in the CG context, and the lower sites were observed in the CHH context (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). The latter was consistent with the global distribution of DNA methylation patterns of tobacco plants. However, the DmCs distribution in different genomic elements (genes, promoters, introns, intergenic regions, and transposable elements) was variable in each context (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f004">Figure 4</xref>Aâ€“F). The intergenic regions were the most enriched element with methylation in almost all contexts, except by the hypermethylated CHG and CHH contexts. In the CG context, the intergenic regions methylation was 91.34% and 92.5% for hyper and hypomethylated DmCs, respectively. In the case of the hypomethylated DmCs in CHG and CHH on intergenic regions were 69.8% and 79.3%. The intron regions were significantly abundant in the hypermethylated DmCs in CHG and CHH contexts, with 43.63% and 52%, respectively.

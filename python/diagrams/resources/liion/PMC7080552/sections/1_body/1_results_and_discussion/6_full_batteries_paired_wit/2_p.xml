<p>To explore the practical application of the Li–B–Mg composite, coin‐type full battery using commercial LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> as cathode was assembled. The full battery employed carbonate‐based electrolyte and its voltage profiles within the voltage range of 3.0–4.2 V at different cycles are presented in

 </xref>a. Under the current density of 0.5 C (1 C = 274 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>), LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>|Li–B–Mg full battery displays a discharge specific capacity of 134.7 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> with a distinct voltage plateaus at ≈3.9 V in the first cycle. In the subsequent cycles, the voltage plateau remains unchanged. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b compares the cycling stability of the batteries assembled respectively with the Li–B–Mg composite and pure Li anodes at 0.5 C. The initial discharge specific capacity of the LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>|Li full battery approximates to that of the LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>|Li–B–Mg full battery (134.3 vs 134.7 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>). However, the LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>|Li full battery decays quickly during the 100 cycles while the LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>|Li–B–Mg full battery exhibits a much longer cycling life (250 cycles with a capacity retention of 77.3%). The pouch‐type battery was also assembled to test the practical performance of the Li–B–Mg composite. Its first discharge capacity is 67.657 mA h (≈6 mA h cm
 <sup>−2</sup>). In addition, the pouch‐type battery demonstrates a similar charge–discharge curve to that of the coin‐type battery (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c) and a very stable cycling over 35 cycles is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d. Meanwhile, its Coulombic efficiency maintains over 99.7%, verifying its feasibility for practical application.

<p>Raw data files produced in Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific) were processed in Proteome Discoverer V1.3 (Thermo Scientific) and searched using Mascot against the WB C6 (ATCC 50 803), V5.0, genome release obtained from GiardiaDB.org [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Parameters and modifications were as follows: MS tolerance was set to ±10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.1 Da, 1 missed cleavage was allowed; static modifications were set for carbamidomethylation of cysteines, while variable modifications were set to TMT 10-plex modification of peptide N-termini and lysine residues, methionine oxidation, and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. Search results only included peptides with a score &gt;15 and below the Mascot significance threshold filter of 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05. False discovery rate (FDR) was set for 1%. Protein grouping for homologous peptide identification was enabled such that protein identifications were based of peptides with amino acid sequences equal to or contained within the sequence of more than 1 protein; the 2 proteins were grouped together in a single protein group. The MS raw data files, database search results, and TMT ratios have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD007183.

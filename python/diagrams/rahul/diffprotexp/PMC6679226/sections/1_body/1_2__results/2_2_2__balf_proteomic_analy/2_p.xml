 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f002">Figure 2</xref>B showed the top-10 enriched canonical signaling pathways revealed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) following I.T. and I.P. LPS challenges compared to the control group. Acute-phase response signaling was activated by both I.T. and I.P. LPS; however, the magnitude of activation is much greater in I.T. LPS group with a z-score of 3.0 compared to the I.P. LPS group with a z-score of 0.71 (

<p>In our study, we preliminarily found that the vagus nerve plays a vital role in mediating anti-inflammatory effects via CAP-mediated regulation of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation in the early stage of VMC. Vagotomy increased the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells and decreased the percentages of Th2 and Treg cells in the spleen. Those effects possibly changed the levels of specific transcription factors of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in the myocardium, increased the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, expanded inflammatory infiltration and myocardial lesions in the acute and subacute phases of the viral myocarditis model. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation was related to JAK2-STAT3 and NF-ÎºB signal transduction pathways. Additionally, cholinergic stimulation with pnu282987 treatment also exerted anti-inflammatory effects, regardless of the integrity of the vagus nerve. This study provides a new clue for understanding the role of vagus nerve during viral myocarditis progression, unveiling potential new target in the therapy against CVB3-induced myocarditis.

<p id="Par46">Higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) and somatic mutation rates are correlated to stronger anti-cancer immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, we calculated the TMB and mutations in each patient using the mutect2-processed mutation dataset of TCGA, and analyzed the same in all immune subtypes. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, IS4 and IS5 showed significantly higher TMB compared to IS1, IS2 and IS3. Similar trends were seen with the number of mutated genes as well

<p>At the same time, several studies emphasized the role of Fe species in Co–Fe oxide catalysts, reporting that CoOOH-like structural motifs were only needed to ensure sufficient electrical conductivity. An

 </sub> catalysts revealed that despite the clear differences observed in the catalytic activity, the Co K-edge XAFS spectra for materials with and without Fe were almost identical. At the same time, the Fe–O coordination number showed a correlation with the catalyst activity, with catalysts with a lower Fe–O CN exhibiting higher activity, suggesting the importance of undercoordinated Fe-based structural motifs for the catalyst working mechanism.

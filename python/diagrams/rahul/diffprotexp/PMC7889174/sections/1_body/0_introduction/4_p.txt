0: The nucleus is an endomembrane compartment with deep evolutionary connections to other endomembranes.
1: In particular, nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins and vesicle coat proteins mediating endocytosis, post-Golgi transport, ER-exit and flagellar assembly all have a common origin (reviewed in [ 14]).
2: Despite significant variation in composition, the secondary structure of many NPC and coat proteins is well conserved [ 14], compelling evidence that the endomembrane system, and hence the great majority of the internal structure of the eukaryotic cell was well developed prior to the radiation of eukaryotes from the LECA ( Figure 2).
3: However, the details of several relevant events leading up to the LECA remain unresolved, including the relative sequential order of the origin of the nucleus and of the mitochondria [ 15, 16].
4: For example, we have argued that the NPC, in its current configuration, likely emerged late in eukaryogenesis, although this does not preclude an earlier origin for the nuclear envelope in some form [ 17].

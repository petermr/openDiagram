 </sup> analyzed gene expression datasets to construct a risk map of tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> expression. Our analysis further examined the gene expression of critical SARS-CoV-2 entry factors that have been confirmed thus far, including 
 <italic>ACE2, TMPRSS2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic>, across 20 normal tissues. Our data support the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts as possible routes more susceptible to viral infection compared to other tissues (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Expression of these entry factors in gastrointestinal tissues, including the esophageal upper epithelial and gland cells as well as intestinal epithelial cells such as absorptive enterocytes of the ileum and colon, have similarly been corroborated by other groups

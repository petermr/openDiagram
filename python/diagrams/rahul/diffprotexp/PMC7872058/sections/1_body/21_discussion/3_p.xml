<p>A clear pathological hallmark of IPA is the pulmonary involvement which makes the BAL fluid examination a widely used procedure for the evaluation of patients with suspected aspergillosis. For instance, the detection of galactomannan, a polysaccharide present in the cell wall of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, in BAL fluids, has been advocated as a sensitive test for diagnosing IPA (26). In this study, we identified a specific role of sTREM1 in the clinical presentation of IPA. Patients with IPA had significantly higher levels of sTREM1 in BAL fluids when compared to control patients. Higher sTREM1 levels were also correlated with higher values of galactomannan. We could discard this finding as attributable to a general response to infection since events of viral, bacterial, and other fungi were diagnosed within the control group (

Considering the specific expression of TREM1 in the lung, we could suggest that the use of TREM1 alone or in combination with other biomarkers present in respiratory samples could improve our capacity to anticipate a more accurate diagnosis for IPA.

Regulon activity scores were calculated from TNI by using a two-tailed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm built-in RTN package and visualized as a heatmap. To construct an edge-weighted gene regulatory network mediated with ETS members (Regulons), transcriptional regulatory networks from TNI and differentially expressed genes were integrated by a transcriptional regulatory analysis (TNA) algorithm with two-tailed GSEA. A gene regulatory network of ETS members was constructed by using significant network interaction from TNA (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the constructed network was filtered with the intersection of DEGs and previous microarray studies (Elk-1-VP16 and PEA3-VP16 overexpression studies). The final GNR was visualized by using Cytoscape software [

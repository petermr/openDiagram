<p>The model also considers the effect of the interfacial energy of the dispersoid particles in the AlZnMg alloys on the nucleation rate. To this end, we first consider that the interfaces of Al
 <sub>3</sub>Zr and Al
 <sub>6</sub>(Mn,Fe) are known to be semi-coherent with the matrix, whilst the Cr-containing dispersoids are generally considered to be incoherent. The difference in interfacial energy between a semi-coherent precipitate (misfit ~1%) and an incoherent interface is typically a factor of about three to eight [
 <xref rid="B220-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. In line with this, we take the efficiency of Cr-containing dispersoids in nucleating the Î·-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub> precipitates to be a factor of five larger than that of the semi-coherent precipitates. This assumption has no noticeable effect on the accuracy of the model for the present alloys, since nucleation of quenched-in precipitates is dominated by Al
 <sub>3</sub>Zr dispersoids, grain/subgrain boundaries, and, to a lesser extent, Mn-containing dispersoids. However, it would influence the accuracy of prediction for data on Cr-containing alloys.

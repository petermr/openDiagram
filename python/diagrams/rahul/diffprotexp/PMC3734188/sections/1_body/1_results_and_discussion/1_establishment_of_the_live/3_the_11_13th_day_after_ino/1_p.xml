<p>It was shown by the preliminary study that metastasis induced liver damage and made more intracellular proteins released into the perfusates of metastasized livers. These proteins were more readily identified as differentially expressed proteins by proteomic analysis. In order to discover candidate biomarkers related to liver metastasis, we tried to reduce the effect of metastasis-induced liver damage. So serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were applied to monitor the damage and to find a time-point when the damage recovered to the normal control level. In FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, ALT levels increased to the maximum level on the 6th day after inoculation and returned to the control level on the 12th day. Therefore, to discover more candidate biomarkers related to metastasis, the period from the 11-13th day was selected as the time-point for perfusion.

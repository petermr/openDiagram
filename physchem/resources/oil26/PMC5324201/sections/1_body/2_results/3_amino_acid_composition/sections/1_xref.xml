<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. In the present study, twelve amino acids were identified with an injection time of 35&#160;min. Glutamic acid, lysine and glycine were found the most predominant amino acids in the analysed sample. The non-essential amino acid contained the higher amino acid content in comparison to the essential and neutral amino acids. Lysine was the highest essential amino acid out of seven essential amino acids. The total basic amino acid is greater than that of total acidic amino acid. The percentage of essential amino acids of the total amino acid was 45.90 whereas, total amount of sulphur containing amino acid was 5.49&#160;g/100&#160;g protein. On the other hand, only tyrosine was found as an aromatic amino acid in the current study. The standard and sample amino acids chromatograms are shown in additional files (Additional file

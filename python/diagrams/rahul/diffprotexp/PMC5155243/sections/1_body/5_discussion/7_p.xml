<p>In summary, the levels of SOD, ETHE1, and ACY-3 significantly decreased after DU exposure, and this phenomenon was more prominent in MT−/− mice. These results suggested that these proteins might be involved in the process of DU-induced nephrotoxicity, and MT might reduce kidney injury to some extent through altering the concentrations of these proteins. Furthermore, ETHE1 could represent a new DU toxicity-sensitive protein and is associated with DU-induced cell apoptosis. This study provides new targets for the prevention and treatment of DU toxicity.</p>

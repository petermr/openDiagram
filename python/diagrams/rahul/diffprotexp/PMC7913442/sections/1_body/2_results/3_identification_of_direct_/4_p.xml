<p id="Par36">When comparing the fraction of genes with differential peaks in each category, we found that in the upregulated DEGs, Cat_2 and Cat_3, which had discordant effect with respect to the vector, had the highest enrichment (Fisher’s exact test, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, odds ratios = 3.1 and 6.5, and p = 8 × 10
 <sup>–25</sup> and 7.3 × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> respectively), while Cat_1, which had concordant effect with respect to the vector, was not significantly enriched for differential peaks (OR = 1.7, p = 0.091). These data suggest that the more dramatic changes in expression were more likely to be due to alteration of FOXL2 binding due to the gain-of-function mutation. For the down-regulated DEGs categories (Cat 4 to 6) we did not observe the same enrichment patterns, perhaps due to the smaller number of genes, or more complex mechanisms leading to gene repression.

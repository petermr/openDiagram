<p>In addition to methylation, phosphorylation and acetylation of histones also play essential roles in pathogenic bacteriaâ€™s ability to invade host cells to cause apoptosis [

 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser 10) is the most common histone modification induced by pathogens. It has been shown that 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection promotes histone H3 (Ser 10) dephosphorylation [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which has also been observed after treatment of epithelial cells with purified bacterial toxins such as PLY of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the current study, the treatment of shrimp hemocytes with PirB also resulted in the dephosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser 10) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>). We believe that when PirB enters hemocytes, it interacts with histones, thereby affecting the phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser 10) and inducing apoptosis. In spite of this, the mechanisms involved when changes in histone H3 (Ser 10) phosphorylation triggers apoptosis-related pathways that affect nucleosome assembly, and the resultant nuclear damage or other biological response remains an open question.

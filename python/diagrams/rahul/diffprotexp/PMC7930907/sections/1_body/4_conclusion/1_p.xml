<p>In conclusion, similar to SAT, PAT, and EAT, functional differences were found among SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs in our study. The possible metabolic pathways of these functional differences were found using both transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, and our data provide a theoretical basis for future studies.</p>

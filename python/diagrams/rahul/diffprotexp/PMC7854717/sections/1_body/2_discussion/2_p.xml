For instance, owing that atrial myocytes lack transverse tubules and have more abundant corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum, local Ca

If proved by further functional analysis, the opposite correlations of ICT genes with the one encoding the major protein responsible for contraction of thin filament in cardiac sarcomere may have important applications in the differential treatment of atrial and ventricular cardiomyopathies.

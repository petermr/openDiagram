<p id="Par10">A line of Vickers hardness measurements was taken along the same centreline as the micrographs, using a Qness Q10A+ Vickers hardness tester. A measuring load of 1 kgf (HV1) was set to allow for close placement of indentations. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the hardness as a function of depth projected over a phase fraction analysis which was performed on the micrographs shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The hardness gradient is an amalgamation of not only the phase transition, but other influences such as grain size and phase structure. While discerning the exact influences of each effect would go beyond the scope of this report, the hardness is representative of the continuously varying microstructure in the hardened zone. This variation is due to the transformation from ferrite-pearlite to austenite (and later, during quenching, to martensite) by the heat input of the temperature field during the performed inductive surface hardening. Thus the plateau at the end of the hardness gradient corroborates the depth of the Ac
 <sub>1b</sub> temperature determined through micrograph analysis.

<p id="Par21">HGrC1 cells were kindly provided by Drs. T. Nakamura and A. Iwase, and their properties and derivation described earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Notably, these cells bear two normal alleles of the FOXL2 gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Cells were cultured in a standard incubator at 37 °C in DMEM-F12 medium (catalog #12,400–024, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) complemented with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and 10% FBS (#F6178, Sigma-Aldrich). HGrC1 cells at passage 14 were used for all the experiments in this study. HGrC1 cells seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well). Medium was replaced after 24 h with serum-free DMEM-F12 (complemented with antibiotics), and transfection was performed using the above described plasmids for 4 h with Lipofectamine 3000 reagents (catalog #L3000008, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s procedures. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with new serum free DMEM-F12 and transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h.

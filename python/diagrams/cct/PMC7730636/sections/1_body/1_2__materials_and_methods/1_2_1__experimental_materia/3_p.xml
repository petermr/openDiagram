<p>Microstructure of investigated AISI 4340 steel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) was analyzed with using of light microscope Neophot 32 (ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany) as well as SEM microscope Tescan Vega (Tescan, Brno, Czech Republic) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The samples were etched by Nital (3% solution of nitric acid in ethanol). The microstructure of the supplied material is made of tempered martensite, bainite and fine secondary carbides, which are spherical in shape. The final structure is coarse-grained and relatively heterogeneous. The microstructure evaluated corresponds to the state after quenching and tempering of thick-walled Cr-Ni-Mo-V steels.

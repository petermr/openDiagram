<p id="Par22">To have tissue genome-scale information, we identified specific co-expression differences between CON and RES groups based on DGCA and DK analyses. We identified hub genes with important biological roles. Furthermore, we found a gain of connectivity in the networks from fetuses from the RES dams. The rewiring of major regulators likely modulates the expression of gene targets as an adaptive response to nutrient availability, impacting tissue development. These findings are supported by the DGCA results that showed TFs differentially coordinating gene transcription between the groups. For example, we found transcriptional repressors in muscle, such as 
 <italic>ZBTB33</italic>, 
 <italic>REST</italic>, and 
 <italic>RCOR3</italic>, more connected in the RES network. Likewise, we identified 
 <italic>ARID2,</italic> whose protein is involved with chromatin remodeling that is important for metabolic programming

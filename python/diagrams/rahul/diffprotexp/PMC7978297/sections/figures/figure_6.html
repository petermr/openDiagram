 <caption> DEHP devastated TGF-beta signal between germ cells and granulosa cells and further impaired follicular assembly. (A) UMAP plot of separated germ cell and granulosa cell subpopulations. (B) Dot plot of components of TGF-beta signal (including signal factors, receptors, target genes, and effectors) between germ cells and granulosa cells. (C) Components of TGF-beta signal between sample groups in germ cells (left) and granulosa cells (right). (D) Histological section staining of MVH (red) and GDF9 (green) with and without DEHP treatment at PD3. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar = 20 μm. (E) Detection of MVH, GDF9, and LHX8 protein levels at PD3 with and without DEHP exposure. MVH was used as a loading control to calculate relative protein levels of GDF9 and LHX8. Data are shown as mean ± SD (N represents independent repeats). * P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.01. </caption>

<p id="Par20">The validation of synthesis of half and full generation dendrimers was determined by UV–Vis as well as FTIR spectroscopy. For the differentiation among half and full generation of dendrimer, 0.1% w/v dendrimers solution was stirred with freshly prepared 1% w/v aqueous solution of copper sulphate. To investigate the structural changes in dendrimer, FTIR spectroscopy was used. The samples were prepared in the form of KBr pellet method. It was subjected to 32 scans and scanning ranges from 4000–400 cm

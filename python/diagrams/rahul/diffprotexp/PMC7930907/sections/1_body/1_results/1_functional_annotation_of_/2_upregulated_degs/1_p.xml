<p>Specifically, the upregulated DEGs show different enrichment in pathway maps: regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization by the kinase effectors of Rho GTPases in common DEGs, role of neuregulin 1 and thymosin beta-4 in myocardium regeneration after infarction in PASCs, and transition and termination of DNA replication in EASCs. Gene Ontology (GO) process enrichment analyses show the common DEGs are most relevant to actin cytoskeleton organization, the PASCs are strongly associated with supramolecular fiber organization, and the EASCs are most enriched in the mitotic cell cycle. In addition, actin filaments in common DEGs, integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion in PASCs, and mitosis in EASCs were seen in process networks (

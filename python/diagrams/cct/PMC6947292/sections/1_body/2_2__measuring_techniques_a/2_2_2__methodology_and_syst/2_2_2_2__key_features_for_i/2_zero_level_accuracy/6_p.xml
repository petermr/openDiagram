<p>Even if all of the abovementioned aspects are ensured, the zero level of the resulting specific excess heat capacity may still show a slight curvature, and this is slightly different for each experiment [
 <xref rid="B75-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. This may be caused by slight differences in the sample position for each individual measurement, for instance [
 <xref rid="B125-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Thus, the raw DSC data must undergo a sophisticated data treatment prior to evaluation, including baseline subtraction in each case, and possibly also the elimination of the remaining zero-level curvature [
 <xref rid="B120-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] or a mean value curve calculation [
 <xref rid="B122-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>,
 <xref rid="B123-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>,
 <xref rid="B127-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. If efforts are made to ensure the best zero level quality, a result that is straight and close to zero can be achieved. In heating experiments, this allows us to judge whether exo- or endothermic reactions predominate at a certain temperature or time [

 <xref rid="B120-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. In addition, the zero level can act as an integration reference for enthalpy calculations [

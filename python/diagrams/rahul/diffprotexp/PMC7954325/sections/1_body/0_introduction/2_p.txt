0: In the current study, we mined and functionally annotated the basic leucine zipper family (bZIP) of TFs in potato using its genome information and previous annotation [ 9 11].
1: Generally, the bZIP proteins contain an essential region that consists of a DNA-binding part and a leucine zipper dimerization motif [ 9 12].
2: Structurally, the bZIP family is highly conserved among the species with signature sequences of the domains (6080 amino acids long).
3: These bZIPs can be subdivided further into two essential parts depending on their structure: the basic region and the leucine zipper region.
4: The basic region has an invariant motif N-X7-R / K-X9, which links nuclear localization to the target DNA [ 10,  12].
5: The leucine zipper region consists of Leu heptad repeats, and often with Ile, Val, Phe, or Met [ 9 12].
6: Recent findings of bZIP TFs in specific plant families have shown that they are involved in diverse biological roles in plant physiology [ 13 16].
7: The functions of bZIP TFs are well characterized in various plants during stress conditions, such as salt, heat, and hormone signaling [ 16 20].
8: To date, genome-wide analysis has led to the identification of the  bZIP gene family in several plants, including 75 in  Arabidopsis thaliana (AtbZIPs), 89 in  Oryza sativa ( OsbZIPs), 160 in  Glycine max ( GmbZIPs), 166 in  Sorghum bicolor ( SbbZIPs), 125 in  Zea mays ( ZmbZIPs), 136 in  Brassica napus ( BrbZIPs), and 370 in  Triticum aestivum ( TabZIPs), and 41 in  Ipomoea trifida [ 10,  11,  21 23,  25,  26].
9: Recently, 65  bZIPs were identified in the potato genome using a single database source viz.
10: Spud DB [ 9].
11: In our current study, we used the previous genome sequence databases available in SpudDB [ 27] as well as the latest genome assembly in the Ensembl plants database ( http://plants.ensembl.org/Solanum_tuberosum) of potato for a comprehensive investigation of the  StbZIP family that includes transcripts and genes.
12: The present work led to the identification of 25 more  bZIPs at the genome-wide scale.

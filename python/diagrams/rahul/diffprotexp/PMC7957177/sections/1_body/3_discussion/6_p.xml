<p>During the progression of cervical cancer, other up‐regulated genes, such as CRISP3 (gene ID: 10321) belongs to the family of cysteine‐rich secreted proteins (CRSP), which is involved in the defense response against foreign material damage and the natural immune response of the reproductive system. CRISP3 has been found to be a prominent marker of prostate cancer gene expression,

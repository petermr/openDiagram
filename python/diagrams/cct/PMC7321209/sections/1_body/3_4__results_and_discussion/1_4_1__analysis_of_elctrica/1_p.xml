<p>In the first step, electrical properties were analyzed during WAAM with a short arc welding regime to characterize the stability of the arc and short arc frequency. Welding voltage and current were measured with a rate of 1000 Hz for GMAW processes with varied CTWD from 12 to 52 mm. The following

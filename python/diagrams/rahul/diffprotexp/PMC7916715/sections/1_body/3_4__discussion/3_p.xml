<p>The leading proportion of the enriched CREIGHTON_ENDOCRINE_THERAPY_RESISTANCE_3 gene set robustly predicts PC relapse risk in two independent datasets, the TCGA PanCancer PC (
 <italic>n</italic> = 492) and MSKCC (
 <italic>n</italic> = 140) cohorts. The prognostic biomarker properties of this 10-gene panel are further validated by its comparable competency in predicting ccRCC poor OS. Although this leading-edge (LE) panel was derived from PC research, its prognostic biomarker potential towards ccRCC is certainly interesting and is likely attributable to the commonality shared by PC and ccRCC with both being urogenital cancers. In support of this concept, the LE gene panel significantly predicts fatality risk in other urogenital cancers, papillary RCC and bladder cancer (

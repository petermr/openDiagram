<p>The first such compound to be identified is lignan sevanol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9a</xref>), extracted from thyme (
 <italic>Thymus armeniacus</italic>), which is a reversible blocker of hASIC3, acting independently of the pH stimulus used (from 5.5 to 6.5), and completely blocks the transient component (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 353 µM), as well as partially inhibiting the amplitude of the sustained component (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 234 µM) [
 <xref rid="cit0213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. In addition to the effects of sevanol on hASIC3, a synthetic analogue, a stereoisomer, and a precursor compound that represents half of the sevanol molecule were tested, all of which showed a marked reduction in inhibition of hASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>].

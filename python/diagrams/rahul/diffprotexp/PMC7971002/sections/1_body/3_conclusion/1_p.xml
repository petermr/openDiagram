<p id="Par27">We employed the next-generation high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools to identify lncRNAs and mRNAs of Hu sheep ovaries at different development stages. We found that miRNAs and lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the three comparison groups at the varying developmental stages. Six thousand seven hundred and sixteen (6716) differentially expressed mRNAs (3377 up-regulated, 3339 down-regulated, including unknown genes) and 1972 differentially expressed lncRNAs (1093 up-regulated, 879 down-regulated) were identified in the ovaries of 1 and 3 months old Hu sheep. The GO annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis of 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans</italic> target genes and differential mRNAs revealed the lncRNA target genes and differential mRNAs might be involved in ovarian follicle development, steroid hormone-mediated signalling pathways, steroid hormone biosynthesis, gonadotropin response, and insulin-like growth factor receptor binding. The target genes of differential mRNAs and lncRNAs in the ovaries of 1 and 3 months old sheep were mainly enriched in the TGF-β and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways, ovarian follicle development and steroid hormone biosynthesis. The target genes of differential mRNAs and lncRNAs in the ovaries of 3 and 8 months old sheep were primarily enriched in PI3K-Akt, ovarian steroid production, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, estrogen metabolism, ovarian follicle ovulation and oogenesis pathways. Candidate lncRNAs involved in the development of Hu sheep ovarian follicles and key target genes identified may require further studies by knockout, overexpression, and RNAi to authenticate lncRNAs-specific functions in ovarian development.

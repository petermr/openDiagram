0: Several distinct modes underpinning the evolution of compartments and organellar diversity have been proposed.
1: These are based largely on analysis of the membrane trafficking system, which features large paralogous protein families with organelle-specific members such as GTPase and SNARE families, kinesins and others [ 810].
2: Some of these modes can be considered to be expansive, in the sense that they lead to an increase in the number of compartments.
3: This is exemplified by Rab GTPases that specify and mediate cargo exchange between endocytic and exocytic compartments [ 8].
4: Alternatively, there are many examples of reductive processes, where lineages lose complexity; again, the Rab family is a good example  in many unicellular organisms, for example in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a great many Rab genes have been lost.
5: We termed this process sculpting, as the new organism is revealed only through the removal of genes.
6: These two examples are comparatively simple to understand in evolutionary terms as they rely on changes to the numbers of paralogs within a gene family [ 11]; but additional mechanisms are also at play and are not always obvious in terms of simple gene counts.
7: These include churning whereby paralogs are created and deleted so the overall number remains similar [ 12]; and finally backfilling whereby loss of functionality through gene loss is compensated through the expansion of a different gene family [ 13] ( Figure 1).
8: In principle, the relevance of such modes of evolution extends to all endomembranes, including their sub-domains and functions, at all stages of eukaryotic evolution.

<p>To further disclose the structural elasticity/robustness, the micro-morphology of B-SFO@C subjected to 500 cycles at 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> was further examined by SEM and TEM. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f007">Figure 7</xref>a, the cycled B-SFO@C electrode can still preserve a micron-sized construction well, without any cracks on its surface even if the surface is somewhat distinguished from that of the fresh B-SFO@C electrode. After cycling, the surface becomes smoother and denser, owing to SEI formation. The magnified SEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f007">Figure 7</xref>b) indicates no obviously spotted fracturing, aggregation, or pulverization on the electrode surface, which verifies the excellent morphologic stability. Such phenomena ensue from a symmetric and uniform volume variation of the metal phases, further elucidating that the shortcomings of Sn-based materials seem to be fully overcome by a straightforward structuring (namely, embedment of the binary small-sized metal particles into the carbon lamella of a compact monolithic geometry). The microstructural integrity can further be confirmed by TEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f007">Figure 7</xref>c), where the metal-in-carbon sandwich structure of constituent particles is retained. That is, the metal nanoparticles are observed to be still well dispersed and intercalated inside carbon layers with no obvious carbon aggregation/fracturing taking place, very similar to the structural motifs revealed by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d. The size of metal nano-particles is very close to the case in the fresh one, suggesting that the metal particle coarsening can be powerfully inhibited and that the unique intercalation layout is able to strongly protect the metal particles from cracking due to the nonuniform and huge volume evolution over initial cycles. These effects can make sure that the morphologic evolutions will not become increasingly serious over the cycling to circumvent the fracturing/pulverization, thus avoiding both the breakage of the preformed SEI layer and endless SEI amassment upon repeated cycles. Corresponding SAED pattern displays the diffraction rings of Sn; however, no diffraction rings characterizing SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> are discerned. Nevertheless, the HRTEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f007">Figure 7</xref>d) reveals that there are plentiful ultrafine amorphous nanoparticles being detected (noted by red circle) except for the crystalline Sn. On the grounds of the preceding reports [
 <xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], these ultrafine amorphous nanoparticles may be SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>—which accounts for the absence of diffraction rings of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> in SAED pattern. Coupling the electron spectroscopy with the cyclic behavior, the characteristics of the surface and morphological integrity can become manifest in the production of steady and thin SEI layers, bringing forth the improved cyclic performance. In short, in conjunction with the excellent cyclic longevity and rate handling, the morphologic characterization before and after the prolonged cycling can undeniably disclose an extraordinary shape memory effect for the topologically frustrated lattice reorganization during the reduplicative (de)lithiation chemistry, leading the electrode to survive even over long-term cycling, i.e., the intercalation structure permits metals to dilate and constringe without disintegration during cycling. As discussed above, in essence, the transcendent structural and morphologic resilience arises from effective stress management from binary metal nanoparticles-in-carbon structures. Accordingly, we are convinced that although it features the micro-sized dimensionality the binary metal-in-carbon architecture not only acts as a stress relaxation regulator to mitigate the compressive stress of lithiated metal phase but also retains the morphological integrity without any mechanical failure by dwindling the tensile stress intensified to carbon layers, inducing the low electrode expansion effect.

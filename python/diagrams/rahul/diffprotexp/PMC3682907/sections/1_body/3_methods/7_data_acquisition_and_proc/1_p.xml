<p>Mass spectra were acquired using a model PBSIIc SELDI-TOF-MS (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA). SELDI mass spectra were acquired with a laser intensity of 225 and a detector sensitivity of 8 for high molecular weight proteins (HMW protocol), and a laser intensity of 199 and a detector sensitivity of 9 for low molecular weight proteins (LMW protocol). Both high and low molecular weight spectra were acquired at a digitizer rate of 250 MHz in positive ion mode with a chamber vacuum of less than 5×10
 <sup>-7</sup> torr, a source voltage of 20 kV and a detector voltage of 2,700 V. A total of 65 transients were averaged for each spectrum. Spectral processing (smoothing and baseline subtraction) was performed with ProteinChip 3.1 software. All spectra were calibrated externally using an All-in-1 peptide standard [porcine dynorphin, 2147.50 Da; bovine insulin β-chain, 3495.94 Da; and hirudin BHVK, 7033.61 Da], and an All-in-1 protein standard [bovine cytochrome c, 12230 Da; bovine carbonic anhydrase, 29024 kDa; and S. cerevisiae enolase, 46670 Da] (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA). Peak intensities were normalized against the total ion current (TIC), excluding the mass range below 1500 Da, which is composed of strong signals from the SPA matrix. Because automatic peak selection by the Ciphergen Express software can miss features that appear as shoulders on large peaks, all spectra were subjected to manual peak-picking. All peaks that are present in at least 25% of the spectra and with SNR ≥ 3 were selected.

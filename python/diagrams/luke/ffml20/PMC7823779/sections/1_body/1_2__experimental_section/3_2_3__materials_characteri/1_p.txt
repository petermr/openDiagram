0: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4700, HITACHI, Chiyoda, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, HITACHI, Chiyoda, Japan) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension Icon, BRUKER, Karlsruhe, Germany) were used to characterize the morphology of the samples.
1: Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, VERTEX70, BRUKER, Karlsruhe, Germany), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C-NMR, CMX 400, VARIAN, Palo alto, CA, USA), Raman spectrometer (RM1000, Renishaw, Gloucester, England) and organic element analyzer (EA3000, Euro Vector, Pavia, Italy) were carried out to analyze the structure.

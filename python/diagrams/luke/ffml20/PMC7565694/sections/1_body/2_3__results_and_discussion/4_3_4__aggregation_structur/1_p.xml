<p>In order to reveal the better barrier properties of 2,7-CPI in comparison with Kapton and 2,7-CPPI, WAXD was carried out to study the packing degree and order of polymer chains. The experimental WAXD scattering spectra of the three PIs are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI presented strong diffraction peaks, suggesting their higher crystallinity, while the broad bands of the Kapton demonstrated the amorphous nature of the polymer. The crystals in 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI matrices will hinder the permeation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub> by forcing them to follow a more tortuous diffusion pathway, and thereby improving their barrier properties [
 <xref rid="B42-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The peak in WAXD patterns is ascribed to the chain-to-chain distance (
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing) between the polymer backbones [
 <xref rid="B43-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The 2,7-CPI showed an intensive reflection peak at 22.11° corresponding to the 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing of 4.01 Å, which was lower than those of Kapton and 2,7-CPPI (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In addition, 2,7-CPI presented higher density than Kapton and 2,7-CPPI, as shown in 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The low 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing and high crystallinity and density suggested the close chains packing of 2,7-CPI. The Kapton displayed lowest density and largest 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing among the three PIs, demonstrating its loose chains packing. This was mainly due to the nonplanar structure of ODA caused by the ether bond.

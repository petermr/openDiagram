<p>From the above analysis, it can be obtained that the interface between lithium anode and solid‐state electrolyte is quite important for achieving the outstanding performance all‐solid‐state batteries. The SCEs not only promotes the construction of a low‐resistance interface with Li metal anode, but also can effectively suppress the Li dendrite growth and side reactions of ICEs with Li metal anode. Whereas, it should be noted that the thickness of above developed SCEs is still larger than commercial separator and the applied current density and areal capacity of plating and stripping during long cycling to examine roles for suppression of Li dendrite growth is quite lower. As we know, it is really difficult to maintain the interface stability and suppress the Li dendrite growth in all‐solid‐state batteries at a higher current density and larger plating and stripping capacity. Therefore, it is quite necessary to develop the SCEs with much thinner thickness and high mechanical strength to suppress the Li dendrite growth at larger charge/discharge areal capacity under high current density in the future research.</p>

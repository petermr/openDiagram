0: Defined input parameters for compression test using of DIL 805A/D are temperature ( t), deformation ( ) and deformation rate (  ).
1: The experiments were performed at temperatures of 900, 1000, 1100 and 1200 C; strain rate from 0.001 to 10 s 1 and maximum strain 0.9.
2: At the end of experiment, all samples were cooled at a constant cooling rate 20 C/s.
3: Samples were made in form of cylinder with diameter of 5 mm and length of 10 mm.
4: Moreover, in these experiments, average values were obtained from 4 identical measurements to obtain relevant values.
5: Due to the friction of the contact surfaces between the sample and the compression pistons of the dilatometry device, the stresses were corrected as [ 27]: (1)=0C22expCC1 where  is the friction corrected true stress, and  0 is the measured true stress.
6: Parameter  C can be determined as: (2)C=2mRh

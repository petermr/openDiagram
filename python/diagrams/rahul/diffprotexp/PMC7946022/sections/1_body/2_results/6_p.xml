  <italic>C. albicans-S. aureus</italic> mixed-species biofilm exhibit increased eDNA content compared to single-species biofilms
 </bold>. eDNA from single species and mixed biofilm was recovered and quantitatively compared using a fluorescence-based kit. As expected, eDNA content recovered from mixed biofilms was significantly higher than that recovered from biofilms formed by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> or 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> alone (

<p>Based on inflated misdiagnosis rate and poor accuracy of diagnosis, pediatric sepsis has brought great difficulty to clinical treatment. To this end, a more comprehensive approach to predict pediatric sepsis based on the specific target gene differential expression is required. To address these issues, in this study, we used a combination of bioinformatics and machine learning to screen out the potential biomarkers in the pathogenesis of pediatric sepsis specimens and then constructed a diagnosis model. All of these promising outcomes enriched the diagnosis of the disease, which provide tremendous help for pediatric sepsis study.</p>

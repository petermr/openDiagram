<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Stoltzfus, 1999</xref>), leading to inaccurate inferences in gene and pathway functions which is a common problem in comparative genomic studies using pathway and gene ontologies to categorize gene function. In addition, we assume that most duplicate genes are functional but it is likely that some of the duplicates were identify are non-functional pseudogenes. Differentiating between functional and non-functional genes using comparative genomics can be challenging. For example, non-functional pseudogenes often accumulate non-synonymous amino acid substitutions and premature stop codons but these same changes can also occur in functional genes. For example, we have found that the elephant genome encodes

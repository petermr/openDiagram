  <p>Protein expression in primary and metastatic tumors. 
   <bold>a</bold> Venn diagram showing the differential expression of 129 proteins by primary and metastatic tumors (76 in primary tumors and 101 in metastatic tumors). 
   <bold>b</bold> Distribution of proteins related to different biological processes. 
   <bold>c</bold> Comparison of proteins expressed by primary and metastatic tumors. The expression of proteins related to developmental and multicellular organismal process was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors, whereas the expression of proteins related to metabolic processes was higher in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors

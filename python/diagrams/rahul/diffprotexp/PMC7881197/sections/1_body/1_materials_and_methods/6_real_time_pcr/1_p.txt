0: Cell culture and RNA preparation for real-time PCR were performed as described in 37.
1: HUMEC and MCF7 cells were grown to 6070% confluence in six well plates and were replaced with the fresh media before applying AS6 to the target concentrations.
2: After 4872 h incubation, the cells were washed with cold PBS once and scraped.
3: The cells were washed again with cold PBS twice before the total RNA molecules were extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit.
4: cDNAs were constructed from 136 to 600 ng of the collected RNAs using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan).
5: cDNA was analyzed through qPCR using SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan), according to the manufacturers instructions (QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
6: The thermal cycle used was 95 C for 1 min as pre-denaturation, followed by 45 cycles of 95 C for 15 s, 55 C for 15 s, and 72 C for 45 s. The primers used for the experiments were purchased from Integrated DNA technology (USA) and are summarized in Table  S1.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f005">Figure 5</xref>. In fact, by increasing the focal plane position (z distance in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f007">Figure 7</xref>a–c account for the influence of LSS on the geometrical dimensions of the hardened layer. It consisted in the fact that the lower LSS caused wider and deeper case hardening with a bigger layer angle. That can be explained with LSS reduction, which increased the interaction time between the material and the laser beam. Therefore, more heat energy was transferred to the surface of the samples and wider and deeper hardened layers were achieved. Sample #9 had a deeper hardened layer, which was 193 µm, and 2284 µm width. Although samples #2 and #3 had the maximum depth and hardness, i.e., the surface of these samples was melted, they were not the best ones, while transformation hardening was desired. The melting surface was due to lower focal plane position distance (8 mm and 9 mm), which led to higher energy concentration and then the energy caused the melt of the material surface.

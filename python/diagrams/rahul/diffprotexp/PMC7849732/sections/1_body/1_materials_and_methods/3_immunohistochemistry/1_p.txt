0: To study the relative expression of GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D isoforms in the SDH versus the DDH regions, we conducted immunohistochemistry experiments with double labeling to detect both the SDH and the receptor subunit of interest.
1: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was used as the marker of the pain-processing SDH (laminae I/II) since it labels the nociceptive afferent peptidergic fibers that selectively innervate this region [ 2729].

<p id="Par33">Women in the control group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were selected among patients who visited the outpatient clinic, without uterine contraction or fluid leakage, ≥3 cm cervical length, and no cervical dilation, confirmed by ultrasonography. To reduce sample heterogeneity, we selected patients with matched maternal and gestational ages. On the day of CI diagnosis, whole blood samples were obtained from the women; for controls, samples were obtained on the day of enrollment in the study. To validate RNA-Seq analysis, qRT-PCR and immunoassay experiments were performed using separate sample-sets of the CI and control groups. Blood samples for qRT-PCR were collected into PAXgene™ RNA stabilization tubes (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), part of the blood samples was centrifuged to collect the serum, and both blood and serum samples were cryopreserved at − 80 °C. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital (No. 2017-08-014). Written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from each individual prior to recruitment.

<p>Recently, from the screening of 380 transposon insertion mutants of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 of Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library, we found that disruption of the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> gene, lying upstream of the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene in a two-gene operon, resulted in the loss of pathogenicity in silkworm and mice. Pathogenicity was restored by the introduction of the 
 <italic>yjbIH</italic> operon and not of the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene might have a role in pathogenicity. Studies involving YjbH in 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>], 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref>], and other Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>] have reported it to be an adaptor protein responsible for proteolysis of Spx, a transcriptional regulator, via ClpXP protease [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref>]. However, the role of YjbH in the pathogenicity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is obscure. In this study, we found that YjbH is essential to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence in a whole-body animal infection model and involved in the expression of the broad range of virulence genes. In addition, we found that YjbH affects the bacterial surface structure, and confers resistance to oxidative stress in the host.

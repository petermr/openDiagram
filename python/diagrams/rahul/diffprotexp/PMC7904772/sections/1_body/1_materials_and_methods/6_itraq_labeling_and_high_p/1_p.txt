0: Peptides from the FASP-based digestion were labeled with 8-plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) reagents following the instructions of the manufacturer.
1: Eight samples from the control and the stressed groups were labeled using the reagents 113121.
2: Each sample was obtained from two or three rats in each group.
3: After peptide labeling, these samples were mixed and subsequently fractionated by offline high-pH RPLC, where the peptides were fractionated via an 80-min linear gradient elution of 538% high-pH buffer (10 mM ammonium formate, 90% acetonitrile, pH 10.0).
4: The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min.
5: The acquired 16 fractions were desalted and lyophilized for the following analysis.

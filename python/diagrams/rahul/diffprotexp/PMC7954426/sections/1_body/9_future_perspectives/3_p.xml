<p>Research in the past 20Â years has focused on adhesins, lipoproteins, and toxins, while several unaddressed questions regarding the pathogenic role of lipids in the mycoplasma cell membranes remain. A recent report showed that TLR4 can mediate proinflammatory cytokine secretion in TLR2-deficient macrophages upon 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="cit0303" ref-type="bibr">303</xref>], indicating that TLR4 is a receptor for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>. TLR4 recognizes lipid A in LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, which is not found in mycoplasmas. There are abundant lipids on mycoplasma cell membranes, and a considerable proportion of the lipids exist in the form of glycolipids or phosphoglycolipids. Nonetheless, our current understanding of their biological effects is limited, hence lipids might possibly be TLR4 ligands. Our recent data also demonstrate that high concentrations of lipids could trigger the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse macrophages via TLR4 [
 <xref rid="cit0305" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>]. Owing to the biochemical particularity of lipids, it is difficult to study their functions through gene knockout as done 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, hence resulting in fewer lipids being functionally characterized. In this regard, future studies should focus on identifying mycoplasma functional lipids.

0: The HPC was obtained from biomass reed flower.
1: The typical synthesis process is shown in  Figure 1.
2: Firstly, 40 mL deionized water (DI-water) was introduced into the 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then, 1 g reed flowers was dispersed in the deionized water.
3: The mixture was heated to 220 C for 12 h. When the Teflon-lined autoclave cooled to 25 C, the hydrothermally synthesized product was taken out and centrifugally separated with DI-water.
4: After the products were dried in a drying oven at 80 C for 10 h, black powders were obtained.
5: Then, 1 g powders and 1 g KOH were mixed evenly and added into 20-mL DI-water with magnetic stirring for 1 h. The mixture was dried at 80 C for 10 h. In the next step, the compound was multistep calcinated at different temperatures (450 C for 30 min, 650 C for 30 min, and 800 C for 1 h) under Ar protection with a heating rate of 5 C min 1, so that the products were fully activated and carbonized, creating plenty of pores in different sizes.
6: After the furnace cooled to 25 C, the products were washed by 10% HCl for 10 min and then washed by DI-water for 5 times.
7: At last, the products were dried at 80 C for 12 h for further testing.

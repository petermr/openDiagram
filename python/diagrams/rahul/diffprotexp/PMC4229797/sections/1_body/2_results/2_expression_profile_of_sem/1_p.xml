<p>Ten seminal proteins were detected with a statistical difference and a ROC value &gt; 0.77 between the fertile and infertile groups: There were four peaks in the low mass range corresponding to small proteins (2000–20,000 Da) and six peaks in the high mass range corresponding to large proteins (20,000–2,00,000 Da) which were statistically (

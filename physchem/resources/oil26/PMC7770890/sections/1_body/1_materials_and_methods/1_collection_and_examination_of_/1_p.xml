<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A list
of ACE2 orthologs from 318 vertebrate species was downloaded from
the NCBI Web site (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59272/ortholog/?scope=7742">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59272/ortholog/?scope=7742</uri>). Besides these, we also considered the ACE2 orthologs from three
mammals that are not included in this list, namely, palm civets, raccoon
dogs, and Chinese rufous horseshoe bats, as civets and raccoon dogs
were suggested to be intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Additionally, it was shown that the ACE2 proteins of civets
and horseshoe bats can also be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry
in cell-level experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup></p>

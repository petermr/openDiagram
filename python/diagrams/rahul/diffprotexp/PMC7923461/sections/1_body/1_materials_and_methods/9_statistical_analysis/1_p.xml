<p id="Par45">All statistical analyses were performed by using R language (version 3.5.3). Kaplan–Meier univariate analysis was used to determine the effect of TUBA1C expression on survival. Multivariate Cox analysis was performed to determine the expression of TUBA1C and the effect of other pathological and clinical factors (age, gender, stage, tumor status, and lymph node) on overall survival (OS). The results were considered to be statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05.</p>

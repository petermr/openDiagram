<p>KEGG significant enrichment analysis of DEGs can reveal metabolic pathway and signaling pathway information. KEGG functional enrichment analysis of all DEGs was performed to determine the pathways involved in regulating the responses of vegetative cells and heterocysts to nitrogen deprivation conditions. Fourteen significantly enriched pathways were identified, and 7, 3, and 4 KEGG pathways were enriched in NV vs. NDH, NV vs. NDV, and NDV vs. NDH comparisons, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the NDV vs. NDH comparison, five pathways were related to metabolism, including those related to carbohydrates, nucleotides, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. In the NV vs. NDV comparison, two pathways were involved in energy and amino acid metabolism and one pathway was involved in replication and repair. In the NDV vs. NDH comparison, three pathways were related to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, terpenoids and polyketides, and nucleotides. These results suggest that most DEGs were involved in metabolism, carbon fixation, and the synthesis of important nitrogenous biomacromolecules including, but not limited to, arginine, DNA, and purine, providing important insight into screening of candidate genes involved in regulating vegetative cells and heterocysts in response to nitrogen deprivation conditions.

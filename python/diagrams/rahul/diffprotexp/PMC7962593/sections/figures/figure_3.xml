  <p>Identification of common genes in sepsis. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Petal plot of sample size for sepsis and control groups in four datasets. Red petals represent healthy controls; blue petals, sepsis patients. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Manhattan plot of differentially expressed genes between sepsis patients and healthy controls in GSE13904 and GSE154918. Up, up-regulation in sepsis; Down, down-regulation in sepsis; Not, no significant difference from controls. The three genes in each group showing the largest fold difference are labeled. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes in GSE13904 (children) and GSE154918 (adults). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Venn diagram showing DEGs in GSE13904 (children) and GSE154918 (adults) as well as module genes, that are common to adults and children or specific to each one of those groups.

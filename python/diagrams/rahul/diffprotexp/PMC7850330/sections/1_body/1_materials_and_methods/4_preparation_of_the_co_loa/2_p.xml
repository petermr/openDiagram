<p>Combined loratadine and sulpiride nanoemulsions (o/w) was developed adopting ultra-sonication technique. Different compositions of the developed formulations are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Specified amounts of Tween-80 and soybean lecithin were mixed at 25 °C using a magnetic stirrer (400
 <bold> </bold>rpm for 30
 <bold> </bold>minutes) to form the oil phase. The specified amounts of olive oil (3.5
 <bold> </bold>g), loratadine (0.25
 <bold> </bold>g) and sulpiride (0.05
 <bold> </bold>g) were added and stirred till obtaining a uniform mixture. The calculated amounts of deionized water, sodium cholate and glycerol (co-surfactants)were mixed to form the aqueous phase. The oil phase was then added gradually to the aqueous phase using a suitable syringe under stirring for 10
 <bold> </bold>minutes. The resultant mixture was further sonicated for 30
 <bold> </bold>minutes adopting ultrasonic processor at 20
 <bold> </bold>kHz (FB-110Q, Shanghai Litu Machinery and Equipment Engineering Co., LRD, Shanghai, China).

<p>However, the heat flow curves measured here only show one peak, but no precipitation or sequence. The measuring system of the used device (Pyris 1 DSC, PerkinElmer) is suitable for relatively fast cooling rates, which is crucial to be able to perform the whole heat treatment cycle inside one device. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of this device obviously is not sufficient to resolve very small heat flows resulting from the transformation of one phase to another. Therefore, the transformation from β” → β’ → β could not be proven in the heat flow curves. For this purpose, other types of DSC, like high sensitivity CALVET-type devices, seem to be more promising. However, in order to use devices such as these for this purpose in future experiments, the possibility for fast quenching will need to be incorporated within them.</p>

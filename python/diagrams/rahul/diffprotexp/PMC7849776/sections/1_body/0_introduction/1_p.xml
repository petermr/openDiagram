 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. As a human-commensal and an opportunistic pathogen, it is responsible for several infectious diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening endocarditis [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the spread of multi-drug resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains has challenged the treatments, thus warranting novel therapeutic options [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4–10</xref>]. It is crucial to understand the pathogen, its weapons, and host-pathogen interactions to develop novel therapeutics. One way of combating infections is to disarm the pathogen from its virulence factors, rendering it less pathogenic, which helps the host immunity expel the pathogen quickly. In this sense, exploring the mechanism of virulence regulation will enhance the understanding of pathogenesis and host-pathogen interaction. To identify the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence factors and the genes responsible for pathogenicity, we performed screening using a silkworm infection model. Over the past years, we have identified several 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence factors that are involved in both the silkworm and mice virulence [

<p>In our previous study, we found that late‐embryogenesis (S3) and mid‐maturation(S5) stages are most crucial for determining seed size/weight in chickpea (Garg et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We identified four modules showing a significant difference in expression patterns of miRNAs between the two cultivars at S3 and/or S5 stage(s) for further analyses (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Among them, dark red and pink modules showed higher expression at the S3 stage in JGK 3. In contrast, two modules (green and dark green) exhibited lower expression at the S3 stage in JGK 3 (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5c‐d</xref>). At the S5 stage, modules (light cyan and turquoise) showed lower expression in JGK 3, whereas modules (purple and dark red) showed higher expression at the S5 stage in JGK 3 (Figure

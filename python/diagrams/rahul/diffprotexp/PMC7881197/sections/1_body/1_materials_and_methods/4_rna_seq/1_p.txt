0: Cell culture and RNA preparation were performed as described in 32.
1: HUMEC and MCF7 cells were grown to 6070% confluence in 6-well plates and the media were exchanged with the fresh complete media including AS6 at final concentration of 0.5 M or H 2O only as an untreated control.
2: After 50 h incubation, the cells were washed with cold PBS once and scraped.
3: The cells were washed again with cold PBS twice before extracting total RNA molecules using Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germany).
4: The cDNA construction and RNA sequencing were commercially performed by Omega Bioservices ( https://omegabioservices.com, USA) using the manufacturers typical procedure as previously reported ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM471292.
5: 33.
6: The RNA concentration and integrity were assessed using Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and Agilent 2200 Tapestation instrument (Agilent Technologies, USA).
7: One microgram of total RNA was used to prepare Ribo-Zero RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries.
8: Briefly, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is removed using biotinylated, target-specific oligos combined with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (Illumina, USA).
9: After purification, the RNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature.
10: First-strand cDNA syntheses were performed at 25 C for 10 min, 42 C for 15 min and 70 C for 15 min, using random hexamers and ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England BioLabs, USA).
11: In a second strand cDNA synthesis the RNA templates were removed, and a second replacement strand was generated by incorporation dUTP (in place of dTTP, to keep strand information) to generate ds cDNA.
12: The blunt-ended cDNA was cleaned up from the second strand reaction mix with beads.
13: The 3`ends of the cDNA were then adenylated and followed by the ligation of indexing adaptors.
14: PCR (15 cycles of 98 C for 10 s, 60 C for 30 s and 72 C for 30 s) were used to selectively enrich those DNA fragments that have adapter molecules on both ends and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library.
15: The libraries were quantified and qualified using the Agilent D1000 ScreenTape on a 2200 TapeStation instrument.
16: The libraries were normalized, pooled and subjected to cluster and pair-read sequencing was performed for 150 cycles on a HiSeqX10 instrument (Illumina, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

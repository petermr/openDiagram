<p>Our group first described that the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) promotes the activity of the proteasome via the ERα axis of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR
 <sup>mt</sup>) (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Interestingly, cross-talk between the endoplasmic reticulum mediated unfolded protein response (UPR
 <sup>ER</sup>) and the ERα has also been reported (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9-12</xref>). Retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome plays a critical role in the UPR
 <sup>ER</sup> (for a recent review (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref>). Therefore, interventions aimed at activating the ERα are predicted to delay the onset and slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

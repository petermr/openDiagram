<p>Certain human pathogenic mycoplasmas, such as 
 <italic>U. parvum, U. urealyticum</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic>, display obvious hemolysin activity 
 <italic>in vitro. U. parvum</italic> serovar 3 and 
 <italic>U. urealyticum</italic> express hemolysin A (hlyA), and hlyA and hlyC, respectively [
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Of these, 
 <italic>U. parvum</italic> hlyA exhibits hemolytic and cytotoxic activities, whereas 
 <italic>U. urealyticum</italic> hlyA has a bearing on hemolysis and hlyC is involved in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> production [
 <xref rid="cit0226" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Furthermore, various 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic> strains show hemolytic activity following incubation with sheep, horse, chicken, and human erythrocytes, although this activity has not been previously found in mouse erythrocytes; the spent culture supernatant of 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic> also has hemolytic activity that depends on the reducing agent cysteine [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These results indicate that 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic>-derived hemolysin can bind to specific receptors on the erythrocytes, and cysteine residues are required for hemolytic activity.

<p>The proteomic method used in this study provides quantitative data that form a basis for subsequent biological verification in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Direct analysis of changes in protein abundance avoids some of the pitfalls associated with more traditional methods of quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Measurements of gene transcripts as indicative of subsequent protein expression at any given time (either by microarray or RT-PCR) are fraught with inaccuracies leading to a poor or lack of correlation between mRNA and protein [

Poor correlation also can be explained by the different lifetimes of the two biomolecules within a cell. Proteins are accumulated products, while mRNAs are instantaneous messengers that are degraded within minutes. Tilton

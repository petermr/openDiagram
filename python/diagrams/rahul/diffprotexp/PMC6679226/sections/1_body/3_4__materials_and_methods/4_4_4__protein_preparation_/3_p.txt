0: The 12 super fractions were then run on a Dionex U3000 nano flow system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer.
1: Each fraction was subjected to a 90-min chromatographic method employing a gradient from 225% ACN in 0.1% formic acid (FA) over the course of 65 min, a gradient to 50% ACN/FA for an additional 10 min, a step to 90% ACN/FA for 5 min and a 10 min re-equilibration into 2% ACN/FA.
2: Chromatography was carried out in a trap-and-load format using a PicoChip source (New Objective, Woburn, MA), with the trap column C18 PepMap 100 (5 m, 100 A) and the separation column PicoChip REPROSIL-Pur C18-AQ (3 m, 120 A, 105 mm).
3: The flow rate for the entire run was at 0.3 L/min, and electrospray was achieved at 2.6 kV.

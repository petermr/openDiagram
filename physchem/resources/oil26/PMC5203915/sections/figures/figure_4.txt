0:  ROS production in LPS-stimulated astrocytes.
1: Astrocytes were induced with LPS (1  g/mL) and then incubated for 24 h with 100  g/mL of Rhaponticum carthamoides HR and SGR essential oils.
2: Values are given as means  SD of three independent experiments.
3: p< 0.05 versus control; # p< 0.05 HR essential oil versus SGR essential oil. )

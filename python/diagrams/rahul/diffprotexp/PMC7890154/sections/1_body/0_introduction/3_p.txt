0: Wheat has inherent defence mechanism to protect itself from heat stress.
1: Wide-diversity across the wheat genotypes has been observed for HS-tolerance.
2: The inherent potential to sense the HS and trigger the defence mechanism, however, varies with the genotypes [ 9].
3: The signaling of plants under stress is basically a complexed network of interacting proteins working in cohesion in order to regulate the activation of the enzymes [ 3].
4: Signal transduction pathways in plants are very complex having significant cross-talks under different environmental cues [ 7, 9].
5: MAPK is one of the most important signaling cascades operating inside the plant system and regulating the abiotic stress response of plants.
6: Several cellular responses are linked with the external stimuli through MAPK cascade [ 10].

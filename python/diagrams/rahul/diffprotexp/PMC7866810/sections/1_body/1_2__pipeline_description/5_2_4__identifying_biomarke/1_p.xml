<p>The biomarker discovery approach starts with a list of DEGs. Next, protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene enrichment analyses are implemented to further explore the hub genes with the most interactions in gene modules [

The outcome is used to test the connectivity degree and the betweenness centrality of the interaction network, which reflects the communication flow in the networks. Additionally, decision tree analysis is implemented either between two clusters of interest or between one cluster verses the remaining cells. Putting all the results together can highlight panels of biomarkers for a particular cluster with certain characteristics. DIscBIO uses decision trees and hub detection through networking analysis and gene enrichment analysis to discover biomarkers. Decision trees are a very efficient classification technique in biomarker discovery. In the current version of DIscBIO, two different decision trees, J48 and RPART, can be implemented to predict the sub-population of a target cell based on transcriptomic data. The J48 tree is implemented through the RWeka package whereas the RPART tree is computed using the rpart package. The performance of the generated trees can be evaluated for error estimation by a ten-fold cross validation assessment. To identify the protein–protein interactions, we use STRING through its application programming interface. Moreover, to gain mechanistic insight into the DEGs, gene and pathway enrichment analysis can be performed in DIscBIO through the enrichR package. Further information on how to use DIscBIO and the possible options and documentation of the algorithms are included within our Jupyter notebooks.

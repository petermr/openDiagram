  <p>TUBA1C expression levels in LUAD performed by immunohistochemistry. 
   <bold>a–f</bold> TUBA1C protein was detected in normal lung tissues and LUAD tissues by TMA-IHC. × 40 magnification (bar = 500 μm), × 200 magnification (bar = 100 μm). TUBA1C protein was dyed brown particles in cell cytoplasm. 
   <bold>g</bold> TUBA1C overexpression was negatively associated with the overall survival rate of patients by Kaplan‑Meier analysis (P = 0.035).

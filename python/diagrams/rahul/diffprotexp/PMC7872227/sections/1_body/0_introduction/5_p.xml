<p>In order to get a better understanding of the mechanism of nitrogen source utilization, comparative transcriptome studies are carried out under three different culture conditions on 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> in this paper. We aimed to investigate the expression pattern of urease gene of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> and the necessary nutrients for the growth, metabolism, and mineralization of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>. The results presented in the paper can help to reduce the cost of MICP and realize the flexible regulation of mineralization reaction in large-scale engineering applications by the utilization of proper nitrogen sources.

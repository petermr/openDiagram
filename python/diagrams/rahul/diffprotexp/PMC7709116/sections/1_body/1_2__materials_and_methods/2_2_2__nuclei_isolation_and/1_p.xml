<p>Nuclear fractionation was carried out as described [
 <xref rid="B18-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, individual striata from each mouse were minced 100 times vertically and horizontally on a glass plate and briefly fixed with 4% (wt./vol) paraformaldehyde for 5 min on ice. The cross-linked tissues from two mice were pooled together and then homogenized in 500 μL of cold homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM tricine pH 8, 100 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl, 1 μM DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (cOmplete™, Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA), phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PhosSTOP; MilliporeSigma)) by using 10 strokes with a loose pestle followed by 10 strokes with a tight pestle in a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at 2000×

 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM tricine-KOH pH 8), it was then overlaid on top of 200 μL of a 29% (

 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor (Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge; TLS55 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). After ultracentrifugation, the top lipid layer was removed with a pipette tip and then approximately 800 μL of the gradient medium was also removed and discarded. The nuclear pellet was washed three times with 1 mL of resuspension buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 20 mM tricine-KOH pH 7.8) in a siliconized Eppendorf tube by using tabletop centrifugation at 2000×

<p id="Par17">The circRNA expression profile of Torin 1 (10 µM)-induced SKOV3 cells was identified via RNA-sequencing analysis. A total of 11,031 different candidate circRNAs were identified from all samples, including 504 upregulated and 478 downregulated ones. In addition, 4223 upregulated and 3952 downregulated mRNAs, along with 353 upregulated and 111 downregulated miRNAs, were detected (Fig.

0: So far, the key pathways that have been associated with the stem height are the gibberellic acid (GA) metabolism and signaling, elasticity of the cell-wall of expanding cells, and cross-talk between GA and other hormone metabolism and signaling pathways i.e.
1: auxin, brassinosteroids (BR), and abscisic acid (ABA) [ 3].
2: Chen et al., [ 1] studied a dwarf mutant of Williams banana variety and demonstrated the role of GA in dwarfism.
3: In peach trees, the brachytic dwarfism trait ( dw) was associated with a nonsense mutation in a GA receptor  PpeGID1c [ 8].
4: GA biosynthesis pathway-related enzymes such as  ent-Copalyl diphosphate synthase,  ent-Kaurene synthase,  ent-Kaurene 19-oxidase, GA12-aldehyde 7-oxidase, GA 20-oxidase, GA 3-hydroxylase, and GA 2-oxidase have been successfully identified in Arabidopsis, pumpkin, and runner bean [ 9].
5: A previous study on GA metabolisms between Williams banana and its dwarf mutant shed light on the GA regulated stem development in banana and identified six main genes regulating differential GA content [ 1].
6: While this study focused on GA metabolism-related genes, the other pathways related to stem elongation remain poorly explored [ 9,  10].

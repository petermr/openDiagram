<p>Fractions obtained from the strong cation-exchange column were pooled, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 20 μL 0.1% TFA before analysis by nanobore HPLC-MS/MS, using an LC-20AD nano HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), an Agilent 1100 Nanoflow LC system coupled online with a linear ion trap–Fourier transform mass spectrometer. Data acquisition was performed with a TripleTOF 5600 System (AB SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada) fitted with a Nanospray III source (AB SCIEX) and a pulled quartz tip as the emitter (New Objectives, Woburn, MA, USA).</p>

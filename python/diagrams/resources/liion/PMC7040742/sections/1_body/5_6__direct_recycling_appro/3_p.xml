<p>A simple process patented by Toyota [
 <xref rid="B209-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>] claims to clean out adsorbed phosphorous compounds from the surface of the cathode active material. These compounds are coming from the dissociation of electrolyte (LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>) during cycling. According to the authors, applying very high frequency ultrasound (&gt;900 kHz) for up to 30 min on the whole undamaged battery, the thin film covering the positive electrode was stripped off. The battery treated thereby was tested for internal resistance and then classified according to a threshold for reuse in electric vehicles, in stationary purpose, or for definitive discard. It is well known that internal resistance is not the only indication of cells degradation [

<p>We went on to analyze samples with hotspot mutations and the five (one did not have RNA-Seq data) samples with such mutations were compared to the original control group of 11 samples. This analysis showed a marked increase in the number of significant differentially spliced events after multiple testing correction (435 significant splicing events compared to just four using all 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutants). The median variant allele frequency (VAF) for the 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> missense mutations was 0.3 (range 0.1-0.64). There was no significant difference in the median VAF between hotspot and non-hotspot mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>, suggesting clonal 
 <italic>versus</italic> sub-clonal mutations were not responsible for the lack of splicing in the non-hotspot samples (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>). Investigation of 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> expression at both the gene and transcript level between groups showed no significant difference (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S2</italic>), confirming that the detected difference in splicing was also not due to a change in the level of 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> expression. There was no significant difference in any other recurrent non-synonymous gene mutations between the hotspot 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant and the control group.

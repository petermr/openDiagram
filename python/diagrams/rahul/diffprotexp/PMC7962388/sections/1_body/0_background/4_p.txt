0: In the past decade, transcriptome surveys have exposed a large number of genes differentially regulated in sexual and apomictic developmental pathways.
1: Analyses on  Boechera spp.
2: [ 17,  18];  Boehmeria tricuspis [ 19];  Brachiaria spp.
3: [ 20,  21];  Citrus spp.
4: [ 22];  Eragrostis curvula [ 23];  Hieracium praealtum [ 24];  Hypericum perforatum [ 25];  Poa pratensis [ 26];  Panicum maximum [ 27];  Paspalum spp.
5: [ 28 31]; and  Pennisetum spp.
6: [ 32 35] used different strategies to reveal the molecular cohorts modulating the trait.
7: Although divergent evolution of apomictic species validates a partially contrasting nature for the detected candidate transcripts, some pathways do seem consistently altered, especially those related to cell cycle and cell division control, ribosome metabolism, RNA processing, signal transduction, hormone signaling and epigenetic mechanisms [ 36].
8: Moreover, long non-coding and antisense RNAs [ 37 41], as well as, small RNAs that target specific transcription factors [ 22,  42 45] are being increasingly recognized as common members of the apomixis cascade.

0: It is well known that the mammary gland is a central organ for milk synthesis, thus, development and metabolism of the mammary gland will affect the production of milk components such as fat and protein.
1: The uptake and utilization of amino acids by the mammary gland also plays an important role in milk protein synthesis and milk yield [ 1, 2].
2: Studies have shown that amino acids are important precursors and signal molecules for the synthesis of milk proteins.
3: Among them, 90% of milk proteins are synthesized from amino acids in mammary epithelial cells [ 3].
4: Amino acids can not only regulate transcription and translation of milk proteins through a variety of signaling cascades [ 4], but also are closely related to the growth and development of the mammary gland and lactation performance [ 2].
5: The proliferation and differentiation of mammary are affected by many factors, such as hormones, vitamins, amino acids and trace elements [ 5].
6: These factors also affect the proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells.
7: For example, arginine, as an essential amino acid for newborns and conditionally-essential for adult mammals, is considered a functional amino acid in the body.
8: It does not only promote the proliferation and differentiation of mammary cells, but also promotes protein biosynthesis [ 6].

0: The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is a critical site for pain transmission and modulation in the central nervous system (CNS).
1: Based on the Rexed classification of transverse spinal sections [ 3], two main divisions of the dorsal horn include the superficial dorsal horn (SDH), composed of laminae I and II, and the deep dorsal horn (DDH), composed of laminae III to VI.
2: The latter is marginally involved in processing noxious stimuli, with neural circuits that are primarily dedicated to processing non-nociceptive somatosensory inputs [ 4].
3: In contrast, the SDH consists of a complex nociceptive network that integrates sensory signals from peripheral nociceptive afferents with local interneuron processing as well as descending efferent modulation from the brain [ 5].
4: Among the afferents that innervate the SDH, peptidergic nociceptive fibers that release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) terminate onto lamina I and the outer portion of lamina II [ 6], with some collaterals that reach deeper laminae [ 7].
5: Therefore, CGRP is an excellent marker of the outermost, nociceptive portion of the SDH.

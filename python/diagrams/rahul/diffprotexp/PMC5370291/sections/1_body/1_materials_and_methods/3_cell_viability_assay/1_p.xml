<p>Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 4 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 24-well plate and cultured for 24 h to allow the cells for attachment. After the TNFÎ± treatment, the supernatant was aspirated and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, the cells were incubated with MTT solution [5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] for 4 h. After the incubation, the supernatant was removed and isopropanol was added. The absorbance at 563 nm solubilized was determined for the solubilized formazan using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX 360 pc, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The cell viability was presented as the percentage as comparing with control. Each treatment was performed in triplicate for statistical analysis.

0: TNF-inhibitor (TNFi) therapies have revolutionised the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for many patients, reducing synovial inflammation and long-term disability attributed to cartilage and bone destruction [ 1 3].
1: Despite their success, up to 40% of patients fail to respond adequately leaving them vulnerable to further disease progression and potential adverse effects of treatment [ 4,  5].
2: In addition, non-response is economically inefficient; the cost of TNFi therapy is estimated to be 300010,000 per patient per year.
3: Thus, early identification of non-responders for switching to an alternative therapy is a research priority for improved long-term outcomes and the responsible use of limited healthcare resources.

0: GC-MS chromatograms were recorded using Shimadzu QP-5000 GC-MS.
1: The GC was equipped with Rtx-5 ms column (30 m long, 0.25 m thickness and 0.250 mm inner diameter).
2: Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
3: Injector temperature was 220 C. Oven temperature was programmed from 50 C (1 min hold) at 5 C/min to 130 C, then at 10 C/min to 250 C and kept isothermally for 15 min.
4: Transfer line temperature was 290 C. For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system, with detector volts of 1.7 KV was used.
5: A scan rate of 0.5 s, and scan speed 1000 amu/s was applied, covering a mass range from 38450 M/Z.

<p id="Par55">Since the tumor immune status is a determinant of mRNA vaccine efficacy, we further characterized the immune cell components in the different subtypes. IS1 and IS2 showed significantly elevated scores of eosinophils, activated CD8 T cells, activated B cells, monocytes and effector memory CD4 T cells compared to IS4 and IS5, while CD56dim NK cells scored higher in IS4 and IS5. This indicated that IS1 and IS2 are immunological “hot”, and IS4 and IS5 are immunological “cold” phenotypes. The molecular signatures of these tumors were consistent with the immune signatures, indicating that patients with different immune subtypes respond distinctly to mRNA vaccine. For instance, IS4 was associated with low expression of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, lymphocyte and stromal fraction and TGF-β response gene signatures, indicating an immunologically cold phenotype. To circumvent poor immunogenicity of these tumors, mRNA vaccines that stimulate the immune system by triggering immune cell infiltrating may be a suitable option. For the immune-cold and immunosuppressive IS5 tumors exhibiting low CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells the least lymphocyte and high stromal fraction and TGF-β signatures, combining the vaccine with ICB or ICD modulators may reinvigorate the immune system and increase immune cell infiltration. IS3 demonstrated moderate immune infiltration and immunosuppressive phenotype with elevated reactive stroma and TGF-β response signatures, and may respond to ICB or other strategies. IS1 and IS2 exhibited a favorable immune-activated phenotype with low stromal fraction and TGF-β response gene expression, and may therefore be responsive to ICB.

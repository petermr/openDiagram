<p>The protein in the peritoneal dialysates (containing 120 
 <italic>μ</italic>g protein) was precipitated with 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in acetone. The precipitates were washed with acetone three times and dissolved in an isoelectric focusing (IEF) rehydration buffer for 2DE analysis. IEF strips (pH 3–10, IPGphor, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) were developed through a stepwise incremental voltage program: 30 V for 16 hr, 500 V for 1 hr, 1000 V for 1 hr, and 8000 V for 4 hr, with a total power of 34 kV hr. Then the strips were subjected to a two-step equilibration in buffers: the first step containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) with 1% w/v dithiothreitol (DTT, Affymetrix/USB, 15395) and for the second step, with 2.5% w/v iodoacetamide (IAA, Amersham Biosciences, RPN6302V). The strips were then transferred onto the second-dimensional SDS-PAGE equipment and developed on 1.0 mm thick gradient (8–16%) polyacrylamide gels at 10°C.

<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics and disease characteristics for each group. Individual tape samples were plotted on the first two principal components of log2 expression for all candidate genes. Using the gene expression data generated in the final analysis, candidate genes were grouped into four gene clusters based on the hierarchical clustering of the consensus of 1000 K-means results, after bootstrapping 80% of samples at each iteration (ConsensusClusterPlus R package). Using pooled data generated from interim analyses and final analyses, gene set scores and differences in gene set scores among disease groups were estimated using a linear mixed-effects model, with fixed effects for sample type and random intercepts for genes and samples. P values from multiple comparisons were adjusted using Tukey’s correction. Spearman’s correlations and associated p values were calculated to determine the associations between biomarkers from skin tape-derived RNA and IHC based on skin biopsies.</p>

<p>The lipoproteins of mycoplasmas are considered the primary proinflammatory substances [
 <xref rid="cit0207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. It was originally believed that the lipid structure at the N-terminal of lipoproteins is the structure behind the inflammatory effect and the foundation for TLR2/6 recognition. Increasing evidence shows that in addition to TLR2 and TLR6, TLR1 and TLR4 are both involved in the identification of mycoplasmas [
 <xref rid="cit0282" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0303" ref-type="bibr">303</xref>]. TLR1/2 primarily recognizes bacterial triacylated lipoproteins, while TLR4 primarily recognizes LPS [
 <xref rid="cit0304" ref-type="bibr">304</xref>]. Nevertheless, the presence of N-acyltransferase has not been reported in the mycoplasma genome [
 <xref rid="cit0280" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. Thus, the existence of triacylated lipoproteins in mycoplasmas upon a lipoprotein recognition by TLR1 and TLR2 is not conclusive, unless any direct evidence is obtained by chemical composition identification coupled with mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.

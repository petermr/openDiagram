<p>In the third temperature range from 300 °C to 250 °C, the precipitation reaction with the highest heat flow peak took place at the soaking temperature of 290 °C and after a period of about 105 s (
 <xref rid="f9-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>). In the temperature range of 300 °C to 250 °C, all other peak values are smaller and occur at a later point in time. At 290 °C and 300 °C, the peak values are reached relatively fast, whereas the heat flow curve at 280 °C already shows a significantly more sluggish precipitation reaction. For example, between 290 °C and 280 °C, the difference in the peak time is about 500 s (roughly a factor of 5). At the temperature of 280 °C, it seems that the precipitation was not finished after 30 min, which causes uncertainties in evaluation. At the soaking temperature of 250 °C, the precipitation signal was hardly measureable with the device used in its applied configuration.

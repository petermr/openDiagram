<p>Several lines of evidence suggest that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> homozygous or heterozygous variants are associated with an increased risk of developing PD. A study on brain samples from 57 subjects clinically diagnosed with PD demonstrated that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants were present in 12 cases (21%), and these were more frequent amongst younger subjects (

 <italic>GBA</italic> variants were identified in 31 cases (31%), and that patients carrying the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants were younger than those who were not carriers (

 <italic>GBA</italic> variants of &gt;5,000 patients with PD, 2 known 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants, L444P and N370S, were commonly associated with PD in all ethnic groups (
 <xref rid="b13-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, each population also had unique variants (
 <xref rid="b10-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="b12-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="b14-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="b15-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In Thailand, heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants were reported in 24 out of 480 patients with PD (5%), including L444P (c.1448T&gt;C), IVS10-9_10GT&gt;AG, P428S (c.1399C&gt;T), N386K (c.1275C&gt;A), V398fsX404 (c.1309delG), IVS2+1G&gt;A and IVS9+3G&gt;C (
 <xref rid="b10-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Previous studies on various populations suggested that 5-10% of patients with PD had 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants, although the percentage was much greater in the Ashkenazi population, whereas the frequency of GBA variants in the control (non-PD) population was as low as 0.5% (

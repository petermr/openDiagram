<p>The specific excess heat capacity is obtained here by measuring an alloyed sample versus a reference sample with similar heat capacity. The specific excess heat capacity is then defined to be the difference between the specific heat capacity of the alloyed sample and that of an inert reference sample. In an ideal situation, the reference and the alloy sample have highly similar absolute heat capacities over the entire temperature range of interest. Another requirement for the reference sample is that it must be inert with respect to thermal reactions within the temperature range of interest. It may be difficult to find appropriate reference material, but in the case of Al alloys, pure Al has proven to be very well suited [

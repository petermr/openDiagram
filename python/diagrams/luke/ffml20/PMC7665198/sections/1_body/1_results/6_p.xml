<p id="Par9">If one H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecule per (MMA/nBA) repeat unit accelerates self-healing of a hydrophobic copolymer, the question is what inter- and intrachain interactions are responsible for this behavior. Taking advantage of the ability of MD simulations to visually assess conformational changes, p(MMA/nBA) copolymer chains with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>w</sub> = 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 were extracted and analyzed. While Supplementary Information (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>) provides further details, when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>w</sub> = 1:1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), not only interchain distances are smaller (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), but a larger fraction (~42%) of nBA side groups takes L-shape conformations compared to 1:2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and 2:1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) H
 <sub>2</sub>O:MMA/nBA ratios (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Molar fraction of L-shaped nBA side groups and CE
 <sub>vdW</sub> changes plotted as a function of # of H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules in p(MMA/nBA) copolymers with 60/40 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A1</xref>), 50/50 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B1</xref>), and 40/60 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C1</xref>) monomer molar ratios shows that the highest fraction of L-shaped nBA side groups coincides with the maximum of CE

 <sub>w</sub> = 1:1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–B2</xref>). When approaching 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>w</sub> = 1, H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules begin to form small clusters between the chains, resulting in self-H-bonding that causes conformational changes of nBA enhancing vdW interaction and accelerated self-healing. The same phenomenon of accelerated self-healing in the presence of H
 <sub>2</sub>O was observed for even more hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate/n-pentyl acrylate) [p(MMA/nBA)] copolymer with a 50/50 MMA/nPA molar ratio in p(MMA/nPA) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>, air-cut/air-healed (A1–A5) and air-cut/water-healed films (B1–B5)).

<p>The mechanism of the interaction between MAM and HLA-DR is becoming increasingly apparent. MAM binds to HLA-DR molecules located in the proximity of the binding groove in a Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-binding site at the MAM N-terminus permits dimer formation, MAM homodimerization and MHC class II dimerization/oligomerization. This induces conformational change and exposes MHC class II- and TCR-binding epitopes, resulting in a high affinity combined with HLA-DR, and ultimately induces considerable T cell activation [

 <sup>2+</sup> has been reported at the interface of the MAM/HLA-DR1 complex or the MAM homodimer [
 <xref rid="cit0288" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]. In solution, MAM can form a homodimer at high protein concentrations, irrespective of the presence of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> [
 <xref rid="cit0294" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>], demonstrating that conformational changes in MAM are independent of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>. Subsequently, Li et al. clarified that Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> can efficiently induce the dimerization of the HLA-DR1/HA complex, and then synergistically combine with MAM in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to form a dimerized MAM/MHC class II complex [

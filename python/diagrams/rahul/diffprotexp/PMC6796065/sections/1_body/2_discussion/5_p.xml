<p id="Par14">The present study performed on brain samples has several limitations that require further attention. First, confounding effects of disease-related factors including medication may have affected the expression of DARPP-32, CaN, or both. Although we did not observe any effects of antipsychotic drugs on the levels of DARPP-32 or CaN expression in this study, additional animal studies are necessary to investigate the effects of chronic antipsychotic administration on the expression of these proteins in the PFC and NAc. Second, our study population was relatively small, especially for a genetic study. In addition, we could not uniformly sample from group with sufficient equilibrium because the NAc was a relatively small area and there were a small number of NAc available. As a result, several genotypes in this study including rs1801028 were not two in Hardyâ€“Weinberg Equilibrium. The findings must be, therefore, confirmed via postmortem examination of a larger brain cohort.</p>

0: Therefore, in this study, we investigated the expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN proteins in PFC and NAc, regions that receive dopaminergic input and are considered to be affected in schizophrenia.
1: This analysis was performed in 49 postmortem samples from subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and control subjects (Table  1) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
2: Moreover, we analyzed the associations between this expression and genetic variants of dopaminergic signaling-associated molecules for 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a much larger set of postmortem samples to examine the potential involvement of genetic variants in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

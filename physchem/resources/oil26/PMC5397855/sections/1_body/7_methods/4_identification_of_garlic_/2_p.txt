0: The compounds were identified using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass detector GC/MS (GCMS-QP 5050 A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
1: The injector and detector temperatures were 220 C and 300 C, respectively.
2: The initial column temperature was 40 C for 3 min, with a programmed temperature increase of 3 C/min to 300 C where it was maintained for 25 min.
3: The split mode ratio was 1:10.
4: One microliter of the garlic essential oil containing 1% (w/v in dichloromethane) was injected, helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate constant of 1.8 mL 1 on the Rtx -5MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm  0.25 m; Bellefonte, USA) using the Crossbond  stationary phase (35% diphenyl-65% dimethyl polysiloxane).
5: Mass spectrometer was programmed to detect masses in the range of 29450 Da with 70 eV ionization energy.
6: Compounds were identified by comparisons of the mass spectra with those available in the NIST08, NIST11 library and Wiley Spectroteca Data Base (7 th edition), and by the Retention indices.

<p id="Par73">During the first step of iPSC commitment to a neuronal lineage, multiple glutamate receptors were altered, notably, gene expression levels of two ionotropic glutamate receptors were upregulated in the NSCs, 
 <italic>GRIA1</italic> and 
 <italic>GRIK1</italic>, while their paralog genes, 
 <italic>GRIA4</italic> and 
 <italic>GRIK4</italic>, were downregulated. This suggests a specific requirement for type 1 ionotropic glutamate receptors early in neuronal development. Neuromedin and apelin receptors (
 <italic>NMUR2</italic> and 
 <italic>APLNR</italic>) were upregulated in NSCs, as well as GPCR response to sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling receptor (
 <italic>S1PR1</italic>), suggesting changes in cytoskeleton dynamics and mitosis [

 <italic>CNR1</italic>and 
 <italic>CHRNB4</italic>) were upregulated during the conversion of NSCs into MNPs and remained activated until eMNs were formed.

0: Dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32), also known as phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 regulatory subunit 1B (PPP1R1B), is a key molecule that integrates dopaminergic signaling into that of several other neurotransmitters, such as a glutamate 1.
1: Phosphorylated DARPP-32 regulates the physiological activities of various proteins 2.
2: Calcineurin (CaN) is located downstream of dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling and inactivates DARPP-32 by dephosphorylation 3.
3: CaN has also been associated with synaptic plasticity 4 and neural cell apoptosis 5.
4: It has been reported that the CaN inhibitor tacrolimus induces psychotic side effects such as hallucinations, anxiety, paranoid delusions, dissociative fugues, and manic-like psychosis 6  8.
5: Therefore, elucidating the signaling pathway that involves DARPP-32 and CaN may be critical to understanding schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.

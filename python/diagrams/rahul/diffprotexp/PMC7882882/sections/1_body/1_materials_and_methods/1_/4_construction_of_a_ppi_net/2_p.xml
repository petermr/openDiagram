<p>First, a PPI subnetwork was generated by mapping all the DEGs and extracting them from the PPI network. To improve reliability, network reconstruction was limited to the first interacting protein neighbors of these DEGs. Second, the DEG-adjacent protein axis was detected, and a DEG-central PPI network was constructed. Third, after mapping all DEGs to the PPI network to detect internal interactions between the DEGs, Cytoscape was used to select nodes with all edges to create a subnetwork. The single-node and self-interactions of proteins in these subnets were deleted. Pearson's correlation test was used to calculate the coexpression relationships between lncRNAs and PCGs, and the coexpression relationships with a P&lt;0.05 and a Pearson coefficient absolute value of &gt;0.9 were selected. Finally, an lncRNA-mRNA network related to NFPA composed of differential genes was obtained. The PPI-lncRNA network was visualized using Cytoscape, and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) (
 <xref rid="b38-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) was used to identify important modules in the PPI network. The key modules and hub genes were further analyzed and visualized using the MCODE plugin in Cytoscape. The screening criteria for module genes were as follows: Degree cut-off, 2; node score cut-off, 0.2; k score, 2; and maximum depth, 100.

<p>In this paper, LSTH of AISI 4130 was performed by Nd:YAG pulsed laser with a maximum power of 400 W. The effects of laser focal point position, laser pulse width, and LSS were investigated after LSTH of AISI 4130 alloy steel. The microstructure was analyzed by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscope. Moreover, Vickers micro-hardness tests were carried out in the transversal section. The results of LSTH were compared with those obtained by furnace heat treatment.</p>

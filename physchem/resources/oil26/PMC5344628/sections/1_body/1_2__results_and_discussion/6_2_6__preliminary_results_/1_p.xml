<p>The stability of the chitosan/essential oil emulsions was sustained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, which showed a main particle population with low dimensions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f011">Figure 11</xref>), with the distribution showing, in the low dimension range, a single peak and a polydispersity index (PDI)-approached value of 1.0 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00045-t007">Table 7</xref>). The chitosan/essential oil emulsions contain two kinds of particle populations: the first one is very small, where 
 <italic>d</italic> = 5 nm for the chitosan solution and 11–70 (350) nm for the emulsion containing EOs, and the second contains larger particles of 850 nm for CS and 2500–8800 nm for CS/EOs emulsions. Oils are probably concentrated around CS particles because of aggregation.

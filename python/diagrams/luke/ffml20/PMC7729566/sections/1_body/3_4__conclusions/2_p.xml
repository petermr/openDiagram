<p>The [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system was applied to the treatment of real waste NiMH battery black mass, with the integration of the leaching and separation steps achieved by the simple addition of water to the leachate yielding a biphasic regime that allows one of the phases to become enriched in Co(II). Both the leaching and metal separation steps are selective for Co(II) against Ni(II), Mn(II) and the rare earth elements. Furthermore, extraction in the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH presents an interesting selectivity for Co(II) against Fe(III). However, additional separation steps are required for the separation of Co(II) from Zn(II) and Mn(II). The close to fourfold concentration of Co(II) from leaching to separation in a single solution through the simple addition of water greatly simplifies downstream purification and provides a guideline for metal process intensification in other alternative solvents such as DES.

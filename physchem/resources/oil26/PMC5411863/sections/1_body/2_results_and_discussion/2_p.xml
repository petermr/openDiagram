<p>The essential oil consists mainly of monoterpene hydrocarbons (88.44-95.58%) followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (0.42-4.89%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (0.45-3.08%). Moreover, levels of phenolic compounds in A essential oil were also detected in a higher percentage (1.5%) than other localities (0.17-0.22%). Essential oils from A and B localities contain higher oxygenated monoterpenes (2.15% for A oil and 3.08% for B oil) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (1.96% A oil and 4.89% for B oil). The predominant compounds were a-Pinene accounting for 27.87% (B) to 61.94% (C) and and β-Pinene 24.92% (C) to 36.46 % (A) of the total oil of 
 <italic>K. anatolica</italic>. Other major compounds were α-Thujene (2.66 to 8.15%), l-Limonene (1.83 to 8.23%), α-Phellandrene (1.85 to 5.01%) and camphene (1.02 to 1.87%). The results indicated that there were significant differences between the contents of main components: a-Pinene (p&lt;0.01), β-Pinene (p≤0.05), a-Phellandrene (p&lt;0.05), a-Thujene (p&lt;0.01) and l-Limonene (p&lt;0.01) in oils (

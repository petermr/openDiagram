 <caption> (a) White line region of Pt L 3-edge XANES data for Al 2O 3-supported Pt 22 NPs in H 2 atmosphere at pressures from 1 up to 21 bar. Spectra for a Pt foil and Pt NPs in He are also shown for comparison. (b) Difference spectra corresponding to different pressures, calculated by subtracting the spectrum acquired in He atmosphere. (c) H/Pt ratio calculated from the area of peak B in the difference spectra, compared with theoretical H/Pt ratios from ref ( 291). The proposed Pt 22 NP model shapes are shown in the inset.

The shift in the Pt L 3-edge XANES peak shown in panel (a) correlates with the (d) hydrogen-coverage-dependent shift of the center of unoccupied d-band states, as obtained in DFT simulations.

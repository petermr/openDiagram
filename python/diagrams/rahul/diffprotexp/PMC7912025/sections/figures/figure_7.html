 <caption> AS of NFκB/RelA and interferon regulatory factor (IRF7) mRNAs. Integrated Genomic Browser view of pile-up of short-read RNA sequencing (Short, in gray) and individual transcripts (SMRT) for ( A) RelA and ( B) IRF7. Genome organization detailing intron–exon boundaries are indicated in dark blue at the bottom. The abundance of short-read sequencing is a most reliable estimate of relative expression levels. Note the presence of exon exclusion, exon skipping, and intron inclusion in transcripts quantified by SMRT sequencing. </caption>

<p>DNA methylation is relatively associated with the development of cancer within the human body (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019</xref>). From our data, it was evident that the promoter methylation of the COL11A1 gene is overexpressed in the colon cancer tissue than that of the normal tissue, and is negatively regulated for all other clinicopathological parameters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2G–L</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). It is reflected that along with the development of cancer stages and nodal metastasis status, the expression of promoter methylation decreases in the tissues (Stage 1 &gt; Stage 2 &gt; Stage 3; N0 &gt; N1 &gt; N2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2H,K</xref>). These results indicate that the promoter methylation is negatively associated with the expression of COL11A1 mRNA, and the hypermethylation of the promoter of COL11A1 may inhibit COL11A1 in upgrading cancer development.

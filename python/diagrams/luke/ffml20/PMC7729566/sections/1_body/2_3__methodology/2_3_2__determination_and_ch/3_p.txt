0: The composition of the equilibrium phases for selected mixture points at 323 K was experimentally determined.
1: The mixtures were gravimetrically prepared, agitated and left to separate for 12 h under temperature control.
2: The equilibrium phases were carefully separated to determine the respective concentration of IL, CH 3COOH and water in each phase.
3: All mixing points were made in duplicate.
4: DLS measurements were performed to evaluate the variation in [P 44414] + aggregate size as a function of CH 3COOH concentration.
5: A constant [P 44414]Cl concentration of 20.0 wt.% was used in all DLS measurements, corresponding to the micellar regime of this surfactant [ 38].
6: Samples were irradiated with a HeNe laser ( = 565 nm) and the intensity fluctuations of the scattered light were detected at a backscattering angle of 173 to generate an autocorrelation function.
7: The autocorrelation function was corrected from the default settings for deionized water by adjusting for the solution viscosity (3.586 cP) and refractive index (1.3324).
8: The cumulant analysis of this function provided by the software DTS v 7.03 yielded the particle size and the distribution width.
9: Each composition tested was analyzed three times to ensure the formation of stable aggregates.
10: Ultrapure water was used in all analyses.

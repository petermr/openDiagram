<p>The analysis of the m6A methylation distribution at different chromosome loci found that the chromosomes with the most m6A methylation were chromosome 1 with 1365 m6A methylation peaks, chromosome 2 with 922 m6A methylation peaks and chromosome 19 with 976 m6A methylation peaks, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">C</xref>). Then, by comparing the m6A methylation levels, we found an average of 12,658 peaks in the control group and 12,599 peaks in the TNF‐α group, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2D</xref>). The analysis of the degree of enrichment of m6A methylation showed that the average logarithmic fold-enrichment of the control group was 4.91, while that of the TNF-α group was 5.19 (

0: In the present study, we applied state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methodologies such as sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra (SWATH-MS) to quantify the protein profiles in the hemolymph of  B.  siamensis goniomphalos experimentally infected with  O.  viverrini.
1: SWATH-MS, a novel technique in mass spectrometry, has recently shown excellent quantitation precision [ 38].
2: This technique combines the advantage of precise quantitative accuracy of traditional shotgun proteomics and reproducibility of targeted data analysis similar to that obtained with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) [ 39 41].
3: The SWATH-MS technique is performed in two separate steps.
4: The first step (called label-free shotgun or data dependent acquisition (DDA) involves a label-free shotgun approach to create a library of precursors and transitions that are used in a second step (called data independent acquisition DIA) to quantify proteins in a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) approach from any other sample [ 38].
5: In addition, this technique has been used for the identification and proteome-wide quantification of the different proteins in a complex protein sample [ 38,  41].
6: While the use of labeled quantitative proteomics techniques such as iTRAQ in  Bythinia- Opisthorchis interactions has proven to be valuable [ 29], the SWATH-MS technique is a compelling alternative to iTRAQ for protein quantitation of complex mixtures [ 42].
7: By characterizing the differential protein expression in the hemolymph of fluke-infected  B.  siamensis goniomphalos we have shed light on the molecular basis of the early stages of snail-parasite interactions, and provided information that might lead to the development of novel intervention tools to control parasite transmission by targeting the snail host stage.

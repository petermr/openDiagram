<p id="p0185">The second functional group included only one GO term: aldo-keto reductase (NADP) activity. The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily comprises several enzymes that catalyze redox transformations involved in biosynthesis, intermediary metabolism, and detoxification [

 <italic>AKR1C3</italic> gene could significantly enhance sensitivity to radiation therapy in non-small cell lung cancer cells [

 <italic>AKR1C3</italic> also increased radioresistance of prostate and esophageal cancer cells [

 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Meanwhile, increased aldehyde reductase expression mediates acquired radioresistance of laryngeal cancer via p53-related mechanism [

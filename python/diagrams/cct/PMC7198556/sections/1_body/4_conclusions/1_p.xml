   <p id="Par21">The temperature history at given points on or slightly below the surface of a surface hardened part can be reconstructed based on microstructural features found by a post-mortem microscopy study provided that a time-temperature austenitisation diagram of the material, which has been recorded for process relevant cooling rates, is available.</p>
  </list-item>

   <p id="Par22">FEM simulations of the thermal problem can be validated by comparing the calculated temperature field with those reconstructed temperatures. Unknown simulation parameters such as surface to air heat transfer coefficients can inversely be determined by an iterative approach.</p>

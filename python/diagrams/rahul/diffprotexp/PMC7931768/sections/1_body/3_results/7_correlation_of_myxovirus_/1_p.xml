<p>As the traditional method of assessing biomarkers in CLE lesions is punch biopsy followed by IHC, we selected three tissue-based protein biomarkers of CLE activity for comparison with IFN-associated and CLE-associated gene clusters from skin tape-derived RNA. We performed IHC on biopsies taken at the same site as the CLE-A skin tape-derived RNA samples for the following: MXA (annotated as MX1 in RNA clusters), an IFN modulated protein; CD45, for inflammatory infiltrates and CD303 (BDCA-2), a receptor uniquely expressed on pDCs. On images derived from IHC slides, we annotated epidermis and dermis, and compared immunoreactive tissue area for each biomarker by disease group (

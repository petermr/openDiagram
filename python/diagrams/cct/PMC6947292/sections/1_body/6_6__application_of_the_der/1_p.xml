<p>The methodology for heating and cooling DSC described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-materials-12-04083">Section 2</xref> has been applied to analyse a range of solid-solid phase transformations in other metallic alloy systems. For instance, quench-induced precipitation in magnesium alloys [
 <xref rid="B123-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] and the tempering of steels have been analysed [

 <xref rid="B222-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. Recently, the DSC method for the analysis of solid-solid phase transformation kinetics was successfully adapted for use with high-temperature alloys up to 1100 Â°C [

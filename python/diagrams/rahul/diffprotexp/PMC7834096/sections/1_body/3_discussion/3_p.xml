<p>We further investigated the composition of the bacterial aggregates that are formed when the same, different, or no AAF fimbriae were expressed by EAEC strain 55989

However, the interactions of the highly positively charged major fimbrial subunits with known receptors, e.g. fibronectin and the transmembrane mucin MUC1, were proposed to be solely based on electrostatic interactions and therefore rather unspecific [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, dispersin was originally suggested to counteract the hyperaggregative phenotype of 
 <italic>aap</italic>-negative bacteria by preventing the collapse of the positively charged fimbriae on the negatively charged bacterial surface [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Such electrostatic interactions of the heterologously expressed fimbriae with the cell surface of the AAF-negative isogenic strain were therefore anticipated. In this context, we further observed that bacteria formed mixed aggregates when combinations of different AAF were expressed, albeit generally less homogeneous as bacteria expressing the same AAF subtype. This suggests that AAF mediate specific bacteria–bacteria interactions, which may be mediated by the minor fimbrial subunit. This assumption is supported by the very well mixed aggregates formed by AAF/III and AAF/V that possess identical minor subunits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>) as opposed to rather patchy types of aggregates formed by, e.g., AAF/III- and AAF/I-expressing bacteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>). In order to clarify this question, it will be necessary to analyze the aggregates formed by bacteria that express hybrid AAF operons.

<p>The LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, an NMP solution in polyvinylidene fluoride, and conductive carbon black (super C) were mixed evenly according to a mass ratio of 8:1:1, doctor-bladed on aluminum foil, predried at 60 °C, transferred to a vacuum drying oven, and then dried overnight at 120 °C. The dry electrode pieces are punched into a circular electrode with a diameter of 12 mm, and the thickness is 15 μm. The CR2025 half-cells were fabricated with the LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> cathode, lithium foil anode, 1 mol L
 <sup>–1</sup> LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in 1:1 EC/DEC as the electrolyte, and Celgard 2400 as the separator in an argon-filled glovebox.

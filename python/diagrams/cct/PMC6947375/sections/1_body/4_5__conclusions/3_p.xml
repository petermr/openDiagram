<p>(2) The morphology and size of cementite particles varied with different processes, especially the size distribution. After spherodizing annealing, the partially undissolved particles exhibited as elongated and irregular shapes because of the incomplete dissolution and unevenly distribution of cementite. The average size of cementite was the smallest at 450 nm, with the smallest ratio of large particles at 12%. In contrast, the average sizes of cementite after cold rolling and cold drawing were large at 630 nm and 600 nm because of the elongation along the rolling/drawing direction. The ratio of large particles was 25% and 28% after cold rolling and cold drawing, respectively.</p>

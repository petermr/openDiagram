0: In this paper, the open-circuit voltage of the LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4/Li half-cell at different discharge states and different temperatures is measured.
1: As temperature increases, the open-circuit voltage decreases linearly in turn.
2: The d E/d TSOD relation curves are fitted by the least square method, and the entropy change values of different SODs are calculated based on the fitted values.
3: The  S values do not change much in 0% to 80% SOD but change dramatically when the SOD is over 80%.
4: Further, the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy change in different SODs are obtained.
5: The electrode reaction of LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4 was discussed by the entropy change in different SODs.
6: According to the evolution trend of  S, the lithium intercalation reaction of LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4 may be a single-phase solid solution reaction rather than a two-phase reaction.
7: In this system, the reversible heat generation shows cooling and heating effect in the charging and discharging process, respectively.

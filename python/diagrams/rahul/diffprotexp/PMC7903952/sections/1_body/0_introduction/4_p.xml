<p>In this study, we first found that LINC00466 could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. Using bioinformatic analyses, we found that LINC00466 may affects glioma cells through miR-137/PPP1R14B axis. Based on this, we aimed to investigate the expression, functional role, TMZ resistance and underlying mechanism of LINC00466 in glioma. Our results suggest LINC00466 can affect cell viability and TMZ resistance of glioma cells by regulating miR-137/PPP1R14B axis.</p>

0: The essential oil obtained was extracted from the powdered flower (376.86 g) for 3 h with a modified hydro-distillation Clevengers-type apparatus as described by Omoruyi et al., [ 24].
1: The hydro-distillation experiment was carried out thrice to obtain enough oil for bioactivity assays and the extracted essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, dispensed into tinted vials and stored at 4 C.

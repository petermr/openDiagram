<p>On the other hand, in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> exposed to osmotic stress, spots containing proteins, like chaperonin 21, 30S ribosomal protein S5 family protein and chlorophyll a-b binding 8, decrease in intensity, while spots containing polyubiquitin 2 increase. These proteins are all involved in protein synthesis and degradation, are located in the chloroplast and have been reported to be affected by abiotic stress [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-ijms-14-04912">78</xref>]. The molecular chaperones that belong to the chaperonin family are essential components that are required for the folding of proteins within cells. Chaperonin 21 has been reported to act as co-chaperonin, helping chaperonin 60, whose function is to facilitate the assembly of RuBisCO [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80-ijms-14-04912">80</xref>]. The 30S ribosomal protein S5 family is one of the plastid-specific ribosomal proteins, directly implicated in the translation of RNA into the plastids. Chloroplast transcription-translation has evolved numerous additional control elements to achieve its highly effective coordination between photosynthetic protein requirements and the ribosome function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81-ijms-14-04912">81</xref>]. Proteins of this translation machinery are integral components of the adaptation to desiccation stress, as the enhancement of the translation machinery would allow for expression of cellular stress response proteins under dehydration, where rates of protein production significantly and progressively decline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76-ijms-14-04912">76</xref>]. Protein degradation is important in the reorganization of plant metabolism under stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82-ijms-14-04912">82</xref>]. The ubiquitins have been shown to have a role in the turnover of proteins in chloroplast, including photosynthesis-and carbon fixation-related proteins [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84-ijms-14-04912">84</xref>]. Our results indicate that plastid-specific protein synthesis is inhibited, and degradation is facilitated under osmotic stress condition in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> and suggests a more pronounced stress-related response in this species, as compared to Désirée.

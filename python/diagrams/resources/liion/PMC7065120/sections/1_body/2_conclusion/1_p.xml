<p>In conclusion, given the new family of 3d transition‐metal carbodiimides which have experimentally turned out as excellent candidates for Li‐ and Na‐ion batteries, we have demonstrated the first computational attempt to model its electrochemical mechanism. A first‐principles study on the conversion‐reaction mechanism of the archetype FeNCN with Li and Na during charge/discharge has been performed by simulating a total of 61 (54) configurations of Li–Fe–NCN (Na–Fe–NCN) ternaries. Based on their structures, spin‐polarized PBE+
 <italic>U</italic> calculations gave access to voltage profiles which agree nicely with experiment for both full (LIB) and partial (NIB) discharge. The origins of the energetically preferred structures adopted in the intermediate compounds were rationalized by chemical‐bonding analysis. Additionally, the continuously lowering voltage profile was also mirrored in the COHP progression and the Mulliken charge transfer. Operando XAS analysis performed during the lithiation of FeNCN substantiates the results of these calculations, confirming the formation of an intermediate species with a structure compatible with the theoretically predicted transient phase Li
 <sub>2</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>(NCN)
 <sub>3</sub>. Finally, this study offers a new challenge to chemists in the preparation of metastable Li–Fe–NCN intermediates.

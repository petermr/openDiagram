<p id="Par19">Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) analysis was conducted using Agilent Carry 680 μATR-FTIR single-beam spectrometer set at 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> resolution with 64 scans/spectrum (19). To analyze the water content of a damaged copolymer as a function of exposure time, 50/50 p(MMA/nBA) 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.03-cm films were damaged (20 vertical and horizontal cuts ~30–50 μm in depth) and were allowed to heal in water.

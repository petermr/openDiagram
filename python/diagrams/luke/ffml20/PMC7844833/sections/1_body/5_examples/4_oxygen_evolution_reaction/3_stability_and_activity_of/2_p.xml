<p>Ru- and Ir-based catalysts are the most common OER catalysts, especially in acidic media.

 </sup> The activity of metallic Ru and Ir is higher than that of the respective oxides, but they show low stability under reaction conditions and therefore, oxide materials are typically used instead. More importantly, RuO
 <sub>2</sub> with a rutile-type structure is more active, but less stable than IrO
 <sub>2</sub> with the same structure. It should be noted that the dissolution of the catalyst has been previously associated with its oxidation to a higher oxidation state (&gt;4+).

  <p>Cell inhibition rate. (A) Cell inhibition rates of the Caki-1 and pENTR™/U6 cell lines. The inhibitory rate of the cells did not differ significantly between the two groups. (B) Cell inhibition rates of the Caki-1 and shRNA-XIAP-1 cell lines. Except at a concentration of 1 µg/ml, cell inhibition rates exhibited a statistically significant difference between the two groups at all other concentrations. (C) Cell inhibition rates of the pENTR/U6 and shRNA-XIAP-1 cell lines. There was a statistically significant difference between the cell inhibition rates of the two groups. shRNA, short hairpin RNA; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein.</p>

  <p>Analysis of baseline skin HA content at varying ages. (A) HA content in dorsal skin of mice, as measured with ELISA-like assay, is noted to progress with age, with dips in expression at 8 and 24 weeks of age, particularly in female mice. (B) Relatively constant level of HA is noted in murine ventral skin in both sexes. HA levels in each mouse skin are plotted, with red dots indicating male and blue dots indicating female mice. Black line represents average HA (ng/µg of protein) of both male and female mice. 
   <italic>n</italic> = 30 mice (2–3 male and 2–3 female mice) per age group.

<p>The DNA modifications include C5-methylcytosine (5mC), N6-methyladenine (6mA), and N4-methylcytosine (4mC) [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are some other DNA modifications as the O6-methylguanine (O6-mG), N7-methylguanine (7mG) or N3-methyladenine (N3mA) that are believed to be cause by endogenous and/or environmental alkylating agents [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and are emerging as important markers with adverse effects. 5mC methylation is the most abundant and studied. As mentioned, in plants, the 5mC presence ranges from 5 to 30% depending on the species [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], while others, as the 6mA levels are less than 0.8% in eukaryotes and in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been reported as less than 0.2% [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In plants, the 5mC DNA methylation exists in three different sequence contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH. The CG context takes place in dinucleotides C and G, and it is called symmetrical context. For the CHG and CHH contexts, the H can be any base as A, T, or C [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The accumulation of DNA methylation in all contexts results in chromatin condensation and, therefore, gene silencing [

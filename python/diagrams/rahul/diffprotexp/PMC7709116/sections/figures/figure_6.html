 <caption> Go-annotation enrichment for cell type-specific clusters. ( A) Enriched pathways and their p-values were obtained from the Fisher exact test &lt; 0.05 in Perseus. D1 cell type displays protein expression changes broadly associated with spliceosome, cell differentiation, metabolic pathways, and other biological pathways listed in this figure. ( B) D2 cell type displays protein expression changes broadly associated with protein processing, inositol phosphate metabolism, protein maturation, and other biological pathways listed in this figure. </caption>

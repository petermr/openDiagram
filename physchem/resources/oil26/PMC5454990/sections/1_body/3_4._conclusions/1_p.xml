The main class of chemical compounds displayed a good correlation with chloroplast DNA region (<italic>matK</italic> gene) analysis. However, the analysis of phylogenetic data and specific chemical compounds showed differences. These results suggest that <italic>matK</italic> gene was not efficient for representing this relationship.</p>

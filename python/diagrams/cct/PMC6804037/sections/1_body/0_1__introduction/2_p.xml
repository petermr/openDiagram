<p>Interesting results were obtained in different studies on LSTH. Lo et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-12-03136" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] worked on AISI 440C LSTH. They demonstrated that this method could be better than a furnace at localized heat treatment. Dumiterscu et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-03136" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] investigated the fiber laser surface heat treatment of AISI D2 steel. The advantages of this process were (1) catastrophic fracture of the used carbide tools could be removed, (2) tool life was improved, (3) chatter of machining and formation of saw tooth chips could be prevented, and (4) the thrust part of the cutting force was decreased. Mahmoodi et al. carried out LSTH of AISI 420 by techniques of Nd:YAG laser; hardness in depth and width of the hardened zone, overlapping of laser treatment lines, and corrosion resistance were investigated [

 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-03136" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] analyzed the effect of LSTH on pure titanium surfaces. They concluded that the heat input had an important role in the geometrical dimension of the resulting hardened layer. In another study, Moradi et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-03136" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] made a high power diode LSTH of AISI 4130 steel by carbon coating and observed high micro-hardness in the carbon coated treated zone. Comparison of wear resistance of a laser processed sample and the base material demonstrated the advantage of the laser treatment.

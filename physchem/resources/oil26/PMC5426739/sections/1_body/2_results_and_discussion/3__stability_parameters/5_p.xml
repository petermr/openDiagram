Temperature had a large effect on the PV of the samples. Oxidation at low temperature was almost two times less than that at high temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Only the 55:30:15 ratio mixture had a higher PV (16 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg) after storage at room temperature. It was observed that blends containing high amounts of flaxseed oil could be stored at low temperatures for a long period of time.</p>

0: In this work we report the results acquired from molecular dynamics simulations as well as the optimization of different generations of polyamidoamine dendrimer.
1: The analysis data revealed synthesized dendrimer as a suitable nanostructured candidate suitable for neutral as well as charged molecule delivery due to the presence of both electrostatic potential and van der Waals forces.
2: The methyl ester terminating groups of half-generation dendrimers with characteristic IR peaks for carbonyl at 1670.41 cm  1 tends to shift to 1514.17 cm  1 on conversion to amide group of full-generation dendrimer.
3: The study includes the usage of detailed analysis, demonstrating how molecular dynamics affect the dendrimer complexation.
4: The present investigations provide an unprecedented insight into the computational and experimental system that may be of general significance for the clinical application of dendrimers.

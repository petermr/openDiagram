<p>TREM1 is an important regulator of innate immunity that promotes the amplification of inflammatory signals initiated by TLRs and NOD-like receptors [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. TREM1 has been characterized as a major player in the pathophysiology of acute inflammatory diseases of different etiologies such as acute myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. TREM1 is an immune receptor expressed on innate immune cells, such as neutrophils, mature monocytes, macrophages [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and platelets [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. TREM1 is also expressed on lung alveolar macrophages, and this tissue-specific pattern of expression has suggested a potential role for this molecule in the activation of local inflammatory response during lung infections [

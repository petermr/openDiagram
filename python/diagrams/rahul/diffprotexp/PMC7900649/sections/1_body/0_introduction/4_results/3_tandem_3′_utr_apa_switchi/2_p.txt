0: We identified 196, 146, 470, 416, 209, 81 and 75 APA switching genes at 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 hpi, respectively (Fig.
1: 3a), among which 171 genes switched to longer 3 UTR, 273 genes switched to shorter, while 360 genes showed dynamic switching of 3 UTR length at different time points, which suggests that these dynamic switching genes may play an active role in the hostpathogen interaction (Fig.
2: 3b).
3: According to the tandem APA switching genes at different time points, we found that 3 UTR tended to be shortened at the early stage after infection, while the number of genes with lengthened 3 UTR increased at 710 hpi (Fig.
4: 3a), which were consistent with previous research [ 15].
5: Then we investigated the biological processes of the tandem 3 UTR APA switching genes and found that most genes were involved with cellular process, metabolic process and response to stimulus etc., few genes were involved in immune system process (Fig.
6: 3c).
7: After pathway enrichment, the genes with highly significant  p values were mainly involved with spliceosome, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Epstein-Barr virus infection, endocytosis pathway etc.
8: (Fig.
9: 3d).
10: For immune response after PEDV infection, several associated pathways were found, such as antigen processing and presentation, TGF-beta signaling pathway, etc.

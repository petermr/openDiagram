0: Total isolated RNA (0.1 ng) was used as a template for synthesizing complementary DNA (cDNA) using a First-Strand Synthesis Kit (InvitrogenTM) according to the manufacturers protocol.
1: cDNA was diluted 1:50 in ddH 2O prior to its use as a template for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using SYBR Green (Thermo ScientificTM).
2: A total volume of 10 ul was prepared for the SYBR Green qPCR reaction [2.5 ul diluted cDNA product or nH 2O, 2.5 ul 2 mM forward + reverse primer mix (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) ( Table 8) and 5 ul of SYBR Green].
3: The qPCR thermal cycle utilized an Applied BiosystemsTM StepOnePlusTM platform, with one cycle of 50C for 2 min and 95C for 10 min followed by 44 cycles of 95C for 15 s and 60C for 1 min.
4: Expression of gene targets values was normalized to housekeeping gene  -actin and was estimated using the Ct approach.
5: Results represented on a log2 scale.

<p>We therefore sought evidence that differences in PAS usage may have functional consequences. In a previous study, we identified genetic variants associated with variation in PAS usage (apaQTLs) in a panel of 52 human LCLs (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Mittleman et al., 2020</xref>). We found that genes with inter-species differences in PAS usage are highly enriched for apaQTLs (160, empirical p-value based on 10,000 permutations = 0.001,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">1</xref>, 3×; hypergeometric test, p=0.0009). This observation indicates that inter-species differences in APA usage can often be found in genes whose regulation varies also at the population level, generally suggesting relaxation of evolutionary constraint on the regulation of such genes. We next considered sequence divergence at PAS by obtaining PhyloP scores for all PAS flanking regions (200 bp, as explained above). If many changes in PAS usage are genetically controlled, we would expect genomic regions of differentially used PAS to be less conserved than regions containing PAS that have similar usage. Indeed, differentially used sites are enriched for regions with negative mean PhyloP scores (1.02×, hypergeometric test, p=0.02). This observation indicates that sequence divergence is often associated with differences in PAS usage, and that the majority of PAS usage in humans and chimpanzees may be generally conserved due to evolutionary constraint.

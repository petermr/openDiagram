0: Quantitative analyses of the garlic essential oil formulation were performed using a gas chromatograph (GC-17A series instrument, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).
1: The following chromatographic conditions were used: a fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.22 mm) with a DB-5 bonded phase (0.25 m film thickness); carrier gas N 2 at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min 1; injector temperature 220 C; detector temperature 240 C; column temperature programmed to begin at 40 C (remaining isothermal for 2 min) and then to increase at 3 C min 1 to 240 C (remaining isothermal at 240 C for 15 min); injection volume 1.0 L (1%w/v in CH 2Cl 2); split ratio 1:10; column pressure 115 kPa.

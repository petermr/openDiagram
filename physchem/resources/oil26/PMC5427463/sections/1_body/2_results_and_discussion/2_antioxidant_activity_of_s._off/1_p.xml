<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The IC<sub>50</sub> values (the concentration reducing 50 % of DPPH) obtained for scavenging activity on DPPH radical are shown in Table 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>. According to the recorded results, SoEO exhibited a good antioxidant power with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 6.7 mg/mL but relatively lower than the synthetic antioxidant BHT used as positive control (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.2 &#181;g/mL). The reducing power and the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation of SoEO showed a mild to moderate activity compared to the positive controls (Table 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>). It seems that the antioxidant activity of sage oil is due to the presence of monoterpenes such as &#945;-pinene, a known potent antioxidant (Wang et al., 2008[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]) and several sesquiterpenes (Tamil Selvi et al., 2015[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]) and it is assumed that the contribution of minor and major compounds exhibited this activity and not only one or few active molecules (Wang et al., 2008[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). </p>

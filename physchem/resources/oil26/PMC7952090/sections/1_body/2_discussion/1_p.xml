While body size and lifespan are correlated with cancer risk within species, there is no correlation between species because large and long-lived organisms have evolved enhanced cancer suppression mechanisms. While this ultimate evolutionary explanation is straightforward (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Peto, 2015</xref>), determining the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of enhanced cancer protection is challenging because many mechanisms with relatively small effects likely contribute to evolution of reduced cancer risk. Previous candidate gene studies in elephants have identified duplications of tumor suppressors such as <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>LIF</italic>, among others, suggesting that an increased copy number of tumor suppressors may contribute to the evolution of large body sizes in the elephant lineage (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abegglen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Sulak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Caulin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Doherty and de Magalh&#227;es, 2016</xref>). Here we: (1) trace the evolution of body size and lifespan in Eutherian mammals, with particular reference to Afrotherians; (2) infer changes in cancer susceptibility across Afrotherian lineages; (3) use a genome-wide screen to identify gene duplications in Afrotherian genomes, including multiple living and extinct Proboscideans; and (4) show that while duplication of genes with tumor suppressor functions is pervasive in Afrotherian genomes, Proboscidean gene duplicates are enriched in unique pathways with tumor suppressor functions.</p>

 <caption> RUNX1/RUNX1T1-associated alternatively spliced variants are distinctive features in primary leukemia samples. a Violin plot showing the enrichment level of Kasumi-1 exon-exon junctions in the transcriptome of primary t(8;21)-positive leukemia blasts from 20 patient samples. P-values were calculated with two-sided Mannâ€“Whitney U test. b, c Independent component analysis of t(8;21)-positive AML cells with normal CD34-positive cells b or other AML subtypes c. This analysis included 20 samples of each cell type. For each sample, the expression of 84,743 exon-exon junctions was quantified. </caption>

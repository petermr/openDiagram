<p>RT-qPCR with specific primers was used to validate DEG patterns detected 
 <italic>in silico</italic> from RNASeq for nine genes involved in RNA transport, membrane structure, lipid or protein biosynthesis. The resultant fold changes between CMV- and mock-inoculated samples were compared to those of detected DEGs from DESeq2 output. All 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tested genes had the same expression patterns as 
 <italic>in silico</italic> detected DEGs (

Then, the supernatant was removed and the dishes were washed twice with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5). The biofilms were detached by scraping. After being sonicated for 5 min (Bransonic 220; Branson Consolidated Ultrasonic Pvt. Ltd., Australia), the cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Then, the cell pellets were washed twice with Tris-HCl buffer (Wang et al.,

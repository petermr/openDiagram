0: The bZIP protein sequences from potato, rice, maize, barley, and  Arabidopsis were aligned with gap opening and gap extension penalties of 10 and 0.1, respectively, using Clustal W. A Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method was used to develop a cladogram of all bZIP protein sequences.
1: The associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test of 1000 replicas.
2: The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 7 software, version 7 [ 33], and visualized through EvolView v2 [ 34].

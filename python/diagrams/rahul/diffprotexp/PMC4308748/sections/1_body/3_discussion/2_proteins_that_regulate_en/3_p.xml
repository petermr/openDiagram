 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The functional changes in these three enzymes suggest they may be important factors in the repair and regeneration of spinal cord injuries. However, the expression of glycometabolism-related enzymes was also altered. For example, the expression of phosphoglyceromutase in the ischemia/reperfusion group was up regulated and the expression of carbonic anhydrase I and carbonic anhydrase II was down regulated. These enzymes participate in cellular glycolysis energy metabolism and balance and their expression was down regulated after reperfusion. This suggests that glucose oxidative and metabolic pathways are enhanced. Concurrently, expression levels of proteins related to energy metabolism, such as ATP synthase and its subunit, were also significantly up regulated. Severe energy supply disorders may occur in spinal injuries[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and therefore cell metabolism may switch from glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The late-stage increase in ATP synthase also suggests this is occurring during spinal cord injury.

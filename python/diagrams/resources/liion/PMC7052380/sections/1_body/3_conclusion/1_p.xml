<p>A LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composite was successfully prepared as cathode material through one-step microwave heating. The graphene oxide, which has excellent microwave-absorbing properties, can react with microwaves quickly and be restored into high-quality graphene directly without any reducing agent or atmosphere. The introduction of graphene does not impact the structure of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>, and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles are packed into micron graphene sheets. The graphene network, which has a high degree of graphitization, can provide a high-speed channel for the rapid transfer of electrons and thus increase the electronic conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles can improve the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions. Moreover, because the nanoparticles are surrounded by the graphene sheets, the micron structure guards the stability of the material. The electrochemical analyses reveal that the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites have excellent high-rate performance and cycling life. The outstanding electrochemical performance, as well as the fast and efficient method, make this technology commercially viable.

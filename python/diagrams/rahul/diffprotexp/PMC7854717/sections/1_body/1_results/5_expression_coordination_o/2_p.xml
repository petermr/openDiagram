 <italic>Akt2</italic> potential binding partners in the four heart chambers. All these four genes were identified in a recent paper
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> as key players in regulating the cardiac rhythm. While no statistically significant antagonism or independence was found in any of the four genes’ networks, the percentages of significant synergisms within this selection of genes were substantially larger in ventricles than in atria. Thus, 
 <italic>Akt2</italic> was synergistically expressed with 15% of its partners in LA, 37% in RA, 100% in LV and 74% in RV. 
 <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (19% in LA, 0% in RA, 93% in LV and 74% in RV), 
 <italic>HSpa5</italic> (19% in LA, 26% in RA, 85% in LV), and 70% in RV), and 
 <italic>Mapk1</italic> (11% in LA), 22% in RA), 96% in LV and 70% in RV).exhibited qualitatively similar networks.

<p>There was no difference among all combinations of the treatment group comparisons except for the lung lesion tissue in group 6 when compared with group 2 with 94 differentially expressed genes. Functional GO enrichment analysis showed that there is a distinct group of genes responsible for multiple closely connected biological processes responsible for microtubule formation and microtubule-based cilium movement. The most common shared genes were CCDC39 and CCDC40. These and many other genes related to these functions were significantly upregulated in lesions of group 6, in which viral shedding, clinical scores and lung pathology were lowest through the course of the disease due to the most effective combination and earliest start of the treatment. Mucociliary clearance-mediated innate immunity is an important component of antiviral protection in the lung and RSV both reduces the number of motile cilia and causes detachment of ciliated epithelial cells [

In our study, it is likely that an increase in expression of genes responsible for cilia and their motility in the treatment group in which BRSV caused minimal damage, played an important role in lung defense. However, group 1, similar to the group 2 by type of treatment but initiated two days sooner, showed similar levels of viral load and clinical scores to group 2 and did not demonstrate such a difference in the expression of cilia-related genes. Differences in the timing of treatment initiation was likely responsible for this difference.

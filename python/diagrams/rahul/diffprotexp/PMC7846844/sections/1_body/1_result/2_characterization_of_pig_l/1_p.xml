<p id="Par7">Previous studies have shown by comparing structural features that pig lincRNA is identical to the lincRNAs of other mammals (human and mouse)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. The pig lincRNA has fewer and longer exons than the coding gene; the lincRNA transcript, owing to their small number of exons, is shorter than the coding gene
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the present study compared the difference in exon number (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), length (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), and length of transcription (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C) between lincRNA (known lincRNAs and novel lincRNAs) and protein coding genes in this data, consistent with previous reports
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. The accuracy of lincRNAs obtained from the pipeline of this study was confirmed.

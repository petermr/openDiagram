 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>Systemic metabolic homeostasis is regulated by inter-organ metabolic cycles involving multiple organs. Obesity impairs inter-organ metabolic cycles, resulting in metabolic diseases. The systemic landscape of dysregulated inter-organ metabolic cycles in obesity has yet to be explored. Here, we measured the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome in the liver and skeletal muscle and the metabolome in blood of fasted wild-type and leptin-deficient obese (

  <italic>ob</italic>) mice, identifying components with differential abundance and differential regulation in 
  <italic>ob</italic>/
  <italic>ob</italic> mice. By constructing and evaluating the trans-omic network controlling the differences in metabolic reactions between fasted wild-type and 
  <italic>ob</italic>/
  <italic>ob</italic> mice, we provided potential mechanisms of the obesity-associated dysfunctions of metabolic cycles between liver and skeletal muscle involving glucose-alanine, glucose-lactate, and ketone bodies. Our study revealed obesity-associated systemic pathological mechanisms of dysfunction of inter-organ metabolic cycles.

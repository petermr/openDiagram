0: Fluctuant reports of outbreaks or clusters of SLEV-related encephalitis are registered annually in Americas, where SLEV is endemic [ 911].The largest epidemic of St. Louis encephalitis occurred in the central states of the United States in 1975 recording nearly 2,000 cases of neurological disease [ 12, 13].
1: SLEV incidence is likely underestimated, as symptoms are usually mild and disease undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as other endemic arboviral illnesses, such as Dengue fever, West Nile encephalitis or Zika fever [ 4, 1416].
2: SLEV biology and disease pathogenesis is not completely understood and there is no specific diagnostic tool or treatment for St Louis encephalitis, besides intensive care [ 17].
3: Vaccine candidates against SLEV were developed and tested  in vivo, but did not progress to clinical trials [ 18].

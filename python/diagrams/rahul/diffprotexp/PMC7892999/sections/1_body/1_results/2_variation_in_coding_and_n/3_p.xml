 </sup>. Most of the known genes of the pathway and their main regulators were differentially expressed between the two genotypes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Several genes were induced in purple tissues and they mainly comprised genes representing: (1) the early step in the flavonoid/anthocyanin pathway, like chalcone synthase (
 <italic>DcCHS1</italic>/DCAR_030786); chalcone isomerase (
 <italic>DcCHI1</italic>/DCAR_027694) and (
 <italic>DcCHIL</italic>/DCAR_019805); flavanone 3-hydroxylase (
 <italic>DcF3H1</italic>/DCAR_009483), and flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (
 <italic>DcF3′H1</italic>/DCAR_014032); (2) cytochrome P450 (CYP450) proteins, putatively related to the flavonoid and isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathways
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>; (3) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, potentially related to anthocyanin transport
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>; and (4) genes from the late steps of the pathway, like dihydro-flavonol 4-reductase (
 <italic>DcDFR1</italic>/DCAR_021485), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (
 <italic>DcLDOX1</italic>/DCAR_006772), and UDP-glycosyltransferase (
 <italic>DcUFGT</italic>/DCAR_009823) and the recently described 
 <italic>DcUCGXT1</italic>/DCAR_021269 and 
 <italic>DcSAT1</italic>/MSTRG.8365, which were confirmed to be responsible for anthocyanin glycosylation and acylation, respectively
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, the most significant regulatory genes of the pathway, belonging to the MYB, bHLH and WD40 TF gene families
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–

 </sup> were also differentially expressed between purple and orange genotypes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). We further analyzed the tissue differential expression distribution of those 26 ‘MBW’ TFs and found that 
 <italic>DcMYB6</italic> and 
 <italic>DcMYB7,</italic> the two most studied TFs associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>, were differentially expressed between purple and orange carrots, both in phloem and xylem tissues (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Interestingly, three genes recently described to be regulated by 
 <italic>DcMYB7</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> (i.e. 
 <italic>DcbHLH3</italic>, 
 <italic>DcUCGXT1</italic> and 
 <italic>DcSAT1</italic>) also displayed no tissue specificity. 
 <italic>DcbHLH3</italic> was described as a co-regulator in anthocyanin biosynthesis, while 
 <italic>DcUCGXT1</italic> and 
 <italic>DcSAT1</italic> participate in anthocyanin glycosylation and acylation, respectively
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, seven TFs showed xylem preferential expression-specificity, while only one was preferentially expressed specifically in phloem. Finally, differential expression of 11 TFs was just detected when the 12 libraries were jointly analyzed, presumably because they have significant but low expression differences (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

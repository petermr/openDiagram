<p>The appearance of a “type 0” biphasic system is unusual as such behavior is traditionally associated with polymer-IL type aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) [

This contrasts with the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior observed in polymer-IL type ABS where the immiscibility region decreases with increased temperature [

<p>A Gene Ontology analysis was performed on the significantly differentially expressed proteins from hemocytes and plasma using Blast2GO. The most abundant GO terms within the “molecular function” ontology in hemocytes were assigned as “hydrolase”, “actin-binding” and “oxidoreductase activity”, while the terms related to “oxidoreductase” and “actin-binding activity” together with “enzyme regulator” “and transferase activity” were prominent terms in plasma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005104.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The most abundant GO term in both hemocytes and plasma within “biological process” was “immune system process”. Furthermore, “cell migration” and “actin filament-based process” were prominent terms in hemocytes whereas terms related to “regulation of cellular localization”, “wound healing” and “regulation of signal transduction” were also highly represented terms in plasma (

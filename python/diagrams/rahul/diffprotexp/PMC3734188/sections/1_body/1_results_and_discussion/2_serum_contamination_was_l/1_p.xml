<p>Because immunoglobulins are high-abundance proteins in the serum and are not secreted by the liver [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the amount of immunoglobulins in perfusates can reflect the level of serum contamination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, IgG was chosen as an indicator of serum contamination in the perfusates. The IgG level, as shown in Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1, indicated that serum contamination was at a very low level.

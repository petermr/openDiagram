<p>Several proteins involved in terminal oxidation of linear 
 <italic>n</italic>‐alkanes were significantly differentially expressed during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> compared to pyruvate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The expression of two P450 CYP153 cytochromes (ABO_0201/2288, 
 <italic>P =</italic> 0.028), which share the same amino acid (100% similarity) and their corresponding genes share 99.6% nucleotide identity, was three‐fold and two‐fold greater while growing on 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> and pristane, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). This suggests the proteins may have a broad substrate specificity being able to utilize both linear and branched alkanes or is constitutively expressed due to expression also on pyruvate. The cytochrome P450s are part of a putative operon made up of genes coding for a ferredoxin (ABO_0200, not detected), which shuttles electrons to the cytochrome P450 (ABO_0201/2288), an alcohol dehydrogenase (ABO_0202) and a ferredoxin reductase (ABO_0203) (Schneiker 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). The alcohol dehydrogenase, AlkJ2 (ABO_0202, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008), which converts alcohols generated by the oxidation of an alkane to its corresponding aldehyde, was highly up‐regulated during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> and pristane but absent on pyruvate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The expression of a ferredoxin reductase (ABO_0203, 
 <italic>P =</italic> 0.049), which oxidizes NAD(P)H to NAD(P)
 <sup>+</sup> capturing electrons to transfer to the ferredoxin, was seven‐fold and five‐fold greater during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> and pristane, respectively, compared to pyruvate. Multiple alkane monooxygenases were also detected. The alkane 2‐monooxygenase, AlkB2 (ABO_0122) was exclusively expressed only during growth on 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B)
 <sub>.</sub> The expression of another putative monooxygenase (ABO_2107, 
 <italic>P =</italic> 0.011) was seven‐fold greater on 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> than pristane with no expression on pyruvate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Domain analysis revealed the protein is a member of the FMO (flavin‐binding monooxygenase)‐like family (PF00743), which specializes in the oxidation of xenobiotics. The 
 <italic>rubA</italic> (ABO_0163) 
 <italic>and rubB</italic> (ABO_0162) genes code rubredoxin and rubredoxin reductase, respectively, and are arranged in a putative operon. RubA (ABO_0163), which transfers electrons to the alkane monooxygenase from the rubredoxin reductase, was not detected in this data set and the expression of RubB (ABO_0162), which transfers electrons from NAD(P)H to the rubredoxin, had 5‐fold greater expression on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C14 compared to pristane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Two aldehyde dehydrogenases that catalyse the oxidation of the aldehyde produced from the alcohol dehydrogenase (ABO_0962/ABO_2414) were significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) differentially expressed on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The combination of these alkane monooxygenases or CYP153 cytochrome P450 with an alcohol dehydrogenase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase makes up two alternative pathways for the terminal oxidation of 
 <italic>n</italic>‐alkanes to their corresponding acyl‐CoA derivatives (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and B).

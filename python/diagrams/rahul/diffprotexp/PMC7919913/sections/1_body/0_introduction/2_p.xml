<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in hypertrophy and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and have been used as new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of heart failure [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In recent years, there are rapidly growing attentions paid on a way of intercellular communication, namely ‘microvesicle (MV)’ [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cells can produce little MVs under the normal physiological conditions, while the production of MVs is significantly increased under the pathophysiological conditions. In 2007, Valadi has found that MV contains miRNA [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been found that a large number of the most basic processes of cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and death in physiological and pathological states are regulated by miRNAs [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The role of MV containing miRNA for intercellular communication has become a new research hotspot. Moreover, MiRNA-21 (miR-21) has been shown to play an important regulatory role in the progression of chronic cardiac and renal diseases. It is interesting to note that MVs containing miR-21 are significantly increased during myocardial hypertrophy, and most of MVs are contained in the fluid around the heart [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the origin of these MVs still remains largely unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-21-containing MVs from tubular epithelial cells in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with CKD.

<p id="Par49">To understand the function of the extended 3′UTR region, InterProScan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] was used to analyse the sequence of this nORF. The results revealed that while the canonical gene PF3D7_1013400 has only a long stretch of “Non-cytoplasmic domain” identified, the extended 3′-end of 71 amino acids was predicted with multiple transmembrane helices.This is further confirmed by the prediction of transmembrane helices from TMHMM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], which predicted two helices in the region after the canonical stop codon (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Figure S5). The inclusion of this transmembrane tail might also explain the low expression of this protein in oocyst sporozoites, because membrane proteins require specialised protocols to be fully solubilised in sample preparation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].

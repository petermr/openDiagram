<p>The vibrational frequencies of hydrogen bonded methanol with neutral and protonated geometries are also calculated and compared with the experimental data in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Addition of one methanol molecule at the Brønsted acidic site gives rise to hydrogen bonded structure with the neutral geometry as depicted with structure A in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The geometry forms a six membered ring structure at the Brønsted acidic site and is similar to the one reported in the literature.

Addition of a second methanol molecule in the unit cell results in an eight membered ring structure at the Brønsted acid site and that the acidic proton shuttles between the framework oxygen and methanol hydroxyl, forming a protonated methanol geometry as depicted with structure B in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The vibrational frequencies calculated for the 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>(C–H) and 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>as</sub>(C–H) stretching modes of the protonated methanol geometry are calculated to have frequencies of 2844 and 2944 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively. These values are consistent with the experimental observations (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), including the observed relative redshift in the vibrational frequencies of 
 <italic>ν</italic>(C–H) modes of the neutral geometry as compared with the protonated one.
 <xref rid="cit63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The experimental results show 
 <italic>a</italic> ≈8 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> redshift for the neutral geometry as compared to protonated geometry, while simulations show 10 (±5) cm

 <sup>–1</sup> for

 <sub>s</sub>(C–D) and 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>as</sub>(C–D) modes. The vibrational frequency of 2083 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> for

 <sub>s</sub>(C–D) is in excellent agreement with the observed DRIFTS band, whereas the calculated 2272 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> frequency for 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>as</sub>(C–D) appeared as a shoulder at 2267 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> to the prominent band at 2217 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> observed by DRIFTS. This once again suggests the occurrence of a combination of different bands in the 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>as</sub>(C–D) region under experimental conditions, which might be difficult to be captured completely by simulations.

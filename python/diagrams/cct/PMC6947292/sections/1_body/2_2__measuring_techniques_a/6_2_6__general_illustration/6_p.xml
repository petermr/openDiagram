<p>The start and finish temperatures of precipitation, depending on quenching rate, are shown by bold lines. In almost all cases, several precipitation reactions occur sequentially during cooling and there is often some overlap. The onset of precipitation in the first reaction and the end of precipitation in the last reaction can be determined exactly, and are shown in continuous black lines. Overlapping reactions are hard to separate by DSC, and intermediate start and finish precipitation temperatures have been estimated using the procedure outlined in Ref. [

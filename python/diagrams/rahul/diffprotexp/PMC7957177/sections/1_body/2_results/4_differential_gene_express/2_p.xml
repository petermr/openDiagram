<p>To further find the useful biomarker, we used R statistical programming and BiocLite of Bioconductor to examine the data in

According to the amplitude of variation with grade, all the genes with significant changes are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cam43799-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>. Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array has complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set, with over 47,000 transcripts. Comparing CIN1 with normal tissue, there were 35 genes that were significantly up‐regulated and 16 genes that were significantly down‐regulated. In the comparison of CIN2 with normal tissue, 120 genes were significantly up‐regulated and 24 genes were significantly down‐regulated. The CIN3 comparison with normal tissue revealed 290 genes that were significantly up‐regulated and 128 genes that were significantly down‐regulated. When comparing CIN2 with CIN1, we found 27 genes that were significantly up‐regulated and 39 that were significantly down‐regulated. In the CIN3 versus CIN1 comparison, 77 genes were significantly up‐regulated and 95 genes were significantly down‐regulated, and in the CIN3 versus CIN2 comparison, 8 genes were significantly up‐regulated and 33 genes were significantly down‐regulated. Compared with normal tissues, tumor tissues showed 660 significantly up‐regulated genes and 432 significantly down‐regulated genes. Compared with CIN1, 298 genes were up‐regulated and 392 genes significantly down‐regulated in tumors. Compared with CIN2, 290 genes were significantly up‐regulated and 419 genes down‐regulated in tumors. Compared with CIN3, 376 genes were significantly up‐regulated and 259 genes down‐regulated in tumors. These results indicate that the predominantly differentially expressed genes in different histological grades may be important during cervical cancer carcinogenesis (Figure

  <title>Functional distributions of the identified proteins from queen and worker larvae at 72 hours (Q 72 h and W 72 h) of developmental stage.</title>
  <p>The percentage of each functional group was obtained based on the calculated absolute number of proteins under each of the functional groups subtracted from the totally number of identified proteins at 72 hours (

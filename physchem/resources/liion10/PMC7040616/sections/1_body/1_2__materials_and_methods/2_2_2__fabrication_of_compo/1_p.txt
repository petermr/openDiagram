0: In order to test the electrochemical performance of submicron LLZNO powder, we prepared a composite cathode and assembled quasi-solid-state batteries.
1: The composite cathode consisted of a LiMn 2O 4 positive electrode layer and a submicron LLZNO electrolyte layer.
2: The positive electrode was fabricated by coating the slurry of a mixture containing LiMn 2O 4 powder, submicron LLZNO powder, acetylene black (Shanghai Hersbit Chemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, FR905, Shanghai San ai fu New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), with a weight ratio of 7:2:1:1, onto circular aluminum foils (thickness of 20 m, Shenzhen Kejingstar Technology Ltd., Shenzhen, China) as the current collector, and the positive material loading was 1.66 mg/cm 2.
3: Then the composite cathode was fabricated by coating the slurry of a mixture containing submicron LLZNO powder and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 9:1 onto the positive electrode layer.
4: The composite cathode was punched into disks with 18 mm diameters after compacted by a roller press (Shenzhen Kejingstar Technology Ltd., Shenzhen, China), and the density of composite cathode was about 2.5 g/cm 3.
5: Quasi-solid-state batteries were assembled with two electrode coin cells (type CR-2025) in a glove box filled with argon and with lithium metal foil (15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick, Shenzhen Kejingstar Technology Ltd., Shenzhen, China) as the negative current collector.
6: In addition, 20 L of a liquid organic electrolyte (1 M LiPF 6 dissolved in ethyl carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a ratio of 1:1, CAPCHEM, Shenzhen, China [ 45]) was added to improve the contact and reduce the interface impedance between the submicron LLZNO electrolyte layer and the anode/cathode [ 46, 47].
7: Compared with lithium-ion batteries, the added amount of liquid organic electrolyte was small [ 48, 49].

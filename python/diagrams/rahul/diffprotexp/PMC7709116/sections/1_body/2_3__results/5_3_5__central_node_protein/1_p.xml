<p>Experimental protein–protein interaction networks were constructed for the two groups of 40 and 47 proteins that were enriched in D1 and D2 nuclei, respectively. Each of these groups of proteins was analyzed separately using OmicsNet, which identifies known interactors [
 <xref rid="B34-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interactions were based only on high-confidence STRING interactions for which there is experimental evidence. The identified networks were imported into Cytoscape and modified with the MCODE app to optimize their visual appearance [

 <xref rid="B36-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the predicted protein–protein interaction networks for D1 and D2 nuclei generated two different central interactors for each cell type: Hnrnpd and Hnmpa2b1 in D1 and Cct2 and Cct7 in D2 nuclei preparations

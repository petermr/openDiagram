0: Item ( E/ T) P, here referred to d E/d T, is determined by measuring the OCV of the electrochemical cell at different temperatures.
1: Ideally, the cell needs to be relaxed for a period of time before the open-circuit voltage is measured to reach equilibrium.
2: The entropy change in the electrochemical reaction can be obtained by measuring the change in open-circuit voltage at different temperatures and calculated using  eq   2.
3: 21 The increase or decrease in entropy means the decrease or increase in the degree of order of the lithium ion in the lattice, respectively.
4: More importantly, the entropy change can also affect the thermal behavior of electrochemical reaction and then change the temperature of the battery, which greatly affects the performance of lithium-ion batteries.

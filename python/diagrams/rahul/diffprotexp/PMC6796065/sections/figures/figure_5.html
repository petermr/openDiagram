 <caption> Flow chart of the DARPP-32-CaN pathway in the Cys311 variant of DRD2. The disturbance of DRD2 desensitization can prolong dopamine-induced DRD2-mediated signaling and accelerate the following processes; PLC activation, IP3 release, and Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, increased intracellular Ca 2+ activates CaN. The activated CaN can then promote PP1 activation through the dephosphorylation of DARPP-32. Dephosphorylation of CREB may then be promoted in the brains carrying the Cys311 variant of DRD2. Since the ChIP analysis showed that CREB binds upstream of several CaN genes, dephosphorylation of CREB may decrease CaN expression. DRD2, dopamine D2 receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, Inositol trisphosphate; CaN, calcineurin;PPI,;CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; ChIP, Chromatin immunoprecipitation. </caption>

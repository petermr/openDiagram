<p id="Par35">Role of ABA in management of plant stress responses includes reprogramming of cellular mechanism at transcriptional level including lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Also the ABA dependent and independent pathways regulate the plant adaptation to adverse environments through AREB/ABF (ABA-responsive element binding protein/ABRE-binding factor) and DREB/CBF subfamily of the AP2/ERF transcription factors. It has been reported in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that overexpression of DREB/CBF regulates the signals for plant growth and development under different environments. Such transgenics although had enhanced tolerance to drought, salinity and low temperature but in addition, some developmental defects were also counterbalanced in this process

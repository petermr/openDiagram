0: However, more work should be done before the ionic conductors are sufficiently conductive for practical consideration in Mg batteries.
1: The electrochemical potential window should be increased to a sufficiently high level.
2: The feasibility of the solid conductor requires the practical evaluation in combination with Mg anode and cathodes as an all-solid-state Mg battery.
3: Furthermore, theoretical calculation could be a powerful tool to improve the performance of solid conductor.

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Tables S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">S3</xref>). To further ensure the sites of inactivating mutation of toothless/enamel-less lineages, we used the CDSs of some representative placental species with well-annotated genomes (
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (human), 
 <italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic> (Dog), 
 <italic>Bos taurus</italic> (Cow), 
 <italic>Echinops telfairi</italic> (Lesser hedgehog tenrec)) as queries including âˆ¼50 bp of flanking sequence on each exon. These sequences were used as queries to BLAST against toothless/enamel-less mammals to confirm the related inactivating mutation among baleen whales.

 <caption> Hierarchical illustration of differentially expressed genes in hTCEpi cells after treatment with AC EFs for 24 h. Both two-fold upregulated and downregulated genes were clustered. Untreated hTCEpi cells served as control. After 24 h of treatment with AC EFs, RNA was isolated and transcriptome-wide gene level expression profiling was performed using Clariom TM S arrays. Affymetrix Â® Transcription Analysis Console TM (TAC) software (v.4.0.1.36) was used for array scanning, data analysis, signal estimation, and quality control functionality for the expression arrays, which also allow statistical analysis and provide a list of differentially expressed genes. Expression level analysis was performed using the normalization method based on the processing algorithm called the robust multi-array average (RMA), which was improved by Signal Space Transformation (SST-RMA, Affymetrix). Each array was performed in triplicate. Blue indicates a relatively low expression, whereas red indicates a relatively high expression. </caption>

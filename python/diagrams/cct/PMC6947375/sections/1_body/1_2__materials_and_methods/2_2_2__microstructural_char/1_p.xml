<p>Metallographic observations were conducted by using a ZEISS ULTRA 55 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM); before observations, the samples were mechanically polished and then etched with 4% nitric acid. The morphology and the chemical composition of the microstructure were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) mode using a JXA-8530F electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA). The size of the carbide particles was measured using image-pro Plus and Photoshop according to the micrograph obtained by SEM. The two-dimensional cross-sectional area of each carbide particle was measured on a polishing plane, which was equivalent to a circular area, and the equivalent diameter of the particle was determined. At least 15 micrographs were taken with magnifications from 2000 to 6000 for each specimen. The total number of particles measured ranged from approximately 300 to 900, depending on the materials and process parameters. The particles larger than or equal to 700 nm were referred to as large-sized particles. The microstructure of 1.0C-1.5Cr steel after different treatments was analyzed by an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) system, and the EBSD data were post-processed by HKL CHANNEL 5 software. Samples for EBSD analysis were prepared by electrolytic polishing with a solution consisting of 10% perchloric acid and 90% ethanol.</p>

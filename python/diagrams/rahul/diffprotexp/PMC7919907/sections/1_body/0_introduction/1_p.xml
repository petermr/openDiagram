<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to more than 100 million infections and over 2.1 million deaths worldwide, and more than 25 million infections and over 429,000 deaths in the US alone as of 28 January, 2021, rendering it one of the most life-threatening infectious disease outbreaks in human history. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], are the three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory syndrome, while the other four common human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) account for 15â€“30% global cases of common cold in humans [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Limited number of therapeutics including vaccines and small molecules are available for COVID-19 treatment. As future coronavirus outbreak is highly possible, it is desired to develop broad-spectrum antivirals that are suitable for the prevention and treatment of both current circulating CoVs and future emerging CoVs.

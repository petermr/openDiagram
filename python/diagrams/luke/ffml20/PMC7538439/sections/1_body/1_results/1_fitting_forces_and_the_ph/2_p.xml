<p id="Par11">For transferability testing, we used the standard approach of fitting to a subset of the data and testing against a different subset. Furthermore, we used an iterative fitting process: a trial potential was fitted, and applied in both Phase II annealing and melting line MD simulations. If novel configurations were found, they were used to generate more reference states for the DFT database, and the fitting process was repeated. This iterative process ensures that spurious structures are suppressed and the ground state structure is the same as found in DFT. Technical details of the forcefield parameterisation are given in the “Methods” section.</p>

<p>ZC3H12D, also known as TFL or p34, is originally reported as a putative tumor suppressor in transformed follicular lymphoma and sporadic lung cancer 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. Following work showed overexpression of ZC3H12D would significantly inhibitor TLR-induced JNK, ERK, and NF-ÎºB 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>. These findings suggest the suppressor role of ZC3H12D in tumorigenesis. In our study, we also found aberrant down-regulation of ZC3H12D in tongue cancer patients with better prognosis. Together, we identified the potential functional pathways of the prognosis-related hub RBPs.

<p>The Clariom S mouse array was used to profile RNA expressions for the adipose tissue sample directly after explantation and after 7 and 15 days after transplantation (N = 4, 8, and 9, respectively). We compared the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at day 0 to day 7 (0vs7) and day 0 to day 15 (0vs15) to assess the impact of time after transplantation.</p>

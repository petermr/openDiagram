0: Mass spectra were acquired using a model PBSIIc SELDI-TOF-MS (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA).
1: SELDI mass spectra were acquired with a laser intensity of 225 and a detector sensitivity of 8 for high molecular weight proteins (HMW protocol), and a laser intensity of 199 and a detector sensitivity of 9 for low molecular weight proteins (LMW protocol).
2: Both high and low molecular weight spectra were acquired at a digitizer rate of 250 MHz in positive ion mode with a chamber vacuum of less than 510 -7 torr, a source voltage of 20 kV and a detector voltage of 2,700 V. A total of 65 transients were averaged for each spectrum.
3: Spectral processing (smoothing and baseline subtraction) was performed with ProteinChip 3.1 software.
4: All spectra were calibrated externally using an All-in-1 peptide standard [porcine dynorphin, 2147.50 Da; bovine insulin -chain, 3495.94 Da; and hirudin BHVK, 7033.61 Da], and an All-in-1 protein standard [bovine cytochrome c, 12230 Da; bovine carbonic anhydrase, 29024 kDa; and S. cerevisiae enolase, 46670 Da] (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA).
5: Peak intensities were normalized against the total ion current (TIC), excluding the mass range below 1500 Da, which is composed of strong signals from the SPA matrix.
6: Because automatic peak selection by the Ciphergen Express software can miss features that appear as shoulders on large peaks, all spectra were subjected to manual peak-picking.
7: All peaks that are present in at least 25% of the spectra and with SNR  3 were selected.

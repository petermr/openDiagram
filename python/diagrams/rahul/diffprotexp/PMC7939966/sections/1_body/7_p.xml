<p>DEGs from 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic>, which were upregulated or downregulated more than 10 fold post-infection with 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, were listed in 
 <xref rid="t1-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t2-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In the 12 hr pi 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic>, 47 out of 1,211 DEGs were upregulated (
 <xref rid="t1-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and 90 out of 1,131 DEGs were downregulated more than 10 fold (
 <xref rid="t2-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Identities for several most upregulated proteins in this group were 2 hypothetical proteins (1,100 fold and 345 fold), S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (173 fold), and GDPD-mannose-3′, 5′-epimerase (87 fold) (
 <xref rid="t1-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). GO analysis of the assigned Entrez Gene IDs revealed that the DEG which underwent 1,100 fold increase was a hypothetical protein that belonged to the DNA binding (GO: 0003677) category. Similarly, the GDPD-mannose-3′,5′-epimerase which was increased 87 fold, was associated with catalytic activity (GO: 0003824). Based on these findings, it can be speculated that these DEGs may be of importance during the initial phase of infection. While xylosyltransferase 1 was downregulated more than 700 fold, sulfiredoxin 1 was downregulated more than 500 fold, and vacuolar sorting-associated protein 13 were downregulated more than 12 fold. (
 <xref rid="t2-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). GO analysis results revealed that the DEGs downregulated 10 fold or more were predominantly associated with the integral component of membrane (GO: 0016021). Findings are consistent with the changes in DEGs categorized under CC as illustrated in

0: Histology was performed in triplicate sections in brains using male and female pups from at least two litters.
1: Sections were selected to focus on the developing somatosensory cortex.
2: Details on sample individual sample usage for each IHC experiment is detailed in  Supplementary files 21 and  22.
3: Embryos used in IHC experiments came from independent litters versus RNA-seq and immunoblotting.
4: Morphological parameters were measured using FIJI ImageJ (NIH), by an experimenter blinded to group and sex.
5: Brain regions were identified based on anatomical landmarks as previously described ( Gompers et al., 2017).
6: No data points were excluded.
7: For IHC staining, fetal brains were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution overnight at 4C.
8: Tissues were then equilibrated in approximately 15 mL of 30% sucrose/PBS solution until they sank to the bottom of a conical tube.
9: Equilibrated brains were embedded in Optimum Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA) and frozen on dry-ice.
10: OCT-embedded brain blocks were cryo-sectioned on a coronal plane (30 m).
11: Immunostaining was performed in free-floating sections with agitation.
12: Sections were washed five times in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 min each) and antigen retrieval was performed using 1x Citrate buffer pH6.0 antigen retriever solution (cat# C9999; Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA), at 60C for 1 hr.
13: Sections were washed five times in PBST (5 min each), permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton for 20 min and blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 5% milk/PBST.
14: Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4C with orbital agitation (4050 rpm).
15: All antibodies used for this study were validated and their specificity validated.
16: The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PAX6 (1:250; cat #PRB-278P-100; Covance, Princeton NJ.
17: ), anti-KI67 (1:500; cat#12202; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-SOX9 (1:500 cat# AF3075, R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-PH3 (1:500 cat# 9701, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-TBR2 (1:500; cat#14-4875-82; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA.
18: ), anti-TBR1 (1:500; cat#ab31940; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-CTIP2 (1:250; cat# ab18465; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-CUX1 (1:200; cat#A2213; Abclonal, Woburn, MA.
19: ), anti-SATB2 (1:500; cat#ab51502; Abcam, Cambridge, MA.
20: ), anti-DLX2 (1:200; generous gift from John Rubenstein, UCSF), anti-GFAP (1:250, cat#Z0334; Agilent Dako, Santa Clara, CA), anti-OLIG2 (1:500, cat#AB9610, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA).
21: After primary antibody incubation, free-floating sections were washed five times in PBST (5 min each).
22: Species-specific fluorophores-conjugated IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were used as secondary antibodies (45 min, RT).
23: 40,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:10000; Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA) was used for nuclear staining (20 min, RT).
24: For cell counting, boxes were drawn on specific areas of the neocortex for progenitor and mitosis markers; SOX2, SOX9, and PH3.
25: This box was 300  300 pixels on an image of the neocortex obtained using a 20 objective.
26: To be consistent, the ventral aspect of the box was drawn along the VZ and one corner touched the medial aspect of the VZ.
27: The same strategy was used to draw boxes from Ki67 images except the box was increased in size to 500  500 pixels to account for the additional Ki67+ cells seen in neocortical areas above the SVZ.
28: SOX9 boxes were drawn along the dorsal border edge (600 pixels in width) of the neocortex and extended ventrally two thirds the length of the neocortex in order to avoid the VZ/SVZ region.
29: For laminar zone counts, a box spanning 300 pixels was drawn along the VZ and the dorsal/ventral proportions were equally divided into three zones.
30: These box sizes allowed for a sufficient number of cells to be counted from each tissue.
31: Laminar thickness analyses were performed by measuring the spread of all positive cells within the cortical plate per individual marker.
32: For all quantification analyses, one to three sections per brain utilizing the developing hippocampus as a landmark for positioning were used.

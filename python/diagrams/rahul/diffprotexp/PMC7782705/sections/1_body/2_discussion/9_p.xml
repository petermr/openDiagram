<p id="Par27">Although we cannot formally rule out that a stage-dependent increase in the number of DEGs and gDTUs could be due to the loss of neuronal cells in brain regions affected by the pathology, several lines of evidence indicate that this is not the most parsimonious explanation for the data described here. First, we observe that the percentage of up- and downregulated genes in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons are close to 50%, ruling out the possibility that changes in cell numbers could explain these changes. Secondly, previous scRNAseq studies in AD observed a consistent fraction of cell types isolated across control and AD individuals

 </sup>, ruling out significant changes in the cellular composition of AD brains. Lastly, a large number of genes with total expression levels unchanged but presenting isoform switches in the AD brains may likely presuppose a steady cellular composition of the tissue.

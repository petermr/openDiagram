0: To confirm titin and FKH 53 protein expression in congenital cholesteatomas, tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin.
1: Paraffin blocks were sectioned into 5 m thick slices and fixed with a chilled 1:1 mixture of methanol:acetone for 5 minutes after pretreatment with 0.3% H 2O 2 for 20 minutes at room temperature.
2: Slides were treated with 1:600 normal rabbit serum for 20 minutes to block nonspecific reactions and then incubated with a polyclonal antibody against target human proteins, including titin (1:200, HPA007042, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and forkhead transcription activator homolog (1:200, clone FKH 53, human (fragment), AHP933, AbD Serotec, Kidlington, England).
3: Slides were then incubated with biotinylated antihuman rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
4: For negative controls, the step in which samples were reacted with primary antibodies (titin and clone FKH 53) was skipped.
5: Peroxidase was attached to the secondary antibody by avidin-biotin peroxidase complex formation.
6: Specimens were incubated in diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride to detect primary antibody binding sites.

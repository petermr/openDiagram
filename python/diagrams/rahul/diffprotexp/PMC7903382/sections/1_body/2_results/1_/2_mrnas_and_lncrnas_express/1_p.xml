<p>The patterns of the mRNA and lncRNA expressions in the T1-T4 spinal cord at 2 h after MIRI or sham operations were then examined using microarray. From the volcano map and hierarchical clustering analysis results, a landscape of the expression characteristics of the mRNAs and lncRNAs was obtained. The volcano plots demonstrated that large numbers of the mRNAs and lncRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups (

 <xref rid="f2-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). The hierarchical cluster analysis of the lncRNAs and mRNAs indicated that the samples of two groups were clustered together and the signal intensity was consistent in the two groups (

 <xref rid="f2-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Furthermore, these differential alterations of the mRNAs and lncRNAs in the T1-T4 spinal cord were associated with MIRI.

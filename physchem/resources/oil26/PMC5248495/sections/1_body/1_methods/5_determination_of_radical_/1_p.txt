0: Free radical scavenging ability of the essential oils was tested using ethanol solution of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) [ 14].
1: Catechin was used as a positive reference.
2: Sample solution contained 125 L (1 mM) DPPH, 375 L ethanol and 500 L of test-solution (essential oils or catechin with different concentrations).
3: In the control solution the test-solution was replaced by ethanol.
4: The absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 514 nm.

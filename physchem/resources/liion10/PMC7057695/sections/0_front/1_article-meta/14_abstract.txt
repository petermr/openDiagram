0: Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in the field of new energy vehicles and energy storage.
1: Understanding the electrode reaction of lithium-ion batteries is the key to improve their cycle life and safety.
2: Direct measurement of thermodynamic data of the electrode reaction is a practical, economical, and nondestructive method for electrode characterization.
3: In this paper, the open-circuit voltage of the LiNi  0.5Mn  1.5O  4/Li half-cell is measured at different discharge states and different temperatures.
4: The d  E/d  TSOD (state of discharge) relation curves are fitted linearly by the least square method, and the entropy change values of different SODs are calculated.
5: Finally, the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy change of different SODs are obtained.
6: The electrode reaction of LiNi  0.5Mn  1.5O  4 in different SODs was discussed by the entropy change in different SODs.
7: According to the evolution trend of   S, the lithium intercalation reaction of LiNi  0.5Mn  1.5O  4 may be a single-phase solid solution reaction rather than a two-phase reaction.
8: Finally, the reversible heat generation at different current values and SODs are calculated.

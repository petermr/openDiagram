<p id="Par58">In summary, we used transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analyses in two first trimester placental models to identify previously unknown biological processes and molecular signaling pathways altered in response to short-term treatment with DCVC concentrations relevant to human exposures. Western blot analysis confirmed the involvement of these pathways and the functional consequences in the cell model. Although transcriptomics differed between models, GSEA demonstrated that the most substantially altered molecular signaling pathway was the ISR, and the most abundantly altered biological processes included amino acid transport, metabolism and biosynthesis, and regulation of tissue development. Evidence showed decreased global protein synthesis in agreement with ISR signaling. Despite these findings, we found no evidence for the change in cell cycle progression or proliferation under the exposure conditions used, suggesting that compensation occurred after 12Â h of DCVC treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of DCVC-mediated activation of the ISR in any cell type. These findings support the biological plausibility of DCVC-induced placental toxicity, providing a compelling rationale for further studies of DCVC and its parent chemical TCE on placental pathophysiology.</p>

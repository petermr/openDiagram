<p id="Par17">Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are a rare form of stromal cell malignant cancer accounting for one in twenty cases of ovarian cancer. GCTs can occur as either adult or juvenile subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Commonly the adult form of GCTs is diagnosed at an early stage and can be treated surgically. However, these tumors often recur, and are predominantly fatal in case of recurrence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Current research is focused on discovering new molecular markers to predict the progression of aGCTs. Established cancer markers have no prognostic significance for this type of tumor. Indeed, while many types of tumors show prognostic induction of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, aGCTs reveal a modestly impacted genome. The immunohistochemical evaluation of different oncogenes and tumor suppressors (

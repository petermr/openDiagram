<p>Histological examination of lungs harvested from mice at 2 dpi showed that TREM1-deficient animals had less evidence of inflammation when compared to WT animals (

 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> promoted remarkable lung inflammatory responses, including significant infiltration of inflammatory cells and destruction of blood vessels (

<p id="Par43">To investigate if nORFs could be involved in a particular function in 
 <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> enrichment analysis was performed on the GO terms and KEGG pathways on their parent reference genes, because they might affect the functions of existing genes. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, parent genes of the novel peptides identified from oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites are associated with very different sets of known genes. With a stringent p-value cut-off of 0.01, the parent genes that overlap with the novel peptides in oocyst sporozoites have a clear enrichment in processes related to cell localization and movement, which is further supported by the 100% enrichment of the background genes in actomyosin. On the other hand, the gene set for salivary gland sporozoite is also enriched in the actomyosin structure, and distinctively enriched in replisome complex as well.

<p>Calcium channels and prostanoid mediated vasodilation was studied following the protocol detailed by Li et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10
 <sup>−5</sup>M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), and to explore the role of calcium channels in the vasorelaxant effect, endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-channel type VOC, verapamil (10
 <sup>−5</sup> M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca
 <sup>2+-</sup>ATP
 <sub>ase</sub> (SERCA) inhibitor, thapsigargin (10
 <sup>−7</sup> M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) for 20 min prior to contraction with phenylephrine (10
 <sup>−6</sup> M), then, the cumulative concentration–response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.

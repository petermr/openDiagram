<p id="Par2">Regeneration is a sequential process specifically controlled by cellular mechanisms to repair or replace tissue or organ from an injury. The mass of undifferentiated cells (blastema) surrounding the injured tissue results in the formation of fully functional replica or imperfect replica which enacts the phenomenon of epimorphic regeneration

 </sup>. The ability to regenerate a full limb is absent in mammals but urodeles; teleost and anamniotes have the propensity to replace limbs, spinal cords, nervous system, heart, tail and, other body parts

<p>Cellular responses to DNA damage and other stresses are important determinants of cell survival and ultimately impact the development of a wide range of human diseases, including cancer where TP53 remains the most frequently mutated gene across numerous cancer types. Specifically, the ability to properly modulate the response to stress impacts tumor development, tumor responses to therapy, the toxicities of cancer treatments, the development of cardiovascular disease, outcome (extent of organ damage) following a heart attack or stroke, and the rate of progression of certain neurodegenerative disorders. When cells properly respond to stressors, like irradiation (IR)-induced DNA damage, levels of p53 protein increase, thereby modulating cell cycle progression, cell death, and cellular senescence. Increases in p53 protein levels after DNA damage have largely been attributed to increases in the half-life of the p53 protein, primarily via the modulation of proteasome-mediated degradation of the p53 protein by the E3-ubiquitin ligase MDM2. However, we have demonstrated that increased translation of p53 mRNA is also a requisite step for optimal p53 induction following DNA damage [

<p>To detect the GluN2B subunit, we used a polyclonal antibody (Alomone Labs, #AGC-003) raised in rabbit. It recognizes the extracellular, N-terminus, sequence (C)NTHEKRIYQSNMLNR corresponding to the amino-acid residues 323â€“337 of rat GluN2B. This GluN2B antibody has been successfully used in immunohistochemistry and cytochemistry experiments [

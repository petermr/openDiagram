<p>This paper reports a comprehensive study of adsorption of DOX on oxidized MWCNTs. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of DOX co-loading on carbon nanotubes, the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent in the method of molecular dynamics simulations was applied. A vital novelty of the study was a complementary application of experimental methods and computer simulations, which permits a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of co-loading doxorubicin onto carbon nanotubes and interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent.</p>

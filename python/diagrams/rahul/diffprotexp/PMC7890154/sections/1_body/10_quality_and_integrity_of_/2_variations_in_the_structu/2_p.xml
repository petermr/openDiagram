<p id="par0220">The developing grains of HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk were subjected to electron microscopy (EM) for analyzing the quality and integrity of starch granules synthesized under control (22 ± 3 °C) and HS-treated (38 °C for 2 h) conditions. We observed very bold, globular and structured starch granules with large size in case of HD3086 under control condition; whereas small granules with less numbers and empty pockets were observed in HS-treated sample (

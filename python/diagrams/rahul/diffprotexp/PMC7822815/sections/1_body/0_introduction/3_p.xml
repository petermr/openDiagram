<p id="Par5">The fusion oncogene 
 <italic>RUNX1/RUNX1T1</italic> is expressed as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(8;21), which involves the 
 <italic>RUNX1</italic> gene on chromosome 21 and the 
 <italic>RUNX1T1</italic> gene on chromosome 8
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. When expressed in haematopoietic cells, the fusion protein occupies more than 4000 genomic sites and forms transcription regulatory complexes by recruiting co-factors
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. These complexes trigger a local remodeling of chromatin of a wide range of genes and thereby affect their expression

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. In turn, the change of target gene expression leads to a block of cell differentiation, enhancement of self-renewal, modulation of the apoptosis and, eventually, to malignant transformation of t(8;21)-positive cells

 </sup>. However, despite increasing knowledge of the molecular function of 
 <italic>RUNX1/RUNX1T1</italic>, its impact on the leukemic transcriptome is still only incompletely understood. More generally, a potential role of leukemic fusion genes encoding epigenetic modulators such as RUNX1/RUNX1T1 has not yet been established for the regulation of alternative splicing.

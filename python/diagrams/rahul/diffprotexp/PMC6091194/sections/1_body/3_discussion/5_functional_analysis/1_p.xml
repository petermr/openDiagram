<p id="Par63">A number of proteins upregulated, on P3 relative to P14 and P30, associate with hereditary disorders, suggesting these proteins may play a role in genetic hearing loss. These proteins included 14–3-3 epsilon (Ywhae), myosin heavy chain 9 (Myh9), myosin VI (Myo6), and structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 3 (Smc3). The 14–3-3 proteins are a family of regulatory proteins that impact various neurological functions, including neural signaling and development, and neuroprotection [

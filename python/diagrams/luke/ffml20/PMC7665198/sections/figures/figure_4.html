 <caption> Visual representation of L-shape conformational changes in n-BA units resulting from interactions with H2O supported by experiments and MD simulations. Graphical depiction of interchain vdW interactions between neighboring p(MMA/nBA) copolymer chains containing 210 ( a—H 2O:MMA/nBA = 1:2), 420 ( b—H 2O:MMA/nBA = 1:1), and 840 ( c—H 2O:MMA/nBA = 2:1) water molecules. A fraction of bent nBA side groups (X nBA-L-shaoe) plotted as a function of # H 2O molecules for non-self-healable 60/40 p(MMA/nBA) (A1), self-healable 50/50 p(MMA/nBA) (B1), and non-self-healable 40/60 p(MMA/nBA) (C1). VdW cohesive energy plotted as a function of # H 2O molecules for non-self-healable 60/40 p(MMA/nBA) (A2), self-healable 50/50 p(MMA/nBA) (B2), and non-self-healable 40/60 p(MMA/nBA) (C2). </caption>

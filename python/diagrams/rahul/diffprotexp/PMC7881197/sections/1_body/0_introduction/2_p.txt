0: Current chymotherapy treatments for breast cancer can be categorized as selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators, estrogen production inhibitors, and cell growth receptor modulators 4  6.
1: Most estrogen receptor modulators resemble the hormone estrogen and, although ineffective at triggering ER mediated transcription, bind to the estrogen receptor instead of the hormone to prevent breast cancer cells from proliferating 4.
2: Aromatase inhibitors block the production of estrogen 7.
3: Biological response modulators target specific proteins on the cell surface of breast cancer cells (e.g.
4: HER2) to suppress their growth 8.
5: Yet because these drugs affect both normal and cancerous breast cells, side effects, including neuropathy, osteoporosis, infertility, lymphedema, and more, are inevitable.

<p>To identify genes associated with mortality, we performed whole blood transcriptomic analysis of a discovery set consisting of 29 Thai melioidosis patients, fourteen of whom survived and fifteen of whom died within 28 days, and 3 healthy controls. The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The quality of 32 RNA samples were analyzed for integrity and read count/mapped read numbers. Overall average RNA integrity numbers (RIN) of 6.0-8.6, average OD ratios 260/280 &gt; 1.8, 260/230 &lt; 1, and average of 22 million reads with mapping rate of &gt;58% were achieved from each cDNA library. Out of 20,802 genes, 18,713 genes with expression values between 10th - 100th percentiles were further analyzed using one-way ANOVA and 5,189 genes were statistically different among groups as shown in three dimensional principal component analysis (3D-PCA) plots (

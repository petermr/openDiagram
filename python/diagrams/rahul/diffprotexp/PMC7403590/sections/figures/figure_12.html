 <caption> Autophagic-lysosomal pathway in VD. Autophagic and lysosomal markers were determined in post-mortem human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of VD patients and controls. The levels of LC3II, p62, Beclin1, Lamp2A, Lamp1 and CatD were determined in: ( A) SNpc; ( B) Hippocampus and ( C) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. ( D) Densitometric analysis of the levels of LC3II, p62, Beclin1, Lamp2A, Lamp1 and CatD. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5–6, *p &lt; 0.05, versus SNpc control subjects and &amp;p &lt; 0.05, versus cortex control subjects). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information. </caption>

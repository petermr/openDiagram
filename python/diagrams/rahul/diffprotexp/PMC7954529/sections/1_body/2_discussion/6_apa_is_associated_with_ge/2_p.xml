<p>Alternatively, the large effect sizes for differential usage of 3' UTR PAS could also be driving the relationship between differential APA and differential expression. In line with this hypothesis, we found increases in AU destabilizing elements and ubiquitination marks for genes with divergent 3' UTR PAS. However, since PAS usage is calculated as a ratio, we may have detected changes in intronic PAS usage solely as a mathematical consequence of changes in 3' UTR PAS. Functional follow-up on the genes with PAS detected as differentially used between and within species would be necessary to explore the relative importance of each of these regulatory pathways and to disentangle the results from both studies.</p>

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows that our WMFVS and WFVS methods display better precision than the traditional DEG-based method (i.e., the all-DEG set and the top-463 DEG set) in four of five cancer gene data sets. Moreover, approximately 60–70% of the genes are dark genes, which were detected by using our WMFVS and WFVS methods but ignored by the traditional DEG method. Even for the MSigDB C6 data set, which was generated directly from microarray data or from internal unpublished profiling experiments involving the perturbation of known cancer genes, the WMFVS and WFVS methods also have a good ability to detect dark genes. In summary, our WMFVS and WFVS methods have an advantage in identifying dark genes that are hard to find by using traditional DEG methods.

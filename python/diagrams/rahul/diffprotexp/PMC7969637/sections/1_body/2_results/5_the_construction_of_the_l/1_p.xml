<p>With the selected 50 genes, we generated logistic regression model 1 from the training set GSE26440. In order to use as few variables as possible to build a strong interpretation model, we performed a stepwise regression method to further identify 5 primary genes from these 50 genes, which were TLR2, MMP9, TLR8, MPO, and CCL5. Logistic regression model 2 was constructed by incorporating these 5 genes into the model as variables. An OR value &gt;1 indicated that the expression of this factor was positively correlated with the onset of disease, while &lt;1 was negatively correlated. At the same time, we found that the 
 <italic>p</italic>-values of these 2 genes, MMP9 and MPO, were &lt;0.05, indicating that they contribute greatly to the model while others (TLR2, TLR8, as well as CCL5 with 
 <italic>p</italic>-value more than 0.05) were not used for model 3 construction and subsequent analysis. Furthermore, we reconstructed logistic regression model 3 with these 2 genes as the final model and found that this logistic regression model had no extreme point affecting the accuracy of the model. The red dashed line in the figure indicated the COOK distance. Generally, the point where the COOK distance &gt;0.5 was a very “influential” point, which affected the reliability of the model. It could be seen in the figure that our model did not show such a point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The AUC value in the training set GSE26440 was 0.9907, while the AUC values in GSE26378 and GSE66099 were 0.9477 and 0.9562, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The AUC as a numerical value can directly evaluate the quality of the model. The larger the value, the better the model.

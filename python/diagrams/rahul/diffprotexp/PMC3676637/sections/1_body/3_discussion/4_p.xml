<p>A recent study indicated that primary tumors can be regarded as genetically heterogeneous and contain subpopulations of cells with varying levels of metastatic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The data indicate that primary tumors are subpopulations of cells with different characteristics. This study indicated, by difference of identified proteins, that cancer cells can have different characteristics between primary tumors and metastatic tumors. The different characteristics might relate to brain metastasis in this study.

<p id="Par34">RNA extraction was done with a combination of the method established by Chomczynski (1993) using Tri-reagent (N.93289, Sigma, USA) and the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Three extractions were made for each stage (normal, day 1 and day 3) and each extraction consisted of pooled tissue samples from three organisms at the same stage. The concentration and quality of the RNA was determined by using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). Samples with a concentration greater than 200 ng/μL and an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) value of ≥ 8 were used for sequencing.</p>

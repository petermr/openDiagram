  <p>LE gene panel predicts poor OS in multiple cancer types with reported relationship with CNTN1 expression. The above datasets were organized by SurvExpress; specifically, lung adenocarcinoma (
   <italic>n</italic> = 475), lung squamous cell carcinoma (
   <italic>n</italic> = 175), esophageal carcinoma (
   <italic>n</italic> = 184), hepatocellular carcinoma (
   <italic>n</italic> = 361), breast cancer (
   <italic>n</italic> = 962), low grade glioma (
   <italic>n</italic> = 512), and stomach adenocarcinoma (
   <italic>n</italic> = 352) were all from TCGA. HR and 95% CI (confidence interval) for individual analyses are included. Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves are shown. Statistical analyses were performed using log rank test. All analyses were carried out using tools provided by SurvExpress.

 <caption> Kaplan-Meier survival curves of seven hub genes related to overall survival (OS). CDC25A ( a), BIRC5 ( b), CCNE1 ( c), CCNF ( d), DLGAP5 ( e), and KPNA2 ( f) were positively correlated with OS, and VEGFA ( g) was negatively correlated with OS. The red lines represent the high expression groups, and the blue lines represent the low expression groups </caption>

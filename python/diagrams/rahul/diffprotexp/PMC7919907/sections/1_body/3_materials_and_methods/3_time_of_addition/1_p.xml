<p>Drug time-of-addition experiment was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Briefly, RD cells were seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 12-well plate. 1000 µg/ml BLF was added at different time points of viral life cycle, as illustrated in 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(B)</xref>: −2 to −1 h (viral attachment), −1 to 0 h (viral entry), 0, 3, 6 to 14 h (post-viral entry). RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 at an MOI of 0.1 24 h after seeding. Viruses were harvested at 12 hpi. The viral titers were determined by plaque assay.

<p id="p0135">Age-associated neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with multifactorial etiology 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In this study, UCHL1, a ubiquitin ligase exclusively expressed in neurons, is up-regulated in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> versus wild type. UCHL1 was shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of PD and AD 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and is elevated in AD patients 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, AD mice 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and senescent C57BL/6J mouse pituitaries 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> compared to controls. However, UCHL1 overexpression has been shown to delay AD progression 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and low levels have also been reported in 
 <italic>postmortem</italic> brain tissue from AD patients 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The increased expression level of UCHL1 protein by RGE treatment suggested that it may play important roles in antiaging and life span extension, and potentially neurodegenerative disorders. HSP70, which also showed increased expression in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, plays important protective roles in various neurodegenerative disorders 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. HSP70 is up-regulated in AD model mice compared to normal mice 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Further studies are required to explore these mechanisms during the process of neurodegeneration, and RGE may offer new avenues for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative disorders that currently have no effective medication.

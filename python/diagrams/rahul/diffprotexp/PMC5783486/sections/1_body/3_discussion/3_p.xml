<p>The biological processes associated with differentially expressed proteins in CAD and CAA were also analyzed. Variations between the two conditions were identified in the present study; lower representation of proteins associated with the wounding response, lipoprotein modelling, platelet activation and blood coagulation, revealed that patients with KD and CAD may exhibit stress responses associated with coronary artery injury. However, within CAA patients, the representation of proteins involved in the response to wounding and the corresponding cholesterol components increased significantly with respect to control samples, indicating aggravated injury in coronary arteries. All of the identified significant proteins were used to construct a signaling network to clarify the overall pathway associations. The main pathways were enriched for functions in infection and immune associated diseases, inflammation and metabolism. These results are consistent with a previous hypothesis (

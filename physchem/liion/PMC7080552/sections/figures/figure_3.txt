0: Figure 3ad) The crosssectional SEM images and EDX mapping of Mg of LiBMg composite in different states.
1: a) Pristine, b) after 15.3 mA h of Li was stripped, and c,d) SEM and Mg distribution after 15.3 mA h of Li was stripped.
2: e) The pristine Li foil, f) after 24.3% Li (60 mA h of Li) was stripped, and g) the surface of Li foil after 24.3% Li was stripped.

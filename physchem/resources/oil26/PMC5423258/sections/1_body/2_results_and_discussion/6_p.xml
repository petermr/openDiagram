<p>The antifungal activities of the essential oils of 
 <italic>C. decurren</italic>s, 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> and 
 <italic>T. articulata </italic>against tested yeast strains are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>. Essential oil of 
 <italic>C. decurren</italic>s showed no activities against all the tested yeast strains except 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> which showed growth inhibition at concentration 0.824 µL/mL. 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> showed no susceptibility to any of the studied essential oils, while essential oils of 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> and 
 <italic>T. articulata </italic>inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> at concentration range 0.42- 0.757 µL/mL. The tested essential oils showed MFC against the susceptible 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species ranging from 1.148 µL/mL to 2.828 µL/mL. 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> essential oil showed the highest fungicidal activities followed by 
 <italic>T. articulata </italic>and 
 <italic>C. decurren</italic>s

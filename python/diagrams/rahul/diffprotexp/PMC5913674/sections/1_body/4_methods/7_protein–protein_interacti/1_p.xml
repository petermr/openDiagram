<p>Network analysis was performed by submitting DEP ascensions to the STRING software (v10.5) [
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Interaction networks were visualized for proteins with medium confidence (0.4), with network edges based on confidence, continuous lines for direct interactions, and indirect interactions with interrupted lines. Clustering was based on a Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) inflation default parameter of 3.

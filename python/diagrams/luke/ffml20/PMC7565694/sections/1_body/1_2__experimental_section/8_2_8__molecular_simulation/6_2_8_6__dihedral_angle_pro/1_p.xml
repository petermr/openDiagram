<p>Dihedral angle profiles are used to examine the mobility of linking groups of polymer chains. Four consecutive atoms in the backbone are used to calculate the dihedral angle 
 <italic>θ</italic>. The dihedral angle is defined as the angle between the two planes formed by the first three and last three atoms. For the most extended planar conformation, the dihedral angle 
 <italic>θ</italic> is ±180°. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S3</xref> illustrates the schematic diagrams of the analyzed atomic segments for the dihedral angle analysis.

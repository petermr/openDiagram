<p id="Par23">Importantly, however, we observed that a number of neuronal subtype populations defined by AS, APA, and IR were not identified by the analysis of GE alone. In particular, AS, APA, and IR distinguished excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the limbic system, whereas GE data did not discriminate these classes of neurons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). In contrast, when only GE data were used, olfactory system and the proprioceptor neurons clustered separately, whereas AS, APA, and IR were only able to distinguish neurons from the peripheral and central nervous system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). This suggests that despite the importance of multi-layered regulatory networks in defining the properties of the nervous system, certain distinguishing characteristics of neuronal populations are more strongly associated with some layers than others. Thus, consistent with findings from analyzing neurons from different hippocampal regions described above, neuronal specificity more generally depends on the collective contribution of multiple regulatory layers, but each layer may have a more prominent relative contribution than other layers depending on the specific spatial and functional properties of a neuronal subtype population (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

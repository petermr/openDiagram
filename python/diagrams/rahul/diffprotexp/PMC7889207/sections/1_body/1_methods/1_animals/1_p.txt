0: Details of the study design have been described previously [ 12].
1: Briefly, three-week old male Wistar rats were fed either a high fat, high sugar cafeteria diet (CD) (n = 10) consisting of a patty containing 40% fat, 15% protein and 44% carbohydrates and a jelly cube supplemented with 15% (w/v) sucrose and fructose or a standard diet (STD) (n = 10) consisting of 11% fat, 15% protein and 74% carbohydrates for three months.
2: Water was given  ad libitum.
3: SAT and retroperitoneal fat, a marker of VAT, were subsequently harvested for histological, gene expression and DNA methylation analysis.
4: The selection of retroperitoneal fat as a representative of VAT is based on reports that (1) lipids from this depot drain directly into the kidney, pancreas and vena cava and (2) retroperitoneal fat mass in humans is directly associated with metabolic syndrome and hypertension [ 13].
5: Ethics for this study was granted (ECRA # 11/03/B) by the Ethics Committee for Research on Animals (ECRA) of the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC, Tygerberg, South Africa).

0: The total heat generation of the Li-ion battery can be calculated using  eq   4( 22) 4where  I is the current value (the discharge current is determined to be negative here),  Ri is the internal resistance of the battery, and  S is the entropy change.
1: Negative  Q means exothermic reaction in which heat is transferred from the battery.
2: On the contrary, positive  Q indicates an endothermic reaction.
3: Qirreversible is always negative and only related to current and internal resistance.
4: The positivity and negativity of  Qreversible depend on the symbol of  S and current.
5: 23 The sum of  Qirreversible and  Qreversible determines the symbol and size of  Qtotal, that is, the total amount of heat generated by the battery.
6: For example, when  S is negative and  I is negative in the discharge process,  I2Ri and  T SI/ nF are both negative values and  Qtotal is negative.
7: In the charging process,  I is positive, so  T SI/ nF is positive and  I2Ri is negative; thus, the positive and negative symbols of  Qtotal are determined by the larger absolute values of the two items.

 <caption> GSK3B is closely related to m 5C regulators. (A) The importance of key proteins of the downstream pathway in the three major categories of Gene Ontology (GO), including biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions. The X axis is the score obtained by comprehensively considering the weight of the three categories of GO. The higher the score, the more important the protein is involved in the GO project. (B) Co-expression analysis of m 5C differential proteins of the ErbB and PI3Kâ€“Akt pathways. The co-expression scores of related genes were displayed. The color intensity reflects the reliability of co-expression; meanwhile, red and blue indicate high correlation and low correlation, respectively. (C) Correlation analysis between writers and reader protein of m 5C with GSK3B. There were significant differences between GSK3B and all genes. (D) The samples were grouped according to the median expression of GSK3B gene, and differential expression analysis was performed. (E) 3D structure of streptozotocin. (F) PPI network analysis between the common genes between streptozotocin. </caption>

  <p>Results of survival analyses in male and female sub-cohorts of TCGA-HNSC. 
   <bold>(A, B)</bold> No significant correlation between immune score and survival was observed in males or females (P&gt;0.05). 
   <bold>(C–E)</bold> The expression of all hub genes was significantly correlated with survival in the male group (P&lt;0.005). 
   <bold>(F–H)</bold> In the females, all hub genes’ expression was not associated with survival (P&gt;0.05).

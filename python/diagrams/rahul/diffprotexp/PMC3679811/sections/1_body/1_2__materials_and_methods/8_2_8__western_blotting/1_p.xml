<p>Four proteins, apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A isoform 1 (EIF4G1), and Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein (AZGP1), were analyzed by Western blotting. Each peritoneal dialysate sample (1

Proteins were transferred from the gel to a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, CA, USA) by means of the semidry technique using the Criterion Blotter (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 60 min and blocked with 5% milk in PBS (adjusted to pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20.

<p id="Par32">To further identify novel miRNAs in the developing Tartary buckwheat seed, the remaining sRNA sequences that were not mapped to the Tartary buckwheat reference genome were analyzed using the miRdeep2 program. As a result, a total of 129 novel miRNAs were identified (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). The length of these novel miRNAs ranged from 18 nt to 24 nt, and the minimum free energy (AMFE) distribution ranged from − 116.2 kcal moL
 <sup>− 1</sup> to − 26.2 kcal moL
 <sup>− 1</sup> (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Among these novel miRNAs, 66 miRNAs were assigned to 35 known miRNA families in the miRNA database, while the remaining 63 miRNAs had no similarity to any known family. Like the above identified conserved miRNAs, more than two-thirds of the novel miRNAs were expressed at a moderate or high level, and the highest expression was fta_novel_miR71 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4).

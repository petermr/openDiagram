<p>Our study showed that protein spot 2-DE distribution patterns of congenital cholesteatoma are consistent among specimens and completely different from acquired cholesteatoma. Many proteins (127 spots) were exclusively expressed in congenital cholesteatoma, and not found in EAC skin or acquired cholesteatoma. Proteins that we did not expect to be expressed in fully differentiated epithelial cells were titin (gi|407139), forkhead transcription activator homolog (FKH 5–3, gi|477361), ryanodine receptor 2 (cardiac), and isoform CRA_c (gi|119590477), all of which are expressed in mesodermal tissues [

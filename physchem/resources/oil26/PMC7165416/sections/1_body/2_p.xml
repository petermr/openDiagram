<p>Here we determined the spectral phenotypes of M/LWS pigments in the highly divergent mammalian clades Rodentia (superorder Euarchontoglires) and Afrotheria, for which sequence-based predictions have suggested marked short-wavelength spectral shifts (

Our results indicate that five rodents—the alpine marmot, degu, golden hamster (“hamster”), lesser Egyptian jerboa (“jerboa”), and Mongolian gerbil (“gerbil”)—are all sensitive to shorter wavelengths of light (516, 502, 504, 501, and 490 nm, respectively) than the predicted values (

We also found that the pigment of one species, the Damaraland mole-rat, showed no readable peak despite possessing an intact open reading frame, implying a potentially unstable pigment (

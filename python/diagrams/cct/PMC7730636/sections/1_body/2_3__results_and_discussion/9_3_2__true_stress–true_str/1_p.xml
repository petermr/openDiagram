<p>Basic input parameters for high temperature True Stress–True Strain curves are temperature, deformation rate and deformation degree. Deformation degree was set as constant (Δ
 <italic>L</italic> = 0.6), while other two parameters were variable during the experiment. There are used temperatures 900, 1000, 1100 and 1200 °C and deformation rates 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 s
 <sup>−1</sup> in the experiment. As a result, twenty True Strain–True Stress high temperature curves were measured. The measured flow stress data was corrected by Equation (1) due to the friction.

<p>Based on global LIB recycling capacity in 2016 (94,000 tons) reported by Mayyas et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and global LIB sales for 2016 (500,000 tons) (Calculated based on energy sales statistics from Pilot [
 <xref rid="B54-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and considering an average energy density of 180 Wh/kg), the theoretical installed recycling capacity only covered 19% of the 2016 manufacturing one, assuming that all recycling plants were exclusively dedicated to LIB recycling. For 2024, this ratio falls below 9% according to the expected LIB sales (3,000,000 tons) and the recycling capacity forecast (264,000 tons) provided by Propulsion Quebec [

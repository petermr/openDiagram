<p>Pathways analyses were performed in GSEA v4.0.3

  <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 </sup> with standard parameters, 1000 phenotype permutations and using KEGG pathways database as reference[
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, gene ontology analyses were performed using the web-based GOrilla platform[
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Multiple testing problems were addressed by employing Benjamini-Hochberg correction[
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and a q value below 0.05 was considered significant in all cases. All figures were made using

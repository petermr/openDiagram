0: Tryptic peptides were reconstituted in 40 L of 0.1% TFA (v/v) in water: acetonitrile (95:5) and 4 L was directly loaded at 4 L/min for 7 min onto a custom-made trap column (100 m I.D.
1: fused silica with Kasil frit) containing 2 cm of 200A, 5 m Magic C18AQ particles (Bruker-Michrom, Auburn, CA).
2: Peptides were eluted using a custom-made analytical column (75 m I.D.
3: fused silica) with gravity-pulled tip and packed with 25 cm 100A, 5 m Magic C18AQ particles (Bruker-Michrom, Auburn, CA).
4: Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 100% solvent A (0.1% formic acid:acetonitrile [95:05]) to 35% solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid) in 30 min at 300 nL/min, using a Proxeon Easy nanoLC system directly coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
5: Data were acquired using a data-dependent acquisition routine of acquiring one mass spectrum from  m/z 3502000 in the Orbitrap (resolution 60,000) followed by tandem mass spectrometry scans in the LTQ linear ion trap of the 10 most abundant precursor ions found in the mass spectrum.
6: Charge state rejection of singly charged ions and dynamic exclusion was utilized to minimize data redundancy and maximize peptide identification.
7: The raw data files were processed into peak lists for database searching.

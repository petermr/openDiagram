<p>BDNF, encoding a member of the nerve growth factor family of proteins, is a crucial regulator of neuronal growth, differentiation and survival [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous evidence in mouse and cellular models of HD revealed that mHtt not only inhibited the synthesis and release of BDNF at cortico-striatal synaptic junction [
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but also disrupted its post-Golgi trafficking and vesicular transport [
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A resultant reduction in BDNF supply led to a failure of trophic support, which, in turn, exacerbated striatal degeneration and motor deficits [
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the neuropathological mechanisms of HD attributable to low BDNF expression remained elusive. Consequently, we sought to conduct a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of BDNF based on gene expression data and functional annotations, which might gain insight into the molecular roles of BDNF underlying HD pathogenesis.

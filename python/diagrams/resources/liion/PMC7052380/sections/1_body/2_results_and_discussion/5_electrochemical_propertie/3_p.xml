<p>The polarization of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C electrode is explained by the electron transfer pathway, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>. The carbon is dispersed unevenly, so the electrons cannot reach the entire reactive site where the Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions intercalate. In contrast, for LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene, due to the one-dimensional Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion mobility in the framework, the graphene can ensure that electrons reach particles from all directions and alleviate the polarization, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>. Therefore, the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites, with well-defined peaks and smaller potential difference, have higher electrochemical reactivity.

 </sup>. Briefly, anaesthesia was induced with Propofol (i.v. 10 mg/kg, Abbott Animal Health) and maintained with gaseous isofluorane. A veterinary anaesthetist was present to administer anaesthetic agents and monitor vital signs. Stereotaxic surgery involved a craniotomy over the left motor cortex (approximate coordinates: AP + 23, ML + 8). An area corresponding to the distal left forelimb motor cortex was identified through microstimulation (11 pulse 330 Hz trains

 </sup>) of the cortical surface around the cruciate sulcus. Next, a 16-site silicon probe (NeuroNexus) was implanted into the identified area. The probe consisted of sixteen 2 mm shanks, spaced 100 µm apart, with a single recording site at each tip. Sites were referenced to a skull screw situated contralateral to the craniotomy. Additionally, EMG recording leads (multistranded stainless steel, Teflon insulated, diameter 0.3 mm, Cooner, Chatsworth, CA, USA) were implanted into the left forelimb Cleidobrachialis Flexor, as well as the long and lateral heads of Triceps Brachii Extensor muscles. A Teflon insulated lead was also implanted into connective tissue in the left forepaw wrist. This lead was used to carry a 400 mV 30 kHz sine wave transmitted through the paw when in contact with a copper baseplate on the floor of the recording environment, enabling the detection of paw lift-off at the initiation of each reach. Animals recovered from surgery in the home pen for 1 week prior to commencement of daily recording sessions (see above).

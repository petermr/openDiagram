0: Unfortunately, both vaccines and treatment options with drugs are limited due to the biological complexity of the Apicomplexan parasites [ 4].
1: Even for the well-studied  Plasmodium species, there is only one vaccine targeted for malaria with relatively low efficacy [ 5,  6].
2: The complexity arises from the highly regulated life cycles that allow them to inhabit different hosts and intracellular niches [ 7].
3: To tackle this challenge, multi-omics data including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets have been produced to understand the biological processes underlying infection and disease causation, which can potentially be targeted with drug design [ 8].
4: However, these studies are often conducted in silos and, therefore, their insights are limited due to the lack of consistency [ 9].

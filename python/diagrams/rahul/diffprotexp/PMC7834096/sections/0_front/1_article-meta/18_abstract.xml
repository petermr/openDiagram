 <p>Whereas the O104:H4 enterohemorrhagic 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) outbreak strain from 2011 expresses aggregative adherence fimbriae of subtype I (AAF/I), its close relative, the O104:H4 enteroaggregative 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EAEC) strain 55989, encodes AAF of subtype III. Tight adherence mediated by AAF/I in combination with Shiga toxin 2 production has been suggested to result in the outbreak strain’s exceptional pathogenicity. Furthermore, the O104:H4 outbreak strain adheres significantly better to cultured epithelial cells than archetypal EAEC strains expressing different AAF subtypes. To test whether AAF/I expression is associated with the different virulence phenotypes of the outbreak strain, we heterologously expressed AAF subtypes I, III, IV, and V in an AAF-negative EAEC 55989 mutant and compared AAF-mediated phenotypes, incl. autoaggregation, biofilm formation, as well as bacterial adherence to HEp-2 cells. We observed that the expression of all four AAF subtypes promoted bacterial autoaggregation, though with different kinetics. Disturbance of AAF interaction on the bacterial surface via addition of α-AAF antibodies impeded autoaggregation. Biofilm formation was enhanced upon heterologous expression of AAF variants and inversely correlated with the autoaggregation phenotype. Co-cultivation of bacteria expressing different AAF subtypes resulted in mixed bacterial aggregates. Interestingly, bacteria expressing AAF/I formed the largest bacterial clusters on HEp-2 cells, indicating a stronger host cell adherence similar to the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain. Our findings show that, compared to the closely related O104:H4 EAEC strain 55989, not only the acquisition of the Shiga toxin phage, but also the acquisition of the AAF/I subtype might have contributed to the increased EHEC O104:H4 pathogenicity.

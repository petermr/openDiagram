<p id="Par45">It is challenging in ML to obtain a model that is accurate and simple at the same time. Simplistic models show a lower degree of prediction accuracy or are under fitted, whereas overly complex models often performed worst on the test data or unknown sets of data. Such models can capture perfect trends on the training dataset but show poor transferability to unknown sets of data and suffer from overfitting. Hence, models need to be optimized by tuning the hyperparameters so that an ideal trade-off between accuracy and computational demand is reached.</p>

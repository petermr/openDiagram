<p id="Par36">The role of retinoic acid signaling in regulating angiogenesis is not studied in detail. A few reports have suggested that retinoic acid has both anti-angiogenic and pro-angiogenic effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the key molecule in retinoic acid signaling, has an important role in modulating angiogenesis. In vitro co-culture studies with human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human umbilical vein ECs reveal that the dose dependent role of ATRA in stimulating capillary tube formation, through activation of endogenous VEGF signaling [

Our study demonstrates for the first time that retinoic acid signaling pathway and their target genes are dysregulated in cerebral AVM nidus. Moreover, we observed increased expression of ALDH1A2, the rate-limiting enzyme in the retinoic acid signaling pathway and various retinoic acid response genes in the malformed vascular structure of AVM nidus (Fig.

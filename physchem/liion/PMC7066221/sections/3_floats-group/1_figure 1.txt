0: Figure 1Comparison of Performance and the Self-Recovery Chemistry in a MnO   2 Cathode  (A) Comparison of cycling performance of -MnO   2, -MnO   2, and cobalt-modified -MnO   2 cathodes with a 2 M ZnSO   4 electrolyte containing 0.2 M MnSO   4.
1: (B) Comparison of retention rates and Coulombic efficiencies of the MnO   2 cathodes with or without 0.2 M MnSO   4 in the electrolyte (the calculation of retention rate is based on the 10   th discharging of the cathodes).
2: (C and D) (C) First five galvanostatic discharging and charging profiles of a cobalt-modified -MnO   2 cathode and (D) the corresponding dQ/dV profiles from 1.55 to 1.80 V.  (E) A schematic and an equation for describing the dynamic capacity retention of a Mn-based cathode.
3: (F) Comparison of the fifth charging of the MnO   2 cathodes; inset shows their corresponding dQ/dV profiles from 1.62 to 1.80 V.  (G) Comparison of the rate performance of -MnO   2, -MnO   2, and cobalt-modified -MnO   2 cathodes with a 2 M ZnSO   4 electrolyte containing 0.2 M MnSO   4.

 <p>The raw manuscript was written by B.M. One aim is to demonstrate the progress gained in the field by the lead author, his supervisors (O.K. and C.S.) and co-workers. B.M. is a member of the groups of Materials Science and Polymer Physics at the University of Rostock, Germany. Those two groups later joined together as 
  <italic>Competence Center for Calorimetry and Thermal Analysis Rostock, Â°CALOR</italic> and collaborated with major international partners e.g., from University of Southampton, UK (M.J.S.) and Monash University, Australia (P.A.R.). Therefore, all authors discussed the results. All authors have revised the text and given their approval for the final version of the manuscript.

   <bold>A</bold>). Differential gene expression analysis results. Principal component analysis (PCA) plot of the normalized expression matrix. Each point represents individual samples. (
   <bold>B</bold>â€“
   <bold>D</bold>). Corresponding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from comparisons of non-tumor vs. individual glioma grades by using the limma package with a 0.6 absolute log2 fold change and adjusted 
   <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 with FDR cutoff, which is indicated with red points. (
   <bold>E</bold>). Relative fold change of significantly changed ETS members for glioma grade compared with non-tumor samples by differential gene expression analysis. (
   <bold>F</bold>). Intersection of DEGs between limma results, Elk1VP16 and PEA3VP16, which are our previously published micro arrays, were represented as venn diagrams.

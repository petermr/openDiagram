<p>Takacova et al. compared the reaction kinetics of several LCO battery leaching conditions and concluded to a two-step leaching reaction that it is limited in the first 15 min by the cobalt reaction rate (

 <italic>Ea</italic> = 3–6 kJ/mol) dependent of acid concentration and temperature. Conversely, Meshram et al. came to the conclusion of a single-step surface layer diffusion controlled leaching mode, which does not fit with the shrinking core model [

However, the log rate empirical model used by Meshram et al. does not fit to linearity in the first 30 min, which confirms a change in the control mechanism. Takacova et al. suggested that lithium, primarily controlled by a mixed mechanism, diffuses first through the internal LCO structure, which opens the structure lattice, enhancing the leaching reaction between leaching agent and Co [

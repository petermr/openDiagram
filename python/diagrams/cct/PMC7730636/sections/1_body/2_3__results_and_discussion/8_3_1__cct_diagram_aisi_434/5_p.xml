<p>Several authors have discussed the issue of creating a CCT diagram of a given steel. As is known, the main parameters that affect the overall shape of the CCT diagram are primarily the chemical composition. However, the set austenitization temperature is also an important factor. Boyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] examined AISI 4340 steel from the point of view of creating its CCT diagram. The critical cooling rate at which only the martensite microstructure is formed was determined to be 8.3 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Our critical rate of pure martensitic transformation is 0.5 °C. Overall, their diagram is shifted to the left. Likewise, a group of authors, Samadi Shahreza et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Penha et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], dealt with this issue, and their resulting CCT diagrams are also slightly shifted to the left. Nasar A. Ali [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Popescu et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] investigate a very similar steel with a slightly higher content of Cr and Ni. Their CCT diagrams match our measured diagrams in the critical transformation of martensite as well as in the overall shape of the diagram. Our CCT diagram does not include the beginning of pearlitic transformation because this transformation takes place only at very low cooling rates. The higher content of Cr and Ni in the investigated steel shifts the whole area of pearlitic transformation to the right. When comparing our diagram, the value of the temperature 
 <italic>Ms</italic> coincides with other authors. Our material contains the upper limits of the main alloying elements, and this higher percentage of alloying elements, especially Cr and Ni, significantly affects the resulting shape and orientation of our CCT diagram when compared to other authors.

<p>Prior to the present study, we performed a preliminary experiment to define the optimal experimental conditions (results not shown). For this, we tested different concentrations of three sugars (sucrose, sorbitol and mannitol) for three weeks. Sorbitol and mannitol seemed to have a similar effect when we compared them, so we selected sucrose and sorbitol as osmotic stressors. Chilling temperatures (temperature below optimal, but above freezing) above 4 °C are often used as preculture to cold acclimate the

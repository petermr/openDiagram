<p id="Par33">Mitochondrial protein extracts (1500 µg) from A549 cells infected with H5N1 or H9N2 influenza viruses were loaded onto 2-D gels. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed 227 protein spots in the H5N1 group (Figure S1A) and 169 protein spots in the H9N2 group (Figure S1B). Eight differentially expressed protein spots from the mitochondria are also illustrated in an enlarged format (Figure S1C). After further MS identification and removal of redundancy, 32 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Compared with the H9N2-infected group, the H5N1-infected group had 16 upregulated mitochondrial proteins and 16 downregulated proteins (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Upregulated 70-kDa heat shock protein 1-like (HSPA1L) is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1) is located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Among these downregulated proteins, stress-70 protein, malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (ATP5F1), and stomatin-like 2 protein are located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, while peroxiredoxin 5 and 60-kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

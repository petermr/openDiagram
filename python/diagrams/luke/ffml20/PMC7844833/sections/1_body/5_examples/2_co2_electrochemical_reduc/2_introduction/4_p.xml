<p>The CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR is highly sensitive to the catalyst structure and oxidation state, and the transformation or rearrangement of structural motifs at the catalyst surface under working conditions can result in significant changes in the catalytic properties. 
 <italic>In situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> characterization tools such as XAS are therefore indispensable for the understanding of the details of the CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR mechanism and the subsequent rational design of novel more efficient catalysts.

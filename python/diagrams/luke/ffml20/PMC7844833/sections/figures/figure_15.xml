  <p>Determination of particle sizes for oxide NPs from XANES: (a, b) analysis of particle sizes in NiO nanostructures. (a) Experimental Fourier transformed Ni K-edge EXAFS data for a NiO thin film (tf) and nanocrystalline NiO are compared with the best matching theoretical EXAFS spectrum from MD simulations. (b) Differences between experimental and simulated EXAFS data for NP models with different sizes and Ni vacancy concentrations. Reproduced with permission from ref (

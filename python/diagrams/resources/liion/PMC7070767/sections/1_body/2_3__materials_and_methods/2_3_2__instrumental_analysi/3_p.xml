<p>The surface structure parameters of the samples were determined using N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption measurements. The adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured by an Autosorb iQ-AG-C Quantachrome instrument (Boyton Beach, FL, USA) at 77 K. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method was used to determine the specific surface area.

<p>Mechanisms underlying PC initiation, progression, and therapy resistance have been extensively investigated. Risk assessment for PC prognosis using clinical features and molecular biomarkers has been actively pursued, leading to numerous biomarker candidates particularly for BCR risk assessment [

However, even with such extensive investigations, our understanding of PC progression remains incomplete and current prediction of PC relapse risk still needs substantial improvement. Effective prognostic biomarkers are the basis for therapy decision making and individualized therapies.

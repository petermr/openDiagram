<p>The proteomic alterations in the hemolymph of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>siamensis goniomphalos</italic> infected with 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> were characterized using the label-free quantitation methodology SWATH-MS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005104.g001">Fig 1</xref>). All examined snails were screened individually to determine trematode infection by using cercarial shedding and confirmed by PCR. All snails that were negative by PCR were negative for 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> and other trematode infections, while PCR-positive snails were visually positive for 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005104.s007">S1 Fig</xref>). All challenged snails used for the proteomics analysis were positive by PCR for 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> infection, while control snails were negative. Samples were prepared for SWATH-MS analysis and, subsequently, subjected to SWATH-MS to generate the spectral library and quantification. Three different biological replicates from each time point were analyzed and a total of 498 and 399 peptides corresponding to 362 and 242 proteins were used to build the hemocyte and plasma libraries respectively; of these, approximately 107 proteins were common to both samples (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only proteins with 2 or more identified unique peptides and &lt;1% FDR were selected for the library, although not all the peptides were used for library construction (e.g. peptides with less than 6 transitions). The total number of proteins used in the library corresponded to 0.47% and 0.31% (for hemocytes and plasma respectively) of the whole snail predicted proteome published previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. After importing the SWATH-MS target data into Skyline, we confidently identified a total of 343 and 217 proteins at an FDR &lt;1%, in hemocytes and plasma, respectively. Only peptides found in all 4 time points and all 3 replicates were used for statistical and quantification analysis (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005104.s002">S2</xref> Tables). Statistical analysis of the expression values of proteins from infected versus control snails was conducted, and only proteins showing a 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 were considered as significant for further analysis (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005104.s004">S4</xref> Tables). The expression profile (volcano plot) of the identified proteins at different times post-infection is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005104.g002">Fig 2</xref>. A total of 145 and 117 proteins from hemocytes and plasma, respectively, exhibited significant differences in their expression levels upon infection, of which 36 proteins were common to both samples (

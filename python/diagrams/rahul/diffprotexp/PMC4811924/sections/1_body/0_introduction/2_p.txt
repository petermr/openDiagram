0: Biofilms are assemblages of microorganisms characterized by cells that are irreversibly attached to a substratum and embedded in a matrix of self-produced extracellular polymeric substances such as exopolysaccharides (EPS), proteins, nucleic acids and other substances; this type of sessile community-based existence is a critical characteristic for bacterial persistence (Davey and O'Toole,  2000).
1: The physical and biological properties of the biofilm, such as slow growth and mechanical barrier, have a substantial role in the development of increased antimicrobial tolerance.
2: Because the bacteria in chronic infections are aggregated and are in close proximity, genes coding for resistance to antimicrobials can be passed horizontally from one bacterium to the another (Bjarnsholt et al.,  2013).
3: The bacteria in biofilms could be 1000-times more difficult to kill by antibiotics than the same organism growing planktonically (Gilbert et al.,  1997).
4: Therefore, the control of biofilms is understood to be crucial.

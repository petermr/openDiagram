<p>To better understand the underlying mechanism of phase separation in the studied systems, the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system for a fixed molar ratio was simulated by classical all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) for various hydration levels from pure to diluted. The compositions of the systems simulated are summarised in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05570-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH was considered as fully protonated throughout.

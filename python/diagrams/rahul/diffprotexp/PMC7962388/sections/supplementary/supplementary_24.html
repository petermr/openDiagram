  <caption> Additional file 16. List of apomixis candidates and their associated transcripts expression levels, at different developmental stages. Several genes associated with apomixis in previous studies are differentially represented in the current analysis. Identifier: number assigned to the previously characterized apomixis candidate at GenBank/NCBI. DE stages: differential expression detected at each stage, red numbers indicate statistically significant differential expression. The NCBI description of the BLASTx top hits and the GO analysis for each DET was incuded in the last five columns. </caption>

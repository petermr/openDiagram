0: Wistar rats weighing 250380 g were slightly anesthetized with ether.
1: Abdominal aorta was catheterized and blood was collected in anti-coagulated tubes with a mixture of acid citric (130 mM)-trisodium citrate (170 mM)-glucose 4% (9:1, v/v).
2: Washed platelets were prepared according to the experimental design reported by Gadi et al.
3: [ 51].
4: A first centrifugation of blood (230 x g/15 min) was made and permitted to obtain a platelet rich plasma (PRP), which was centrifuged a second time (400 x g/ 15 min) to obtain the platelet pellet.
5: The platelets were then washed once with washing buffer (NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.6 mM, NaHCO 3, 12 mM, MgCl 2 0.9 mM, glucose 5.5 mM, gelatin 0.25%, pH 6.5), centrifuged for the last time (400   g/ 15 min) and suspended in the final buffer with the following composition (mM): NaCl 137, KCl 2.6, CaCl 2 1.3, MgCl 2 0.9, glucose 5.5, Hepes 5, gelatin 0.25%, pH 7.4) in order to have a final platelet concentration of 5  10 5 cells/mm 3.

<p>In 1.0C-1.5Cr steel, each element has its irreplaceable role. Cr promotes the solid solution strengthening and reduces the spacing of pearlite lamellae, leading to work hardening [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Si induces the solid solution strengthening and suppresses the precipitation of proeutectoid network carbides, which are harmful to the strength and toughness of steel [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The rate at which silicon is rejected from the cementite phase limits the growth kinetics of pearlite. The characteristics of the two solutes have also been verified in the steels considered here. Al can effectively increase the eutectoid transformation temperature and the free energy change of transformation, preventing the initiation of crack and the formation of network carbide [

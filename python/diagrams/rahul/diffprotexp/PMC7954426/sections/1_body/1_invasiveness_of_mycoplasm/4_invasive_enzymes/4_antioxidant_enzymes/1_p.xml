<p>During infection, mycoplasma inevitably encounters oxidative stress owing to the host immune response. Certain mycoplasma can also express various antioxidant enzymes including methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA), organic hydroperoxide reductase (Ohr), osmotically inducible protein C (OsmC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, ClpB, thioredoxin reductase, thiol peroxidase, and peroxiredoxin [

 <xref rid="cit0124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0143" ref-type="bibr">143–146</xref>]. These enzymes can effectively protect mycoplasmas from oxidative damage imposed by the host, and significantly increase their survival in the host. For instance, MsrA is an antioxidant enzyme localized primarily in the cytosol and is important for the maintenance of cytadherence and virulence potential in

 <xref rid="cit0147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. MsrA-deficient mycoplasmas have a reduced ability to interact with host cells (including adhesion and cytotoxicity), reduced viability in hamsters, and higher susceptibility to H

<p>Nevertheless, in our data, the most changes in the DmCs sites were in the CHG context. This pattern was also reported in other DNA methylation studies related to stress responses, as salt stress [

Also, it is possible that exists other sequences of non-coding RNAs not identified among the sites with differential methylation on intergenic regions, which was the most abundant in this study. The non-coding RNAs play a critical role in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and lately have emerged as key regulatory elements in the plant stress responses [

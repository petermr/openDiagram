<p>Approximately 50% of mRNA transcripts showed some degree of differential isoform utilization (DIU) as a function of RSV infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f004">Figure 4</xref>D); of these, 355 genes were identified to have significant isoform switching. DIU identifies genes that have distinct splice forms as a function of RSV infection that represent the majority of the isoforms expressed. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in coding sequences (CDS) and post-translational modification (PTM) acceptor sites and relatively depleted in miRNA-binding sites relative to all features in the transcriptome (

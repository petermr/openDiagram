<p>The analysis of the chemical composition of tested steel confirmed the compliance of the chemical composition of steel with standard. The steel was characterised by a carbon content of 0.056% by weight as well as by the following contents of hardening micro-additions: titanium–0.12%, niobium–0.044%, and vanadium–0.006%. The nitrogen content was about 70 ppm, which was in accordance with the material compliance certificate. The above-named steel is characterised by very low carbon content and relatively high titanium content. Because of the high reactivity of titanium with nitrogen and carbon, titanium was bonded in stable precipitates of TiN and TiC as well as in complex precipitates of (Ti,Nb) (C,N) (

Taking into consideration the atomic masses of the previously mentioned chemical elements, it was calculated that titanium and niobium bonded above 0.02% of carbon. As a result, the content of free carbon involved in phase curing and structural transformations was very low (approximately 0.03%).

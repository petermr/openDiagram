0: The infarct size was assessed using TTC staining 2 h after reperfusion.
1: After surgery, the hearts were removed and frozen for 20 min at -20 C, then transversally cut into sections with a thickness of 1-2 mm.
2: Tissue sections were incubated in 2% TTC for 10 min at 37 C in dark conditions and then fixed in 10% formaldehyde at 4 C overnight.
3: Under light microscopic observation, the infarct area was a white color, and the healthy tissues had a red color.
4: The degree of myocardial infarction was represented by the percentage of infarcted area accounting for the left ventricle.

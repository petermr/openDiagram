<p>The genomic response of RSV-infected airway epithelial cells has been studied systematically using high-density microarrays [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and short-read RNA sequencing [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to identify time-dependent, replication-sensitive [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although these studies have provided information at the gene expression level, mRNA-processing events, including alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA), are recognized to generate transcriptome complexity and proteome diversity. These events have been underexplored due to technical limitations in full-length mRNA sequencing. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts now enables the identification of differentially processed mRNAs and opens the door for understanding transcriptome diversity in normal and cellular stress responses.

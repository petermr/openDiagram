  <p>The interaction between PirB toxin protein and histones. (a) Purification of nucleosome proteins by gel ﬁltration chromatography. (b) SDS-PAGE, Native-PAGE and Western blot analysis of purified nucleosomes. (c) Native-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the interaction between His-rPirB and nucleosome proteins. Purified nucleosomes treated with different concentrations (0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 µM) of recombinant His-rPirA or His-rPirB proteins and analyzed by Native-PAGE and Western blot using anti-histone H3 antibody</p>

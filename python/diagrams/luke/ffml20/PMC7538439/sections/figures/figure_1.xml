  <title>Machine learning interatomic potential simulated phase diagram of hydrogen.</title>
  <p>Each datapoint represents a machine-learning interatomic potential based molecular dynamic simulation (HMLP-MD) which is itself in agreement with the equivalent DFT simulation. Blue squares represent the melting points form Z-method while the data of stable Phase I and Phase II appears as orange hexagon and red triangles, respectively. The dashed melt line and phase Iâ€“II boundary is to guide the eye. Experimental phase boundaries (solid lines) are taken from ref.

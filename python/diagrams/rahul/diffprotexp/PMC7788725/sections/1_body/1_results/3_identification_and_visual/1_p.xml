<p id="Par36">To deeply study the differential genes over euchromatin in LMNA mutation-associated DCM, we selected the genes from RNA-seq data consistent with the differential binding genes of ChIP-seq to perform PCA, and the PCA results also showed distinct clustering at the transcriptome level (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2B). Furthermore, the heatmap confirmed that the differential target genes of LMNA alone (MACS) and LAP2Î±-lamin A/C complexes (SICER) according to ChIP-seq results were also shown significant differences in RNA-seq analysis between control and DCM (Additional file

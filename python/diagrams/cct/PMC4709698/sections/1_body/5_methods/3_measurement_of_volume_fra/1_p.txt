0: We used the software Image J ( http://imagej.nih.gov) to directly measure the area fraction of -Ti from the SEM micrographs 1225.
1: Supposing the area fraction of -Ti in the cross section at height of  h in a unit cubic is  A( h), then the volume fraction can be obtained by the relation:  .
2: In the current BMGCs, -Ti precipitates within the liquid by homogenous nucleation which is then followed by diffusion-controlled growth.
3: Thus -Ti is distributed homogeneously on the micrometer-scale in the BMGCs, causing that the  A( h) slightly fluctuates near the measured average volume fraction  .
4: In this case  .
5: This method shows good accuracy, because the fluctuations of  A( h) are quite small (within 1.5%, seen in  Fig.
6: 1h).
7: Particle sizes were also measured using Image J by directly measuring the diameters of secondary arms or particles of -Ti.
8: We also estimate the volume fractions of -Ti in the 10 mm rod of BT20 and the 100 g ingot of BT15 by comparing their intensities of diffraction peak (110) of the XRD patterns with that of BT95, i.e.
9: .

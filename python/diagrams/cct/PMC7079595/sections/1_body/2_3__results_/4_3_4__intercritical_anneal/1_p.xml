<p>The third approach to obtain retained austenite in the final microstructure of the steel is intercritical annealing, variant C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). As already mentioned, in this variant, during heating to the selected temperatures (700–720 °C), the reverse austenite transformation from the initial martensite occurs, and the microstructure will be composed of different quantities of ferrite and austenite during annealing, which influences the subsequent phase transformation kinetics upon cooling. Therefore, this heat treatment differs from the other variants, A and B, in terms of the starting microstructure (100% austenite in variants A and B). In any case, variant C corresponds to a manufacturing schedule mostly used in case of cold-rolled steel sheets. The results of dilatometric analysis during cooling from the intercritical annealing to room temperature are presented in

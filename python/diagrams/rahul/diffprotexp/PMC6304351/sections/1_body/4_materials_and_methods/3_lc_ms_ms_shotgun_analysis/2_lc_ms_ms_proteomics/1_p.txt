0: Cells were harvested from 50 ml of each culture by centrifugation (4,600   g, 15 min) and washed in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline.
1: Total protein was extracted by resuspending the cell pellet in 75 l of extraction buffer [62.5 mM TRIS, 10% glycerol w/v, 12 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) v/v and one Pierce Protease Inhibitor Tablet per 50 ml], heating in a water bath (95C, 12 min) fully lysing the cells, and then centrifuging (10,500   g, 5 min) to remove cell debris.
2: Protein extracts were visualized by SDS-PAGE and trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS with a Thermo Fisher hybrid high resolution LTQ Orbitrap instrument was performed as previously described ( McKew et al., 2013).

<p>In our study, we stratified sTREM1 levels detected on the BAL of IPA and control patients according to TREM1 genotypes. We found changing levels of sTREM1 for rs2234237 and rs2234246 and we also found that TREM1 genotypes influenced the profile of proinflammatory cytokines. Based on the fact that in IPA higher levels of inflammatory mediators at the site of infection might indicate a more severe infection [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we could hypothesize that TREM1 genotypes associated with an increase of sTREM1 levels and alteration of pro-inflammatory cytokines production in response to 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection may impact disease progression that can ultimately affect patient outcomes.

<p id="Par3">Carrot (
 <italic>Daucus carota</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>carota</italic> L.; 2n = 2x = 18) is a globally important root crop with yellow and purple as the first documented colors for domesticated carrot in Central Asia approximately 1100 years ago

 </sup>, where its popularity was fortuitous for modern consumers because the orange pigmentation results from high quantities of α- and β-carotene, making carrots the richest source of provitamin A in the US diet

 </sup>. Additionally, with its great nutrition and economic value, carrot has been well known as a nice model plant for genetic and molecular studies

 </sup>. Carrot is one of the crops that can accumulate large quantities of anthocyanins in its storage roots (up to 17–18 mg/100 g fresh weight)
 <sup>

 </sup>. Purple carrots accumulate almost exclusively derivatives of cyanidin glycosides with five cyanidin pigments reported in most studies

 </sup>. In addition, anthocyanin pigmentation also varies between root tissues, ranging from fully pigmented roots (i.e., purple color in the root phloem and xylem) to pigmentation only in the outer-most layer of the phloem

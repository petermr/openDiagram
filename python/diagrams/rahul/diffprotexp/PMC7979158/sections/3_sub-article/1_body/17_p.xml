<p>(2d) A subset of layer 6 neurons expresses Ctip2, so it is hard to determine whether the phenotype represents a reduction in layer 6 or layer 5 Ctip2+ neurons, or a reduction in Ctip2+ neurons in general. The authors should co-label with Tbr1 and additional deep layer markers, such as Satb2 (which is expressed in a subset of layer 5 neurons), Fezf2, Sox5, and/or Rbp4 to bet a better idea of layer 6-layer 5 separation. The results do not rule out possibility that migration may be affected by MIA and the authors should address this point.</p>

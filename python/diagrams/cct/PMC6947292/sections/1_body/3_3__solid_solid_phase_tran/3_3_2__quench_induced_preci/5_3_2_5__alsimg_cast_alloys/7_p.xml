<p>CCP diagrams for the cast alloys are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f074">Figure 74</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f075">Figure 75</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f076">Figure 76</xref>. As precipitation starts instantaneously with the onset of cooling for all the cast alloys, these CCP diagrams show that the onset of precipitation is the same for any cooling rate. The start of high-temperature precipitation is therefore plotted as a straight line starting at the solution treatment temperature. The reactions that are most likely to be occurring are labelled.

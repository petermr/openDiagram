  <p>A. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of proteins in CV-PTC, FV-PTC and benign samples. FV1 is the only NIFTP case in FV-PTC group, which was clustered with CV-PTC samples. B. Venn Diagrams of proteins identified across all three groups. The proteome profiling of all three groups contributed to 2.560 protein identifications (p &lt; 0.05). 65% of proteins were common in benign and CV-PTC, whereas 88% of proteins found to be identical in benign and FV-PTC. In both hierarchical clustering and Venn diagram; FV denotes FV-PTC, CV denotes CV-PTC.</p>

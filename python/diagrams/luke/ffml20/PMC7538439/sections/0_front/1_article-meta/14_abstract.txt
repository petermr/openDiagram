0: Hydrogen has multiple molecular phases which are challenging to explore computationally.
1: The authors develop a machine-learning approach, learning from reference ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, to derive a transferable hierarchical force model that provides insight into high pressure phases and the melting line of H  2.

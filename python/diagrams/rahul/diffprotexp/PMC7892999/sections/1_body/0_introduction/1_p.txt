0: Anthocyanins are flavonoids, a class of phenolic compounds synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, a late branch of the shikimic acid pathway 1.
1: They are secondary metabolites that confer purple, red, and blue pigmentation to several organs and tissues of many plant species 2.
2: These water-soluble pigments serve in various roles in the plant, including attracting pollinators to flowers and seed dispersers to fruits, protection against UV radiation, amelioration of different abiotic and biotic stresses, such as drought, wounding, cold temperatures, and pathogen attacks 3,  4, as well as participation in physiological processes such as leaf senescence 5,  6.
3: As dietary components, anthocyanins possess various health-promoting effects, mainly due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, including protection against cancer, strokes and other chronic human disorders 7.

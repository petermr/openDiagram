<p id="Par5">CNFs are benign, skin-based neoplasms. These tumors typically arise in puberty and increase in number throughout adulthood. NF1 patients can develop between several to thousands of CNFs that cover significant portions of the body. Even though the size of CNFs can vary in NF1 patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), CNFs are associated with limited growth potential (typically &lt; 3 cm). The primary treatment option for CNFs is surgical removal, however they are prone to recurrence and surgical treatment is impossible in patients with severe tumor burden. CNFs are composed of neoplastic Schwann cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, middle and lower panels). In addition, CNFs often include a collagenous and myxoid extracellular matrix. CNFs and PNFs share nearly identical histology and require clinical context to accurately diagnosis [

Because of these features, PNFs can envelop organs and cause pain, disfigurement, and morbidity. For example, a PNF included in this study was removed due to its rapid growth in an axial location (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Importantly, CNF-associated malignancies are rare, whereas PNFs are able to dedifferentiate into aggressive sarcomas in 8–13% of patients [

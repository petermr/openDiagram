0: Poly(methyl methacrylate/n-butyl acrylate) [p(MMA/nBA)] copolymers with 40/60, 50/50, and 60/40 MMA/nBA molar ratios were synthesized using solution polymerization in THF.
1: In a typical synthesis, a total of 0.042 moles of the monomer was dissolved in 5 ml of THF, mixed with 0.5% w/w of AIBN, and purged with N 2 for 30 min.
2: The air-free system was placed in a heat bath at 75 C and allowed to react for 8 h. The resulting product was precipitated in hexane and redissolved in THF (300 mg/ml) prior to film formation.
3: The same method was utilized to copolymerize poly(methyl methacrylate/n-pental acrylate) [p(MMA/nPA)].
4: The properties of p(MMA/nBA) and p(MMA/nPA) are summarized in Supplementary Table  1.

<p>All the samples passing the preset cut-off value (height = 15) belonged to specific clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Five co-expression modules (blue, brown, gray, turquoise and yellow) were constructed by using WGGNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). The heatmap of module-trait relationships (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>) revealed that the turquoise module had the strongest negative correlation with HD (correlation coefficient = -0.69, P = 8e-46) and the strongest positive correlation with BDNF expression (correlation coefficient = 0.79, P = 2e-68); whereas the blue module was the most positively correlated with HD (blue: correlation coefficient = 0.73, P = 9e-53) and the most negatively correlated with BDNF expression (blue: correlation coefficient = -0.74, P = 3e-56); likewise, the brown and yellow modules were positively correlated with HD (brown: correlation coefficient = 0.72, P = 3e-51; yellow: correlation coefficient = 0.53, P = 1e-24) and negatively correlated with BDNF expression (brown: correlation coefficient = -0.53, P = 2e-24; yellow: correlation coefficient = -0.45, P = 6e-17). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>, the DEGs of the turquoise module were enriched in KEGG pathways of GABAergic synapse, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), renin-angiotensin system (Ras) and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathways; the blue module DEGs were involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor intersection, phagosome, and MAPK signaling pathways; the DGEs of brown and yellow modules participated in Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) signaling pathway and vascular smooth muscle contraction, respectively.

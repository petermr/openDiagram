<p id="Par6">To tackle such a multi-target problem, this paper employs both multiple single target (ST) approach (for PR, RF, SVM, k-NN, DT, and GP) and multi-target regression approach (for NN). While multiple single target (ST) regression splits the problem into multiple single-output regression problems where the outputs are assumed to be independent of each other, multi-target regression incorporates the statistical correlation among the outputs besides using the original input features. As such, multi-target regression is likely to offer superior response predictions for C–S–H due to its multivariate nature and the compound dependencies between the multiple feature and/or target variables

Overall, this paper, aimed at predicting composition-dependent multiple elastic constants for C–S–H, is expected to provide a valuable composition-property link for C–S–H which can help clarify efficient pathways to optimize the nanoscale C–S–H structures to enhance mechanical performance and, durability of cementitious materials.

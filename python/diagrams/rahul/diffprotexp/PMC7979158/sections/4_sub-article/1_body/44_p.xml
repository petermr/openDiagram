<p>We first want to clarify that Grey and Green modules are both significantly associated with the MIA phenotype, and YeMaBl as well demonstrates marginal significance. Thus, the review comment that the Grey module was the only MIA-associated module is incorrect. This was described in the following section of the Results in the initial manuscript: “The WGCNA-resolved modules enabled mapping of DE signatures to neurodevelopmental processes that were acutely induced by MIA. There was significant association between genes in Grey (P = 0.007) and Green (P = 0.03) modules and MIA treatment, and marginal significance with MIA for the YeMaBl (P = 0.05) module (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).” We go into depth interrogating these three MIA associated modules in the Results text, in Figure 3, and in the Discussion.</p>

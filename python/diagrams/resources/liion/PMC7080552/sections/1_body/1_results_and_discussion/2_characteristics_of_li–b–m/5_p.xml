<p>To examine the practical capacity of the prepared Li–B–Mg composite anode, it has been charged at 0.2 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> in a Li‐half battery and the voltage profile result is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b. From Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, a long stage below 0.1 V, which can be assigned to the stripping of free Li, can be observed. This capacity is calculated to be 1832 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> based on the mass of the whole composite anode. In addition, three small platforms located at 0.46, 0.67, and 0.80 V, which can be attributed to the Li electrodissolution from the LiB compound, can be observed.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> To further examine the compositional and morphological change of the 3D Li–B–Mg composite anode during Li electrodissolution, ex situ XRD and SEM measurements have been conducted during the charge process at specific stages (marked from A–H in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and the corresponding results are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c,d. From Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, it can be observed that one of the XRD peaks of the Li(Mg) solid solution, which is located at 36°, gradually decreases during Li electrodissolution process (Figure S3a, Supporting Information). This implies that the original Li(Mg) solid solution which has filled in the pores of the fibrous LiB skeleton has gradually transformed into a Li‐deficient phase during the charge process. Meanwhile, Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c shows that the XRD peaks belonging to the LiB compound, which is located at 45.06°, rise first and then fall during Li electrodissolution. This indicates that the Li in the LiB compound could be dissolved to some extent during the charge process. It has to be noted that although the Li in the LiB compound can contribute extra capacity during the charge process, yet it will jeopardize the structural integrity of the LiB compound structure, resulting in an unstable 3D Li–B–Mg composite anode. The deterioration of the LiB compound can be observed via the appearance of the dark LiB color as shown in Figure S3b (Supporting Information, see also below) especially after the voltage reaches greater than 0.8 V.

<p id="Par24">As shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, thin films that are approximately 100-µm thick are obtained through the aforementioned fabrication technique. The calendering of self-standing films results in reduced thickness, as discussed below. Generally, average thickness reductions of 20 and 30% are observed when the electrodes are calendered at 50 and 80 °C, respectively. The films are fully bendable, rollable, and resistant, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Punching an electrode from the film does not affect the integrity of the electrode, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. The carbon-rich side produced during the first fabrication step (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) remains totally similar after the filtration of the solution that contains the active material. The FB-rich side shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> is then filled with active material and carbon during the second filtration step. A two-layer electrode film composed of a carbon current collector, a layer of active material, and carbon is subsequently fabricated. This method is interesting because it avoids the inclusion of the mass of an aluminum current collector. This mass can be replaced with more cellulose fibers or carbon in order to fabricate a strong film with a higher carbon content than a film casted on a metal current collector. In fact, for an electrode (~6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> of active material) casted on an aluminum foil, the active material (e.g., LFP) accounts for 53% of the total mass, whereas the inactive aluminum is 41 wt.%. Approximately 6% of the electrode mass corresponds to the binder and carbon. Another interesting aspect is that the quantity of active material may be accurately determined because it is weighed before it is introduced to the beaker and before the filtration step (Scheme 
 <xref rid="Sch2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Depending on the battery configuration or cathode/anode material utilized, the quantity of active materials (in mg·cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) in the self-standing film can be easily adapted.

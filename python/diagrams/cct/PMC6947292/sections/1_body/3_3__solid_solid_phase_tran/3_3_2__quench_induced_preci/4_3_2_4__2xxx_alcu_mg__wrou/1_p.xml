<p>The kinetic behaviour of quench-induced precipitation in AlCu(Mg) alloys is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f066">Figure 66</xref> based on DSC cooling data for 2024 and 2219. The total precipitation enthalpy (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f065">Figure 65</xref>D, 2024 natural ageing, 2219 artificial ageing) are also shown. As seen for the other alloy systems, multiple precipitation reactions occur. During slow cooling of 2219, two major reaction areas can be detected within the considered cooling rate range, while for 2024, three distinct reaction intervals can clearly be seen. For 2219, significant superposition of the two reaction peaks occurs, meaning that the second peak is seen only as a shoulder at ≈400 °C during slow cooling. During slow cooling of 2024, only two main reaction peaks are seen, a HTR and a medium temperature reaction (MTR). The HTR is increasingly suppressed with increasing cooling rate. At the same time, the MTR increases in intensity up to a cooling rate of about 0.3 K/s. If the suppression of the HTRs is almost complete, an additional LTR (≈250–150 °C) is seen. 2219 has only Cu as its main alloying element, but 2024 contains a considerable amount of Mg in addition to Cu. This obviously adds an additional reaction to the quench-induced precipitation.

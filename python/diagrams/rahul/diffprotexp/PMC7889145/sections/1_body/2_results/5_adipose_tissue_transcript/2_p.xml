<p>We next performed RNA sequencing analysis on interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) isolated from 8-week-old male hemizygous 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic>
 <sup>Â±</sup> mice and 
 <italic>Cre</italic>-negative littermate controls to investigate transcriptome changes introduced by the 
 <italic>Adipo-Cre</italic> transgene. Transcriptional changes were overall low with 115 genes for BAT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2a</xref>), 53 genes for iWAT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b</xref>) and 515 genes for pgWAT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2c</xref>) meeting criteria for altered gene expression. Furthermore, gene ontology and pathway analysis failed to find significant gene enrichment (data not shown). However, differential gene expression analysis did reveal gene expression changes in the previously identified transgene passenger genes 
 <italic>Kng1, Eif4a2</italic> and 
 <italic>Rfc4</italic>; as well as 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> and the gene zinc finger protein 949 (
 <italic>Zfp949</italic>). 
 <italic>Zfp949</italic> expression was elevated in all three tissues and it is worth noting that this gene is downstream of the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene insertion, suggesting possible long-range alteration of 
 <italic>Zfp949</italic> regulation.

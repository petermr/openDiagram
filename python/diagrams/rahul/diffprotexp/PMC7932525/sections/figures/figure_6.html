 <caption> Validation of DEGs by qRT-PCR analysis in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. The relative expression levels of four chosen DEGs were obtained by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). Different low case letter above each column indicated significant difference at P = 0.05. ‘NDV’ and ‘NDH’ refers to vegetative cells and heterocysts cultured respectively under nitrogen deprivation condition, and ‘NV’ refers to vegetative cells cultured under nitrogen-replete condition. In three paired comparisons, X vs. Y refers to Y/X. </caption>

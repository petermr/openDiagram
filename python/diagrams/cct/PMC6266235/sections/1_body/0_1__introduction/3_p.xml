<p>Mn has been utilized in advanced cryogenic steels to replace Ni recently. Like Ni, Mn can enlarge the Î³ phase and prompt reversed austenite. Additionally, Mn enriches the reversed austenite and enhances its stability, thus improving the cryogenic toughness. In this present work, 5% Mn cryogenic steel was experimented. The following issues were investigated based on reversed austenite transformation at a high temperature of the welding thermal cycle:

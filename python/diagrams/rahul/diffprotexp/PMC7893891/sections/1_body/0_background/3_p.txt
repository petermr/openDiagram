0: Here, we followed an established protocol [ 6] to differentiate iPSCs into MNs using chemically defined media conditions.
1: Efficient neural conversion is based on mimicking in vivo neurogenesis where extrinsic and intrinsic signals are introduced in culture, yielding a relatively pure MN population [ 7,  8].
2: During neuronal differentiation, there are cascading effects as signaling pathways activate transcription factors to upregulate expression of MN specific genes.
3: Neural induction of iPSCs is driven by simultaneous inhibition of tumor growth factor- (TGF), activin, Nodal, and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling.
4: Similar to processes that occur during early development, inhibition of those signaling pathways promotes differentiation along the neuronal lineage primarily through inhibition of pluripotency and blocking alternative lineage differentiation.
5: Several other pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, regulate neuronal differentiation.
6: The protocol implemented in this study included three core chemical compounds to inhibit TGF and BMP signaling pathways and simultaneously activate Wnt signaling.
7: Following neural induction of iPSCs, neuronal progenitor cells were patterned with all-trans retinoic acid (RA), to promote caudal (spinal cord) identity, and ventralization was promoted by activation of Shh signaling with Purmorphamine.
8: Finally, synchronization of the maturation process, through elimination of dividing cells, was aided by inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway resulting in mature MNs.

0: SoEO has been extracted from air-dried leaves by hydrodistillation for 3.3 h, using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: Five portions (40 g each) of the dried leaves were individually subjected to hydrodistillation.
2: Oil yield was then estimated on the basis of the dry weight of plant material.
3: For antioxidants, antimicrobial, insecticidal and phytotoxic activities, oil was recovered directly, from above the distilled water without adding any solvent; meanwhile for gas chromatography analysis oil was recovered from 1 mL of hexane added above the distilled water.
4: SoEO was stored in opaque glass tubes at -20 C until use.

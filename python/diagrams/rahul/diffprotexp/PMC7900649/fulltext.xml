The pathogen&#x02013;host interaction after PEDV infection is still unclear. To investigate this issue, high-throughput-based sequencing technology is one of the optimal choices. In this study, we used in vitro transcription sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (IVT-SAPAS) method, which allowed accurate profiling of gene expression and alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites to profile APA switching genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IPEC-J2 cells during PEDV variant strain infection. We found 804 APA switching genes, including switching in tandem 3&#x02032; UTRs and switching between coding region and 3&#x02032; UTR, and 1,677 DEGs in host after PEDV challenge. These genes participated in variety of biological processes such as cellular process, metabolism and immunity reactions. Moreover, 413 genes, most of which are the &#x0201c;focus&#x0201d; genes in interaction networks, were found to be involved in both APA switching genes and DEGs, suggesting these genes were synchronously regulated by different mechanisms. In summary, our results gave a relatively comprehensive insight into dynamic host&#x02013;pathogen interactions in the regulation of host gene transcripts during PEDV infection.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s11262-020-01817-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</kwd><kwd>Alternative polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>Differential expression of host genes</kwd><kwd>Dynamic host&#x02013;pathogen interactions</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Key Research and Development Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0500101)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yongchang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par16">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alphacoronavirus, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and weight loss in piglets. Before 2010, PEDV was under control by proper vaccine programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, from October 2010, due to the emergence and rapid spreading of the highly pathogenic PEDV variant strains, a large number of suckling piglets in southern China, even in vaccinated herds, presented symptoms such as severe diarrheal disease and higher mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, the high morality in infected neonatal piglets leads to enormous economic loss, making PEDV a huge threat to swine industry. From May 2013, a PEDV variant began to emerge and quickly spread throughout the USA and caused numerous deaths in neonatal piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Henceforth, PEDV has received global attention.</p><p id="Par17">As an alphacoronavirus, PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sensed RNA virus with a genome of approximately 28&#x000a0;kb. The viral genome contains at least seven open reading frames (ORFs). Among the proteins encoded are four structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To better understand the pathogenesis of PEDV, it is necessary to investigate the mechanisms of virus&#x02013;host interaction. To address this issue, high-throughput-based sequencing technology provides a powerful tool. For instance, transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) was applied to describe gene responses in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Quantitative high-throughput proteomic analysis was also used and indicated that the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were related to metabolism, cellular processes and protein synthesis etc. post PEDV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, most of this former work on host response at the cellular level was conducted in Vero cells, which are deficient in innate antiviral response.</p><p id="Par18">During virus infection, the regulation of host gene expression is dynamic. The regulation at transcription and post-transcription levels plays an essential role, which involves cellular transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, alternative splicing and microRNAs, etc. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a common regulation mechanism that generates transcript isoforms with alternative 3&#x02032; ends. More than half of mammalian genes are characterized by alternative polyadenylation of their transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Various biological effects associated with tandem APA were investigated, including cancer transformation, embryonic development, immune responses, neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] as well as virus&#x02013;host interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, we used in vitro transcription sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (IVT-SAPAS) method to profile differential APA site switching events and differentially expressed genes in IPEC-J2 cells during the infection of PEDV variant strain GDS01. A comprehensive analysis of the APA switching genes and DEGs (differentially expressed genes) was carried out to understand regulation mechanisms during PEDV infection.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sensitivity of IPEC-J2 cells to PEDV infection</title><p id="Par19">Immunofluorescence assay and plaque assay were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of IPEC-J2 cells to PEDV GDS01 infection and the kinetics of virus replication.

After 7 hpi ( hours post-inoculation), immunofluorescence resulting from staining with a PEDV-specific monoclonal antibody was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Until 13 hpi, cytopathic effects (CPEs) caused by PEDV GDS01 infection of IPEC-J2 cells were characterized as vacuolation, formation of syncytia and fusions of the cells. After infection, the virus titer declined at 7 hpi and then increased and peaked at 25 hpi, suggesting the eclipse phase of infection of the virus in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).

Thus, we analyzed the differential use of tandem APA sites located within the 3&#x02032; UTR in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV GDS01.</p><p id="Par24">We identified 196, 146, 470, 416, 209, 81 and 75 APA switching genes at 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 hpi, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), among which 171 genes switched to longer 3&#x02032; UTR, 273 genes switched to shorter, while 360 genes showed dynamic switching of 3&#x02032; UTR length at different time points, which suggests that these dynamic switching genes may play an active role in the host&#x02013;pathogen interaction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).

Although the pathogenicity of the virus was studied extensively, little is known about the mechanism of the virus&#x02013;host interaction. Several studies tried to investigate it using proteomics analysis of Vero E6 cells infected with PEDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, the global dynamic regulation of PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells at the transcriptional level has been analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since the regulation of host genes after PEDV infection is a dynamic and complicated process, various types of transcript regulation, including alteration of mRNA quantity and alternative polyadenylation, are involved. In this study, IPEC-J2 cells were used to study the dynamic regulation after PEDV variant strain GDS01 infection. High-throughput-based IVT-SAPAS technology was applied and the differentially expressed genes were profiled.</p><p id="Par31">Extremely complex gene regulatory changes occur in cells after virus infection. On one hand, to replicate in host cells, viruses develop strategies to disturb host gene expression or protein production. On the other hand, cells carry out various defense mechanisms. One way is through affecting sites of 3&#x02032; end processing of mRNA, which has consequences for transcript stability and mRNAs translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As a consequence of alternative polyadenylation, a variety of cellular processes are affected. Since the 3&#x02032; UTR serves as a docking platform for posttranscriptional gene regulators, alterations of tandem 3&#x02032; UTR APA could influence the stability, localization and translation of the target RNAs. The length of 3&#x02032; UTRs influence the translation efficiency, and truncated transcripts lead to truncated proteins. In this work, we just focused on gene expression at the transcript level. In our results, APA switching genes were mainly clustered into cellular processes such as endocytosis, protein processing in ER and spliceosome. Moreover, the same pathways were enriched with the DEGs. Since IPEC-J2 cells were not immune cells, fewer genes affected are associated with immune reaction. Immune pathways such as antigen processing and presentation were found to be promoted in this research.</p><p id="Par32">In this study, APA switching genes and DEGs were found to participate in variety of biological processes such as cellular process, metabolism and immunity reactions, which was consistent with the results of Zhang et al., who analyzed the DEGs of PEDV infection in Vero cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several proteome analyses also show that, after PEDV infection, differentially expressed proteins involve in biosynthesis, metabolic and signal transduction processes, such as cell cycle, cell death and survival and virus entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Immune-related pathways, like TGF-beta signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway and antigen processing and presentation, were enriched in our results. The expression levels of more immune-related genes and proteins were found to be affected by PEDV infection by Zhang et al. and Sun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In our data, some genes exhibited both APA switching and changes in expression levels, suggesting these genes are regulated by multiple mechanisms during virus infection. Furthermore, the overlapped genes tended to be the &#x0201c;focus&#x0201d; genes in the networks of cellular processes such as cell cycle and protein processing in ER as well as signaling pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). These genes may serve as essential genes during PEDV-cell interaction.</p><p id="Par33">The ER serves as a site of protein folding as well as transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER during virus infection would cause ER stress. Various research found that a majority of <italic>coronaviruses</italic> cause ER stress after infection, such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus and infectious bronchitis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For PEDV infection, researchers demonstrated that the viral structural proteins including envelope protein (E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], membrane protein (M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and nucleocapsid protein (N) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] could cause ER stress, resulting in activation of pathways distinct from NF-kB activation. In our gene profiling, we could not find any activation in the NF-kB signaling pathway. Stimulation of immune responses could be studied further in future work.</p><p id="Par34">Cell cycle directs cell proliferation through a series of events. The PEDV structural proteins were shown to be able to prolong the S-phase in a cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In our study, DEGs and APA switching genes could be mapped to the cell cycle pathway, suggesting the cellular state may serve an important role in PEDV replication. The focus genes exhibiting both APA switching and changes in expression levels may act as more important functional genes. CCNB1, CDK6, ANAPC7 and CDKN2C are main regulators of cell cycle progression, while E2F1 and PCNA participate in DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par35">Our results reveal a dynamic regulation of gene expression in IPEC-J2 cells after PEDV infection, in which both APA sites switching events and DEGs are involved. About 20% of the significantly changed genes were identified as both APA switching genes and DEGs. These genes tended to act as a &#x0201c;focus genes&#x0201d; in function networks, which may have greater research value in the future. Our results could provide a relatively comprehensive insight into dynamic interaction between host and PEDV virus, which would contribute to future research on PEDV pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cells and virus</title><p id="Par36">A porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 cells (a kind gift from Prof. Qian Yang, Nanjing Agricultural University, China) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and antibiotics (penicillin 100U/mL and streptomycin 100ug/mL) at 37&#x02103; in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

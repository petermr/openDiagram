0: Results are expressed as mean plus standard error of mean, unless otherwise stated.
1: Raw data was first analyzed for the presence of outliers (GraphPad quickCalcs) and checked for a Gaussian distribution.
2: Data sets were compared using ANOVA, followed by posttests of Tukey or Sidak.
3: Differences between survival curves were analyzed using the Log Rank test.
4: Results with P< 0.05 were considered significant.
5: All data are representative of at least two experiments (n = 4 to n = 12 replicates or n = 7 to n = 17 mice).
6: All data analysis and graph construction were performed using software GraphPad Prism 8.

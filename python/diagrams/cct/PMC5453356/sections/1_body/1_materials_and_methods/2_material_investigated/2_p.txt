0: Material from an industrial extruded profile of EN AW-6005A was investigated.
1: This alloy was chosen, because it possesses a critical cooling rate of about 6.3 K/s [ 27, 31], which can be achieved within the DSC device that was used.
2: Pure aluminum (99.9995% Al) was used as the reference.
3: The chemical composition is given in  Table 1.
4: The main alloying elements possess an atomic fraction of approximately 0.63% Mg and 0.65% Si.
5: With respect to the quasi-binary composition of Mg 2Si, the alloy 6005A therefore has an excess of Si.

0: Zurich I  Prnp  / mice of the C57BL/6J genetic background were generated as previously described by  Bueler et al.
1: [ 36].
2: As controls, we used WT mice from the same genetic background.
3: The body weight of all animals varied between 25 and 35 g and they were either 3 or 9 months-old.
4: Prnp  / mice showed age-dependent behavioral abnormalities as given in the  Supplementary Table S1 and and earlier reports [ 21, 37].
5: Five (WT group) and six ( Prnp  / group) animals per experimental group were tested for differential mRNA expression levels.

<p>In order to determine the effect of genome quality on our results, we used the gVolante webserver and CEGMA to assess the quality and completeness of the genome (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Parra et al., 2009</xref>). CEGMA was run using the default settings for mammals (‘Cut-off length for sequence statistics and composition’=1; ‘CEGMA max intron length’=100,000; ‘CEGMA gene flanks’=10,000, ‘Selected reference gene set’ = CVG). For each genome, we generated a correlation matrix using the aforementioned genome quality scores, and either the mean copy number or mean ECNC for all hits in the genome. We observed that the percentage of duplicated genes in non-Pseudoungulatan genomes was higher (12.94–23.66%) than Pseudoungulatan genomes (3.26–7.80%). Mean copy number, mean ECNC, and mean CN (the lesser of copy number and ECNC per gene) moderately or strongly correlated with genomic quality, such as LD50, the number of scaffolds, and contigs with a length above either 100K or 1M (

The Afrosoricidians had the greatest correlation between poor genome quality and high gene duplication rates, including larger numbers of private duplications. The correlations between genome quality metric and number of gene duplications were particularly high for Cape golden mole (

 <italic>Elephantulus edwardii</italic>: eleEdw1); therefore we excluded these species from downstream pathway enrichment analyses.

<p>To validate the DEGs identified in the NV vs. NDH, NV vs. NDV, and NDV vs. NDH paired comparisons by RNA-Seq technology, four DEGs that may be involved in nitrogen fixation and photosystems were selected for validation by qRT-PCR analysis, and two DEGs that may be involved in nitrogen fixation were selected for validation by RT-PCR analysis. In general, the log
 <sub>2</sub> (fold-change) values obtained using the Illumina sequencing platform were consistent with those obtained by qRT-PCR analysis (

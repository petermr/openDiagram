<p id="Par15">The most significant canonical pathways which were found to be associated with genes/proteins data obtained from transcriptomics and proteomics analysis were GP6 signaling pathway, Protein kinase A signaling, Telomerase signaling BAG2 signaling, paxillin signaling, VEGF signaling and various metabolic pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The major network pathways associated with the identified and dysregulated genes/proteins based on differential analysis includes Cell morphology &amp; Embryonic development, Cellular assembly &amp; organization, Organ &amp; organismal development and Skeletal &amp; Muscular development network pathways.

<p>Western blot analysis was performed using the Bio-Rad Criterion Cell Midi blot system. Protein was collected as described above and quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye method (cat. No. 500-0006) before being separated on a 4% to 20% gradient TGX™ Precast Midi (Bio-Rad, cat. No. 5671094) polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose blotting membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; 1 M tris-HCl, 25% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and heated to 95°C for 5 minutes before being resolved on the gel. Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk suspended in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 45 to 60 minutes at room temperature and probed with primary antibodies against K48Ub (
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) (EMD-Millilore, cat. No. 05-1307), actin (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. No. sc-47778), β5 proteasome subunit (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) (Enzo life sciences cat No. BML-PW8895-0025), or SOD1 (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# sc-11407, RRID:AB_2193779) overnight at 4°C. All primary antibodies were suspended in 2.5% milk TBST. After a wash series in TBST, blots were then probed with horseradish peroxidase conjugated antimouse (
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) (Kindle Biosciences Cat# R1005) or antirabbit (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) (Kindle Biosciences Cat# R1006) antibodies and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore or Kindle Biosciences). Images of developed blots were captured either using film and then digitized with a flatbed scanner or captured using the KwikQuant Imager system (Kindle Biosciences, cat. No. D1001). Band quantification was performed in ImageJ using the built-in densitometry tools.

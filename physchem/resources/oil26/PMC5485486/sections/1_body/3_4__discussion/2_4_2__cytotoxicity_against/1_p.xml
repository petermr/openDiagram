<p>Based on the essential oils cytotoxicity ranking [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the five essential oils studied marked very high cytotoxic effect against P815 (BE essential oil is the most cytotoxic with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and high to moderate activity against MCF7 and VERO cell lines (DE essential oil is the most cytotoxic with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.72 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 32.90 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, resp.). To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report about the cytotoxic activity of
 <italic> A. citriodora</italic> essential oil. However, the cytotoxic effect of
 <italic> Lippia alba</italic>, with its main constituent citral on HeLa and VERO cell lines was reported [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The interesting cytotoxicity toward cell lines could be due to the main compounds in the essential oil. Literature reports the induction of apoptosis by citrals (neral and geranial) in chronic lymphoid leukemia by activation of caspase-3 [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, it has also been demonstrated that 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were also reported to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and exert analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and sedative activities [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene and spathulenol were reported as having anticancer activities on human glioblastoma and on MCF7 cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Interestingly, no cytotoxic effect of
 <italic> A. citriodora</italic> essential oil studied here was observed on Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

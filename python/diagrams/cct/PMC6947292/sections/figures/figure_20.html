 <caption> Schematic development of the enthalpy level Î”h for different temperature-time profiles with final reheating (RH). ( A) Slow cooling (sc) from solution treatment to room temperature; ( B) slow cooling from solution treatment to a certain temperature and interruption by overcritical cooling; ( C) arbitrary types of ageing after overcritical cooling from solution treatment; and ( D) overcritical cooling (oc) from solution treatment. </caption>

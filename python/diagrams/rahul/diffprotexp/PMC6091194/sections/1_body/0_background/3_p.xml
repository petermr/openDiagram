<p id="Par36">In the present study, we used label-free quantitative proteomics to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in the cochlear sensory epithelium of the mouse between three different ages. We collected protein samples from the cochlear sensory epithelia of P3, P14, and P30 mice, performed multi-digestion procedures, separated peptides using SCX chromatography and analyzed peptides with nano RP-LC-MS/MS. Differential protein expression was determined using spectral counting and an ANOVA was used to determine significant differences in protein expression. Functions for differentially expressed proteins and putative protein partners for select biomarkers were explored using bioinformatics. For verification, select proteins that were differentially expressed were analyzed using immunoblotting and putative partners, determined via bioinformatics, were verified using coIP. This is the first study to identify regulated proteins from the mouse cochlear sensory epithelia before, during, and after the onset of hearing.</p>

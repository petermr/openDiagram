<p id="Par39">However, genes encoding splicing factors and mRNA surveillance genes may also indirectly be regulated via fusion protein-mediated control of transcription factors expression. To test this hypothesis, we reconstructed gene regulatory network for those genes encoding splicing factors and mRNA surveillance genes with significantly changed expression upon RUNX1/RUNX1T1 depletion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9d</xref>). This network was inferred from microarray, RNA-Seq and bioinformatics data (see Supplementary Methods for further details). The reconstructed network suggests a complex expression interplay between the fusion protein, transcription factors and the factors involved in splicing and mRNA surveillance. Consequently, factors can be classified according to their response to RUNX1/RUNX1T1 status. One group comprises RBFOX2 and several hnRNPs (HNRNPDL, HNRNPLL, and HNRNPR) with changed expression levels upon RUNX1/RUNX1T1 knockdown, while other hnRNPs such as HNRNPA3, HNRNPF, and HNRNPH1 were not affected (Supplementary Data

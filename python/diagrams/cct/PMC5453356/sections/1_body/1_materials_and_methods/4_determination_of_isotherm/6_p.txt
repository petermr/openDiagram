0: In order to understand the way in which the mechanical properties were influenced by the precipitation during the soaking step, the residual hardening potential was analyzed by  ex situ hardness tests (Vickers hardness HV1).
1: These tests were performed after selected soaking temperatures and times and further overcritical quenching and ageing.
2: Therefore, the samples were aged at 180 C for 4 h after the DSC-measurements.
3: The temperature program before the hardness test is shown in  Figure 8.

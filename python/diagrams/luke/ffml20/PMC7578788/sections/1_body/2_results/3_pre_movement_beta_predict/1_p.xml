 </sup>. To determine whether such interactions were present in pre-movement beta signals, we correlated the trial-by-trial beta data to the measured reaction time and reach duration of the upcoming reach. In both species, we found a significant non-parametric correlation between pre-movement beta power and both metrics (Human: ρ
 <sub>ReactionTime</sub> = 0.053, p = 0.002, ρ
 <sub>ReachDuration</sub> = − 0.103, p &lt; 0.0005; cat: ρ
 <sub>ReactionTime</sub> = − 0.76, p = 0.002, ρ
 <sub>ReachDuration</sub> = − 0.537, p &lt; 0.0005).

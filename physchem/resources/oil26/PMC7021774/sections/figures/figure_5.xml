  <p>ToxB sensitivity in the context of wheat pedigree information. ToxB-sensitive (score ≥ 1) and insensitive (score &lt; 1) lines are highlighted in red and green, respectively. Lines or steps in the parentage for which no ToxB phenotype data were available are indicated in grey. The varieties ‘Cadenza’ (node 6) (and its sibs) and ‘Aardvark’ (node 21) are highlighted in orange and are hypothesised here to have segregated for allelic status at the 
   <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus during the early period they were used for breeding, with insensitive alleles having subsequently been fixed in commercially released germplasm for both lines.

0: According to the cytopathic effect (CPE) of BVDV-infected cells, BVDV is divided into two biotypes, cytopathic (CP) biotype, and non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype [ 5].
1: Among them, the CP or NCP biotype BVDV strains are divided into BVDV-1, BVDV-2, and atypical BVDV genotypes based on the viral sequence variation with an amino acid homology of approximately 85% [ 68].
2: Epidemiological investigations have showed that these BVDV biotypes and genotypes are widespread in countries and regions with developed cattle husbandry [ 9, 10].
3: In North American, the positive rate of BVDV infection is approximately 9.7226.53%, while in Europe, the rate is 40.8253.47% [ 11].
4: China has one of the highest BVDV infection rates, with over 46.7% of cattle farms testing positive for the presence of BVDV with a PI rate of approximately 2.2% in the herds [ 12].
5: Recently, an analysis for the epidemiological investigation data of BVDV infection from the major cattle-rearing provinces in China showed that the overall BVDV positive rate was 58.09%, testing for the presence of BVDV-specific antibodies using ELISA [ 13].
6: These findings indicate the serious hazard posed by BVDV to the development of the cattle industry in China.

<p id="Par28">The peptide mixtures of all samples were submitted for fractionation using the Agilent 1260 infinity II HPLC system. Buffer A solution consisted of 10 mM HCOONH
 <sub>4</sub> and 5% ACN (pH 10), and solution B consisted of 10 mM HCOONH
 <sub>4</sub> and 85% ACN (pH 10). The chromatographic column was balanced with buffer A, and the sample was loaded by the autosampler onto the chromatographic column (XBridge Peptide BEH C18 Column, 130 Å, 5 µm, 4.6 mm × 100 mm; Waters, MA, USA) for separation with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The liquid phase gradient was as follows: linear gradient of 5% B to 45% B within 40 min with a column temperature maintained at 30 °C. In total, 36 components were collected, and each component was dried in a vacuum concentrator for use. The sample was lyophilized, reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution and combined into 12 fractions.

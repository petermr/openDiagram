<p>“Tissue dissections for RNA-seq and Immunoblotting. Dissections of dorsal telencephalon/pallium or developing cortex were performed at E12.5 + 6 hrs, E14.5, E17.5, and P0 from control (saline) and poly(I:C)-exposed MIA litters. At E12.5, due to the smaller embryo size, dissections were made via a diagonal cut that maximized collection of dorsal telencephalon, but could have also included some subpallium/ventral telencephalon and superficial tissues. […] Independent litters were used for RNA-seq and immunoblotting.”</p>

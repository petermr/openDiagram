<p>There was no particular air temperature at which aardvarks emerged from their burrows or returned to them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The range of air temperatures at which aardvarks emerged (–3.2 to 36.9°C) or returned (–2.4 to 39.4°C) to burrows varied seasonally, and was only slightly narrower than the full range of air temperatures experienced at Tswalu (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Air temperatures usually were higher at the time of emergence than at the time of return, except from January to March 2013, when aardvarks had increased diurnal activity.

 </sup>. Analysis of transcript abundance differences between the cytosol and the nucleus and mature transcript length for the three sample groups indicates that long transcripts are more nuclear compared to short transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>A), highlighting a transcript length signature in subcellular mRNA distribution. However, no such pattern was observed when the transcript abundance differences between the cytosol and nucleus were analyzed against the UTR length of the genes (data not shown). We also found, when comparing the global expression levels between nucleus and cytosol, that genes with relatively higher expression tend to be shifted toward the cytosol (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>B). To examine whether the higher expression in the cytosol is caused by the transcript length bias detected between the cytosol and the nucleus, we analyzed the RPKM expression values and transcript lengths in the three sample groups. The results demonstrated no influence of transcript length on gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>C).

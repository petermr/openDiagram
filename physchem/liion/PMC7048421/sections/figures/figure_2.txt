0: Fig.
1: 2Experimental comparison between LIB and SEB and mechanism explanation.
2: (   A) Nyquist plots showing measured charge-transfer resistances of SEB cells versus the baseline LIB cell.
3: (   B) Schematic showing the in situ formed interfacial layers on the surface of graphite and NCM particles.
4: The enhanced SEI layer on graphite slows down EC transport though the film and suppresses further SEI growth.
5: The CEI layer hinders EC oxidation with lattice oxygen over the NCM surface at high temperatures or high voltages.
6: (   C and    D) Cell voltage and temperature evolutions during nail penetration of a SEB cell and the baseline LIB cell along with qualitative temperature distributions.
7: Both cells are 2.8-Ah pouch cells composed of the same graphite anode and NMC622 cathode materials.
8: The baseline LIB cell is filled with a standard electrolyte: 1 M LiPF   6 in EC/EMC (3/7 wt) + 2 wt % VC.
9: The SEB cell has the electrolyte of 1 M LiPF   6 in EC/EMC (1/9 wt) + 2 wt % VC with TAP as electrolyte additive.
10: RT, room temperature.

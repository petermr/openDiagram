<p>The chemical composition of the garlic essential oil revealed 14 compounds detected, 10 identified and quantified in terms of relative percentages. In particular, diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl tetrasulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and 3-vinyl-[4H]-1,2-dithiin were the main compounds that were detected in garlic essential oil. The result is in accordance with those of previous reports

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The above compounds are produced as a result of the degradation of allicin under the harsh thermal treatment in the hydrodistillation procedure. Allicin is not a stable compound and readily degrades 
 <italic>via</italic> several pathways to form the secondary products of various sulfides contributing the characteristic flavour and odour of garlic

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Various studies indicated that the rapid decomposition of allicin in garlic aqueous extract involved transformation mainly to diallyl sulfides

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In this study, the main compounds of garlic essential oil are sulfur compounds (thiosulfinates) such as diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide. However, there are considerable variations in the chemical composition of garlic essential oil where 3-vinyl-[4H]-1,2-dithiin is a main compound. In general, the diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide are the most abundant constituents of fresh garlic oil and commercially can be variations in the relative proportions of these compounds

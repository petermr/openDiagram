<p id="par0285">The production of ROS in response to HS triggers the expression and activity of phosphoproteins like CDPKs and MAPK cascade in crop plants. MAPK, being at pivotal position trigger the expression of TFs and other defence-linked genes like HSPs, antioxidant enzyme, osmolyte and pathway-linked genes inside the cell (

The sugar synthesis and translocation is hampered due to HS, though SAPs actively works to protect the translocation and accumulation of photosynthates in the form of starch granules inside the endospermic tissue. Tissues having high MAPK activity showed maximum activities of HSPs and antioxidant enzymes along with the accumulation of osmolyte and antioxidants. This makes us to conclude that the activity of starch degrading enzymes is indirectly regulated by MAPK which is evident from the high quality starch granules in plants having maximum expression of

MAPK has been predicted to act as master switch for triggering different genes/ enzymes involved in tolerance and carbon assimilation in wheat under terminal HS without affecting the grain-quality [

0: PTC has many histological variants arising from different thyroid cells  [4].
1: The classic variant of PTC (CV-PTC)the most common variantshows papillary structures with branching and are covered by cells with large nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm  [5].
2: In the follicular variant of PTC (FV-PTC) papillary structure is absent and it forms follicles.
3: However, cells that form these follicles have nuclear changes that are typical for papillary carcinoma.
4: In these cases, the absence of papillary structures may obscure the definitive diagnosis of cytological examination of FV, since the core features of PTC are faint/unclear.

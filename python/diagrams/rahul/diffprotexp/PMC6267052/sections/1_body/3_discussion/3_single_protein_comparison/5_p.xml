<p id="Par30">The protein with the highest significant intensity difference in meniscus compared to articular cartilage in this study was dermatopontin, with a meniscus to articular cartilage ratio of approximately 15 and 29 in the DIA and DDA analysis respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Dermatopontin is an ECM protein that has been associated with promotion of cell attachment and spreading of dermal fibroblasts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and has been reported to have a higher expression in healthy menisci than OA menisci using proteomics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The presence of fibroblast-like cells in the outer regions of menisci could explain the increased intensity of dermatopontin in our meniscus samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

<p>Finally, the present study also assessed the predictive ability of the module genes (such as NOL6, CDK15, MOV10, SAMM50, COL24A1, EPHX1 and DCP1A) for the recurrence process. In addition, the expression levels of NOL6 and LL21NC02-21A1.1 were validated, which were randomly selected from among the hub and module genes, using RT-qPCR. The results confirmed the accuracy of the bioinformatics analyses.</p>

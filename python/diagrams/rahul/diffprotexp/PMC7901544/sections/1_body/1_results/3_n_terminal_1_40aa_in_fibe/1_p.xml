<p>To map the domain in Fiber-2 responsible for the interaction with KPNA3/4, the plasmids carrying the different truncated 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic> were constructed. After a series of Co-IP and western blot analysis for these Fiber-2 truncations, N-terminal 1–40aa in Fiber-2 was identified to be responsed for the interaction with KPNA3/4. As described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>, the endogenous KPNA3/4 could be efficiently immunoprecipitated by mAb 3C2 in LMH cells transfected with full-length 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic> and the truncated 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic> with 61–114aa deletion, but not in LMH cells transfected with the truncated 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic> with 1–40aa deletion. Notably, large sequences analysis revealed that N-terminal 1–40aa in Fiber-2 was highly conserved in the highly pathogenic FAdV-4 isolates, but several unique deletions or mutations were found in the nonpathogenic FAdV-4 isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>). Several mutations were also found in the nonpathogenic FAdV-10 serotype. These findings indicate that the N-terminal 1–40aa in Fiber-2 interacted with KPNA3/4 might play a key role in the pathogenesis of FAdV-4.

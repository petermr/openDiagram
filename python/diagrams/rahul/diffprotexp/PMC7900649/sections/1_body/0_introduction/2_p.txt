0: As an alphacoronavirus, PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sensed RNA virus with a genome of approximately 28 kb.
1: The viral genome contains at least seven open reading frames (ORFs).
2: Among the proteins encoded are four structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein [ 6].
3: To better understand the pathogenesis of PEDV, it is necessary to investigate the mechanisms of virushost interaction.
4: To address this issue, high-throughput-based sequencing technology provides a powerful tool.
5: For instance, transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) was applied to describe gene responses in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells [ 7].
6: Quantitative high-throughput proteomic analysis was also used and indicated that the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were related to metabolism, cellular processes and protein synthesis etc.
7: post PEDV infection [ 8 11].
8: However, most of this former work on host response at the cellular level was conducted in Vero cells, which are deficient in innate antiviral response.

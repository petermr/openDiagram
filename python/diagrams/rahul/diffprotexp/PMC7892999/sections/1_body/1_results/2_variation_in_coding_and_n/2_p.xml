<p id="Par9">We then assessed the variation in mRNA and ncRNA gene expression between purple and orange carrot roots in our RNA-seq analysis. A total of 3567 genes were differentially expressed (DEG) between purple and orange carrots (Bonferroni’s adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.01), divided in 2928 mRNA and 639 lncRNAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B) and representing 10% and 15% of the mRNA and lncRNA expressed genes, respectively. Within the 3567 DEGs, we found 1664 downregulated and 1907 upregulated transcripts. In turn, the downregulated transcripts were distributed into 1343 coding and 319 noncoding transcripts, while the upregulated were divided into 1585 and 320 coding and noncoding transcripts, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). All information concerning the differentially expressed analysis and gene annotation is detailed in Supplementary Table

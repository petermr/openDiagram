<p>The expression analysis after the exogenous supply of ABA in potato leaf tissue revealed 53 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic>, and out of these, only 
 <italic>StbZIP88</italic> had an expression of &gt;2 FC. However, relative differential log2 FC expression analysis suggests that four StbZIPs are positively (1, 7, 25, and 88) and negatively (8, 21, 24, and 37) expressed, respectively. ABA plays a vital role in plant physiological processes and, therefore, regulates plant development. The expression of several ABA/stress-responsive genes in plants is regulated by cis-acting elements [

 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The regulation of ABA is reported to be controlled by PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE (PYR / PYL), PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C, SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 2 (SnRK2), ion channels, and NADPH oxidases [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and most notably by bZIPs. The bZIP has a binding affinity towards the ABA-responsive element-binding protein / ABRE-binding factor (AREB / ABF) [

 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> will facilitate further functional characterization of these subfamily members.

<p id="Par29">In order to evaluate the effects of DCVC on the first trimester placental extravillous trophoblasts, RNA sequencing analyses were performed on HTR-8/SVneo cells to measure differential gene expression between treated cells and controls. Average LogFC of expression levels for comparisons between all treated versus control samples are displayed in a heatmap in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Genes were ordered based on hierarchical clustering. In MDS diagrams depicting all samples plotted on relevant covariates, clustering by treatment duration and replicate were observed (Suppl Fig. 3). The replicate covariate (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.84 × 10
 <sup>–04</sup>) was associated with MDS dimension 1, while treatment duration (
 <italic>P</italic> = 9.03 × 10
 <sup>–11</sup>) was associated with MDS dimension 2.

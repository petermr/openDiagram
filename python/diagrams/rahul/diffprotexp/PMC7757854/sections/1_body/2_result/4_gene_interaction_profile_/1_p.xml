<p>Most genes identified in the PPI network are known to influence adipogenesis, and 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> and 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic> were further investigated for their relation to protein factors. The endogenous expression of these factors may differ in terms of interaction with other proteins in a time-dependent manner (MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min). Therefore, 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> and 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic> were examined with RT-PCR to determine and validate expression at the mRNA level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5a</xref>). On D3, significant upregulation of 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> and 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic> was observed; however, on D5, only 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> showed significant upregulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5a</xref>). These observations reflect the sensitivity of RNA-Seq analysis and suggest time-dependent interactions during treatment.

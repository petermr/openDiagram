 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> causes the deadliest form of malaria, which impacts over 200 million individuals and results in nearly 450,000 deaths each year, 60% of which are children aged under 5Â years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It belongs to the large Apicomplexa phylum of diverse eukaryotic intracellular parasites. In addition to malaria, this phylum also encompasses infectious agents of cryptosporidiosis and toxoplasmosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The latter is caused by 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, which is estimated to infect over 30% of the world population, and hence considered as one of the most successful parasites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These diseases are not only life-threatening but also widespread and, therefore, represent a serious threat to public health.

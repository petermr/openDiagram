0: Deformation dilatometer (TA Instruments, Milford, MA, USA) used in this study utilizes compression of the samples in axisymmetric test.
1: The results of the experiments are presented in form of true stresstrue strain curves,  Figure 3.
2: It is a relation between the true stress and corresponding true strain, also called flow stress curves.
3: Elastic deformation has a negligible value and therefore is omitted.
4: There are four characteristic points in the curve.
5: The point [0;  0] is onset of plastic deformation.
6: Stress  0 could be considered as yield point in a compression.
7: The point [   p;   p] is the maximal value of stress, marked as    p. Several authors describe the value as a Peak Stress [ 25, 26].

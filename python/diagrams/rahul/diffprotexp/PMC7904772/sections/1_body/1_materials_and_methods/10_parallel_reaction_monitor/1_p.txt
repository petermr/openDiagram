0: Protein extraction and digestion were conducted following the above iTRAQ experiment.
1: The tryptic peptides were placed in the mass spectrometer.
2: Peptide fragmentation was performed with a normalized collision energy of 28.
3: The fragments were identified at a 35,000 resolution in the Orbitrap.
4: The acquired raw data were then analyzed with the Proteome Discoverer.
5: The resulting MS data were processed with Skyline software (v19.1).

<p>A total of 23,583 lncRNAs were identified in osteoarthritis cartilage, including 5,255 upregulated and 5,690 downregulated lncRNAs, compared with normal cartilage (log2 fold-change &gt;1; P&lt;0.05; 
 <xref rid="f1-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The most significantly upregulated lncRNA was MSTRG.95856 (log2 fold-change = 11.6488). The most significantly downregulated lncRNA was ENSG00000279725 (log2 fold-change = -9.6546). According to the microarray data, the number of downregulated lncRNAs was larger than that of the upregulated lncRNAs. However, among significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs (log2 fold-change &gt;6), there were more upregulated than downregulated lncRNAs. Hierarchical clustering analysis displayed the differential expression of lncRNAs (
 <xref rid="f2-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), where red and blue represent expression values higher and lower than the median expression value, respectively. The results indicated that differences between osteoarthritis and normal cartilage could be identified by differences in the expression profiles of lncRNAs associated with osteoarthritis (

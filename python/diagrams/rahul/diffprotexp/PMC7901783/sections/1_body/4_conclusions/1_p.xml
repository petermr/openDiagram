<p>Altogether, we concluded that CMV infection of sweet/semi-sweet quinoa varieties with different resulted in variable virus-induced local or systemic symptoms. Suppression of TSARL1 gene in the bitter variety was concurrent with systemic movement of the virus in the leaves. Integration of high-throughput transcriptome and sRNASeq of quinoa varieties during time-course CMV infection provided the knowledge on 1) general and individual variety responses such as perturbation of translation, lipid and nitrogen metabolism as well as plant-pathogen interaction, hormonal signaling, DNA and mismatch repair processes, and 2) differentially expressed miRNAs and siRNAs and their putative targets. Our findings will enhance knowledge on 1) genes and biological pathways involved in tolerance of quinoa varieties to viral infection, and 2) molecular characteristics of regulatory miRNAs, endogenous and exogenous siRNAs. However, functional studies should be conducted to confirm the impact of regulatory and endogenous sRNA in quinoa as well as their role in quinoa-virus interaction. Taken together, information provided in this study will be helpful in development of resistant quinoa varieties against virus infection through molecular breeding.</p>

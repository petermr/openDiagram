0: Expression profiles of genes governing differentially expressed proteins were estimated using Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).
1: Genes related to Al-responsive proteins were identified and selected, and specific primers for qRT-PCR, corresponding to the identified genes, were designed using Oligo 7 software ( https://www.oligo.net/ (accessed on 12 January 2021)) ( Table 1) before qRT-PCR.
2: The primers of 9 selected genes were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
3: RNA was extracted from masson pine needles using Tiangen RNAprep Pure Plant kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China).
4: A list of primers for the nine genes is presented in  Table 1.
5: The 2 Ct method was used to calculate the relative expression levels [ 55].

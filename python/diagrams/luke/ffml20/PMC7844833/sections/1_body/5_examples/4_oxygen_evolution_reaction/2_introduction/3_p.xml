<p>Similarly as with other electrochemical reactions, the catalytic activity of a material for OER is determined by a balance between the adsorption strengths for oxygen and those of the reaction intermediates.

 </sup> The most active catalysts which are currently used for OER are Ru- and Ir-based materials. However, these noble metal-based catalysts are expensive, and may suffer from dissolution problems at high overpotentials.

 </sup> Therefore, alternatives are actively sought. In particular, in alkaline media, transition metal-based oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides were shown to be promising and highly tunable catalysts, demonstrating activity comparable to that of traditional noble metal-based catalysts.

 </sup> Moreover, nonoxide materials (phosphides, phosphates, chalcogenides, nitrides) have also been proposed as possible candidates for OER due to their better electrical conductivity, which often impairs applications of oxide-based catalysts.

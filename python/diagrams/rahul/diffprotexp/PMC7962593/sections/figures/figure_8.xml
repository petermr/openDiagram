  <p>Screening of key methylation markers for sepsis in GSE138074. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between sepsis and controls. Of all DMPs, 49.58% were hypermethylated and 50.42% were hypomethylated. The 10 sites with the highest methylation levels are labeled. Each feature color represents a different methylation site. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The methylation levels and the expression levels of methylation marks. Key genes are labeled. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Differences in key gene methylation levels between sepsis and controls. 
   <italic>P</italic> for CD247 was 0.039; MAPK14, 0.047; FGR, 0.047.

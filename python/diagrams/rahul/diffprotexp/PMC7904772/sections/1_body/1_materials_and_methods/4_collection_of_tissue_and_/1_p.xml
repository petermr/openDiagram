<p id="Par8">After the behavioral testing, these rats underwent decapitation, and their entire brains were quickly excised. The prefrontal cortex tissues were separated from the brain and frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen while housed at −80 °C. For the extraction of proteins, the tissues were homogenized in an SDT lysis buffer containing 4% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors. These protein extracts were heated at 100 °C for five minutes and then centrifuged for 10 min at 40,000 ×

0: Virus-infected cells were washed once with precooled PBS, and lysis buffer (25 mM mannitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA [w/v]) was added.
1: The cells were scraped and placed in a homogenizer for homogenization.
2: The cell sample was centrifuged at 600  g for 5 min at 4 C, and the supernatant was collected.
3: The supernatant obtained by centrifugation in the previous step was centrifuged at 10,300  g for 10 min at 4 C, and the precipitate was mitochondrial protein [ 17].
4: The previous centrifugation step was repeated, and the precipitate was combined with that obtained in the previous step to further maximally enrich mitochondrial protein.
5: The obtained mitochondrial protein was suspended in acetone precooled to  20 C, stored at  20 C for 12 h or more, and centrifuged at 8750  g for 35 min at 4 C. The supernatant was then removed, and the centrifugation step was repeated once.
6: On an ultraclean work bench, samples were naturally air-dried on ice, and an appropriate amount of lysate was added to fully dissolve the precipitate.
7: Protein was further dissolved by vortexing [ 18,  19].

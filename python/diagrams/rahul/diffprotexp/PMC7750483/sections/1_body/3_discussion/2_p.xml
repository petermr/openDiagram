<p>Next, we used clinical information to evaluate the association of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulator expression with patient survival and clinicopathological parameters. Notably, high expression of almost all m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators was significantly associated with shorter OS in HCC patients except 
 <italic>NSUN7</italic>, indicating that dysregulation of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators may strongly influence liver cancer patient survival (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). High expression of 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> has been reported to predict poor survival in head and neck cancer (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). It was only found to be associated with shorter survival in liver cancer from our study. For clinicopathological parameters, consistent with previous result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), the level of 
 <italic>NSUN3</italic> and 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic> was increased in tumor samples versus normal samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). For tumor grade, the expression of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators increased from G1 to G3 except 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic>, which showed an opposite trend of expression. The result for pathological grade was similar to that for tumor grade. The expression of all m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators was elevated from pathological stage I to IV, except for 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic> whose expression was decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Similar to our result, 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> has been found to be significantly correlated with clinical stage and pathological differentiation in breast cancer (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>We explored the relationship between inter-species differences in APA and gene expression by using a different perspective. We hypothesized that we could gain more insight into regulatory variation by summarizing the PAS diversity for a given gene using a single statistic, rather than by analyzing the usage of each site separately. To do so, we measured isoform diversity using Simpson’s D (D), a metric traditionally employed by ecologists to measure taxon diversity between environments (

In our system, higher D values indicate that the usage is spread more evenly across all PAS for a gene, while low D values suggest the one PAS is more dominant than others (see 'Materials and methods'). As expected, in both humans and chimpanzees, D values are correlated with the number of PAS per gene (

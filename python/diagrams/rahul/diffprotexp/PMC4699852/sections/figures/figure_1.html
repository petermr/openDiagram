 <caption> Cell morphology of me_SWH-treated MSCs (A, B, C in upper panel) and intact MSCs (D, E, F in lower panel) before and after neuronal differentiation induction. A and D are cells before induction; B and E are cells inducted with NIM for 5 and 7 days, respectively. C and F are cells induced with ERK inhibitor-containing NIM for 5 and 7 days, respectively. </caption>

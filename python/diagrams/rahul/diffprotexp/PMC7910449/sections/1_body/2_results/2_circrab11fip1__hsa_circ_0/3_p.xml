<p id="Par21">Furthermore, mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter was adopted for determining the autophagic flux. Silencing circRAB11FIP1 reduced the number of red puncta in SKOV3 cells. However, circRAB11FIP1 ectopic expression increased the number of red puncta in A2780 cells, thereby indicating that circRAB11FIP1 knockdown suppressed the autophagic flux (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2F</xref>). Divergent primers were employed for amplifying circRNAs generated through the head-to-tail splicing. Meanwhile, circRAB11FIP1 was examined for its presence or absence and was discovered from A2780 and SKOV3 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>). Afterward, more divergent primers with partial overlapping of the 5′-end nucleotides were prepared for identifying full-length circRNAs. As suggested by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, circRAB11FIP1 (hsa_circRNA_005630) with stable expression was successfully amplified (Figs.

<p>To obtain a dynamic range that covers cooling rates of several orders of magnitude and also allows us to analyse the full temperature range, it is essential to combine several types of DSC device [
 <xref rid="B83-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In this work, a total of five different DSC devices were used: two relatively slow CALVET-type heat-flux differential scanning calorimeters, a disc-sensor type heat-flux differential scanning calorimeter, a power-compensated differential scanning calorimeter and a chip-sensor-based differential fast scanning calorimeter (DFSC, [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f011">Figure 11</xref>B, the large variation in cooling rates also causes a strong variation in the sample mass. Large sample masses are crucial for slow scans, since the heat flow signal is proportional to the scanning rate and sample mass. This means that if the scanning rate is very small, the signal can only become strong enough for detection if the sample mass is large. On the other side of the spectrum, small sample masses are essential to allow for fast cooling [

1: 1 Principles and advantages of a SEB versus a conventional LIB.
2: DCR is shown to vary with the inverse of temperature for both batteries, where the upper curve for the passivated SEB is always safer due to higher DCR.
3: The SEB can, however, achieve a similar power output to the LIB by thermal stimulation before operation, shown as going from point b to c.

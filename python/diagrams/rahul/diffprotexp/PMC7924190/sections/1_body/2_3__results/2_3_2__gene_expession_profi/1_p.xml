<p>Since there were no observable morphological differences in hTCEpi cells following EF stimulation, we further proceeded to study the effects of EF stimulation using gene expression analysis. After AC EF treatment of hTCEpi cells for 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS and collected to isolate RNA. Gene level differential expression analysis was performed using Clariomâ„¢ S arrays. Principal component analysis of the RMA normalized microarray data is shown in

Of the 21,448 genes analyzed, only 5.35% of the genes were found to be differentially expressed (556 genes were upregulated and 591 genes were downregulated) after stimulation of hTCEpi cells with AC EFs compared to the control untreated cells (

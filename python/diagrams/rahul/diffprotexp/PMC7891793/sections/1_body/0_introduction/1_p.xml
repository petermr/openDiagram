<p>Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a common and serious illness of both dairy and beef cattle. This multi-factorial and multi-pathogenic condition [

 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One of the most common pathogens in the etiological structure of BRDC is bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) [

It is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus with the high tropism to epithelial cells of the upper- and lower respiratory tract. Clinical manifestation of the disease is characterized by rhinitis, laryngopharengitis, tracheo-bronchitis, and, in more severe form, bronchiolitis with wheezing, tachypnea and cough. Clinical signs in calves include: fever, anorexia, and depression.

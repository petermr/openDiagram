0: Euclidean distances between the samples were calculated on regularized log-transformed (Rlog) counts.
1: The distance matrix was used to compute hierarchical clustering of the samples.
2: The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed with prcomp function in R using Rlog values of top 500 genes with high variance.
3: Clustering and PCA were based on protein-coding and lncRNA genes.

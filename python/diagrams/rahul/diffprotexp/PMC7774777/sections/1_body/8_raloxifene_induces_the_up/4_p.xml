<p>While several biological pathways were found to be modulated (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and (
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25)</xref>), gene ontology analysis identified proteasome ubiquitin-independent processes as a top biological process upregulated by raloxifene in females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, the proteasome was not identified among the processes upregulated by estrogen or raloxifene in males. We decided to focus on the proteasome for further analysis because a defect in proteostasis is a hallmark of neurodegeneration and more specifically in ALS, where the spinal cord is the most affected tissue. To begin testing the effect of raloxifene on the proteasome and the tissue specificity of this effect, we first measured the activity of the proteasome. This analysis revealed that raloxifene has opposite effects on the proteasome in the spinal cord in males and females, as it promotes proteasome activity in females, but inhibits it in males (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Such a statistically significant and opposite effect in males and females was only observed in the spinal cord and not in other tissues tested, including the mammary gland, which is a known target of ERÎ± transcriptional regulation.

<p>Synthesis of proteins, transport of proteins, and internalization of proteins were all decreased after exposure to CNTs, which means an inhibition of the protein metabolism. The decrease of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (EIF) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor (EEF) indicates the inhibition of protein translation. Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 10 (TMED10) and clathrin (CLTC) are involved in vesicular protein trafficking and the documented decrease of these proteins may slow down the intracellular trafficking of proteins and exocytosis and endocytosis of a variety of molecules. </p>

 <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites were isolated from the mosquito blood bolus at 18 or 24 h post infectious feed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Howick et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, each midgut was dissected and a lateral incision was made along the gut epithelium to release the contents of the bolus into a small drop of PBS and the midgut tissue was further rinsed with a syringe. The released contents were transferred to an Eppendorf tube stored on ice. Each sample was diluted in an additional 400 µl of PBS, filtered with a 20 µm filter, and stained with SYBR green (1:5,000) prior to FACS. For the 
 <italic>Pb vector species data set</italic>, the contents of five boli were pooled prior to sorting at 18 h (
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic>) and 24 h (
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>). The 18 h time point was included in our analysis to inform developmental trajectory inference. For the 
 <italic>Pb single-gut data set</italic>, parasites were collected from each gut at 24 h post-infection and maintained and sorted as separate samples. Parasites were sorted into lysis buffer in 96-well plates using an Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences) with a 70 µm nozzle. Sorted plates were spun at 1,000 g for 10 s and placed immediately on dry ice.

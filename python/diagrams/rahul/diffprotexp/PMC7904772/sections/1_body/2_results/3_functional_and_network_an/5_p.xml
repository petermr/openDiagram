<p id="Par22">Further, we carried out phenotype-target-drug network analysis to explore the drug relevance of the differential proteins. A total of 38 antidepression and 13 antianxiety drugs approved by the US FDA were firstly retrieved through searching DrugBank database. Details of these drugs, including drug name, DrugBank ID, and target proteins, are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>. A total of 113 primary target proteins were obtained from 38 antidepression drugs, and a total of 70 primary target proteins were obtained from 13 antianxiety drugs. After species type was converted from human to rat, the target proteins together with the differential proteins were introduced into the STRING database to obtain their interactions. The direct interactions with medium confidence were then mapped to the corresponding drugs in Cytoscape for the construction of the phenotype-target-drug networks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In the networks, the primary target proteins acted as a link between the differential proteins and the drugs. The results showed that 14 differential proteins from the depression-susceptible group were correlated with 37 antidepression drugs. Meanwhile, 9 differential proteins from the anxiety-susceptible group were found to be correlated with 11 antianxiety drugs, and 30 differential proteins from the insusceptible group were correlated with 42 antidepression and/or antianxiety drugs. By means of these functional links, the 52 phenotype-associated proteins could be predicted to be potential secondary targets of the antidepression/anxiety drugs.

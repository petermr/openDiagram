<p id="Par15">To examine whether diffEEJs detected in Kasumi-1 cells are also present in primary leukemia blasts, we selected publicly available RNA-Seq samples from 20 patients with t(8;21)-positive AML (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>, GSE62190 and GSE67040). With this dataset we detected about 80% of Kasumi-1-associated diffEEJs that are abundant in the transcriptome of primary t(8;21)-positive leukemia blasts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). This extensive overlap is in line with the previously observed high correlation between t(8;21)-positive cell lines and patient material regarding gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and proves Kasumi-1 as a relevant model system for RUNX1/RUNX1T1-regulated gene expression

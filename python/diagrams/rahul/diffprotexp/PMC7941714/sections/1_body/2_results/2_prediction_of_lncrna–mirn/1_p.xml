<p id="Par42">We predicted lncRNA–miRNA interaction pairs based on DElncRNAs using the online tool DIANA-LncBase version 3 and found that 153 of the 217 DElncRNAs might target 199 of the 376 DEmiRNAs. Subsequently, miRTarBase, miRDB, and TargetScan databases were used to identify miRNA–mRNA interaction pairs. Target mRNAs that were recognized by all three databases were selected as candidate genes. The results showed that 184 of the 199 specific DEmiRNAs might target 3475 candidate genes. After comparing the 3475 candidate genes with 2480 DEmRNAs, we obtained 455 overlapping genes and 1148 miRNA–mRNA interaction pairs.</p>

0: It is essential to develop new carriers for laryngeal drug delivery in light of the lack of therapy in laryngeal related diseases.
1: When the inhalable micron-sized crystals of   -cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (CD-MOF) was utilized as dry powder inhalers (DPIs) carrier with high fine particle fraction (FPF), it was found in this research that the encapsulation of a glycoside compound, namely, scutellarin (SCU) in CD-MOF could significantly enhance its laryngeal deposition.
2: Firstly, SCU loading into CD-MOF was optimized by incubation.
3: Then, a series of characterizations were carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of drug loading.
4: Finally, the laryngeal deposition rate of CD-MOF was 57.72  2.19% improved by SCU, about two times higher than that of CD-MOF, when it was determined by Next Generation Impactor (NGI) at 65 L/min.
5: As a proof of concept, pharyngolaryngitis therapeutic agent dexamethasone (DEX) had improved laryngeal deposition after being co-encapsulated with SCU in CD-MOF.
6: The molecular simulation demonstrated the configuration of SCU in CD-MOF and its contribution to the free energy of the SCU@CD-MOF, which defined the enhanced laryngeal anchoring.
7: In conclusion, the glycosides-like SCU could effectively enhance the anchoring of CD-MOF particles to the larynx to facilitate the treatment of laryngeal diseases.

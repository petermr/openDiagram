  <p>The correlation of the expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN of control group and patients with schizophrenia. The expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN in PFC (
   <bold>a</bold>) and NAc (
   <bold>c</bold>) of control group (closed circles) and patients with schizophrenia (open circles) are shown by scatter plots. The ratio of DARPP-32 and CaN expression of each sample were compared between diagnostic groups in PFC (
   <bold>b</bold>) and NAc (
   <bold>d</bold>). The p values between controls and schizophrenia were calculated using Welchâ€™s t-test. Error bars indicate SEM.

0: In this study, high-throughput MD simulations are performed to obtain an adequate dataset of elastic constants for different compositions of CSH.
1: The CSH model construction procedure for varying Ca/Si ratios, molecular loading conditions, and evaluation of elastic constants for all the CSH compositions within the high-throughput MD simulations are presented in the forthcoming sub-sections.

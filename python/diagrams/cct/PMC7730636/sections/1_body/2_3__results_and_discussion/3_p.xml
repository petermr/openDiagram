 <italic>,</italic> on heating the samples, we focused on the following dilatation curves, which represented different cooling rates. These following eight dilatation curves investigate the decomposition of austenite at different cooling rates and the formation of the resulting microstructure. The formation of the final phases after cooling does not only have to be homogeneous but can be formed by a combination of several structures. The rate of cooling affects the formation of the final microstructure. Each resulting phase transformation has its own temperature ranges at which it can occur. These thermal ranges can represent a relatively wide range of formation of the follow structure, which occurs in the process of anisothermal decomposition of austenite.

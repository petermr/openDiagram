The Mueller-Hinton agar media in Petri dishes was swabbed with 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>l of the bacterial suspension 10<sup>8</sup>&#8201;CFU/ml (0.5 NTU McFarland) and kept for 30&#8201;min at 4&#176;C. Sterile filter paper discs (6&#8201;mm in diameter) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] were soaked with 6&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>l essential oil and placed aseptically on the surface of the inoculated Muller-Hinton agar plates. Plates were then incubated at 37&#176;C for 24&#8201;h and the diameters of bacterial growth inhibition zones (in millimeters) were recorded. Standard antibiotic discs (6&#8201;mm) were used as positive controls: ceftriaxone (30&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g), ofloxacin (5&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g), and blank discs were used as negative control.</p>

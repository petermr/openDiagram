<p id="Par39">Sixty-five candidate genes were chosen to perform GO and KEGG analysis. For the candidate genes measured by MACS (LMNA alone bind to euchromatin), we detected enrichment in several biological process GO terms such as signal transduction, beta-catenin–TCF complex assembly, transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter, and Notch pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). In terms of pathway annotation, WNT pathway was the most significantly enriched result, which showed a high correlation with CREB binding protein (CREBBP). It indicated that CREBBP was the key gene. We visualized the distribution of lamin A/C-binding sites in euchromatin by Integrated Genomic Viewer browser (IGV) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). The signals of CREBBP in DCM were significantly lower than control, which suggested that the binding between lamin A/C and DNA on euchromatin was impaired in the LMNA mutant.

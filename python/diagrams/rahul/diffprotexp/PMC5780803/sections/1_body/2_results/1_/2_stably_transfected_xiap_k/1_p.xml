<p>To further evaluate whether XIAP-knockdown would influence the anti-apoptotic ability of Caki-1 cells, the MTT method was used to detect the cell death rate under different drug concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 µg/ml) and flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. As demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="f2-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, following XIAP-knockdown, the cell death rate was significantly increased under all drug concentrations ≥5 µg/ml, while there was no statistically significant difference in the cell death rate between the original Caki-1 group and the pENTR/U6 group. Additionally, the inhibition ratio of the 50 µg/ml treatment group was significantly greater compared with that of the 0 µg/ml group between shRNA and Caki-1 cell lines. The results of the flow cytometry further demonstrated that the occurrence of apoptosis in the cell line with XIAP-knockdown was significantly higher than that in the original Caki-1 cell line (

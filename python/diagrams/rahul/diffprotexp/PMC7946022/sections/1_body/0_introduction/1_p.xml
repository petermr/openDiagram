<p>Polymicrobial infections caused by a combination of microorganisms are responsible for significant mortality and morbidity [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>]. Biofilm-associated mixed infections, such as those on indwelling medical devices, are particularly challenging to treat due to their inherent heterogeneity, which can be further amplified by synergistic inter-species interactions [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,

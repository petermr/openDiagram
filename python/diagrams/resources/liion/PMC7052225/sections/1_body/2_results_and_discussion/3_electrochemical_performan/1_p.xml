 <sub>3</sub>H-aryl-modified VGCF (· · · ·). Although the cyclic voltammograms are relatively similar, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref> shows a clear improvement of the electrochemical performance when modified VGCFs are used, especially at 2 C and 5 C cycling rates. At a low current density (C/10), the discharge capacities of all electrodes are similar, i.e., approximately 155 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>. When the cycling rate is increased to 1 C, the discharge capacity remains at approximately 140 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> for electrodes that contain the modified VGCF. On the other hand, for the film made of VGCF, 120 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> is obtained. At a 5 C rate, a similar discharge capacity of 120 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> is obtained for the electrode containing the COOH-aryl-modified VGCF. As discussed above, water-soluble carbons are well-dispersed in the pores created by cellulose fibers, thus resulting in better electrical conductivity in the film. At 5 C, approximately 50 and 77% of the initial discharge capacity is recovered when the VGCF and COOH–aryl-modified VGCF are employed, respectively. The inset in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref> shows that cellulose fibers are visible on the surface of the electrode made of VGCF–COOH carbon. This observation confirms that the modified carbon migrates inside the film during the process, thus leading to a better contact between the LTO and carbon fibers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). Similar electrochemical improvements were reported by Wu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. with their cathode composite made of carbon-coated LFP nanoparticles that are electronically connected with CNTs, thus forming an optimal three-dimensional conducting network

<p>A He–Ne CLSM (VL2000DX-SVF17SP, Lasertech Yokohama, Chiba, Japan) with infrared image furnace and laser scanning confocal microscopy was employed to in situ observe the reverse transformation of austenite on heating, and martensite transformation on cooling during the simulated welding thermal cycle. The CLSM samples, with approximate 4 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height, were carefully machine polished, and then set into an alumina crucible with 0.5 mm in thickness. The sample chamber was evacuated and then filled with argon to prevent the sample from being oxidized during heating. Using focused infrared light heating mode, the specimens were heated to the peak temperature of 1320 °C at the rate of 5 °C·s
 <sup>−1</sup>, and then cooled down to 200 °C at the rate of 5 °C·s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The live pictures were taken every 15 s from 240 mm × 240 mm surface areas.

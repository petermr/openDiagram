<p id="Par40">The complete list of AD risk/causal genes used in this study is described in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">10</xref>. Briefly, AD risk loci were selected from previous work using genome-wide association studies and whole exome sequencing
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. AD risk genes within these loci were determined based on regional association plots, assuming that the functional risk variants are located in the vicinity of the SNP producing the top signal and taking into account the linkage disequilibrium patterns and the recombination peaks within the loci of interest

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Early-onset AD causal genes used in this study are APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2.

<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules &gt;200 nucleotides in length that are the by-product of RNA polymerase II transcription, and were previously thought to have no biological function (

 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) reported that ZNF1 antisense RNA 1 can promote chondrocyte proliferation and inhibit apoptosis by regulating the expression level of Wnt family member 3A. A previous study by Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b22-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) suggested that nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 can act on microRNA-181c to promote the proliferation of human synoviocytes and accelerate the progression of osteoarthritis (
 <xref rid="b22-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Although the specific function of lncRNAs has not been elucidated, previous studies have reported that the abnormal expression of lncRNAs is closely related to osteoarthritis (

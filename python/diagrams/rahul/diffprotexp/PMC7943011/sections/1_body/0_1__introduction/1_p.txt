0: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the 6 th most common cancer in women and constitutes the leading malignancy of the female reproductive system in developed countries [ 1].
1: EC can be subdivided into an estrogen-dependent type I, and a less common (1525%) but more aggressive and invasive, estrogen-independent type II [ 2 4].
2: The incidence of EC has increased over the past years and mainly affects postmenopausal women while it is uncommon to be diagnosed under the age of 45 years [ 5,  6].
3: The high incidence and mortality in developed countries could be related to a higher prevalence of common risk factors such as obesity and type II diabetes mellitus [ 1,  7,  8].
4: Obesity and obesity-associated diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) lead to elevated levels of circulating estrogens that, in turn, increase proliferation of endometrial cells and promote EC development, especially in the absence of progesterone [ 9 11].
5: Elevated blood glucose levels of diabetic patients may further contribute to the risk of EC development via an increased glycolytic-lipogenic metabolism and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway [ 12,  13].

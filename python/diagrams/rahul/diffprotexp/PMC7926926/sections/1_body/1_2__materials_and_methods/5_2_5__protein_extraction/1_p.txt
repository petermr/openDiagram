0: The needles and samples of the same parts of  P. massoniana seedlings with different treatments were selected for protein extraction by utilizing the phenol extraction method [ 54].
1: Tissue samples of pinus needles (stored at 80 C before use) were weighed and ground into a fine powder.
2: Phenol extraction buffer was added to the powdered samples, followed by sonication.
3: The samples were centrifuged at 5500xg for ten minutes after adding Tris-balanced phenol.
4: After centrifugation, methanol was added to supernatant and kept overnight.
5: 8M urea was added to the overnight-kept samples to reconstitute the pallet.
6: Later, protein concentration was estimated for each sample with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (BCA kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

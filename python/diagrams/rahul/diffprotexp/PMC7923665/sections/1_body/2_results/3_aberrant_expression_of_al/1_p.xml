<p id="Par32">The cerebral vascular system is enriched with astrocytic cells, and the presence of abnormal astrocytes around human cerebral AVMs is reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Since there was an upregulation of ALDH1A2 protein in AVM nidus, we were interested to analyze the expression of ALDH1A2 protein in abnormal astrocytes around the cerebral AVM nidus. To study this, we have performed triple immunofluorescence (IF) staining for GFAP and Vimentin, well-known marker proteins for abnormal astrocytic conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Along with these proteins, we have performed IF staining for ALDH1A2 protein to AVM nidus and control tissues. The IF staining has clearly indicated that there is strong upregulated expression of GFAP, Vimentin, and ALDH1A2 in abnormal astrocytes associated with cerebral AVMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, c). Whereas, the triple immunofluorescence staining with all three antibodies in the control tissues has revealed minimal expression of these marker proteins in astrocytes associated with control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c). The specificity of primary antibodies used in this study was verified by immunostaining of AVM tissues with secondary antibodies, and the results confirm the absence of localization-specific signals in the tissues (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This data supports that upregulation of ALDH1A2 in cerebral AVM and its associated abnormal astrocytes; thus, we speculate that the abnormal astrocytes might be a potential stimulus for the development of cerebral AVMs in humans.

<p>The STRING database was used to predict protein interaction networks of functionally related proteins and to provide an enhanced definition of the functions described in the section above by revealingthe individual interactions of the proteins that are altered in response to CNT exposure. This analysis provides uniquely comprehensive coverage of both experimental and predicted interaction information and the software gives a relative confidence score [
 <xref rid="B24-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We focused on protein interactions with a medium confidence score &gt;0.4. The interactions are represented by knots connected with edges (lines). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-01-00219-f005">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="proteomes-01-00219-s001">Figure S1</xref>, thicker edges represent stronger associations. For each protein-protein interaction network, the majority of the knots were linked with each other, while some of the altered proteins were isolated without partners. Although most proteins interact with only one or two others, a few are “hub” proteins capable of physically interacting with many partners. In this sense, the networks do not appear to be random, meaning that each protein would have a similar number of binding partners but are, rather, considered scale-free [
 <xref rid="B41-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Scale-free networks have certain important characteristics, such as unequal binding interactions and hubs that have an unusual number of binding partners. This type of network is common in biological systems and leads to a certain redundancy within the network but, at the same time, also creates system vulnerability if a hub protein expression/activity is altered. Within the various networks, Cadherin 1 (CDH1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), junction plakoglobin (JUP), ezrin (EZR) apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (PYCARD), are connected with many partners, which suggest they are important hub proteins and may be more important biologically than less connected nodes [
 <xref rid="B42-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The modulation of their expression will, therefore, have more effect on the cell function. For instance, EZR, an intermediate between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton proteins, is essential for epithelial cell integrity and can also regulate the structure and the function of specific domains of the plasma membrane. It plays a key role in cell surface structure adhesion, migration, and organization [
 <xref rid="B43-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. PYCARD is composed of two protein-protein interaction domains, PYD and CARD, that mediate assembly of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways via the activation of caspase-1 [

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, there is no knowledge on the impact of virus infection on transcriptome and small RNA profiles of sweet or bitter quinoa varieties. Therefore, in this study, quinoa leaves from different varieties were inoculated with cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs, and siRNAs were detected among and within quinoa varieties during a time-course virus infection study designed to elucidate general response of quinoa and variety-specific interactions to CMV. In addition, small RNASeq (sRNASeq) analysis was incorporated to complement the transcriptome analysis by characterization of host components involved in viral gene silencing, virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs), and validated known/novel miRNAs. These findings are of particular interest for molecular breeding of quinoa varieties to enhance resistance against virus.

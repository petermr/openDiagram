0: Serum samples from 36 children (12 control, 12 CAA and 12 CAD) were randomly grouped into 12 sets (for Control, CAA and CAD; details are presented in  Table IB) for validation.
1: Proteins from the sera of these patients were extracted and the concentrations were measured using lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) and a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).
2: Following electrophoresis with 20 g protein per lane via 1215% SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against: Complement factor H (CFH; cat.
3: no.
4: ab133536), mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2; cat.
5: no.
6: ab203303), kininogen 1 (KNG1; cat.
7: no.
8: ab170475), fibronectin (FN1; cat.
9: no.
10: ab2413), antithrombin-III (SERPINC1; cat.
11: no.
12: ab126598) and -actin (cat.
13: no.
14: ab8227) (all from Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4C.
15: Subsequently, horse radish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG (cat.
16: no.
17: ab6721, 1:2,000; Abcam) was applied to the primary antibody-treated PVDF membranes at room temperature for 2 h. The specific bands on these membranes were visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence system (Promega Corporation).

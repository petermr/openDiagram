 <caption> Nuclear-encoded-mitochondrial proteins (NEMPS) are significantly enriched in the cytosol. (A) MA plot showing localization distribution of NEMPs (red), remaining protein-coding genes (blue), and mitochondrial encoded genes (green). (B) Violin plot showing fold change distributions between the three gene categories (baseMean ≥ 10) in cytosolic and nuclear fractions. P-values reported were obtained with the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test. (C) Validation of the enrichment of NEMPs RNA transcripts OAT and SLC25A5 in the cytosol in SHSY-5Y cells using RNA FISH. MALAT1 (known nuclear transcript) and GAPDH used for comparison. Images represent maximum projections of 13, 18, 20 optical intervals spaced by 0.5 μm. Scale bar, 2 μm. (D) Box plot shows mRNA half-life rate comparison between groups of differentially localized NEMP (red) and remaining protein-coding genes (blue). (E) Comparison of mRNA half-life rate between cytosolic and nuclear DEGs. </caption>

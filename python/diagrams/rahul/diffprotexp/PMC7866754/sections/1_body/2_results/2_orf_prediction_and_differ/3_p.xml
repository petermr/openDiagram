<p id="Par41">After computing the PSMs for both novel and canonical proteins in two different stages, one could then proceed to identify the ones that were differentially expressed using G-test statistics. In total, 86 differentially expressed nORFs were observed, which share a similar distribution of nORF categories (classified in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) with those present in the total proteomics data of salivary gland sporozoites and oocyst sporozoites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). One exception is the intergenic ORFs—while the intergenic peptides were the second most abundant category in both stages, only 6% of the differentially expressed nORFs are from the intergenic region.

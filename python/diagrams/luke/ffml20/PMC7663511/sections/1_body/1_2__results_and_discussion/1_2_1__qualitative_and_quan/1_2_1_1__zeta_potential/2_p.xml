<p>The results show that electrokinetic potential for unmodified MWCNTs decreases as the solution’s alkalinity increases, which changes after the isoelectric point. This tendency is due to the presence of some hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of pristine CNTs and probably due to the presence of amino-groups being residues of the process of synthesis. At acidic pH, amino groups and hydroxyl groups become protonated and, as a result, the surface of unmodified nanomaterials exhibits positive charge. Similarly, basic pH causes the gradual rise of dissociation degree of carboxylic groups and thus leads to an increase in the negative charge density of MWCNTs. The modified MWCNTs exhibit negative ζ potential over the whole investigated pH range. The decreasing tendency ζ = f(pH) can be attributed to the presence of numerous dissociated carboxylic groups and the suppression of the diffuse double layer [

 <xref rid="B48-ijms-21-08230" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Differences in the values of electrokinetic potential are inevitable and indicate that pristine material has different numbers of functional groups that determine the value of zeta potential. Analysis of ζ for carboxylated MWCNTs seems to be more complicated because the efficiency of oxidation strictly depends on the oxidizing agent, contact time with oxidant, as well as the temperature of oxygenation. Despite this, the values of electrokinetic potential for different modifications remain in good agreement with the results presented by us in References [

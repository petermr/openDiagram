0: We followed the organic phase RNA extraction as the previously described protocol [ 113].
1: In brief, B16F1 cells were lysed in the presence of TRIzol (Invitrogen) to solubilize the melanin.
2: The lysate was collected in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and heated for 2 min at 65 C [ 114].
3: By successive centrifugations with chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (Biomedical Inc.), and 75% ethanol (Merck), the pellet dried at room temperature for 10 min and was resuspended in H2O DEPC (diethyl pirocarbonate, Sigma-Aldrich) for subsequent RT-qPCR assays and quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific); or resuspended in transport buffer following the manufacturers recommendations, for subsequent sequencing.
4: To obtain enriched fractions of small RNAs  200 nt, miRVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used following the manufacturers recommendations.

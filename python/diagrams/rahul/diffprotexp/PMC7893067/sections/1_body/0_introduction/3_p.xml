<p id="Par4">The subcellular expression patterns of lncRNA have also been the focus of several studies during the last years. Although a large number of lncRNAs have been identified, the biological relevance for the majority of lncRNAs is still elusive

 </sup>. In fact, lncRNA subcellular localization was divided into three categories: (1) exclusively expressed in the nucleus, (2) mainly enriched in the nucleus and, (3) mainly enriched in the cytoplasm

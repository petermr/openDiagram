<p>Construction of experimental protein–protein interaction networks for the two groups of 40 and 47 proteins that were enriched in D1 and D2 nuclei respectively identified two different central interactors for each cell type: Hnrnpd and Hnrnpa2b1 in D1 and Cct2 and Cct7 in the D2 nuclear fractions. Hnrnpd and Hnrnpa2b1 encode heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (Hn D0 (UniProtKB: HNRPD_MOUSE) and A2/B1 (UniProtKB: ROA2_MOUSE) respectively that are located primarily in the nucleus [
 <xref rid="B42-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) D0 binds RNA molecules that contain AU-rich elements (AREs) that are within the 3’-UTR of many proto-oncogenes and cytokine mRNAs. hnRNP D0 also binds to double- and single-stranded DNA sequences in a specific manner and functions as a transcription factor. Together with at least 20 other proteins hnRNP A2/B1 binds nascent pre-mRNAs and packages them into hnRNP particles that are involved in transcription, pre-mRNA processing, RNA nuclear export, sub-cellular location, mRNA translation, and stability of mature mRNAs. In oligodendrocytes and neurons hnRNP A2/B1 is involved in the transport of specific mRNAs to the cytoplasm. hnRNP A2/B1 also binds and protects single-stranded telomeric DNA sequences against endonuclease digestion. The two central interactors Cct2 and Cct7 in the D2 nuclear fractions encode the T-complex protein 1 subunits beta (UniProtKB: TCPB_MOUSE) and eta respectively that are components of the chaperonin-containing T-complex (TRiC) that assists the folding of ~10% of eukaryotic newly translated proteins in the cytoplasm [

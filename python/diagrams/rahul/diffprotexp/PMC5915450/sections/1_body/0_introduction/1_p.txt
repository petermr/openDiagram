0: Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial that kills bacteria by inhibiting their growth and replication.
1: Antibiotics target a diverse range of molecules and processes including DNA gyrase, RNA polymerase, cell wall synthesis, metabolic pathways and protein synthesis 1.
2: Due to the central nature of protein synthesis to life, many different antibiotics target and disrupt this process.
3: Protein production occurs via the action of the ribosome, which covalently links amino acids together through the catalytic action of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC).
4: Newly synthesized protein segments leave the ribosome through the exit tunnel 2, a 10 nm long, irregularly-shaped tunnel that is on average 1.5 nm in diameter.
5: The passage of a newly synthesized protein through the exit tunnel can be dramatically slowed due to interactions between the exit tunnel wall and sequence motifs within the primary structure of nascent proteins 3  5.
6: Additionally, the binding of ligands, including antibiotics, in the exit tunnel can also inhibit protein synthesis 1,  4,  6,  7.

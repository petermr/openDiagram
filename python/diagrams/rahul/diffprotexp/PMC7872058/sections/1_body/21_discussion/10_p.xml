<p>The early control of microbe’s invasion primarily depends on professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages. In vitro studies have suggested that TREM1 may enhance phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, we observed that the capacity of phagocytosis of 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia was slightly reduced in the absence of TREM1. In addition, gene expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, the adaptor protein MyD88 as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, CXCL1, MCP1, IL1β, and TNFα, were quantified in order to corroborate the hypothesis of a synergistic effect between TREM1 and inflammatory reactions mediated by TLR4 and TLR2. Using murine macrophages isolated from 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>+/+</sup> and 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice, we observed a decreased expression of all the studied genes in the absence of TREM1 after 6 hours of 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge. These 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest a role for TREM1 in the recognition of 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and support the role of TREM1 as an important modulator of the inflammatory response against 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. From a mechanistic point of view, we could suggest that TREM1 acts as a supplementary molecule amplifying the immune response, but not initially inducing it, since its absence does not suppress completely the expression of TLR2 and TLR4. These receptors are important for the recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells to the lungs during IPA. The fact that the expression of the TLR‐MyD88 pathway is reduced in conditions of TREM1 deficiency will impact the response to 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> by restraining the release of cytokines and chemokines and less effective recruitment of immune cells to the lungs.

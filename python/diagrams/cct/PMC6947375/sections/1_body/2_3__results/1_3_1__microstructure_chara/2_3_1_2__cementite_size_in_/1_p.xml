 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the average size of the spherical cementite and the ratio of large particles in 1.0C-1.5Cr steel after different processes. The ratio of the large particle was defined as the ratio of the particles with a size larger than ≥700 nm to total particles. One could see that the morphology and size of particles varied with different processes, especially the size distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f003">Figure 3</xref>a–f). Obviously, the microstructure was mainly composed of ferrite matrix and undissolved spheroidized cementite. The dissolution of cementite was controlled by the diffusion of carbon and chromium [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The partially undissolved particles exhibited as elongated and irregular shapes because spherodizing annealing was conducted at the intercritical zone (i.e., between Ac1 and Ac3), leading to the incomplete dissolution and unevenly distributed of cementite. The smaller multi-pass cold deformation led to the coalescence of adjacent carbides, showing an irregular shape. It could be seen that the amount of 100~300 nm cementite particles decreased after spheroidization annealing, and the size of undissolved spheroidized cementite particles was mostly located in the range of 300~500 nm. Statistical results showed that the average size of cementite after spherodizing annealing was the smallest at 450 nm, with the smallest ratio of large particles at 12%. In contrast, the average sizes of cementite after cold rolling and cold drawing were large at 630 nm and 600 nm because of the elongation along the rolling/drawing direction. The ratio of large particles was 25% and 28% after cold rolling and cold drawing, respectively. It is worthy to point out that the real size was smaller than the statistical size because of the limited resolution of SEM. On the other hand, recrystallization annealing and stress-relief annealing slightly reduced the size non-uniformity and the ratio of larger particles.

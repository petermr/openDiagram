<p id="Par25">The superior spikelets of the apical primary branches had greater dry mass compared to the inferior spikelets of the basal primary branches of panicle in both SR-159 and SR-157 cultivars, but the magnitude of difference in the former was greater than that of the latter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At anthesis, dry mass of the inferior spikelet was lower than that of superior spikelet. With passage of time, the rate of accumulation of dry mass in the two spikelet types of both cultivars increased progressively and stabilized after day-15 post anthesis showing a sigmoid pattern of growth. The rate of growth was faster in apical than in the basal spikelet. The difference in growth rates of apical verses basal spikelets was greater for high sterile SR-159 than that of low sterile SR-157 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although figures not presented, curvilinear growth sports embodying 
 <italic>ln</italic> (natural logarithm) values of grain dry weight (Y-axis) against time scale, i.e. days from anthesis (X-axis) indicated statistical significance of difference between the two spikelet types and cultivars. The equations were encapsulated as follows: SR-159-apical spikelet y = − 0.0031x
 <sup>2</sup> + 0.1553x + 1.4101, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.993, basal spikelet y = − 0.0025x
 <sup>2</sup> + 0.1451x + 1.2254, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.998, SR-157-apical spikelet y = − 0.0036x
 <sup>2</sup> + 1.2254 + 0.9956, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9948, basal spikelet y = − 0.0034x
 <sup>2</sup> + 0.1809x + 0.6915, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9962.

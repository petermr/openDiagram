 </sup>. The resulted sequences were termed as known miRNAs. All known miRNAs were considered for various analyses and were grouped into 2 categories, i.e. common miRNAs, which were found in both SR-159 and SR-157 cultivars, and unique miRNAs specific to either SR-159 or SR-157. miRNA family analysis revealed that MIR166 family was the most abundant family identified followed by MIR812, MIR444 and others (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Total of 86 miRNAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and 94 miRNAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) were common among all samples in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. These reads were aligned to the reference genome using Bowtie1.1.1.

<p id="Par31">To evaluate the functional significance of the genome-wide alterations in gene expression triggered by FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on DEGs, specifically focusing on the differences between FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup>. The volcano plot (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and heatmap analysis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5) revealed significantly upregulated (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> SMARCA4, RRBP1, FLNA) and downregulated genes (e.g. NFKBIA, TAP1, CXCL8). Among the upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), many are associated with the (ECM) extracellular matrix (HSPG2, COL4A2, COL5A1) or cellular interaction with it (FLNA, FLNC), chromatin remodeling (SMARCA4, EP400, BAZ2A), and PI3K/AKT and inflammation pathways (AMIGO2, XBP1).

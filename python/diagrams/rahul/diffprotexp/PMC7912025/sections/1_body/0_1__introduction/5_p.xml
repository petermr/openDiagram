<p>In this manuscript, we use single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) RNA sequencing to explore regulated alternative mRNA processing in a human small-airway epithelial cell (hSAEC) model in response to RSV replication. SMRT sequencing data were subjected to a pre-processing informatics pipeline, yielding high-confidence long-read transcripts that characterize the composition of the full-length transcriptome. Differentially expressed isoforms were identified using an expression matrix from short-read RNA sequencing data, resulting in the identification of 905 genes undergoing APA and 355 genes expressing differential isoform utilization (DIU). DIU isoforms represent a switch in the major mRNA isoform encoded by a gene. We found that DIU genes are enriched in cell cycle control and IIR pathways. We focused on validating master transcriptional regulators of the IIR, RelA, and the inducible IRF isoform, IRF7, critical in the control of the type I and III IFN response. Differential processing was confirmed in primary cultures of human small-airway cells. We concluded that the IIR is regulated extensively by AS.</p>

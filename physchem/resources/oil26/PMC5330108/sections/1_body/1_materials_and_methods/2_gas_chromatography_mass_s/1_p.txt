0: The GC-MS analyses were performed in EI mode (70 eV) with an Agilent 7890 GC system, equipped with model 5975 mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, USA).
1: SGE BPX5 fused silica capillary columns (30 m  0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness) were employed for separation; the column oven temperature was raised linearly from 80C (hold for 2 min) to 280C (hold for 5 min) at 20C/min.
2: Helium was used as carrier gas at constant flow of 1.2 mL/min.
3: The samples were analyzed in splitless mode at injection temperature of 250C, EI source temperature 230C, and quadrupole analyzer at 150C, ionization current at 235 eV.

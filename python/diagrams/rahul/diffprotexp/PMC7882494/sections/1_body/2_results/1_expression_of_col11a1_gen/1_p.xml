<p>The role of the COL11A1 gene in colorectal cancer is significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The TIMER analysis reveals that the comparison of the COL11A1 gene across various cancer types including colon cancer and displays that it is significantly upregulated for colon adenocarcinoma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further analyses of the mRNA expression profiles of the COL11A1 gene in normal and transformed tissue in ONCOMINE server reveal significant upregulation of COL11A1 mRNA in both the subtypes of cancer datasets i.e., TCGA colorectal cancer and Kaiser colon cancer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C–J</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). It includes colon adenocarcinoma (
 <italic>p</italic>-value- 2.19E-44, fold change- 32.796), colon mucinous adenocarcinoma (
 <italic>p</italic>-value-7.94E-21, fold change- 79.836), rectal adenocarcinoma (
 <italic>p</italic>-value-3.31E-32, fold change- 24.013), and cecum adenocarcinoma (
 <italic>p</italic>-value-1.48E-13, fold change- 28.716) for TCGA colorectal cancer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C–F</xref>), and is somehow greater than that of the Kaiser Colon cancer dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G–J</xref>). All these data collectively indicate that human colorectal cancer samples display significantly higher expression of COL11A1 mRNA in comparison to normal colon and rectum tissues, indicating COL11A1 could have a crucial role in the neoplastic transformation of colorectal cancer.

<p>In a comparison of DSC cooling curves for the four substantially different aluminium alloys shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f077">Figure 77</xref>, it is notable that the calorimetric and kinetic behaviour is to a large extent similar. This is particularly true for a comparison of the alloys 7150 and 2024, which are substantially different in composition but which show highly similar dynamic behaviour of quench-induced precipitation (for different phases).

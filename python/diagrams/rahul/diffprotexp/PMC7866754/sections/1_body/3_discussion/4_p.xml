<p id="Par59">The functional roles of antisense transcripts have been a subject of debate where previous studies showed conflicting resultsâ€”some suggest that they can activate transcription [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and others showed no effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], where the former is achieved by epigenetic modifications and the latter is due to the lack of RNAi machineries. The presented results align with these observations where the levels of the 41 identified antisense transcripts do not have a consistent correlation with protein expression. Interestingly, some translation of the antisense transcripts was observed, suggesting that their regulatory roles could be performed by the translation product as well.

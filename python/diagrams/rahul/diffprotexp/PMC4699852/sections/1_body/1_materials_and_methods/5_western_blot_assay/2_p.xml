<p>Differentially expressed proteins observed from 2-DE gels and identified by mass spectrometry were also assayed by western blotting. The housekeeping protein GAPDH was used as an internal control. The proportion of the protein of interest to GAPDH was normalized to the undifferentiated group. The primary antibodies rabbit monoclonal anti-PKC-ε and anti-GAPDH were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA); while rabbit polyclonal anti-UKHC and rabbit monoclonal anti-NM23-H1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Abcam, respectively. Primary antibodies of PKC-ε, NM23-H1, UKHC, and GAPDH were used at dilutions of 1/5000, 1/1000, 1/200, and 1/1000, respectively for Western bolting.</p>

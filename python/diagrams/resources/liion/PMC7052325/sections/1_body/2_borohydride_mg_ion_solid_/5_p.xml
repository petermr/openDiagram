<p>Compared with phosphate-based Mg ion conductors, Mg(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> and its derives show a promising future as Mg ion conductors with high ionic conductivity at low temperature. Proper modification of Mg(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> are still necessary to improve the conductivity, stability and operating potential window.

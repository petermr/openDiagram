 <italic>Genome databases</italic>. Eukaryotic species were selected for based on factors including importance as experimental organisms, phylogenetic diversity and sequence/assembly quality. This included recently published sequence data from the protozoan alga 
 <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the freshwater sponge 
 <italic>Ephydatia muelleri</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Details regarding all genomic and transcriptomic data sources are provided in Table S1. Although some datasets are from genome sequencing studies and some from transcriptomic studies, in each case only predicted peptide sequences were analyzed herein. In the case of 
 <italic>Carpediemonas membranifera</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and 
 <italic>Hemimastix kukwesjijk</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], nucleotide transcript sequences were translated to predicted peptide sequences using GeneMarkS-T [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

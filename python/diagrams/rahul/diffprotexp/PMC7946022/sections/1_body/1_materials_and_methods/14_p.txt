0: Data analysis.
1: All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software.
2: All  in vitro experiments were performed on at least 3 separate occasions and in triplicate where applicable, and averages were used to present data.
3: Multiple groups were compared by 2-way ANOVA with Tukeys multiple-comparison correction.
4: The set of data obtained from WT and lrg mutants biofilm susceptibility to vancomycin alone or combined with DNAse was analyzed by 2-WAY ANOVA using the Multiple Effect analysis (Mixed Model).
5: Students unpaired t-test was used to compare differences between two samples; p values of<0.05 were considered to be significant.
6: For  in vivo experiments, the database for statistical analysis was built up by incremental addition of experimental data.
7: Based on our analysis, a sample size of 5 mice per experimental group will have at least 80% power to detect difference of 80%.
8: All experiments were performed on at least three separate occasions, analyzed separately and averages used to present data.
9: The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test and Dunnets Multiple Comparison Test were used to compare differences between multiple groups and statistical significance, respectively.
10: P values<0.05 were considered to be significant.

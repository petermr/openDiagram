0: We selected LPAI H9N2 virus-infected A549 cells as the control group and HPAI H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells as the test group in this study.
1: Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D) and MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were applied to investigate the differences in the host proteome after infection with these two influenza virus strains and to explore the different pathogenic mechanisms of A/Chicken/Jiangsu/07/2002 (H9N2) and A/Chicken/Henan/12/2004 (H5N1) in infected human cells.

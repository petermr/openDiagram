<p>Our study provides several important pieces of evidences on the significance of the COL11A1 gene in the prognosis of human colorectal cancer. The overexpression of COL11A1 is positively upregulated in the cancer tissue across the various clinicopathological conditions, while negatively regulated in the case of promoter methylation indicating that the hypermethylation can induce the inhibition of cancer development. The survival assay signifies poor prognosis in both overall and disease-free survival. Our 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study reveals that an abundance of COL11A1 mRNA could induce the transcriptional upregulation of THBS2, COL10A1, COL5A2, and COL1A2 genes cooperatively, to promote the neoplasia. The dysregulation in the expression of COL11A1 and mutations alters various critical regulatory pathways to influence the oncogenesis of colorectal cancer in humans. Therefore, our experimental data firmly claims the candidature of the COL11A1 gene as a potential biomarker for the prognosis of colorectal cancer and opens new areas of research for the diagnosis and development of appropriate therapeutic strategies. However, further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental validations are required to determine the efficacy of the COL11A1 gene in the prognosis of colorectal cancer and the development of a therapeutic strategy. Regarding this, we are in order to work on the cancer cell-lines and the murine model of colorectal cancer for validating the present study and developing efficacious therapeutic strategy by targeting COL11A1 gene.

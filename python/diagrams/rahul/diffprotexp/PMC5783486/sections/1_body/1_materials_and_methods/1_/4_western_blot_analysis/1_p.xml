<p>Serum samples from 36 children (12 control, 12 CAA and 12 CAD) were randomly grouped into 12 sets (for Control, CAA and CAD; details are presented in 
 <xref rid="tI-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="table">Table IB</xref>) for validation. Proteins from the sera of these patients were extracted and the concentrations were measured using lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) and a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Following electrophoresis with 20 µg protein per lane via 12–15% SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against: Complement factor H (CFH; cat. no. ab133536), mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2; cat. no. ab203303), kininogen 1 (KNG1; cat. no. ab170475), fibronectin (FN1; cat. no. ab2413), antithrombin-III (SERPINC1; cat. no. ab126598) and β-actin (cat. no. ab8227) (all from Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, horse radish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG (cat. no. ab6721, 1:2,000; Abcam) was applied to the primary antibody-treated PVDF membranes at room temperature for 2 h. The specific bands on these membranes were visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence system (Promega Corporation).

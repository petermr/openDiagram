<p>Microstructure characterization was carried out using an Olympus BX51 optical microscope (OM, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a Zeiss Ultra-55 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Inclusions in steel were analyzed by a JXA-8530F electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. Meanwhile, Mn diffusion in austenite at different temperatures was calculated by Thermo-Calc DICTRA dynamics software (V2017b, Thermo-Calc Software AB, Solna, Sweden) with MOBFE4 database.</p>

0: Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for human.
1: Many animal experiments and clinical studies had indicated that Se plays an important role in diverse physiologic actions [ 1, 2].
2: The essentiality of Se depends on its role at the catalytic site of multiple selenoproteins [ 3].
3: Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), thioredoxin reductase (TRR), and deiodinases (ID) are also some of the enzymes with Se in their structure.
4: These enzymes perform many important biological functions.
5: The reduction of hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by GSH-Px through the reduced glutathione.
6: As for TRR, it catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the redox protein thioredoxin [ 4].
7: ID regulates thyroid hormone bioavailability.
8: The above enzymes play a critical role in reproduction, antioxidation, muscle function, and tumor prevention [ 5].

<p>First dimensional IEF was performed using Ettan IPGphor 3TM (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) with 7 cm ImmobilineTM DryStrip Non-Linear both pH 3–10 and pH 4–7 (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK). Rehydration of the gel strips was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein extracts were further diluted in Destreak rehydration buffer and were focused up to 9400 V·h at a maximum voltage of 5000 V (step and hold). Following IEF, proteins were reduced and alkylated by soaking the Immobiline Drystrips in 5 mL equilibration solution (6 M urea, 50 mM Tris HCl; pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.004% bromophenol blue) containing 50 mg dithiothreitol for 15 min at room temperature and then in 5 mL equilibration solution containing 125 mg iodoacetamide with the same conditions [

Tris glycine SDS (25 mM Tris, 198 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS) was used as electrode buffer. Gels were run at 20 mA/gel until the dye front reached the bottom edge of each gel. The 2-DE was run in duplicate for each sample.

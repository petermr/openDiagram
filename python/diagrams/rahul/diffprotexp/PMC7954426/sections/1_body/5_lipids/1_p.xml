<p>Mycoplasmas can recruit and metabolize host lipids that are critical for their growth and survival. A detailed analysis of mycoplasma cell membrane lipids revealed that 35%–50% are neutral lipids, primarily unesterified cholesterol incorporated from the growth medium, and 50%–65% are polar lipids [

 <italic>M. hominis, M. penetrans, M. pneumoniae, M. fermentans, M. orale</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic>, have been studied [

 <italic>M. fermentans</italic> being the most studied. The polar lipid fraction of 
 <italic>M. fermentans</italic> is mainly composed of phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro), phosphocholine-containing glycoglycerolipids (MfGL), glycoglycerophospholipids (GGPLs), ether lipids (MfEL) and its lyso form (lyso-MfEL) [

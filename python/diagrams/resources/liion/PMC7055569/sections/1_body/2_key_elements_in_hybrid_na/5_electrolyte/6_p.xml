 <sup>−1</sup> of discharge capacity with 0.3 V of overall overpotential gap. In acidic electrolyte systems, due to instability of NASICON at low pH, weak acids become an obvious choice but with the drawback of low ionic conductivity. Therefore, it always required to add a salt in weak acids to improve the conductivity of electrolyte.

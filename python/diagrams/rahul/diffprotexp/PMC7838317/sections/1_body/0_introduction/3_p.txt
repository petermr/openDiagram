0: While some studies have found only minimal effects of translocation on survival of freshwater mussels 21,  22, this practice often results in increased mortality and/or reduced growth rates 19,  23  25.
1: However, models of future extinction rates predict that, without effective intervention, more than 40% of North American freshwater mussel species will become extinct over the next 100 years 26.
2: Translocation and captive breeding programs continue to be crucial and necessary tools in freshwater mussel conservation, and thus efforts should focus on making these techniques as successful as possible.
3: One of the major factors limiting conservation success is our limited knowledge of freshwater mussel health and disease 27.
4: Because mussel physiology is understudied, the exact roles of potential causes for population declines (e.g., habitat destruction, pollution) are poorly understood 27.
5: The effects of captivity on mussel physiology and appropriate health assessment techniques are also unclear 28.

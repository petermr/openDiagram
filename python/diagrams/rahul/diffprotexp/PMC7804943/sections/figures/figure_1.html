 <caption> Multi-layered RNA-seq analysis for investigating neuronal subtype diversity. a Schematic of the mouse hippocampus (center) and the various anatomical regions assayed by RNA-seq from Cembrowski et al. 28 . The hippocampus is broadly segmented into three subfields: CA1 (purple), CA3 (green), and DG (orange, unlabeled). Computational methods were applied to generate multi-dimensional profiles of each transcriptome, including gene expression (GE), exon sequence alternative splicing (AS), intron retention (IR), and alternative polyadenylation (APA).

The total contributions of each layer, measured by total variance explained ( R 2), are summarized in the bar-plot (top panel). The individual contributions of each layer to each latent factor (LF) are summarized in the heatmap (bottom panel). c Beeswarm plots (one-dimensional scatterplots) illustrating the variation described by the top four latent factors inferred by MOFA. Each sample is assigned a factor weight ( y-axis) signifying its involvement in explaining the factor. MOFA captures sources of variability found between different regions (color). </caption>

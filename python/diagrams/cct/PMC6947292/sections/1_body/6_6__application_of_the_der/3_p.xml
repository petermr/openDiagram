<p>In the martensitic precipitation hardening of steels such as X5CrNiCuNb16-4, strengthening is caused by the precipitation of fine Cu-rich particles [

 <xref rid="B226-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. In terms of cooling from solution treatment, the quench-induced precipitation of Cu-rich phases has thus far been disregarded, since the available continuous time-temperature transformation diagrams for precipitation hardening steels were recorded by dilatometry. The available continuous time-temperature-transformation diagrams therefore neglect precipitation, and only the martensitic transformation has been analysed in work using dilatometry [

 <xref rid="B131-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>] covering cooling DSC on X5CrNiCuNb16-4 clearly reveals quench-induced precipitation and its negative effect on the hardness after ageing (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f083">Figure 83</xref>). In a similar way to aluminium alloys, precipitation occurs in two different temperature regimes and the UCCR for this steel is about 30 K/s.

  <p>Electrophysiological analysis of (MNs). 
   <bold>a</bold> Time-dependent increase of spontaneous action potential (AP) spikes generated by MNs and recorded from a representative electrode (one of 144) on a multi-electrode (MEA) chip. MN were plated on the MEA chip at 18 days post-chemical induction of iPSC (D18) and electrophysiological activity was recorded at the indicated time points of MN maturation (D22-D31) for 1 min. The frequency of AP spikes (
   <bold>b</bold>) and the percentage of spikes in the burst 
   <bold>(c</bold>) dramatically increased within the neuronal networks over time. Shown are the mean and standard error from 12 electrodes at each sampling day post iPSC induction

<p id="Par40">Prenatal exposure to hormones like T can strongly influence developing offspring, even exerting long-term organizational effects. Accordingly, we show that adult males from T-injected eggs were more aggressive toward conspecific intruders than control males, similar to findings in other avian species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Here, we examined a hypothesized mechanism by which prenatal T promotes this long-term behavioral change, including differential neural gene expression and methylation. We found hundreds of DEGs in the HYPO, but not the TnA, of males exposed to experimentally enhanced prenatal T. The TnA is involved in social arousal and sensory integration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and, as such, may play a larger role in more transient, socially activated genomic responses. Whereas the HYPO regulates upstream neuroendocrine processes associated with social behaviors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], perhaps making it better poised to generate lasting and far-reaching organizational effects. Many of the DEGs in the HYPO were associated with processes that have well-established links to the regulation of aggression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, we identified a highly connected PPI subnetwork in the HYPO that showed enrichment for signaling pathways and hormone regulation. Several DEGs in this subnetwork were also differentially methylated, suggesting prenatal T may generate epigenetic changes in key genes that are capable of influencing multiple aggression-related pathways.

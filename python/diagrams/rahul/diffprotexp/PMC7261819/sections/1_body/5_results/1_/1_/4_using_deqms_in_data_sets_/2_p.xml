<p>For comparisons between methods, we used a common matrix design (with all 18 cell lines as one factor) when using DEqMS, Limma and ANOVA. As an example of the output of the analysis, comparing two of the luminal breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) resulted in a large number of significant DEPs for DEqMS (5825) as well as Limma (5811,

 <italic>A</italic>). In this setting, ANOVA also generated a similar number of significant DEPs (5799), whereas 
 <italic>t</italic> test generated much fewer significant DEPs (2747). Overall, the differences in the total number of DEPs identified were small between DEqMS, Limma and ANOVA. This is not a surprise because in larger MS-data sets with more samples (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> replicates and/or sample groups), the influence of the estimated prior variance on the posterior variance becomes smaller (see formula (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) in Materials and Methods) and the degree of variance shrinkage in Limma and DEqMS is decreased. Importantly, all these methods calculate pooled variances for each protein using all samples in all sample groups, whereas 
 <italic>t</italic> test use only the samples in the two groups compared. Therefore, the statistical power is inferior in 
 <italic>t</italic> test compared with the other methods, which is clearly indicated by the 
 <italic>p</italic> values generated by the different methods (

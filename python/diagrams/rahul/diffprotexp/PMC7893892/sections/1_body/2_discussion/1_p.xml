<p id="Par32">Studies have found that lncRNA is involved in multiple reproductive functions such as spermatogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], placentation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], signaling pathway of sex hormone response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and gonadgenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is known that the melatonin synthesized in pineal gland is closely related to the estrus cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Herein, the study focused on examining expression profiles of pineal gland lncRNAs and mRNAs in sheep with two genotypes at different phases of estrous cycle using RNA-Seq technology. Analysis of relationship between DE lncRNAs and mRNAs by generating a co-expression network. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide analysis of pineal gland in sheep with different genotypes, and might provide valuable resource for searching functional lncRNAs associated with sheep prolificacy.

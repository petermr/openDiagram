<p id="Par2">Induction heating techniques have proven a boon to surface hardening, based on their short process times, precise energy input and resulting low energy usage

 </sup>. The repeatability inherent in electronically controlled induction circuits further lends itself to a high degree of automation within a production chain. Process design for induction hardening, however, is non-trivial as the short heating times allow for little diffusion, giving the microstructure of the base material some influence on the properties of the hardened surface

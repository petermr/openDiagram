<p>The alterations identified in the modular structure and compactness of cancer networks can pinpoint the biological functions or molecular pathways more strongly affected by cancer transformation. Gene co-expression networks, in fact, have a modular structure where genes belonging to the same module often share functions. This approach can rely on previous knowledge of pathwaysâ€™ components and structure, as defined, for example, in KEGG pathways and through PPI networks, but also unbiasedly define modules based on expression levels only.</p>

<p>It is worth emphasizing that miRNA–mRNA interaction analysis results based on target prediction and calculation of expression correlation should be treated as preliminary. The commonly used methodology of detail validation of miRNA–mRNA interactions utilize laborious experimenting in vitro to confirm the impact of miRNA level on target gene expression and confirmation of physical miRNA–mRNA interaction with luciferase assay. This wet-lab approach is practically unfeasible for simultaneous investigation of many target genes of multiple miRNAs that we attempted to perform in our study. Additionally, this approach requires an appropriate cell model, but no human cell line of corticotroph cells is available. The only stable line of corticotroph cells are mouse AtT-20 cells and its usefulness in investigation of miRNA–mRNA interaction in human is limited due to evolutionary differences between species [

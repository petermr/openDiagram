<p id="Par18">Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were acquired on NEO Avance 500-MHz Bruker spectrometer. Prior to analysis, copolymer 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.025-cm films were cut using a razorblade grid, resulting in 441 pieces. Such prepared specimen was placed into CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> at a concentration of 15 mg/ml and allowed to dissolve without agitation for 10 min prior to analysis. The relaxation and mixing times were optimized and set to 1.5 and 0.6 s, respectively. Eight consecutive scans were co-added to generate NOESY spectra. Reproducibility of NMR experiments was determined by conducting multiple damage-repair cycle experiments using different damaged sections of copolymer films. The analysis of NOE intensities and chemical shifts due to

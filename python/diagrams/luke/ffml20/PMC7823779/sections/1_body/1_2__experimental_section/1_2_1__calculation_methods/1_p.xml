 <sup>+</sup> and GO, A simplified model of GO that only includes epoxy and hydroxyl was built, which is shown in

 <sup>+</sup> were constrained to analyze the changes in the structure (both bond length and bond angles) when the reactants get closer. The DFT results were obtained by using the DMol3 density-functional module in the set of general gradient approximation (GGA) functionals and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) correlation [
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We set 1 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> Ha as the convergence tolerance, DNP 3.5 was the basis set and 0.002 Ha of smearing was used to speed up the convergence.

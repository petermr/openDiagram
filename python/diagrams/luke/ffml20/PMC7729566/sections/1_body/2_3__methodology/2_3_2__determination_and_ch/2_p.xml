<p>Based on the screening results, the phase diagram of the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH + H
 <sub>2</sub>O system was experimentally determined using a combination of the cloud point titration method and turbidimetric method performed in a temperature-controlled thermostatic bath. The cloud point, representing the solution turbidity caused by phase demixing, was visually detected when a mass of acid or aqueous salt solution was added dropwise over an aqueous IL solution of known mass, and a known mass of water was added until the solution became clear again, this process being repeated several times. The [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl and CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH concentration ranges probed in this study are 2.0 to 75.0 wt.% IL and 0.0 to 30.0 wt.% CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH respectively. Additionally, to delimit the “type 0” phase diagram of [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH + H
 <sub>2</sub>O, mixing points of known composition concentrated in organic acid and IL were prepared and a known mass of water was added dropwise in each tube until the appearance of cloudiness. All mixing points were made in triplicate.

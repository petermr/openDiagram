<p>A quantitative sandwich ELISA was performed according to the protocols of the manufacturers on non-depleted cyst fluid samples of 72 thyroid lesions (17 cPTCs and 55 benign lesions) and the cystic tissue reference samples. The calibrators and samples were loaded to 96-well microplate in duplicate and bound by the immobilized primary antibody using assays for: CK-19/CYFRA 21â€“1 (KA4024, Abnova, Taiwan), S100A13 (E01S0025, Bluegene; DY4327 R&amp;D systems, Abingdon, UK), and vimentin (KA3127, Abnova). After washings, an HRP-conjugated antibody was added to the samples. The optical density (O.D.) was determined using a VERSA max microplate reader by photometry at 450 nm and documented by SOFTmax PRO v4 (Molecular Devices, USA), and protein concentrations were interpolated from the O.D. data using a standard curve.</p>

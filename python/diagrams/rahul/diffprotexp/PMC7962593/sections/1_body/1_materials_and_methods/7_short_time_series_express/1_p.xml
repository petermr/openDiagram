<p>We performed STEM analysis to cluster the common genes in healthy individuals, sepsis patients and septic shock patients in the GSE13904 database (children).
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Significant clustering was defined as 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. The significantly clustered genes showed a trend of gradual up- or down-regulation as one moved from controls to sepsis patients and then to septic shock patients.

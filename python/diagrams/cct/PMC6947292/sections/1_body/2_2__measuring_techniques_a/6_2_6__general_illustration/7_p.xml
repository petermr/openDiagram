<p>To provide information about precipitation intensity, the total cooling rate specific precipitation enthalpy âˆ†h
 <sub>total</sub> is plotted below certain cooling paths in rectangles. The specific precipitation enthalpy is proportional to the volume fraction of precipitates formed during cooling. The Vickers hardness HV1 (HV5 for some 7xxx alloys) after cooling and additional ageing is shown by ovals. The precipitation enthalpy is high for slow cooling, whereas hardness after ageing is high for rapid quenching. Strong precipitation during cooling causes a loss of availability of alloying elements for subsequent ageing.

<p>To perform Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, HPLC was used to fractionate the tryptic peptides before mass spectrometry analysis. The parameters used for the step gradient were set to acetonitrile (pH 9.0); 8–32%. Later, we combined the peptides, followed by freeze-drying in a vacuum chamber. EASY-nLC 1200 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was employed to separate dissolved peptides. The liquid phase gradient was set to B (Methanole %); 9–25% for 30 min; 25–35% for 22 min; 35–80% for 4 min; 80% for 4 min, while the flow rate was kept constant at 350 nL/min. Orbitrap Fusion LUMOS platform was utilized to perform Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with standard mass spectrometry parameters.</p>

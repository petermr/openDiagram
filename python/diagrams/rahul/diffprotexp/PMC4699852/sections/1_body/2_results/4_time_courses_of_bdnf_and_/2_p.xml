 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows time courses of relative expression levels of phosphorylated ERK, TrkB and phosphorylated CREB for 
 <italic>me_</italic>SWH-treated MSCs in NIM with and without ERK inhibitor. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, the level of phosphorylated ERK had a rebound increase 24 h after induction. However, in the presence of ERK inhibitor, the related level of phosphorylated ERK decreased gradually with time. Similarly, the phosphorylated CREB level increased initially with time and then decreased at 24 h. The phosphorylated CREB level then increased again to approximately 1.2 times the initial value at 56 h. An oscillation behavior was observed in the level of pCREB during the early stage of differentiation. This oscillation was smoothed out if ERK inhibitor was present in the NIM. The increase in TrkB levels was significant after 32 h of induction and increased to approximately 3.1 times the initial value at 64 h. When the ERK inhibitor was present in the induction medium, the TrkB level increased at 24 h and reached the highest value (approx. 3.3 times of the initial value) at 48 h. The TrkB level then decreased slightly over time.

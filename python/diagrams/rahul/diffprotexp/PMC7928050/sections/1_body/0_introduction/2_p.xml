<p>In plastic surgery precisely this SWAT is used for free fat transplantation. Interestingly, most studies on fat transplantation address the viability of transplanted fat tissue and its ability to fulfill the requirements of volume augmentation. Opposing to this huge amount of studies, to our knowledge, no study has addressed the impact of transplantation itself on the metabolic and other biological functions of the transplanted tissue itself. We know that transplanted fat tissue can ameliorate skin texture when transferred to scar tissue[

 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Hence, this tissue is biologically active after transplantation. But we ignore the effect the transplantational stress has on the biological functions of the fat tissue. As gene expression changes are the first answers to external physiological demands of the cell, we decided to assess the genetic response of the adipose tissue after transplantation.

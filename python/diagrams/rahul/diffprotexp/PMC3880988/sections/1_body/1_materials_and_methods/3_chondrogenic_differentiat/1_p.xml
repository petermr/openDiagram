<p>MSC- and AC-alginate beads were prepared using a 1.2% low viscosity alginate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed in 0.15M sodium chloride as previously described 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. MSC and AC-alginate beads were then formed in a 102 mM calcium chloride solution at a density of 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Alginate beads were then washed with 0.15M sodium chloride. Ten cell-alginate constructs were transferred to each well of a 6-well culture plate (Corning, USA) before being cultured in chondrogenic defined medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD USA) containing 10 ng/mL TGF-β3 (Lonza, USA). MSC and AC-alginate cultures were maintained at 37
 <sup>o</sup>C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 21 days.

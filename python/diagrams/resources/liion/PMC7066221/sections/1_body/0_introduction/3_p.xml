<p id="p0040">Despite significant advantages (e.g., high theoretical capacity, low cost, low toxicity), the notorious instability of the Mn-based cathodes during recharging cycles severely impedes their use in practical Zn-ion batteries (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2019</xref>). The instability could be mainly associated with the disproportionation of Mn(III), generating Mn(IV) and highly soluble Mn(II) (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). It is important to note that for MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, regardless of its initial phase structure (e.g., α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, β-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> or δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>), this charge disproportionation is very likely to happen, leading to the same result of the dissolution and loss of active Mn compound and, consequently, deterioration of the capacity. To address this issue, additional Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> at high concentrations (usually 0.1–0.5 M) was proposed to be introduced into the electrolyte to suppress the disproportionation reaction (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2019</xref>). The cycling stability of Mn-based cathodes has been greatly enhanced by adopting this strategy. However, this enhancement is at the expense of reduced mass energy density of the battery, given that the large proportion of the extra Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> occupies additional weight but might not provide decent capacity.

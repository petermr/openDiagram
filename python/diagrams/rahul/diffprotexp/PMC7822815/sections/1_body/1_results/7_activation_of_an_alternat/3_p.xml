<p id="Par36">To that end we took advantage of the RSK-specific inhibitor BI-D1870 and examined the impact of RPS6KA1 inhibition on the clonogenic potential of t(8;21) AML cells as a surrogate read-out for leukemic self-renewal. In general, RPS6KA1 inhibition substantially impaired clonogenic growth in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>). However, RUNX1/RUNX1T1-knockdown sensitizes leukemic cells to RPS6KA1 inhibition: BI-D1870 alone reduced clonogenicity with an apparent IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 600 nM, a preceding knockdown of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 lowered this value to 100 nM. In conclusion, alternate TSS usage and therewith linked increased expression of RPS6KA1 compensated for the loss of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 strongly suggesting RPS6KA1 as a pharmacologic target for t(8;21) AML. As target identification usually focuses on genes and proteins with elevated expression levels

<p>Spots of interest, selected as described earlier, were excised from a non-charged gel containing 90 μg of protein and digested using the fully automated Ettan Spot Handling Workstation (GE Healthcare), as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91-ijms-14-04912">91</xref>]. All MS and MS/MS analyses were performed using a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and the resulting spectra used in database searches with an Applied Biosystems GPS-server and an in-house MASCOT platform (Matrix Science, London, UK). All proteins from the taxonomy Viridiplantae were downloaded from the NCBI server and used as protein database; likewise, the used EST database contained all Viridiplantae ESTs downloaded on 04/10/2010. All searches (combined MS and 8 MS/MS spectra) were carried out using a mass window of 100 ppm for the precursor and 0.75 Da for the fragments. During the different searches, the following parameters were defined: two missed cleavages, fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteine and variable oxidation of methionine and tryptophan to kynurenine or double oxidation to N′-Formylkynurenine. When a protein is identified as “hypothetical”, “unknown” or based on an expressed sequence tag (EST)-sequence, the sequence was used for a BLAST analysis, and the protein with the highest homology (when significant) was added as an identified protein.

0: Detection of  BRAF (V600E) mutation was performed using allele-specific PCR with dual-labeled probe as described in [ 91].
1: PCR cycling conditions were pre-denaturation step 95  2 min, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation (94, 10 s), annealing, and elongation (60, 15 s).
2: Mutation status was considered positive if the mutant allele content was 3% or more of the wild-type allele.

 <caption> GAG secretion of MSC, cMSC and AC culture from day-0 to day-28 were compared to their respective control using parametric 2-sided independent t-test. GAG secretion in both cMSC and AC was significantly higher than MSC ( p&lt;0.01). GAG secretion of cMSC was significantly enhanced at day-21 compared to day-0 ( p&lt;0.01). </caption>

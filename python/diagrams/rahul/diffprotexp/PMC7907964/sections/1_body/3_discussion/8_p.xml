<p>The present study has various limitations. Firstly, the proteins were identified without consideration of protein isoforms or processing, such as cleaved, mature and truncated forms or other post-translational modifications. Secondly, although the present study provides potential proteins associated with the disease, the numbers of patients with PD exhibiting 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants from whom fibroblasts were acquired was small. Therefore, larger numbers of samples need to be analysed to represent phenotype and variant correlations. Lastly, the identified proteins obtained from skin fibroblasts of patients may not be the same as those of a patient's neuronal cells, which are more likely to demonstrate a direct clinical correlation with the variants. The results from studies focused on induced dopaminergic neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells from patients should reveal more precisely the molecular defects that occur in those neuronal cells (

 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> genes provides unique proteome profiles, which suggest that the proteins identified may serve important roles in the disease status.

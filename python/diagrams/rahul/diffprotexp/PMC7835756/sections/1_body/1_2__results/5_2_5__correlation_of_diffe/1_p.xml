<p>The correlation of genes with DmCs and differential expressed Genes (DEGs) was analyzed to determine the biological relevance of the methylome in the physiological adaptation to stress. For this analysis, 1117 DmCs sites were considered, including the sites on protein-coding regions and promoter regions. Also, there were considered the data set of DEGs [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and small-RNA targets (sRNA) [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] obtained in previous works, considering that the same grown conditions were used in the experiments and the physiological age of plants tested were identical. Of the genes differentially expressed in response to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the transgenic tobaccos, 5397 DEGs were considered, and among those, 83 genes were also differentially methylated (

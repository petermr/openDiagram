0: All patients were biologic naive, had received previous treatment with DMARDs, and were selected if they were treated with adalimumab and could be categorised as good or non-responders to treatment at 3 months.
1: Stringent inclusion criteria were applied to select responder groups.
2: Good-responders were defined by a 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) of< 2.6 at follow-up (i.e.
3: clinical remission) and an improvement of > 1.2.
4: Non-responders were included if their improvement in DAS28 was< 0.6 with an endpoint DAS28 of > 5.1 (i.e.
5: high disease activity).
6: Non-responder patients were excluded if anti-drug antibodies, measured by radioimmunoassay at 3-month follow-up, were detected in serum samples and/or if they self-reported non-adherence [ 14,  15].

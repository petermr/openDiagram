<p>To ensure this is clear we have redesigned Figure 4C to match the lineage coloring scheme from Figure 1, and indicate with a skull and cross bones which species are extinct. We have also added a caveat to the description of Figure 4C: “Cladogram of Afrotheria with sequenced genomes. Exemplar tumor suppressor duplicates are mapped onto lineages in which those genes are duplicated. Dots represent a duplication event of the color-coded genes. Note that we are unable to determine duplication status for some genes in Proboscideans because of assembly gaps in ancient genomes (indicated with skull and crossbones); these genes appear to be independently duplicated in extant species (African Forest, African Savanah, and Asian elephants) because they are missing from ancient genomes, biasing ancestral reconstructions of duplication status.”</p>

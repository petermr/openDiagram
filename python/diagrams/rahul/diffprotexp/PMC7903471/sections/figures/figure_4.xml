 <caption>
  <p>KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs. Each dot represents the degree of enrichment of the KEGG entry. The closer the color is to red, the higher the enrichment. The size of each dot represents the number of genes enriched in the KEGG entry; the larger the dot, the more genes are enriched in the KEGG entry. Rich ratio: (Differential genes of this pathway/all differential genes)/(genes annotated to this pathway/all can be annotated to Gene). KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA.</p>

<p id="Par40">To further characterize the specific roles of individual ATF4 gene targets during ISR activation, the 
 <italic>ATF4</italic> gene plus the 47 ATF4-regulated genes with an FDR &lt; 0.05 and magnitude logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3] (up or down) were grouped by function with single gene-level logFC displayed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). Most of the ATF4-regulated genes are involved in various biological processes necessary for cellular compensation to DCVC-induced stress. Notably, 5 amino acid transporter genes were significantly differentially expressed: 
 <italic>SLC1A4, SLC1A5, SLC6A9,</italic> and 
 <italic>SLC7A11</italic> (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). Contrarily, some of the ATF4-regulated genes control biological processes that contribute to cell death. Moreover, many of these genes are co-regulated by dimerization with C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), another transcription factor which is itself regulated by ATF4 (Han et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>; Su and Kilberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2008</xref>). Particularly, 9 amino acid biosynthesis genes were differentially expressed at a significant level: 
 <italic>AARS, ASNS, CARS, GARS, MARS, SARS, TARS</italic> and 
 <italic>YARS</italic> (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c)

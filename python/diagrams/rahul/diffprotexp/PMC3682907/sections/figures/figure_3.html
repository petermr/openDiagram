 <caption> Protein expression profile for fraction Q3. (A) Example of SELDI mass spectra of two differentially expressed proteins in anion exchange fraction Q3 obtained from mitochondrial fractions of brain tissue from EAE mice at disease stage 1 (E1) and disease stage 3 (E2-E5) as well as brain tissue from controls (C1-C3). The peak at 12448 Da shows increased expression in EAE tissue relative to controls, whereas the peak at 13954 Da shows a decreased expression in EAE as compared to controls. (B) Scatter plot of scores for principal components 1 and 2 obtained from a PCA analysis showing the segregation of data into EAE and control samples. (C) Heat map obtained from a hierarchical cluster analysis showing the clustering of the E1 (disease stage 1) sample with the control samples. The * indicates the two differentially expressed proteins shown in the SELDI mass spectra given in (A). These two proteins were digested with trypsin and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing with a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (TableÂ  4). </caption>

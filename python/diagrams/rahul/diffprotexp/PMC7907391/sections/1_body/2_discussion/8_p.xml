<p id="Par27">Limitations of this analysis should be noted however, as the variables collected in the radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and COVID-19 datasets are confined to the original study design with missing data on the baseline immune characteristics of the cancer patients in the former studies, and lack of cancer characteristics in the COVID-19 dataset. Ideally, a single prospective dataset of cancer patients with and without COVID-19 with temporal transcriptomic profiles of the patients before, during, and after radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatments would be most useful in the future. Additionally, it is noted that gene-to-protein translation could not be validated for all tissue types, since these studies were limited by the number and types of antibodies used, as well as the number of available patient samples.</p>

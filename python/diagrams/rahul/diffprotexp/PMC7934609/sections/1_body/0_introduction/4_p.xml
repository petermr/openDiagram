<p>In the present study, we aim to characterize the differential expression proteins involved in the development of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>. We provide the iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of proteins present in the three consecutive stages of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>: oncosphere, adult, and protoscolex. This work provides important information on 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> developmental biology, and also contributes to new strategies and targets to combat 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infections in humans and animals.

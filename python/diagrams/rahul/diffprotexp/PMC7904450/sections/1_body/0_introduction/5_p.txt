0: To investigate the potential clinical utility of using fluoxetine to reduce IL6 mediated inflammation in COVID-19 patients and to elucidate the mechanism by which fluoxetine acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, we used transcriptomic signatures from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data repository to perform bioinformatic analyses comparing fluoxetine with 2 other antidepressantsbupropion and paroxetineas well as an established anti-inflammatory therapeuticthe corticosteroid dexamethasone.
1: The transcriptomic changes caused by targeted knockdown of 27 inflammatory genes potentially involved in fluoxetines anti-inflammatory mechanism of action were compared to the transcriptomic changes caused by antidepressant drug therapy.
2: Our resultant data highlights the significance of IL6ST and NF-kappaB in fluoxetines anti-inflammatory mechanism of action and supports further exploration of fluoxetine as a candidate drug in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies such as those contributing to COVID-19.

<p>Full-length CPSF1 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian vector pENTER for overexpression and confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid was transfected into HCC cell lines using Lipofectamine
 <sup>TM</sup> 3000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States). For knockdown assays, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CPSF1 were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine
 <sup>TM</sup> RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The siRNA sequences used are listed in

<p>For further interpretation and understanding of the aforementioned findings, chemical‐bonding analysis was employed. In the cathode of a LIB or NIB, the ideal reaction pathway (or minimum‐energy curve) starts at FeNCN, proceeds through a variety of intermediate (amorphous) compounds, and ends at Li
 <sub>2</sub>NCN or Na
 <sub>2</sub>NCN. For an intermediate compound with a certain stoichiometric configuration, for example, Li
 <sub>2</sub>Fe
 <sub>7</sub>(NCN)
 <sub>8</sub>, different crystal‐structure models were computationally established. Taking a thermodynamic point of view, the one crystallizing with the lowest formation energy was preferred but we note that other metastable variants with higher formation energies but lower activation barriers are also possible according to Ostwald's step rule.

It is apparent that bonding interactions dominate in the low‐energy valence‐band region whereas anti‐bonding states appear in the unoccupied conduction band, but also just below the Fermi level. For a quantitative assessment, all COHP values were integrated up to the Fermi level to yield ICOHP data for the Fe−N and Li−N bonds and averaged over all corresponding bonds in the unit cell. It turns out that the

 <italic>mmm</italic> model of Li

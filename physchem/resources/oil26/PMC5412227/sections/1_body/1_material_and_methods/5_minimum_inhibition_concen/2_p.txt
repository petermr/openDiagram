0: 96-well microtiter plates utilizing broth microdilution method was applied for the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) concentrations determination.
1: In a typical procedure, the bacterial strains were cultured overnight at 37 C on MHB, adjusted to a final density of 8 log CFU/mL, and used to inoculate (1-10) 96-well microtiter plates containing serial dilutions of the essential oils (5120-20 g/m1) on MHB.
2: A positive control containing the bacterial culture and broth without the plant oils was included in each test.
3: The contents of each well were mixed on a plate shaker at 300 r/min for 30 seconds and then incubated at 37 C for 24 h, while  Streptococcus agalactiae and  Streptococcus mutans were incubated for 48 h. Then, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, T8877) was used for the visual indicator of bacterial growth.
4: The MIC of the essential oils was regarded as the lowest concentration showing no growth.

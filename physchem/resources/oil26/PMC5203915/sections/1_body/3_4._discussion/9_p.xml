Astrocytes are multifunctional glial cells in the central nervous system and can regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, control the release of antioxidant defences, and are associated with the immune response by the production of inflammatory mediators such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prostaglandin E, and nitric oxide [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The inflammation causes neuronal death and brain injury. The activation of astrocytes leads to the release of neutrophic factors which regulate the survival and function of nervous tissue [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hence, the astrocytes are good cellular models in in vitro study to determine the potential anti-inflammatory effects of various agents, such as essential oils. The<italic> R. carthamoides</italic> HR and SGR essential oils did not inhibit the viability of astrocytes at concentrations between 0&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL and 800&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL.</p>

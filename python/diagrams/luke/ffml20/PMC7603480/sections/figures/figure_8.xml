  <title>Comparison ML models trained on the Rad-6 and the Rad-6-BS databases.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Learning curves for AE predictions of using the extensive kernel with an extensive FPS split and DFT geometries. 
   <bold>b</bold> Same as (
   <bold>a</bold>) but for the intensive kernel with an intensive FPS split. 
   <bold>c</bold> Correlation plot of MAE RE vs MAE AE for both Rad-6 and Rad-6-BS. Blue lines represent results obtained with the extensive kernel (crosses for Rad-6 and stars for Rad-6-BS) in (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>c</bold>). Red circles correspond to the intensive kernel with Rad-6 and orange diamonds to the intensive kernel with Rad-6-RE.

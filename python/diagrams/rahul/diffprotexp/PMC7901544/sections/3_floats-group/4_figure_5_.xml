   <bold>Evaluation of the interaction between KPNA3/4 and FAV4-Del</bold>. LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4 and FAV4-Del at 0.1 MOI respectively, and lysed and immunoprecipitated with KPNA3 (a) or KPNA4 (b) polyclonal antibodies, and then the cell lysates were detected with mAb 1C9 against Fiber-2, while the immunoprecipitates were detected with polyclonal antibodies against KPNA3(A) and KPNA4 (B), and mAb 1C9 against Fiber-2, respectively

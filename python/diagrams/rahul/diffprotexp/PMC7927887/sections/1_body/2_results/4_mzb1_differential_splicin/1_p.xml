<p>Marginal zone B and B1 cell specific protein (MZB1), is encoded by a gene that has eight potential transcripts. 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-201 is protein-coding transcript, 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-202, 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-204, 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-205, and 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-208 are removed via nonsense-medicated decay and 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-203, 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-206, and 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-207 have a retained intron. Differential splicing analysis between the mutated 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> samples and the control group identified six significant splicing events which included two novel splice junctions, one known splice junction, and differential usage of two exons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig004">Figure 4A</xref>). Three known transcripts, 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-203, 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-204 and 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-205 showed significant differences in the levels of expression between the two groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig004">Figure 4B</xref> and C). 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-205, which has been associated with apoptosis, was significantly higher in the 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant samples. Conversely, the transcripts 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-203 and 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>-204 were significantly down-regulated in the 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant samples. Manual inspection of 
 <italic>de novo</italic>-assembled transcripts identified two novel transcripts identified due to alternative splicing; designated MSTRG.24254.14 and MSTRG.24253.16. They had protein coding potential scores of 0.96 and 0.71 respectively and were both identified as coding. MSTRG.24253.14 and MSTRG.24253.16 share junctions with MZB1-204, which explains the reduced expression of MZB1-204, which is due to increased expression of these novel transcripts (

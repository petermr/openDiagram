<p id="Par21">The different lncRNAs, MSTRG.244344.3, MSTRG.262482.1 and MSTRG.378260.18 identified in the 1 and 3Â months old ovaries of Hu sheep may be involved in regulating the development of ovary follicles by up-regulating EGFR. The protein encoded by CDK2 is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex, which regulates cell cycle development. Similarly, cyclic ovarian activity is key to reproductive success and profound changes in tissue composition. Its function requires exquisite spatiotemporal coordinated proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of many different cell types within follicles, corpora lutea and ovarian stroma

 </sup> reported that blocking CDK2 activity can lead to cyclin B1 accumulation and a failure to induce meiosis. Thus, CDK2 participates in meiotic maturation of mammalian oocytes, promoting the first oocyte transition to the second meiosis. MSTRG.335777.1, MSTRG.340334.3, MSTRG. 397096.6 may have a 
 <italic>trans</italic> effect on CDK2 and affect follicle maturation. JAK signalling regulates the formation of primitive follicles in mice and participates in the proliferation of granulosa cells, and its inhibition (JAK3) reduces the proliferation of granulocytes. Inhibition of JAK3 expression can also occasion failure in primordial follicles formation

 </sup>. Previous studies have shown that VEGFC and VEGF-D can co-integrate with VEGFA to stimulate early events in the angiogenesis of primate ovulatory follicles. However, the function of VEGFC in mammalian ovarian development is still unknown. Thus, lncRNAs may affect the PI3K-Akt pathway by regulating the expression of EGFR, CDK2, JAK3, and VEGFC in ovarian development.

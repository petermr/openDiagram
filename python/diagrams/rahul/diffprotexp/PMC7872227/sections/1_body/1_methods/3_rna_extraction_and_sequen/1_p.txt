0: Total RNA was extracted from nine sets of bacterial fluid samples using RNAprep Pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing), following the manufacturers protocol.
1: The quality and quantity of the extracted total RNA were verified using RNA-free agarose gel electrophoresis and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2: Nine sets of RNA samples were then used for library construction.
3: A total amount of 3g RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations.
4: As for prokaryotic samples, mRNA was purified from total RNA using probes to remove rRNA.
5: Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X).
6: First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-).
7: Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities.
8: After adenylation of 3 ends of DNA fragments, Adaptor with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization.
9: Then USER Enzyme was used to degrade the second strand of cDNA containing U.
10: In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 370~420bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA).
11: Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer.
12: At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and the library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.

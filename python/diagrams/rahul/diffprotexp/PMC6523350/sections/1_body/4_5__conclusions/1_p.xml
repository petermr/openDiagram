<p>A quantitative proteomics study was conducted on rice, based on iTRAQ technology, to find out the difference between natural Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice at proteome differential expression levels. Bioinformatic analysis on differential proteins pointed out anti-stress, anti-oxidation, reactive oxygen metabolism, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism of natural Se-enriched rice was better than non-Se-enriched rice. Howbeit, the starch synthesis pathway was evidently more in non-Se enriched rice. It can be inferred from GO, COG and KEGG annotations that CYS and metE probably were the two key proteins that caused amino acid differences between these two types of rice, and OsAPx02, CatC, riPHGPX, HSP70 and HSP90 perhaps were the key enzymes regulating the antioxidant and anti-stress effects in these two types of rice. This study provides interesting insights on proteome analysis and proteinic differential expression in Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice. In nature, Se is the key contributor to many biological and metabolic processes and has scavenging effects. However, the present investigation nurtures our understanding of the functioning of this trace element and uncovers the protein mechanism underlying Se.</p>

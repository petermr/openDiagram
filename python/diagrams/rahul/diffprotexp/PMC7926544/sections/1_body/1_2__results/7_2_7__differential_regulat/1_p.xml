<p>The interaction of the stress-inducible Hsp70 with the immature form of NKCC2 opens the possibility for its involvement also in the regulation of NKCC2 biogenesis. Consequently, we next compared the effect of STCH with that of Hsp70 on the expression of NKCC2 protein. To this end, HEK cells were transfected singly with NKCC2, or in combination with STCH or Hsp70. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f007">Figure 7</xref>A, when increasing amounts of STCH or Hsp70 (0.1–0.5 μg/well) were co-expressed with NKCC2 (0.1 μg/well), NKCC2 expression was, again, heavily reduced by STCH, whereas it was markedly increased by Hsp70, in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, these data revealed also, that Hsp70 co-expression effect on the mature form of NKCC2 is greater than that observed on the immature form of the co-transporter. Consequently, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f007">Figure 7</xref>B, Hsp70 co-expression increased the ratio of the mature vs. immature form of NKCC2, in a dose-dependent fashion strongly indicating that Hsp70 increases the maturation efficiency of the co-transporter. Hence, these data further support, per se, the notion that STCH induced-downregulation of NKCC2 is specific. Most importantly, they provide evidence that the non-inducible Hsp70-like protein STCH and the stress-inducible Hsp70 differentially regulate NKCC2 biogenesis.

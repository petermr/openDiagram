0: At the beginning of the soaking step, the precipitation reaction may start immediately.
1: Therefore, it may barely be possible to evaluate the precipitation onset directly.
2: Besides, during quenching from the solution treatment to soaking temperature, a temporal delay between the sample temperature and the program temperature occurs.
3: This fact influences the definition of the onset-point of the precipitation reaction.
4: Furthermore, the duration of the quenching step is longer when the soaking temperature is lower.
5: All these effects have been taken into account in the evaluation ( Figure 3).

<p id="Par35">In conclusion, our research confirms that the reproductive-stage water-deficit stress does have transgenerational effects in durum wheat, affecting the physiological parameters, yield performance and grain quality traits in the successive generation. Epigenetic mechanisms such as miRNA-guided gene regulation provide biological links between plant phenotypes and their adaptation to environmental stress exposure. Here, inter- and trans-generational stress had a significant influence on the expression profiles of miRNAs and their protein-coding genes, of which the functions are directly linked to biological pathways in plant development and fitness. The results suggest that durum miRNA-regulated pathways could play important roles adaptation to water-deficit stress across generations, helping plants achieve a balance between stress survival and reproductive success. The key miRNA-mRNA modules identified in the study provide new entry points for epi-breeding, which could subsequently lead to the development of superior, climate-smart durum varieties.</p>

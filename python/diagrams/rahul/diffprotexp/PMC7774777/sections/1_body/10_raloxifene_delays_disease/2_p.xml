<p>Since raloxifene has potent effects on proteostasis, the limited beneficial effect observed in the trial in SOD1-G93A mice was surprising. We reasoned that 1 major difference is the mode of drug delivery between the acute treatment administered by twice daily subcutaneous injection to the wild-type mice, in which we performed RNA-seq analysis, versus slow release pellets in the trial using SOD1-G93A mice. To test this hypothesis, we measured raloxifene serum concentration in both conditions. We found that the serum concentration ranged between 0.042 and 0.066 ng/mL in mice treated with the slow-release pellets while it was 0.126 to 0.225 ng/mL in the acute treatment (

Importantly, the serum concentrations in the acute treatment were performed 24 hours after the last injections and were within the concentration range measured in humans, 0.5 mg/mL 6 hours after oral administration with a half-life of 27 hours, which supports the estimation of approximately 0.24 ng/mL after 24 hours in humans (

Therefore, since a delay in disease progression is observed in the SOD1-G93A female mice, despite a dose 10-fold lower than what is typically achieved in humans treated with raloxifene, this result raises the possibility that the beneficial effect could be much greater in humans. However, a “U” shape dose response cannot be ruled out by these experiments and more work will be needed to define a dose response curve of raloxifene in these mice.

0: The differentially expressed proteins spots were manually excised from CBB stained gels.
1: Gel fragments were digested with trypsin (Roche, Cat.
2: No.
3: 11418025001) for MS analysis according to our previously described method  [20].
4: Matrix was prepared by dissolving -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA, Bruker Daltonics) in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.
5: 10 L of the matrix solution was added onto the dried digests and vortexed for 30 min.
6: A total of 1.5 L of the reconstituted in-gel digest sample was then spotted on Anchorchip target plate (600/384F, Bruker Daltonics), followed by addition of 1 L matrix solution onto each spot.
7: The dried sample on the target plate was washed twice with 1 L of 0.1% TFA, left for 30 s before solvent removal, and dried for matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight/mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/MS) analysis on Autoflex MALDI TOF/TOF MS instrument (Bruker Daltonics).
8: Peak-lists were generated by Mascot Distiller software (Version 3.2.1.0, Matrix Science).
9: Parameters and thresholds used for peak picking were signal/noise threshold >6 and resolution >1500.
10: The peptides for the calibration were done by a protonated mass signal from a standard peptide calibration mixture consisting of 8 peptides covering mass range from 700 to 3100 Da (Bruker, Billerica, MA Peptide Calibration Standard 206196) (Bruker daltonics).
11: Then, the measured tryptic peptide masses were transferred through MS BioTool (Version 2.2, Bruker daltonics) as inputs to search against the non redundant NCBI (NCBInr) database using MASCOT 2.2 (Matrix Science).
12: Search parameters were as follows: Taxonomy: all entries; trypsin cleavage; allow up to one missed cleavage; peptide mass tolerance 0.2 Da; fixed modification: carbamidomethyl (C); variable modification: oxidation (M).

<p>C57BL/6J strain mice, used only for single-cell sequencing, were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). For biochemical experiments, CD-1 mice were purchased from Jinan Pengyue Experimental Animal Breeding Co. Ltd (Jinan, China). The mice were raised in cages with 
 <italic>ad-libitum</italic> food and water, a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle at a constant temperature (24 ℃) and humidity. Females were mated with reproductive males around 17:00 h. The following morning, a vaginal plug indicated a successful mating, and the time was recorded as 0.5 dpc. At 16.5 dpc, mice were treated with 40 μg/kg body weight DEHP via oral gavage once a day. Postnatal female pups (birth on 19.5 dpc) at 0 and 3 days (PD0 and PD3) were sacrificed for subsequent isolation of ovarian tissue. In accordance with national guidelines, all the murine experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethical Committee of Qingdao Agricultural University.

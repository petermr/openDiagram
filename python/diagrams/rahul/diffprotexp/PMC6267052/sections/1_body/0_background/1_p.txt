0: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease, traditionally characterised by loss of articular cartilage.
1: However, for the knee, in the last years, more and more interest has also been directed towards the meniscus since meniscal damage is strongly associated with development of knee OA [ 1].
2: Both articular cartilage and menisci have similar functions, which are to withstand load and to distribute weight across surfaces, but their ultrastructure is somewhat different [ 2,  3].
3: Articular cartilage consists of chondrocytes that produce structural macromolecules, which, together with water, builds up the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the chondrocytes [ 4].
4: These macromolecules are mainly collagens (predominantly type II) and proteoglycans (predominantly aggrecan) as well as non-collagenous proteins and glycoproteins.
5: The meniscus also contains a dense ECM, but unlike articular cartilage, which only has one cell-type, the meniscus contains several different cell-types in its different regions [ 5,  6].
6: In the outer (peripheral) parts of the meniscus, which also contains blood vessels (red zone), the cells are mostly elongated fibroblast-like and in the inner region (white zone), the cells are mostly round chondrocyte-like.
7: In addition, the superficial regions have been reported to host progenitor cells [ 5,  6].

<p id="Par15">For the human experiments, data from five epochs, each of 72 consecutive trials, was extracted from each participant. The five epochs were: baseline—the final trials of the baseline period; early adaptation—the set of trials following the visuomotor rotation, in which endpoint errors were greater than 2SD from baseline; late adaptation—final trials under the visuomotor rotation condition; early aftereffect—the 72 trials following the removal of the visuomotor rotation, in which endpoint errors were greater than 2SD from Baseline; and late aftereffect—the final 72 trials of the task.</p>

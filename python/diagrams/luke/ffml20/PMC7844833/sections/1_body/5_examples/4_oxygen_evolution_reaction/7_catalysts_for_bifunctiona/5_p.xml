<p>Materials based on metalorganic frameworks were also considered as promising candidates for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. The control of the catalyst properties can be ensured in this case through tuning the lattice strain. Recently, Cheng et al. investigated NiFe MOFs where the strain was controlled via UV irradiation for different amounts of time, which resulted in an expansion of the organic interlayers.

 </sup> Using EXAFS, the octahedral local environment of the Ni species was established, with Niâ€“O interatomic distances systematically changing with the induced strain. Moreover, positive shifts of the Ni K-edge XANES were observed with increasing strain, suggesting a charge transfer from Ni to neighboring O species. The Ni L
 <sub>3,2</sub>-edge spectra, in turn, showed the white line with intensity gradually increasing upon induced strain. Both observations suggest a shift of the d-states energy, and an increasing number of d-state holes in Ni with increasing strain (

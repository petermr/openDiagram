<p id="Par39">An immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was conducted as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, the LUAD samples were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The primary antibody was that against TUBA1C (1:100 dilution; ab222849; abcam). The positive expression of TUBA1C was localized in cytoplasm. The scoring criteria for IHC staining were based on the intensity of the stain and the percentage of immunoreactive cells, as previously described [

<p>TREM1 is constitutively expressed by neutrophils and macrophages and its expression is further up-regulated by microbial components [

In addition, TREM1 can be secreted as a soluble form (sTREM1), and therefore it has been utilized as a diagnostic marker for inflammatory processes including infections. For instance, the presence of sTREM1 in samples from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from mechanically ventilated patients has been shown to be a good indicator of infectious pneumonia [

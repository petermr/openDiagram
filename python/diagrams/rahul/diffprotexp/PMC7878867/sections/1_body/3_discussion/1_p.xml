 </sup>. Exposure of abiotic stress (short or prolonged) is known to have transgenerational effects in the subsequent generation(s). The underlying mechanisms relies on stress memory, which can be defined as the genetic, epigenetic, structural and/or biochemical modifications that can affect how a plant responds to a subsequent stress episode

 </sup>. Most often, the stress memory, or imprint is beneficial to the plant, which makes it more tolerant (or more sensitive in certain cases) to future stress events in the same or subsequent generation(s)

 </sup>. In this context, stress acclimation training presents new opportunities for agricultural researchers and breeding programs to develop novel climate-smart crop varieties. To achieve this, we must first fully understand the consequences of transgenerational stress in the targeted crop germplasm.

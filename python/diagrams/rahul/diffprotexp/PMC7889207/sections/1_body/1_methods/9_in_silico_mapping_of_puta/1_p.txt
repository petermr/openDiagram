0: In silico analysis was performed to identify potential transcription factors that bind the regions spanning the six  Slc27a3 CpG sites investigated in this study.
1: The  Slc27a3 gene sequence containing the CpG island of interest was obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser ( https://genome.ucsc.edu/- Rat 5.0/rn5 assembly, accessed May 2020).
2: The transcription factor prediction software PROMO [ 17] was used to identify the putative transcription factors within this region.

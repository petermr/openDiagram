<p>Deionized water, dimethylformamide (DMF, AR), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP, AR) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB, AR) were employed as the solvents. Taking the deionized water as an example: 100 mg nitrated graphite was dispersed into 300 mL deionized water, and then was exfoliated by ultrasonic crusher under the power of 250 W for 9 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 2 h and the NGO with few layers remained in the supernatant. GO dispersion in these solvents were prepared in the same way. NGO and GO aqueous dispersions were dried in the vacuum freeze oven to obtain solid samples. The entire preparation process is shown in

<p>Engineering stress-strain curves for 0.10C-1.50Cr steels after different processes are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f009">Figure 9</xref>. Obvious yield points occurred in the stress-strain curve of 0.10C-1.50Cr steel after spheroidizing annealing, which could be attributed to dislocation accumulation on ferrite grain boundaries and dislocation activation in ferrite grains. The strength decreased, and the elongation increased after spheroidization annealing. This was mainly attributed to the spheroidization of lamellar cementite and the elimination of grain boundary network cementite. For the cold drawn steel, the tensile yield strength 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>y</sub>
 </italic> (at 0.2% offset) was high at 670 MPa, and the tensile strength (
 <italic>σ
  <sub>TS</sub>
 </italic>) was 740 MPa, while the steel after stress-relief annealing had 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>y</sub>
 </italic> of 600 MPa and 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>TS</sub>
 </italic> of 740 MPa. In contrast, the spheroidizing annealed steel had a relatively low 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>y</sub>
 </italic> of 340 MPa and 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>TS</sub>
 </italic> of 640 MPa, while the steel after recrystallization annealing had a medium 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>y</sub>
 </italic> of 470 MPa and 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>TS</sub>
 </italic> of 660 MPa. It is interesting to note that the elongation-to-failure (
 <italic>ε
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic>) increased considerably with decreasing 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>y</sub>
 </italic>. For example, for the cold drawn steel with the highest 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> at 670 MPa, the 
 <italic>ε
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> value was only 26%. However, for the cold rolled steel with a low 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>y</sub>
 </italic> of 565 MPa, the 
 <italic>ε
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> value significantly increased to 37% because of a decrease in dislocation density. In contrast, for the spheroidizing annealed steel with a low 
 <italic>σ
  <sub>y</sub>
 </italic> of 340 MPa, the highest 
 <italic>ε
  <sub>f</sub>
 </italic> of 48% was related to the reduction in the amount and size of large particles after spheroidizing annealing (

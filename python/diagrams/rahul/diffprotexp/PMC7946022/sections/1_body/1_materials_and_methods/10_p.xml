  <italic>In vitro</italic> evaluation of eDNA accumulation in single- and mixed-species biofilms
 </bold>. 24 hr-preformed single and mixed-species biofilms were grown as described above using 6-well microtiter plates and eDNA was quantified as previously described with modifications [
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, biofilm supernatant was aspirated and formed biofilms were harvested by scraping and resuspended in 1 ml PBS. Suspensions were centrifuged for 10 mins at 5000 g to separate cells and the soluble biofilm matrix and the recovered supernatant was filtered using 0.22 µm Millex syringe filters. The amount of eDNA was quantified using the QuantiFluor® dsDNA System kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as per manufacturers instructions. Fluorescence was measured at 504 nm/531 nm (Ex/Em) in triplicates per sample in flat-bottom black-sides 96-well plates (Greiner, Kremsmünster, Austria) using Biotek Cytation 5 plate reader.

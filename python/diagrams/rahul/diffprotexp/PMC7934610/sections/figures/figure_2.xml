 <caption>
  <p>Scatter chart of differential expression genes between groups. 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows differential expression genes between the CE-R and CE-NR groups. 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows differential expression genes between the CE-R and CK groups. 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> shows differential expression genes between the CE-NR and CK groups. 
   <italic>X</italic>-axis and 
   <italic>Y</italic>-axis presents two samples log2 value of gene expression, and the expression was calculated using the 
   <italic>RPKM</italic> method (reads per kilobase transcriptome per million mapped reads) as shown in section “Materials and methods”, red (up) and green (down) dots mean the gene has significant differences (FDR ≤ 0.001, two fold difference), and the blue dot means no significant differences.

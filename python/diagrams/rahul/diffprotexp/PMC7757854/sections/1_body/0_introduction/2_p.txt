0: Adipocyte differentiation is a dynamic process tightly regulated through a multistep process conserved across species [ 2].
1: The process involves temporal expression of various signalling cascades that regulate the expression of transcription factors and thereby pro-adipogenic genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPARG) [ 5, 6].
2: Adipocyte differentiation is characterized by significant changes to cell morphology  from a fibroblast to a rounded spherical form  and acquisition of functional characteristics of AT cells [ 7].
3: These properties are directed by the expression of PPARG, which is central to adipogenesis.
4: This receptor is encoded by  Pparg and cooperate with members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (CEBPs) family of transcription factors, specifically CEBP- (CEBPB), encoded by  Cebpb, and CEBP- (CEBPA), encoded by  Cebpa.
5: Several studies have demonstrated the interplay among these factors during adipocyte differentiation and in enhancing adipogenic cell fate [ 811].
6: Mechanistically, induction of CEBPB, at an early phase of adipogenesis, promotes induction of PPARG and CEBPA by binding to their proximal promoter regions.
7: Therefore, this results in activating several pro-adipogenic genes [ 1216] that support the progression of preadipocytes cells into mature adipocytes [ 11, 17].

0: Once the structures are adequately equilibrated, they are subjected to three axial and three shear deformations along the X, Y, and Z axes.
1: To apply axial tensile load, the CSH structures are subjected to uniform tensile strain in the X-direction, and the process is continued for Y and Z-directions.
2: Similarly, to simulate the shear loading in the CSH structures, a shear strain is applied along X, Y, and Z-directions, respectively.

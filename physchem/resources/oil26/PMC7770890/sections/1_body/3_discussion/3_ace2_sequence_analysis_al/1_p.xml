<p>Built on the fact that hACE2 is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, many previous studies only performed sequence analyses and used the sequence identity between animal ACE2 proteins and hACE2 to predict intermediate hosts,

Following the optimum sequence identity cutoffs, the ACE2 proteins of these New-World monkeys were predicted to be very effective receptors. However, in vivo infection studies showed

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>

 <italic>C. jacchus</italic> cannot be used by SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> In contrast, dogs, cats, and ferrets, which have a much lower sequence identity to hACE2 than the new-world monkeys (

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> These results suggest that an ACE2 protein with a higher sequence identity to hACE2 is not necessarily an effective receptor, whereas those with lower identities are not necessarily poor ones. Therefore, sequence identity between hACE2 and animal ACE2 may not be a good descriptor for host identification.

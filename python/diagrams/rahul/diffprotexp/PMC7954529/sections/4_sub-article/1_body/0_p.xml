<p>We thank all of the reviewers for their thoughtful comments on our manuscript. All of the reviewers suggested that we include more biological information to support the mechanistic trends that we describe in the paper. In response, we performed a number of gene set enrichment analyses and added the results to the manuscript and supplement. We also provided additional information about the species-specific PAS example gene, and the genes previously annotated as subject to directional selection. The reviewers also asked us to perform functional validation of our RNA-seq data. In early RNA sequencing papers, authors performed validation experiments with qPCR. We now know that results from functional high throughput sequencing analyses can be trusted provided the appropriate quality control measures are used (as is the case for our study). The main aim of this work was to establish a genome-wide census of APA events in human and chimps and to infer global mechanisms that underlie species specific APA. Thus, our conclusions are generally based on aggregated observations from many sites and are robust against false positives and false negative errors. Like the reviewers, we acknowledge the importance of functional follow-up on our results to understand the effect of APA differences on phenotypes. However, the editors have agreed that follow-up experiments are outside the scope of this manuscript. We believe this study opens the door for using a similar study design to understand APA conservation in more cell types and dynamic biological processes. We added a few sentences to the discussion to acknowledge this limitation and reaffirm the goals of the study. Please see below for specific responses and changes we have made to the manuscript.</p>

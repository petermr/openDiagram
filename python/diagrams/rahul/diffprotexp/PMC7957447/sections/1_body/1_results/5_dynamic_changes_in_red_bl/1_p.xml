<p id="Par15">Based on transcriptomic data, the erythrocyte differentiation pathway was up-regulated, which aroused our interest in RBC. Therefore, we analyzed RBC and Hb levels in critical patients during their hospitalization. Longitudinal regression showed that RBC counts in 11 critical non-survivors gradually declined over time, and Hb values were highly correlated with RBC counts (Fig.

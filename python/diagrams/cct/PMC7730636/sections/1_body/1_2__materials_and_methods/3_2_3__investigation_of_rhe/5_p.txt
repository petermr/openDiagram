0: The values of the geometric parameters of the sample before compression were  R0 = 5 mm and  h0 = 10 mm.
1: After compression, the average values of the geometric parameters were  R = 0.81 mm and  h = 5.93 mm.
2: Based on these parameters,  m = 0.358 and  C = 0.564 were determined.
3: Using these parameters and Equation (1), the values of the measured true stresses were corrected.

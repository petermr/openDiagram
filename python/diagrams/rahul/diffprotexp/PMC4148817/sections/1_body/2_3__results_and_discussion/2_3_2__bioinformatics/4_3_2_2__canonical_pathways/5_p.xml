<p>Telomeres are dynamic DNA-protein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes, preventing detrimental chromosome rearrangements and defending against genomic instability and the associated risk of cancer. Telomerase, also called telomere terminal transferase, prevents telomere shortening and has high activity in lung cancer cell lines [

This pathway is involved in the prevention of telomere degradation, chromosome clustering and apoptosis and inhibition may lead to the instability of chromosome and cell apoptosis. SWCNTs have been previously reported to inhibit telomerase activity through stabilization of i-motif structure eventually leading to telomere uncapping and displacement of telomere-binding proteins from the telomere, which triggers DNA damage [

<p>Similarly, from the 22 individual proteins upregulated at 120 hours, 16 and 9 were in the queen and worker larvae, respectively. Out of the 16 upregulated proteins in queen larvae, 6 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production (enolase, spots 42, phosphoglycerate mutase, spot 53, phosphoglycerate kinase, spot 60, ATP synthase beta subunit, spot 45, transketolase, spots 58, 59 and aldehyde dehydrogenase, spot 52, 54), 2 for metabolizing fatty acids and amino acids (long-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase, spots 51 and ornithine aminotransferase precursor, spot 55), 2 for antioxidant protein (Glutathione S transferase S1, spot 46, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, spot 47), 2 for development (Leonardo, spot 43 and imaginal disc growth factor 4, spot 56), 2 for protein folding (ERp60, spot 48) and heat shock protein 8, spot 49), 1 for transcription/translation (translational controlled tumor protein, spot 57) and 1 nutrition storage protein (larval serum protein 1, spots 44, 50) (

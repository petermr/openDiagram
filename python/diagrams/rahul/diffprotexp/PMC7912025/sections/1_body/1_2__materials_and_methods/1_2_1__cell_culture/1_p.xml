<p>Human small-airway epithelial cells (hSAECs) from a cadaveric donor were immortalized using human telomerase/CDK4, as previously described [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These non-oncogenic, telomerase-immortalized cells maintain genomic and proteomic signatures representative of primary SAECs over many population doublings [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. hSAECs were grown in small-airway epithelial cell growth medium (Lonza, cc-3118) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. For validation experiments, primary small-airway epithelial cells (pSAECs) were obtained from cadaveric donors (ATCC, PCS-301-010). Cells were grown in airway epithelial cell basal medium (ATCC, PCS-300-030) supplemented with a bronchial epithelial cell growth kit (PCS-300-040).

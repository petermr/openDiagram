0: Four proteins, apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A isoform 1 (EIF4G1), and Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein (AZGP1), were analyzed by Western blotting.
1: Each peritoneal dialysate sample (1  g/ L, 10  L) was electrophoresed through a precast gel (NuPAGE Novex 412% Bis-Tris Gel, 1.5 mm, 10 wells, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
2: Proteins were transferred from the gel to a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, CA, USA) by means of the semidry technique using the Criterion Blotter (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 60 min and blocked with 5% milk in PBS (adjusted to pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20.

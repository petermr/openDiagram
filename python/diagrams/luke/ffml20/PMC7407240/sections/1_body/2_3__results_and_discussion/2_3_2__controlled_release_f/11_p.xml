<p>For tetracycline hydrochloride, the conjugated trione system (involving the amide group) is responsible for pKa
 <sub>1</sub> = 3.3 [
 <xref rid="B52-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The weakly basic conjugated phenolic enone system becomes involved at pH = 7.3, owing for a 25% decrease in the value of the tetracycline diffusion coefficients, compared to pH = 3. The amino groups become ionized only at pH &gt; 8, which is well outside the pH thresholds for the human body.

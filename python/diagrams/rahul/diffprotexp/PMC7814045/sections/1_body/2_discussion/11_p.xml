<p id="Par28">Here we show that the exposure to acetic acid in yeast determines a differential usage of ribosomal protein paralogs, with an overexpression of mitoribosomal proteins. Although more in-depth analyses are required to confirm the compositional modifications at ribosome level, also to shed further light on the molecular mechanisms inducing the differential expression patterns among ohnologs, our analysis highlights that this phenomenon is also accompanied by rRNA modifications, mRNA decapping, affecting translation accuracy and putatively, triggering the synthesis of proteins involved in PCD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This scenario, here shown for the first time in yeast programmed cell death induced by acetic acid, suggests a possible overall translation reprogramming in eukaryotes cell death.

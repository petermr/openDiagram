<p>We explored NEA protein conservation by conducting searches for orthologs of 164 putatively NEA genes, using reciprocal-best-hit searching with BLAST. This cohort included 75 genes originally identified in mammals [
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41–45</xref>] and 89 proteins identified in 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The data returned from this procedure (supplementary data archive) were manually validated. All calls are conservative, with only orthologs detected with confidence deemed ‘found’. Our search included members of the Amorphea (comprising organisms belonging to Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa and Apusomonada supergroups), Archaeplastida (including a diversity of plants and members of Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta), Cryptista (represented by members of Cryptophyta), Excavata (flagellated organisms of biological and/or medical importance such as 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> and 
 <italic>Leishmania major</italic>), CZAR (which encompasses several major groups of algae, protozoa and seaweeds), Haptista (comprising haptophyte algae, represented in this work by the marine microalgae 
 <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>) and Hemimastigophora (an early-branching lineage of free living protozoa with two rows of flagella, represented here by 
 <italic>Hemimastix kukwesjijk</italic>) [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. All genomes were selected for quality in terms of predicted proteome coverage completeness (see Methods for data sources and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref> for taxonomic context).

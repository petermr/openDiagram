0: Cultured HCC cells were plated in six-well plates and transfected with CPSF1 plasmids or siRNAs.
1: Equal number of cells (1,000 cells) from each group was embedded in 2 mL of 0.35% agar solution and layered on top of 1.5 mL of 0.6% basal agar layer pre-coated in a six-well plate.
2: Fresh medium (200 L) was added every 3 days.
3: The plates were incubated at 37C with 5% CO 2 for 3 weeks.
4: Colony formation was determined by counting colonies larger than 50 m in 10 fields under the 4 magnification under a microscope.

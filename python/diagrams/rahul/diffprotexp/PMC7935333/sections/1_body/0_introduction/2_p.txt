0: During the last decades, the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer has been widely recognized.
1: The development and widespread application of high-throughput technologies, including microarray and RNA-sequencing, has provided a novel understanding of the molecular complexity of this disease.
2: 79 Several studies have demonstrated that TNBC cells express genes characteristic of normal basal/myoepithelial cells, such as  KRT5, KRT14, KRT17 and  EGFR.
3: 10, 11 Some molecular features of TNBC have been discovered, including a high frequency of  TP53 mutations, aberrant activation of PI3K pathway, inactivation of  BRCA1 and  BRCA2, RB1 loss, and cyclin E1 amplification.
4: 12 However, little is known about the etiological factors which promote the initiation and development of TNBC, and the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC are far from elucidated.

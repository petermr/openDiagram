<p id="Par10">Three sites were selected in three different biomes in South Africa, spanning a range of annual rainfall: Rietvlei Nature Reserve (c. 720 mm per annum; mesic grassland), Khamab Kalahari Reserve (c. 330 mm per annum; semi-arid savannah) and Tierberg Karoo Research Centre (c. 170 mm per annum; arid scrubland at the border of Succulent- and Nama Karoo, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (see ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup> for details on these biomes). Data from the arid scrubland and mesic grassland have previously been reported in a different context (see ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup>). Aardvark occur at all three sites and are the dominant medium-sized (i.e. c. 40–60 kg) burrowers across all sites (R. Marais; S. Milton; H. Kilian pers. comm.).

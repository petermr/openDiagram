<p id="p0225">Here we present clinically annotated RNA sequencing data for 95 human thyroid tumor biosamples corresponding to 17 follicular adenomas, 23 follicular, 51 papillary, 1 poorly differentiated, and 3 medullar thyroid cancers cases. These molecular data are fully compatible with the previously published ANTE database, which includes RNA sequencing profiles for healthy human tissues, including thyroid tissue [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The gene expression dataset is assembled in a machine-readable format and annotated by the available patientsâ€™ data, including type and histological subtype of thyroid tumor, sex, age, diagnosis, and 
 <italic>BRAF</italic> (V600E) mutation status and gene fusion status. This dataset will hopefully be useful to those interested in thyroid tumor biology, especially in the context of relevant data accumulation from different sources. The use of this material in further analytic investigations can make it possible to identify and validate thyroid tumor type-specific expression biomarkers.

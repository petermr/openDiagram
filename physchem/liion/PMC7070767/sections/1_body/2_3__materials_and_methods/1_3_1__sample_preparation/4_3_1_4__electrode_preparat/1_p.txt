0: For the preparation of Si-based anodes, we used powder silicon samples (S1, S2, and S3) mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and conductive carbon black (CB) in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).
1: The ratio applied was 60 wt-% of samples S1, S2, and S3, 20 wt-% of PVDF, and 20 wt-% of CB.
2: The prepared slurries were then spread onto aluminum foil current collector (20 m thick) using a Doctorblade coating machine for wet thickness of 200 m. The prepared electrode sheets were dried for 12 h at 60 C in vacuum.
3: Thereafter, circular electrodes with 16 mm diameter (A = 2 cm 2 ) were cut with an electrode punching tool and placed in a vacuum oven over night at 50 C. The typical loading of composite electrode material was 12 mg.
4: Figure 13 shows prepared electrodes with associated coffee bag batteries.

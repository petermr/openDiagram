<p>Volcano plots analysis of the effect of each treatment relative to vehicle controls in females (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>) or males (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref>) revealed unique changes in gene expression. Next, we performed gene set analysis to identify genes uniquely up- or downregulated by each treatment, as well as differentially expressed genes shared among treatments, within each sex. We found that raloxifene is the most potent modulator of gene expression in the female spinal cord, with 3391 and 3535 genes up- or downregulated, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Estrogen and tamoxifen also affected gene expression, but to a much lower extent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In males, we found that estrogen has the most potent effect on gene expression as it upregulates 2181 and downregulates 1964 genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), while tamoxifen and raloxifene have essentially no effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

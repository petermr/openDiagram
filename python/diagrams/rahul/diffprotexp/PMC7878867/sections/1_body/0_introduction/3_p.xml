 </sup>. Small RNAs, mainly microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), can precisely reprogram the expression of stress- or development-related genes through post-transcriptional gene silencing
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Compared with other epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, sRNAs can quickly respond to various environmental and developmental cues, and act as mobile signalling molecules to modulate the expression level of their target genes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. In particular, the biological functions of many miRNA families in regulating important reproductive, agronomic and physiological traits have been described in several studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Research has shown that plant miRNA-mediated pathways can participate in stress memory to facilitate the adaptation to recurring stress
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. In our previous research, we discovered that in durum wheat, water-deficit and heat stress imposed on the parents during reproduction had negative effects on seed germination and seedling vigour in the progeny, but to a lesser extent in the stress-tolerant genotype
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Significant differences in miRNA expression was observed between stress-tolerant and stress-sensitive genotypes under the effects of transgenerational stress. The biological functions of differentially expressed miRNA modules are related with signalling pathways in stress adaptation and plant development, which could contribute to the phenotypic differences observed in the seedlings
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. However, there has been no investigation of the miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules in progeny exposed to water-deficit stress during reproduction to study the association between gene networks and the physiological/yield traits under the effects of transgenerational water-deficit stress.

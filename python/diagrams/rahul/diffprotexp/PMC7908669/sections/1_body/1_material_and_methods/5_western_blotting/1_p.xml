<p id="Par13">Total protein samples were extracted from cultured BMSCs using the Total Protein Extraction kit (#C006225-0050; Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. Approximately 30 μg of protein was then boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes The membranes were subsequently blocked in 5% lipid-free milk solution, incubated with diluted primary antibodies, washed three times with TBST solution, and incubated with diluted secondary antibodies. Finally, the PVDF membranes were developed with the EasyBlot ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) kit (#D601039-0050; Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At least three biological replicates were conducted for protein quantitation, and GAPDH was used as an internal standard. The antibodies used in the present study included anti-ALP (#ab229126; Abcam), anti-osteopontin (OPN) (#ab8448; Abcam), anti-runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) (#12556; CST), anti-GAPDH (#ab181602; Abcam), and anti-growth arrest-specific gene 1 (GAS1) (#ab236618; Abcam).</p>

<p id="Par37">Around 60% of the differential splicing events in Kasumi-1 cells cannot be explained by proximal RUNX1/RUNX1T1 binding indicating that they are not under direct control of the fusion protein. However, we and others have previously shown that t(8;21)-positive leukemia cells have a specific signature of genes encoding splicing factors and mRNA surveillance genes expression that may affect splicing patterns and abundance of RNA isoforms

 </sup>. This signature is so unique that it allows distinguishing leukemic from normal hematopoietic cells (Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>). Furthermore, RUNX1/RUNX1T1 binding sites were often present within the genes encoding splicing-associated factors or in their immediate vicinity (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that RUNX1/RUNX1T1-dependent changes in expression of RNA processing genes may be responsible for differential splicing events in Kasumi-1 cells.

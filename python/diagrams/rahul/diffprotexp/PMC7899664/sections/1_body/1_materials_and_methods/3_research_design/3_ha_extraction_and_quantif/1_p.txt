0: Mouse skin samples were weighed and homogenized in freshly made, pH optimized lysis buffer comprised of 0.15 M Tris base, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M CaCl 2, 5 mM deferoxamine, and 20 U/ml  Streptomyces griseus protease (Sigma) in a ratio of 15 l buffer per 1 mg of tissue.
1: Each sample was digested at 55 C for 16 hours on a shaker at 1400 rpm.
2: To stop digestion, the protease was denatured on a hot plate at 95 C for 1015 minutes.
3: The supernatant was collected from each tissue sample.
4: HA quantification in skin and serum samples was then performed using an ELISA-like sandwich protein binding assay as per the commercial manufacturer's instructions (Corgenix).
5: Briefly, the assay uses microwells coated with highly specific HA binding proetin (HABP) to capture HA from the test samples.
6: 50 l of the samples or standards were pipetted into the HABP coated microwells and incubated for 1 hr, and an enzyme conjugated version of HABP was used to detect HA.
7: The absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader and optical density was blanked against reagent reference.
8: HA concentration in the samples was measured by comparing absorbance againt standard curve.
9: The HA values were normalized to total protein determined from the undigested homogenate using Coomassie plus assay.

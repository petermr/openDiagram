<p>With respect to the biofilm formation capacities, bacteria expressing AAF/I were not or much less efficient in biofilm formation on PVC (especially prominent at 37Â°C), compared to the closely related AAF/III and AAF/V-expressing strains, which formed intermediate biofilms in a temperature-dependent manner. In contrast, high biofilm formation was observed with bacteria expressing AAF/IV, which is supported by the fact that also wild type EAEC isolates encoding this cluster were described to adhere quite strongly to glass surfaces and to form strong biofilms [

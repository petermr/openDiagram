<p>Principal component analyses (PCA) were carried out for the assessment of the diagnostic potential of subtype-specific DIPs using the expression values of genes encoding the DIPs which had the secretion levels in body fluids. The simulations were performed using the gene expression data of tumor samples of ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC datasets for each subtype-specific DIPs, separately.</p>

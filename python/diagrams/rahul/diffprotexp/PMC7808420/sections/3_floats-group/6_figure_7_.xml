    <sup>−/-</sup> glial cells are more susceptible to SLEV infection and respond with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines
   </bold>. Mouse mixed glial cell cultures were prepared from the brains of WT and ABR
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice and infected with SLEV at a MOI of 0.1 or incubated with medium (NI). Supernatant samples were collected at 24–96 h p.i. for assessment of SLEV load by plaque assay (a) and for the release of proinflammatory cytokines CCL5 (b), IL-6 (c) and IL-1β (d), by ELISA. Results are expressed as mean plus SEM and are representative of two experiments (N = 6–8). NI = not infected, incubated with medium

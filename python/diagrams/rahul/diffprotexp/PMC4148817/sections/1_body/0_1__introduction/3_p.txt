0: A primary route for nanoparticle uptake in humans is through the airways, and high concentrations of carbon nanoparticles are known to cause oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and granuloma formation in respiratory epithelia [ 6].
1: Calu-3 is one of the airway cell lines commonly used for bronchial epithelial cell studies.The serous cells, of which Calu-3 are a model, are a major source of airway surface liquid, mucins and immunologically active substances [ 7].
2: Mucus protects the epithelium from infection and chemical damage by binding to inhaled microorganisms and particles that are subsequently removed by the mucociliary escalator system.
3: Bronchial secretion and mucociliary clearance (MCC) are critical components of the innate immune response to remove inhaled pathogens and particulates.

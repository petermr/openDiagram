  <p>KEGG pathway classification of stress-responsive miRNA-miRNA regulatory modules. Down-regulated, mRNA targets were less abundant in the water-deficit stress treated progeny. Up-regulated, mRNA targets were more abundant in the water-deficit stress treated progeny. The treatment groups are: AtCC (DBA Artemis control group parents, progeny treated with control), AtCW (DBA Artemis control group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress), AtWC (DBA Artemis water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with control), AtWW (DBA Artemis water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress). _L represents flag leaf libraries, _G represents developing grain libraries.</p>

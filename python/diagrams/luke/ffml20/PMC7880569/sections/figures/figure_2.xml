  <p>Gravimetrically derived water loadings on (a) AcidBir (59.2 m
   <sup>2</sup>/g) and (b) δ-MnO
   <sub>2</sub> (204 m
   <sup>2</sup>/g), collected as adsorption (closed symbols) and desorption (open symbols) isotherms at 25 °C. Loadings are shown in terms of bound water molecules per unit cell (H
   <sub>2</sub>O/UC) and birnessite mass-normalized (left ordinate axis) mass of H
   <sub>2</sub>O (mg/g). Lines (see labels) are predictions of water binding during the adsorption (full) and desorption (dashed) leg of the data collection and generated using the composition 
   <italic>adsorption–condensation–intercalation</italic> model of this study. The orange line in (a) and the blue line in (b) show the sum of internally and externally bound water to the basal faces of birnessite.

0: The clean reads were aligned to the miRNA precursor/mature miRNA of  Ovis aries in miRBase 21.0 ( http://www.mirbase.org/ftp.shtml) to identify the sequences and counts of miRNAs observed in the samples.
1: The characteristics of hairpin structures of miRNA precursors were used to predict novel miRNAs.
2: Milarepa v0.2 ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/mireap/) was used to analyze the unannotated reads.

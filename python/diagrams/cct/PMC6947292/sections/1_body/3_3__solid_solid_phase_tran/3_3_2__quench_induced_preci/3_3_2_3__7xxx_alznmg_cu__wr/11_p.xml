<p>In general, it is found that the AlZnMgCu series should be considered very quench sensitive. This is reasonable, as these alloys typically contain the highest concentration of alloying elements amongst the age-hardening Al alloys. However, there are indications that small additions of Ge and Ag might reduce the quench sensitivity of 7xxx alloys [

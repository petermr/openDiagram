<p>With increasing number of layers, the difference in hardness becomes smaller. From a distance to the substrate of approximately 20 mm a mean hardness of 180 HV1 can be observed for a CTWD of 44 mm. A decreased CTWD of 12 mm led to mean hardness values of approximately 168 HV1. These values can be measured with little deviation throughout the additively manufactured structure to a distance from the substrate of 102 mm (CTWD = 12 mm) respectively 126 mm (CTWD = 44 mm). The values correspond to the shown cross sections of the 35th layer (compare

<p>The clean data were used to calculate the distribution of reads on reference genes and perform coverage analysis. Gene coverage was calculated as the percentage of a gene covered by reads. This value is equal to the ratio of the base number in a gene covered by unique mapping reads to the total base number of that gene by the SAMtools program.</p>

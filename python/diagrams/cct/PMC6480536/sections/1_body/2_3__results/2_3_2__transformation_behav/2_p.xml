<p>A series of in situ micrographs taken by LSCM during sample cooling is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Inclusion particles appear as small black dots in the LSCM micrographs. Ferrite transformation always occurred first at the austenite grain boundaries in all the test samples. Acicular ferrite plates were observed to nucleate on the intragranular inclusions during cooling. Besides, acicular ferrite lath could also form on the surface of the pre-existing ferrite lath. It is possible that the newly formed acicular ferrite was sympathetically nucleated on the broad face of pre-formed acicular ferrite. The average sizes of prior austenite grains after 3 min holding at peak temperatures were measured with the linear intercept method. In situ micrographs with magnifications of ×200 and ×100 were used for samples with austenitization temperatures at 1000–1200 °C and 1300–1400 °C, respectively. The result is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f006">Figure 6</xref>a. It shows that the average size of the austenite grains increased from 53 μm to 189 μm when the peak temperature increased from 1000 °C to 1400 °C. Babu et al. reported that acicular ferrite nucleates at non-metallic inclusions and grows within prior austenite grains competing with the growth of Widmanstätten ferrite and bainite, which nucleate at grain boundaries [

By contrast, acicular ferrite forming intragranularly was significantly improved at higher austenitizing temperatures of 1200–1400 °C. This indicates that a high temperature contributes to inclusion-induced nucleation, which is consistent with the result in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f003">Figure 3</xref>. In addition, the austenitizing temperature also influenced the transformation temperatures during cooling, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. The formation of acicular ferrite tended to raise the transformation temperature. For the 1400 °C austenitized sample, AF transformation was completed in the range of 660–561 °C. The effect of the austenitizing temperature on AF transformation lies not only in its influence on austenite grain size but also on the diffusion of manganese atoms, which may affect the development of Mn-depleted zone [

0: The miRCat tool in the sRNA Toolkit package was used to predict novel miRNAs.
1: The signature microarray structure of microRNA precursors could be used to forecast new microRNAs.
2: After comparing the unanalyzed reads in the annotations (the sample name was _unannotated.csv) with the rat genome, the sequence was initially determined as a candidate for new microRNA through the folding model when it was located on the stem-loop structure.

 <caption> CPSF1 knockdown induced differential expression of transcripts. (A) A volcano plot illustrates the expression of transcripts following the silencing CPSF1 in HepG2.2.15 cells. Up- and downregulated transcripts are highlighted as red and blue dots, respectively. Barplots showing the top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways (B) and GO biological processes (C) identified by the gene set analysis using DAVID. (D) List of top 10 representative genes down- or upregulated following CPSF1 silencing is presented. </caption>

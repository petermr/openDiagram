Each ml of <italic>D.kotschyi</italic> oil weights 0.68 g. 300 ml oil is dissolved in 300 &#956;l DMSO solution and then using a nutrient solution MHB, the volume is increased to 1000 &#956;l and spin and vortex for 5 minutes (2000 rpm) so that a stock with a concentration of 20480 &#956;g/m1 is prepared and then by serial dilution in nutrient medium MHB the concentrations of 20 to 5120 &#956;g/m1 oil are prepared in the wells. The final DMSO concentration was 5% (v/v), and this solution was selected as a negative control.</p>

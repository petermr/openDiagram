<p id="Par27">DTT was added to 200 μg of protein solution collected from each sample to reach a final concentration of 100 mM, and the samples were incubated in a water bath at 100 °C for 5 min. UA buffer (200 μL) was then added, and the samples were mixed and transferred to a 30 kD ultrafiltration centrifuge tube. The samples were centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 25 min, and the filtrate was discarded (this step was repeated twice). IAA buffer (100 μL; 100 mM IAA in UA) was then added, and the samples were shaken at 600 rpm for 1 min. The samples were allowed to react at room temperature for 30 min in the dark and then centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 25 min. UA buffer (100 μL) was then added, and the samples were centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 15 min (this step was repeated twice). Then, 40 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>3</sub> (100 μL) was added, and the samples were centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 15 min (this step was repeated twice). Trypsin buffer (40 μL; 4 μg of trypsin in 40 μL of 40 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>3</sub>) was then added, and the samples were shaken at 600 rpm for 1 min and placed at 37 °C for 16–18 h. The collection tube was replaced, and the samples were centrifuged at 12,500×g for 15 min followed by the addition of 20 μL of 40 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>3</sub> and centrifugation at 12,500×g for 15 min to collect the filtrate. A C18 cartridge was used to desalt the peptides. After the peptides were dried, they were reconstituted with 40 μL of 0.1% formic acid solution.

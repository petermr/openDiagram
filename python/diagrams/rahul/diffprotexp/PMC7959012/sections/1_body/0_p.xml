<p>Myopia is a very common eye condition that is rapidly increasing in occurrence. It is the most common eye disease in teenagers [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and uncorrected ametropia is the main cause of moderate or severe visual impairment in people aged 50 years and above [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is estimated that the number of patients with myopia will reach 4.758 billion by 2050, accounting for 49.8% of the global population [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The severity of a patient’s myopia is also associated with increased risk of visual impairment due to macular degeneration, cataracts, retinal detachment, and glaucoma caused by high myopia [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A decreased visual function in the early stage of myopia [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has also been noted, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Due to the existence of a large number of genes that affect biological function, retinal pigmental epithelium (RPE) single-cell captured ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing technology was adopted to explore the molecular mechanism of RPE cell apoptosis in myopia and provide a theoretical basis for clinical guidance aimed at protecting early visual function in myopic patients.

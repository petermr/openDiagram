0: AcidBir was prepared by the dropwise addition of 166 mL of 12 M HCl to a vigorously stirred 2.5 L solution of 0.4 M KMnO 4 kept in a water bath at 90 C. 16 The resulting solution was reacted for an additional 10 min after completion of the titration.
1: The precipitate was then washed with ultrapure water by repeated cycles of centrifugation/decantation until the conductivity was close to 0 S/cm.
2: -MnO 2 was, in contrast, prepared by adding an 80 mL solution of 0.1 M KMnO 4 and a 160 mL solution of 0.1 M KOH to 1640 mL of ultrapure water at 25 C. An aliquot of 120 mL of a 0.1 M MnCl 2 solution was thereafter added dropwise to this solution under vigorous stirring.
3: All synthesis procedures were carried out in polypropylene bottles, and all washed precipitates were stored as aqueous suspensions in polyethylene bottles at 4 C for a 2 month period prior the onset of this work.

0: A PPI network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was constructed with the STRING database ( http://www.string-db.org) followed by visualization with the Cytoscape software (version 3.6.0, Washington, DC, USA) ( http://www.cytoscape.org/).
1: The degree of nodes was determined with the plug-in Network Analysis app on the Cytoscape software.
2: Gene interaction network models were constructed with the Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BIOGRID;  https://www.thebiogrid.org/) database followed by visualization of DEGs with the Cytoscape software.

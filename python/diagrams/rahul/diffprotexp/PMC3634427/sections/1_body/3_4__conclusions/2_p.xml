<p>One of the earliest responses to abiotic stresses and the inhibition of growth is the inhibition of protein synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b96-ijms-14-04912">96</xref>]. Our results are consistent with the expected general changes under abiotic stress conditions. The inhibition of carbon metabolism and oxidative homeostasis appears to be a general response for all the stress treatments used and in both species. Furthermore, the differences between 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> and Désirée are reflected in protein metabolism; the sucrose and sorbitol treatments induce more changes in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic>, whereas cold affects more Désirée. Moreover, we found a lipid metabolism-related protein, patatin, that only increased in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> when treated with osmotic stress. This glycoprotein appears to have a role in Ca-dependent plant signal transduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85-ijms-14-04912">85</xref>]; our results are consistent with this concept, especially when considering the variation of differential abundant proteins related to protein metabolism in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> under osmotic stress conditions. They suggest that patatin might have a more important role in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> than in Désirée.

<p id="Par17">In this study, we obtained previously published RNA-seq data representing six transcriptomes from the GEO database (ID: GSE99749). Two sows (Tibetan pigs (TP) &amp; Yorkshire pigs (LW)) used for RNA-seq were raised in the Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College Farm, under the same dietary and drinking water standards. Animal care and all experimentation were conducted in accordance with the guidelines pre-approved by the Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College Farm Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All samples were taken from longissimus dorsi muscle tissue of the embryo as described by Shang et al

 </sup>. Divided into two groups (Tibetan pigs (TP) &amp; Yorkshire pigs (LW)) according to breed. After 60Â days of fertilization, each group randomly selected a pregnant sow and randomly took out nine embryo samples. The nine embryonic samples were randomly divided into three parts, each part as a biological replicate (each RNA library contains an equimolar ratio of RNA from the three samples.), and each group contains three biological replicates. The pig gene annotations were downloaded from

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The ZOI, MIC, and MBC values of the essential oil from <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>. The results showed that the essential oil had a satisfactory antibacterial activity on all of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The ZOI values of the essential oil were in the range of 10.5&#8211;24.4&#8201;mm for all tested bacterial strains, respectively. The MIC and MBC values for tested bacterial strains were in the range of 10&#8211;40&#8201;mg/mL and 20&#8211;40&#8201;mg/mL, respectively. Unfortunately, the MIC and MBC values of the essential oil for <italic>E. coli</italic> have not been gained when the concentration of essential oil reached the maximum in method system tested. Of these bacteria, the essential oil performed both a minimum MIC of 10&#8201;mg/mL and a minimum MBC of 20&#8201;mg/mL against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which indicated it was the most effective bacterial inhibitor and bactericide against <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. On the whole, the Gram positive bacteria were more sensitive than the Gram-negative ones to the essential oil from <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). To some extent, these results were consistent with previous studies on antibacterial activity of <italic>C. rotundus</italic> essential oils<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, which was likely due to the significant differences in the outer layers of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance of Gram-negative bacteria against essential oils is attributed the presence of a hydrophilic outer membrane which possess hydrophilic polysaccharide chain as a barrier hydrophobic essential oil<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p>

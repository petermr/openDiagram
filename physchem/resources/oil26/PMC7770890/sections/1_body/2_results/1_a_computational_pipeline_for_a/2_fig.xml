<fig xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A computational pipeline
for ACE2 usage analysis. 321 ACE2 orthologs
were downloaded from NCBI. The crystal structure of the hACE2/S-RBD
complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) was used as a template for homology modeling. For each ACE2/S-RBD
pair, 100 initial Modeller complex models were constructed and repacked
by FASPR, and then five models were generated by EvoEF2/SAMC remodeling
for each FASPR model. The binding energy cutoff (<italic>E</italic><sub>cutoff</sub>) was set to &#8722;47 EvoEF2 energy units.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr0c00717_0001" id="gr1" position="float"/></fig>

<italic>v</italic>) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The solutions were heated in a water bath at 100 &#176;C for 15 min to develop the pink coloured malondialdehyde&#8211;thiobarbituric acid adduct. After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm against an appropriate blank solution. The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).

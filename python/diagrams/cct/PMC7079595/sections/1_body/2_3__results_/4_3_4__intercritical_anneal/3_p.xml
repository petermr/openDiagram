<p>On the other hand, annealing at 700 Â°C ensures enough stability for the austenite to preserve it to room temperature. Thus, regardless of the increased annealing time from 1 to 2 and 5 h, there is no sign of martensite formation during cooling (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,b), which proves the high stability of austenite. It has to be highlighted that a longer time should allow manganese to diffuse between ferrite and austenite, further increasing its stability.

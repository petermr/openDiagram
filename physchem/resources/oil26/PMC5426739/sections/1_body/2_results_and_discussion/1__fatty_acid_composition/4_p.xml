A suitable intake of the essential fatty acids is very important in daily diet. According to the literature, the optimal ratio of &#969;<sub>6</sub>:&#969;<sub>3</sub> is reported to range from 1:1 to 4:1.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The ratio of &#969;<sub>6</sub>:&#969;<sub>3</sub> in olive, sesame and flaxseed oils were 9.5:1, 50.1:1 and 0.22:1, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This result shows that olive and sesame oils do not have optimal &#969;<sub>6</sub>:&#969;<sub>3</sub> ratios. Therefore, consumers should have other &#969;<sub>3</sub> rich oils in their diet for long term usage.</p>

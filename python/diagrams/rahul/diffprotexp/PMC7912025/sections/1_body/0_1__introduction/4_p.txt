0: The genomic response of RSV-infected airway epithelial cells has been studied systematically using high-density microarrays [ 2, 16] and short-read RNA sequencing [ 17] to identify time-dependent, replication-sensitive [ 18], and NFB-controlled gene expression programs [ 16, 19].
1: Although these studies have provided information at the gene expression level, mRNA-processing events, including alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA), are recognized to generate transcriptome complexity and proteome diversity.
2: These events have been underexplored due to technical limitations in full-length mRNA sequencing.
3: Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts now enables the identification of differentially processed mRNAs and opens the door for understanding transcriptome diversity in normal and cellular stress responses.

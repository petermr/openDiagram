<p>The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase are markers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; elevated total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA (fPSA) and decreased tPSA/fPSA indicate prostate cancer [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We demonstrated a significant downregulation of PSA in metastatic lung cancer urine relative to nontransfer of lung cancer. Neutrophil defensin 1 protein is important in the neutrophil defense system and has antitumor effects [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In advanced metastatic lung cancer, the metabolism and activity of the tumor are increased, and neutrophil defensin 1 is part of its defense system. Thus, neutrophil defensin 1 can be used as an indicator of cancer prognosis.

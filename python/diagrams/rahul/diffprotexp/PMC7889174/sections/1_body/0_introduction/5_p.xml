<p>The nucleus facilitates separation of transcription and mRNA processing from translation and in modern eukaryotes a considerable machinery is devoted toward securing accurate mRNA processing prior to export from the nucleus [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Much of the apparatus is conserved, indicating ancient origins and a central requirement to minimize accumulation of aberrant proteins. Separation of translation and transcription enabled evolution of mRNA splicing, allowing greater functional diversity to be extracted from essentially the same coding sequences and providing additional mechanisms for controlling gene expression. Further complexity of gene regulation then arises from the development of sophisticated genome packaging that allows formation of eu- and heterochromatin and, further, to chromosomal territories and complex spatial genome organization. Some nuclear functions are potentially very ancient and are likely repurposed components from preexisting systems, for example, the ESCRT system involved in NE repair likely originated as a cytokinesis system in Archaea [

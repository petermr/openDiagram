Based on the high content of linolenic acid in flaxseed oil, which is about 50 times higher than olive and sesame oils (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), addition of flaxseed oil to sesame and olive oil mixtures caused an effective decrease in &#969;<sub>6</sub>:&#969;<sub>3</sub> ratio (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which is very important from nutritional prospective. Therefore, blending flaxseed oil with other vegetable oils which are low in &#969;<sub>3</sub> fatty acid can change their fatty acid composition and increase &#969;<sub>3</sub> fatty acid content. Samples containing 10% and 15% flaxseed have optimal levels of &#969;<sub>6</sub>:&#969;<sub>3</sub> ratio as stated in the literature for better health achievement (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>

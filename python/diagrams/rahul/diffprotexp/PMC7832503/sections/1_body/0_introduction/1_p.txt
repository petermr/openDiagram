0: In April 2009, a novel influenza A(H1N1) virus [A(H1N1)pdm09] was recognized and quickly spread around the world.
1: By June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the start of the first twenty-first century influenza pandemic [ 1].
2: It was estimated that there were 123,000203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths globally in the last 9 months of 2009, which was 10-fold higher than the laboratory-confirmed mortality count from WHO [ 2].
3: In contrast to seasonal influenza virus, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus sustained a substantially higher human-to-human transmissibility [ 3] and caused more severe morbidity and mortality in children and young adults [ 1].
4: Some influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected patients required hospitalization because of the unusually severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which was different from typical influenza symptoms [ 4].
5: To date, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus still posed a threat to public health.
6: Moreover, disease severity has the potential to alter, especially if virus mutation occur [ 5, 6].

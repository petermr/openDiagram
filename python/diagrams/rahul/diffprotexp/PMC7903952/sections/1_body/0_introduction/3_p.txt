0: Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent of the imidazoline series, is a first-line chemotherapy drug in clinical treatment of malignant gliomas.
1: After oral administration, it is absorbed rapidly and enters the cerebrospinal fluid through the blood-brain barrier, reaching an effective blood drug concentration in the central nervous system.
2: 13 However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment.
3: 14 Some researchers found that certain lncRNAs such as SNHG15, NCK1-AS1 and MALAT1 could affect the sensitivity of glioma cells to TMZ chemotherapy.
4: 13, 15, 16 However, the roles of other lncRNAs in pathogenesis and TMA resistance of glioma are still unclear.

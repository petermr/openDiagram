 <caption> Changes in protein abundance in response to carbon nanotube exposure. The bars depict the number of proteins whose expression was increased (above 0) or decreased (below 0) over controls in response to 24 h exposure to carbon nanotubes at the concentrations listed on the figure. Actual numbers of proteins whose abundance are altered are also shown on the graph. Protein expression data filtered by ANOVA p &lt; 0.01 and Pairwise Multiple Comparison p &lt; 0.05 of different CNTs (SWCNT, MWCNT) and concentrations (10 Î¼g/mL, 100 ng/mL). </caption>

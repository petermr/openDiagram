<p>The association between APA and tumor progression has been broadly validated in many tumor types, including breast cancer (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen X. et al., 2018</xref>). TCGA datasets also validated that HCC contains many abnormal APA events. However, little attention has been paid to the generation of these APA events during hepatocarcinogenesis. In HCC, the CPA complex, NUDT21 (also known as CPSF5 or CFIm25), has been reported to be a tumor suppressor that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by regulating APA (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). A zebrafish liver tumor model supported that poorly differentiated tumors had lower expression of liver-specific genes but high expression of genes involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, including CPSF1 (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lam and Gong, 2006</xref>). In the present study, we identified 43 transcripts with altered 3â€² UTR following knockdown of CPSF1 in HCC HepG2.2.15 cell line. Among these, 36 shortened and seven lengthened transcripts were identified, indicating that CPSF1 was essential for the selection of distal polyadenylation sites compared to proximal polyadenylation sites.

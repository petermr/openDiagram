<p id="Par8">Further we assessed the correlation of expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN in PFC and NAc (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Positive correlations were observed between the expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN of controls in PFC (r = 0.585, p = 0.004) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), patients with schizophrenia in PFC (r = 0.645, p = 0.002) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) and NAc (r = 0.550, p = 0.010) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The ratio of these two proteins in each sample were compared between the diagnostic groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,d</xref>). In PFC, the ratio of DARPP-32/CaN in each sample were significantly low in schizophrenia patients compared to controls (t [29.72] = 4.45, p = 1.12e-4) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), but no changes were observed in NAc (t [33.71] = −0.185, p = 0.854) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

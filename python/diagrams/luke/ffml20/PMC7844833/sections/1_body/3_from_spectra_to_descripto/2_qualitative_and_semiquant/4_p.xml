<p>In the absence of accurate theoretical models, the interpretation of XANES spectra often relies on semiempirical relationships. As the most important material descriptors that can be extracted from XANES data, one usually considers: (i) the position of the absorption edge, (ii) the intensity of the white line, and (iii) the presence and intensity of the pre-edge features.</p>

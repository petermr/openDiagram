Bacteria selction was made based on their relevance as food contaminants. Their potency was qualitatively and quantitatively determined from the diameters of the inhibition zones (DDs), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

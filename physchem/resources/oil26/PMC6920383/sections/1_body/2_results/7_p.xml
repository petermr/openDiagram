<p id="Par24">Burrowing lowered soil compaction significantly in both the mesic grassland (ANOVA: Chi
 <sup>2</sup> = 25.62, p &lt; 0.001) and the semi-arid savannah (Chi

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.7</xref>). Impacted area soils were also less compact than soils at the control plots in the mesic grassland, but were more compact in the semi-arid savannah. In contrast, in the arid scrubland there were no significant differences in soil compaction between the microsites (Chi
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.40, p &gt; 0.1, Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.7</xref>). Burrow age class did not significantly affect soil temperature, moisture or compaction at any of the study sites (Supplementary Table

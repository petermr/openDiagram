0: The adsorption isotherms of DOX on modified MWCNTs at 298 K were determined using three liquid phases: (I) the aqueous solution of DOX 1 mg mL 1, (II) the suspension of modified MWCNTs in water 1 mg mL 1, and (III) PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH = 7.4).
1: The experiment involved the preparation of mixtures of these liquid phases, with always the same volume of modified MWCNTs suspension of 300 L. The volume of DOX aqueous solution varied between 0 (blank) and 2400 L, and the volume of PBS varied between 4200 and 1800 L. The total volume of these three phases was always of 4500 L. The mixtures were shaken for 24 h. Then, the carbon nanotubes were separated from the suspension via centrifugation.
2: The concentration of DOX was determined via the spectrophotometric standard curve method.
3: The adsorbed amount of drug per unit weight of adsorbent-modified and nonmodified MWCNTs (mg g 1) at equilibrium was calculated according to Equation (1) [ 69]: (9)qe=VC0Cem where  m (g) is the mass of nanotubes,  V (mL) is the total solution volume,  C0 and  C  e mg mL 1 represent the initial and equilibrium concentrations of DOX, respectively.

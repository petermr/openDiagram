<p>Among other monometallic catalysts for CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR, Pd-based catalysts attract attention due to the possibility to generate simultaneously CO and H
 <sub>2</sub> with tunable ratio, which is important to convert CO
 <sub>2</sub> to valuable syngas.

 </sup> The peculiarity of Pd lies in its ability to absorb hydrogen within the Pd crystal lattice and to form different active phases such as hydrides and carbides at ambient conditions.

 </sup> The formation of hydrides changes the catalyst selectivity and can be used to tune the catalyst properties. For example, Sheng et al. correlated the formation of Î²-hydride, as detected by Pd K-edge XANES and EXAFS analysis, with a decrease in the adsorption energies for CO and H, and the consequent changes in the catalyst selectivity toward the simultaneous production of H
 <sub>2</sub> and CO under CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions.

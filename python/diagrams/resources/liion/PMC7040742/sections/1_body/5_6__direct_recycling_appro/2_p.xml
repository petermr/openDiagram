<p>Different methods have been developed with varying degrees of success. The methods may involve physical separation of active material from other components, washing of PVDF binder, thermal treatment, lithium replenishment of the active material, and final thermal treatment step.

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Supplementary Information</xref> summarizes the process and reagent schemes, specifies the types of batteries treated, and gives values of key process parameters. Where available, the capacity of refreshed material is also provided. Note that parameters of cycling and, more particularly, details of the protocol followed for button cell fabrication are rarely specified in publications despite their high influence on the capacity of cells. Therefore, comparison with each process becomes difficult.

0: The cytotoxicity assay detected the reduction of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] by mitochondrial dehydrogenase to the formazan blue product, which is a reflection of the normal mitochondrial functioning and cell viability (Lau et al., 2004).
1: Briefly, the cells (5 10 4) were seeded in wells containing 100 l of the RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a 96-well plate.
2: After 24 hours of adhesion, different concentrations of the essential oils were added to triplicate wells over the range of 5120 to 20 g/m1.
3: After 2 days, 10 l of MTT (5 mg/ml stock solution) was added and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 hours.
4: The medium was discarded, and the formazan blue formed in the cells was dissolved with 100 l of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).
5: Quantification of formazan was performed using an ELISA microplate reader (SLT, Austria) at 490 nm.
6: The cell viability curves were calculated with regard to the control cells.
7: Cytotoxicity was expressed as the concentration of drug inhibiting cell growth by 50% (IC50).
8: All tests and analyses were run in triplicate, and the mean values were recorded.

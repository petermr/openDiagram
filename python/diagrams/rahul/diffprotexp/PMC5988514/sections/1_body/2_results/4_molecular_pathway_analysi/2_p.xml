<p id="par0100">Differentially expressed proteins in CV-PTC (n = 25, FDR p-value &lt;0.0005) were further investigated using STRING database to establish known and predicted protein interactions. These interactions indicated enrichment of actin cytokeleton proteins (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) and additionally supported by the increase in Rho related proteins (fc ≥ 2), which are known to regulate actin cytoskeleton. For example, several members of actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp 2/3), filamin-a, coronin-1a and plectin were overexpressed in CV-PTC. Moreover, gene ontology analysis based on the molecular functions of proteins that are up-regulated in CV-PTC showed that 45% of these proteins have binding properties. Apart from cytoskeletal binding proteins, DNA and receptor binding proteins showed increased expressions in CV-PTC (

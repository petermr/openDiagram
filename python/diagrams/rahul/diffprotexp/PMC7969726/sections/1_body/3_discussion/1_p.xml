<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. With the development of multi-omics analyses, many differentially expressed genes and signaling networks have been identified. In this study, we report for the first time that CPSF1, the major component of CPA, is upregulated in HCC compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. The clinical significance of CPSF1 expression is that high expression of CPSF1 indicates unfavorable patient outcome as an independent prognostic factor in HCC. Elevation of CPSF1 mRNA partially accounted for its genomic amplification. Biologically, CPSF1 regulates APA and AS that are correlated with cell proliferation and migration. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of HCC growth and suggests that CPSF1 is a potentially novel biomarker for HCC treatment.</p>

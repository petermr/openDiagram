<p>Two rice cultivars; Z3057B (Se-enriched) labelled as S3057, and Chenghui 727 (non-Se-enriched) labelled as S727 were provided by the Demonstration Base for International Science and Technology Cooperation, Rice Research Institute of Sichuan Agricultural University (Chendu, Sichuan, China). Using heterosis [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-09-00130" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the material was cross-bred over years to have a bioaccumulation effect on Se. The material (S3057) was tested by the Rice Testing Center of the Ministry of Agriculture (Chendu, Sichuan, China) and 0.046 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> of Se content was found to have accumulated in polished rice, which meets the national standard of rich-Se paddy, that is, 0.04–0.30 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (GB/T 22499-2008).

<p id="Par55">We established a prognosis-related risk score model based on the eight independent prognosis-associated RBPs. The risk score of each BLCA patient was calculated according to the following formula: 
 <italic>Risk score</italic> = (0.6449 * ExpEFTUD2) + (− 0.5050 * ExpGEMIN7) + (− 0.2456 * ExpOAS1) + (− 0.3768 * ExpAPOBEC3H) + (0.5310 * ExpTRIM71) + (0.3403 * ExpDARS2) + (− 0.6204 * ExpYTHDC1) + (0.4484 * ExpRBMS3).

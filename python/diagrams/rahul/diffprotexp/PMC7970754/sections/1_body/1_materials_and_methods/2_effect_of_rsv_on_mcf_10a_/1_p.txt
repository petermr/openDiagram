0: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) (Dojindo, Japan) was used to detect the effect of RSV (Solarbio, China) on the survival of MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells.
1: The cells in the logarithmic growth phase were adjusted to a concentration of 5  10 4/ml and were inoculated in 96-well plates (100 l per well).
2: The experiment was divided into eight groups, and each group was set up with five duplicate wells that were incubated in a 37 C, 5% CO 2 incubator overnight.
3: After the cells were adhered, the medium was removed, and 100 l of DMEM (Gibco, USA) containing RSV at concentrations of 0, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 M were added in groups.
4: The control group had 100 l of 0.1% DMSO in DMEM added, which was then incubated for 24 h under the same conditions.
5: Next, 10 l of CCK8 solution was added to each well and incubation continued for 3 h. A microplate reader was used to measure absorbance (A) at 450 nm.
6: The survival rates of the eight groups of MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells were then compared, and the experiment was repeated six times.
7: The concentration of RSV that produced significant differences in survival rates between the two cell lines was chosen as the optimum concentration for further experiments.

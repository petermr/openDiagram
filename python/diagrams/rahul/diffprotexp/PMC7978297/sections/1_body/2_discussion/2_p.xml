<p>Great progress has been made since single-cell transcriptomics has been applied to studies of the female reproductive system

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. Specifically, the transcriptome landscape of the whole process of folliculogenesis in humans has been described, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of monkey ovaries have identified ovarian aging associated dysregulation of antioxidative pathways

 <italic>Lhx8</italic>. Similarly, it is reported that DEHP exposure also decreased the levels of oocyte-specific genes, such as

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>. Nevertheless, the current study displayed an impeded progression of PF assembly through a decline of the cell percentages of early-stage follicles in PD0-DEHP and late-stage in the PD3-DEHP group. Further, the ovarian sections revealed that DEHP treatment significantly reduced the cell percentage of germ cells within follicles.

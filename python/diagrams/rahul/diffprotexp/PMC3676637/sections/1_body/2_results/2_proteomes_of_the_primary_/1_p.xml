<p>Each protein that we identified was assigned a biological process based on information from the IPI and GO databases to understand their role. If a protein was known to participate in more than one biological process, it was included in multiple categories. Classification according to biological processes showed that the majority of the proteins were involved in metabolic processes, developmental processes, or multicellular organismal process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), with some interesting proteins that have been implicated in tumorigenesis. In metastatic tumors, proteins related to developmental and multicellular organismal process were decreased compared with primary tumors (4.7 and 3.2 %, respectively), while proteins related to metabolic processes were increased compared with primary tumors (5.3 %) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).

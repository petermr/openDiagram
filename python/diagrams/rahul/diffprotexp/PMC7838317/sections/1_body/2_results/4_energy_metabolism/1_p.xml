<p id="Par13">Mussels brought into captivity also showed differential expression of transcripts involved in energy metabolism. Several transcripts that code for enzymes participating in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport chain) were up-regulated in mussels brought into captivity (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Enzymes involved in glycolysis included triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. Enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle included citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (which catalyzes the rate-limiting step), succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase. Enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation included NADH dehydrogenase (i.e., Complex I), cytochrome c oxidase (i.e., Complex IV), and alternative oxidase (AOX). Many of these transcripts were assigned the GO terms “oxidoreductase activity” and “mitochondrion”, both of which were significantly over-represented among up-regulated transcripts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Other GO terms included “integral component of membrane”, “transferase activity”, and “nucleus” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).

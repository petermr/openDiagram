<p id="Par56">Based on previous immunotyping studies, PAAD was classified into the C1-C6 subtypes. Most patients were clustered into the C1, C2, C3 and C6 subtypes. C3 is associated with superior, C1 and C2 with moderate, and C6 with inferior prognoses. In this study, PAAD was differentiated into IS1-IS5 subtypes. IS1 and IS3 mainly overlapped with C3, IS2 with C2 and C3, IS4 with C1 and C2, and IS5 with C1, C2 and C6. These results were in agreement with better survival probability of IS1 and IS2, and the relatively poor prognoses of IS4 and IS5. Interestingly, both IS1 with superior prognosis and IS3 with lowest survival largely overlapped with C3. Therefore, our immunotyping method is reliable and complements the previous classification. Nevertheless, the vaccine antigens and other prognostic markers identified in this study will have to be validated in future studies.</p>

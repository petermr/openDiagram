0: Chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance (adaxial) were measured every 5 days from flowering (0 DPA) to 40 DPA as previously described 4,  27.
1: Briefly, chlorophyll content was measured three times along the middle part of the flag leaf with a SPAD meter, stomatal conductance was measured on the adaxial surface along the middle part of the flag leaf with a SC-1 porometer.
2: All replications were arranged in a complete randomised block design.
3: Eight biological replicates per group were used for chlorophyll content measurement.
4: Four biological replicates were randomly selected from these eight for measuring stomatal conductance.
5: At harvest, yield components including grain weight per plant, grain number per plant, biomass, harvest index, 1000-grain weight, plant height, tiller number and main spike length were determined.
6: Ten biological replicates were used for harvest analysis.
7: After harvest analysis, out of these ten biological replicates, four biological replicates per group were randomly chosen for destructive grain quality analysis.
8: Wholemeal flour samples of the mature grains were prepared using an IKA A11 analytical mill 4 for the measurement of grain quality traits.
9: A rapid N Elementar was used to determine grain protein content (GPC) based on the Dumas method (nitrogen content multiplied by a factor of 5.7 at 11% moisture basis).
10: Total starch content (TSC) of the grains was determined using the Total Starch Assay Kit as previously described 4.
11: Statistical analysis was performed using GENSTAT 20 Edn (VSN International Ltd) as described previously 4.
12: One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant differences between treatment groups of the same genotype, with the least significance difference (l.s.d.)
13: value at  P < 0.05.

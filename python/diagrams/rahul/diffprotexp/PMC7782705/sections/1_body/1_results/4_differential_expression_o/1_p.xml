<p id="Par13">To evaluate whether the emergence of gDTUs could be correlated with AD pathology hallmarks, we quantified the total of gDTUs observed at different disease stages in the MSBB dataset using the Braak classification (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">5</xref>). For this purpose, we subdivided samples into three groups: low Braak (0, 1, and 2)— 196 samples (clinical diagnosis: 15 AD and 181 controls); mid-Braak (3 and 4)—133 samples (clinical diagnosis: 58 AD and 75 controls); and high Braak (5 and 6)—308 samples (clinical diagnosis: 305 AD and 3 controls). Next, we evaluated the number of gDTUs when comparing individuals at these different stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We observed that most gDTUs were detected only while comparing high with either low or mid-Braak stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A–D). This pattern was observed both in the FL (BM10 and BM44) and TL (BM22 and BM36), suggesting that gene isoform switches positively correlate with AD pathology progression.

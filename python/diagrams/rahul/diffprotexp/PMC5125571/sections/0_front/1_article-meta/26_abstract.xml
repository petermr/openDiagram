 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>The control of snails involved in transmission of trematodes plays a key role in the fight against these parasitic diseases. While some snails have been studied thoroughly, only few genomic and proteomic studies have focused on 
  <italic>Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos</italic>, the snail intermediate host for 
  <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>, and none of them separately analyzed the cellular and humoral arms of the snailâ€™s immune system. Here, we applied a label-free proteomic approach to identify and quantify the proteins from the hemolymph of 
  <italic>B</italic>. 
  <italic>siamensis goniomphalos</italic> experimentally infected with 
  <italic>O</italic>. 
  <italic>viverrini</italic>. We identified several immune response proteins that could play critical roles at the snail-trematode interface, generating important new information on the molecular interactions between flukes and their intermediate snail hosts. This work will contribute towards generating a body of knowledge that will ultimately result in the control of 
  <italic>O</italic>. 
  <italic>viverrini</italic> transmission in endemic areas.

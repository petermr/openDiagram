 <caption> Differential expression of LE genes following PC progression. The curated GEO GDS2546 dataset was used for these analyses. Normal prostate tissue (prostate) n = 67, primary PCs ( n = 66), and mPCs ( n = 25) [ 56, 57]. * p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.001 in comparison to normal prostate tissues; $ p &lt; 0.05, $$ p &lt; 0.01, $$$ p &lt; 0.001 in comparison to primary PCs. One-way ANOVA was performed, followed by post-hoc analysis using the Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparisons test. </caption>

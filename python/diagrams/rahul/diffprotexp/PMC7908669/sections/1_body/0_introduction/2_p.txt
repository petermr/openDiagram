0: Melatonin (MEL), alternatively known as 5 methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine, is a key indole hormone primarily secreted by pinealocytes in the pineal glands of mammals and was first characterized in bovine pineal tissues in 1958 [ 7,  8].
1: As an amphiphilic chemical messenger, MEL has been widely implicated in various physiological processes, such as circadian and seasonal timing, glycemic control and energy metabolism, neural protection and neuroplasticity, sleep and wake cycle control, immune system function, and oxygen and nitrogen reactive species scavenging as a natural antioxidant [ 7].
2: Furthermore, MEL has also been reported to be an essential regulator of bone metabolism processes including bone formation and resorption, bone matrix mineralization, and osteoblast and osteoclast activities [ 9].
3: For example, the stimulating effects of MEL on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation have been verified by extensive research under different conditions [ 9 11].
4: Contrarily, MEL may suppress the function of osteoclasts by upregulating a section of calcitonin by osteocytes [ 12].
5: Importantly, recent studies have shown that MEL promotes bone formation and alleviates bone destruction in a mouse OP model induced by retinoic acid.
6: This effect is mediated by its reduction of oxidant levels and modulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways [ 13].
7: Furthermore, MEL maintains BMSC stemness and promotes the osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis of BMSCs [ 14 16].
8: However, the mechanisms underlying MEL-regulated BMSC differentiation and OP development remain poorly understood.

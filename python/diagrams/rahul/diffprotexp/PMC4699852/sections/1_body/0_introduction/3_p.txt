0: Among the predisposition genes reported by Blondheim et al.
1: [ 3], Nurr-1 is the key transcription factor for the differentiation of human MSCs to dopamine neurons [ 13].
2: Induction of MSCs into dopamine-producing cells is of great interest because of their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease [ 9 10,  14 15].
3: According to Trzaska et al., human bone marrow MSCs become dopaminergic neurons when incubated with a neuronal induction medium composed of SHH, bFGF, and FGF8 for 12 days [ 15].
4: A combination of SHH, FGF-8, and RA has also been used to produce dopaminergic-like neurons [ 14].

<p>Regarding the possibility of 17α-meT inducing noxiousness and processes associating drug detoxification and stress response, we observed overexpression of two glutathione-mediated detoxification proteins (3.54E00), GSTM1 and GSTM2. GSTM proteins are steroid binding proteins characterized by their properties to bind testosterone and estradiol [

We also observed a modulation in the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress receptor pathway (3.36E00), associated with overexpression of the antioxidant and stress response proteins, GSTM and STIP1. This pathway has also been associated with a decreased expression of PEBP1, a Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). Therefore, it is not surprising that, in our study, PEBP1 was found to be decreased by 17α-meT.

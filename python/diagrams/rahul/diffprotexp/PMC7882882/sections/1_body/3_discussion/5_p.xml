<p>Second, a total of eight modules were identified via cluster analysis using the PPI network based on the DEGLs. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses illustrated that these module genes were mainly involved in different GO functions and pathways. For module 1, the related GO functions were ‘T cell migration’ and ‘chemotaxis’, which implied that the process of recurrence may be associated with the immune-related tumor microenvironment. Similar to the current study, Marques 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b58-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) found that a low CD8:CD4 ratio is associated with a higher proliferative index (Ki-67) in pituitary adenoma. In addition, the present KEGG analysis of other modules found that these genes were involved in the ‘cell cycle’, ‘TNF signaling pathway’, ‘VEGF signaling pathway’ and ‘TGF-β signaling pathway’. These pathways might participate and regulate the proliferation and recurrence processes that occur in NFPAs.

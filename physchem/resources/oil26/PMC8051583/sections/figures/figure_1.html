 <caption> Duplication of insulin-like genes in vertebrates. (A) Phylogeny of the insulin supergene family members inferred from their sequences and their genomic locations ( 18– 21). The divergence of the multiple human relaxin ( RLN1, RLN2, and RLN3) and insulin-like peptide ( INSL3, INSL4, INSL5, and INSL6) are indicated by the triangle. Grey box indicates the two genome duplications (2R) that occurred near the origin of vertebrates. (B) Origin of the duplicated rodent insulin genes. The Ins1 gene originated by a retroposition event, shown by the arrow, in the common ancestor of the mouse ( Mus musculus) and rat ( Rattus norvegicus), while Ins2 is located at the locus-of origin ( 22– 26). (C) Duplication of the insulin gene in the frog Xenopus laevis ( 27). A pair of insulin genes, ins.L and ins.S, are found in the Xenopus laevis genome due to a genome duplication that has occurred since its divergence from the diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis. The grey box indicates the genome duplication. (D) Summary of the duplications of insulin genes in bony fish ( 28). A triplication of the insulin gene, yielding insa, insb, and insc genes, occurred in an early ancestor of teleost fish (the order of the duplications events yielding the insa, insb, and insc is unresolved). These duplications occurred at about the same time as the fish-specific genome duplication (the genome duplication is shown as a grey box) – it is unclear whether if any of the insulin gene duplications were due to the genome duplication. A latter duplication of the insa gene in an ancestor of a subset of teleost fish resulted in an insaa and an insab gene in many fish (e.g., clownfish; Amphiprion ocellaris). Insulin genes within some fish genomes also originated via retroposition, as indicated by the arrow, with the Northern pike ( Esox lucius) insa2 gene being an example. </caption>

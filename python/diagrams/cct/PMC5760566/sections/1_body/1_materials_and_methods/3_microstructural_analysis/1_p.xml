<p id="Par11">The specimens for optical microscopy (OM, Zeiss 40MAT) and SEM (Hitachi S4300) were polished and etched with a 4% nitric acid +96% ethanol solution. Further details of the microstructure were revealed via EBSD (FEI Quanta 650 with Nordlys Nano) and TEM (Hitachi H800). Specimens for EBSD and TEM were prepared through conventional dual-jet electro-polishing in the solution of 8% perchloric acid +92% ethanol at a temperature of −25 °C. In addition, grain boundary segregation of elements after the step-cooling heat treatment was investigated via AES (Ulvac-PHI-700).</p>

0: Chicken ovaries also contain numerous developing follicles in different size, including cortical follicles (< 1 mm in diameter), white follicles (15 mm), yellow follicles (58 mm), and five to six large preovulatory follicles (1040 mm) which are under a clear hierarchy in ovulation.
1: The largest preovulatory follicle (named F1 follicle) is ovulated first, while the second to fifth/sixth preovulatory follicles (F2 to F5/F6) will be ovulated sequentially at an interval of 2426 h 6.
2: Owing to the large amount of lipid-rich yellow yolk accumulation in these preovulatory follicles, the nuclei and 99% of the ooplasm concentrate in a small region of 12 mm in diameter, thus is designated as the germinal disc (GD), which can be observed as a small white plaque at the surface of the large oocyte under the microscope 7,  8.
3: Relative to the position of the GD, GC encircling the oocytes can be sub-divided into two subpopulations: Gp cells which are located proximal to the GD, and Gd cells which are distal to the GD 7,  9.

<p id="Par32">Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed the marked elevation of circ_0003865 expression in mouse bone tissue of the OP + sh-NC-treated group compared to that of the sh-NC group. A decrease was observed when circ_0003865 was inhibited (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). In contrast, the expression miR-3653-3p in murine bone tissues was significantly decreased in the OP + sh-NC group compared to that in the sh-NC group. This was also markedly increased by sh-circ_0003865 administration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). The expression of GAS1 in bone tissues of the OP + sh-NC group was significantly higher than that of the sh-NC group, whereas this effect was downregulated by sh-circ_0003865 administration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). Furthermore, the relative mRNA levels of ALP, RUNX2, and OPN in bone tissues of the OP + sh-NC group were all significantly lower than those of the sh-NC group, whereas all were markedly elevated by sh-circ_0003865 administration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). Concomitantly, sh-circ_0003865 induced significant alterations of GAS1, ALP, RUNX2, and OPN protein levels in murine bone tissues between the three groups as determined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>f). Collectively, these results indicate that the silencing of circ_0003865 suppresses ovariectomy-induced OP in a mouse model by regulating circ_0003865 expression and modulating BMSC osteogenic differentiation.

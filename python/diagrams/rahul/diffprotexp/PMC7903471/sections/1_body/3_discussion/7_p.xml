<p>In summary, the present study used RNA microarray data to describe the expression profiles of lncRNAs in osteoarthritis and normal cartilage. Bioinformatics methods were used to predict the target genes and potential functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs. The results obtained by microarray analysis may contribute to the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and predict the development of osteoarthritis. Differentially expressed lncRNAs may also help to identify novel potential candidate targets for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.</p>

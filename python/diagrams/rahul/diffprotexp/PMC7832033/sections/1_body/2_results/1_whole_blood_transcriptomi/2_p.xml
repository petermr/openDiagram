<p>Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-survivors and survivors performed using the moderated t-test method identified 283 DEGs. Hierarchical cluster analysis of these genes was generated by GeneSpring (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Whole blood of non-survivors presented more down-regulated genes compared to survivors (fold change ≥ 2). RNA-seq data of 65 up-regulated genes and 218 down-regulated genes with 
 <italic>P</italic> value ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2 are shown in Supplementary Table 2. In comparison to melioidosis patients who survived, the fold changes of up-regulated genes in non-survivors ranged between 2.00–15.72 and 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 1.70 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 5.47 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup>. The fold change of down-regulated genes ranged between 2.00–9.42 and 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 9.50 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> to 2.54 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup>. The volcano plot in 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the distribution and relationship between fold change and 
 <italic>P</italic> value of 65 up-regulated genes and 218 down-regulated genes in non-survivors in relation to survivors.

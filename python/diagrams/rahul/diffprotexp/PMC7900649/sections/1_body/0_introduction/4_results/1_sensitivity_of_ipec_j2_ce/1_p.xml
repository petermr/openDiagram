<p id="Par19">Immunofluorescence assay and plaque assay were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of IPEC-J2 cells to PEDV GDS01 infection and the kinetics of virus replication. The IPEC-J2 cells were infected with the GDS01 strain and harvested at different time points. After 7 hpi ( hours post-inoculation), immunofluorescence resulting from staining with a PEDV-specific monoclonal antibody was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Until 13 hpi, cytopathic effects (CPEs) caused by PEDV GDS01 infection of IPEC-J2 cells were characterized as vacuolation, formation of syncytia and fusions of the cells. After infection, the virus titer declined at 7 hpi and then increased and peaked at 25 hpi, suggesting the eclipse phase of infection of the virus in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In general, these data suggest that IPEC-J2 cells are sensitive to PEDV GDS01 infection.

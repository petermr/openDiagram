<p>Prolonging the time of intercritical annealing at 700 Â°C leads to some growth of ferrite grains. This is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f008">Figure 8</xref>c,d. However, this grain growth is lower than could be expected. The grain size is not much higher when 1, 2 and 5 h holdings are compared. Longer time influences the number of small austenite grains. For 2 and 5 h holding times, more regular austenite grains are exhibited. This may be a result of some defragmentation of austenite laths during isothermal holding.

0: One of the most well-known inhibitors of HA synthesis is 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU).
1: A coumarin derivative, 4-MU has been shown to experimentally reduce HA levels both  in vivo and  in vitro (Kakizaki et al.
2: 2004; Kultti et al.
3: 2012; Nagy et al.
4: 2015).
5: Though many of its functions are still yet unidentified, three primary mechanisms of action are well described: first, it acts as a competitive substrate of UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), a necessary enzyme in the creation of the dimer unit (GlcUA-GlcNAc) that comprises the HA molecule.
6: Second, 4-MU has been reported to reduce concentrations of UDP-GlcUA  in vitro via binding directly to glucuronic acid (Kultti et al.
7: 2012).
8: Finally, 4-MU is also capable of reducing mRNA expression levels of HAS2 (Kultti et al.
9: 2012).
10: Many groups have developed strategies for intravenous administration of 4-MU or oral administration with 4-MU added into the mouse chow (Kuipers et al.
11: 2016), which have proven very useful for understanding the role of HA in several disease processes, but the systemic side effects of such treatments are either unknown, strongly confounding, or undesired.

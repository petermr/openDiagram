0: Official methods of the American Oil Chemists' Society were used for the determination of melting point (method Cc 1-25), refractive index (method Cc 7-25), iodine value (method Cd 1-25), peroxide value (method Cd 8-53),  p-anisidine value (Cd 18-90), acid value (method Ca 3a-63), and saponification value (method Cd 3-25) [ 13].
1: The total oxidation (TOTOX) value was calculated using determined values for peroxide and  p-anisidine (2Px + Av) [ 14].
2: Stability was measured with a 743 Rancimat instrument (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) using an oil sample of 3 g, warmed to 120C and an air flow rate of 20 L/h.
3: Stability was expressed as induction time (h).

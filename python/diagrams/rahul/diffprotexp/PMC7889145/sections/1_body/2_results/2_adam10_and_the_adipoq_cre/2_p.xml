 <sup>FLOX/FLOX</sup> mice. With the cause for this observation unknown, we initially hypothesized that deletion of

 <sup>±</sup>; homozygous

 <sup>FLOX/FLOX</sup> mouse was born and surprisingly did not have any overt phenotypic changes compared to littermates. In subsequent breeding utilizing this mouse, pups were born with genotypes at the expected frequency, suggesting genetic linkage between the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene and the 
 <italic>Adam10</italic> locus. We initially tested this hypothesis using an informative mating scheme (Supplemental Figure 1) and recorded the resulting genotypes (

 <sup>FLOX/FLOX</sup> mice born was much less than expected (2.2% versus 25%) and statistical testing for linkage [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was definitive with an estimated genetic distance of 4.4 centimorgans (cM) between the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene and the floxed 
 <italic>Adam10</italic> loci (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results demonstrated strong genetic linkage between the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene and

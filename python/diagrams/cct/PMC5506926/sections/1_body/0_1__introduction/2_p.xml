<p>In the melt spinning process, conditions between the roll-contact surface and free surface of ribbon are different, and these will affect the final ribbon quality [

In contrast, metallic ribbons produced by twin-roll casting technique are casted and hot rolled at the same time and a better surface quality is expected. The concept of continuous casting in a single stage dates back to Bessemer, in 1846, who envisioned using a twin-roll technique to cast steel strips [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-10-00420" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but technical realization was more than a century later. In 1970, after Duwezâ€™s seminal discoveries, a twin-roll casting (TRC) technique for preparing uniform films of metastable phases was devised by Chen and Miller [

Nevertheless, most of the studies so far have been based on horizontal type twin-roll casters. Studies on TRC technique for producing metallic glasses are listed in

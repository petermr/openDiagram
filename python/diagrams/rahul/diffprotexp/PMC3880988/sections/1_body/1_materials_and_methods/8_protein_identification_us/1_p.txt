0: Identification of protein spots were performed through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.
1: Protein samples were extracted according to the standard techniques described previously  13.
2: The peptides were analysed using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (Dionex, Thermoscientific, CA, USA) coupled to a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems).
3: The peptides were loaded onto a C18 PepMap100, 3 m (LC Packings, Dionex, Thermoscientific, CA, USA) before being separated by a linear gradient of water/acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (v/v).

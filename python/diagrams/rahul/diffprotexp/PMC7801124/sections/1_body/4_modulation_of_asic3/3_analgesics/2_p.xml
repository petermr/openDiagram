<p>The structural determinants for the inhibition of ASIC3’s sustained current by salicylic acid, aspirin, and diclofenac remain unknown. In outside-out patches, extracellular application of aspirin or salicylic acid inhibits ASIC3, thus making a direct interaction with an extracellular region of ASIC3 highly likely. In addition, the reversibility of aspirin’s inhibition, as well as inhibition by salicylic acid, suggest that such ASIC3 inhibition by these specific NSAIDS does not involve acetylation [

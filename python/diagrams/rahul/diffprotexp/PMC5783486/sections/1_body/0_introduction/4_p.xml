<p>Rapid advances in mass spectrometry (MS) for peptide identification and improved protein sequence coverage of complex biological samples (
 <xref rid="b8-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) has provided highly effective proteomic technologies for biomarker identification and therapeutic target discovery in serum samples (

 <xref rid="b10-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In order to obtain accurate and reliable results, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and MS were employed for quantitative proteomics analyses, with increased proteome coverage and labelling efficiency to compare proteomes among serum samples from healthy individuals, and patients with KD and CAD or CAA (
 <xref rid="b6-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Western blotting was employed to confirm the significantly expressed proteins following bioinformatics analysis. The objective of the present study was to investigate proteomic variations to further our current understanding of the pathogenesis of coronary artery lesions, and provide a basis for the establishment of indicators for these KD complications.

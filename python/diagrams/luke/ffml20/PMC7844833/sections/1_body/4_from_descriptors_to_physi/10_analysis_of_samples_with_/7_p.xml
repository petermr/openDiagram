<p>In addition to species in different oxidation state, particles of different sizes and composition can also coexist in the same sample. Without additional information, it is impossible or at least extremely challenging to disentangle the contributions of different species in these cases. However, when additional (even incomplete) information about the distributions of particles sizes is available, for example, from STEM, the fractions of different types of clusters can be identified, as demonstrated in a recent

0: In this work, we perform a deep characterisation of the transcriptional and proteomic landscape of disease in chondrocytes and synoviocytes extracted from primary joint tissue of osteoarthritis patients.
1: We define molecular quantitative trait loci, identify likely effector genes for GWAS signals, characterise molecular features of cartilage degradation and highlight drug development and repurposing opportunities through analysis of transcriptional signature changes.

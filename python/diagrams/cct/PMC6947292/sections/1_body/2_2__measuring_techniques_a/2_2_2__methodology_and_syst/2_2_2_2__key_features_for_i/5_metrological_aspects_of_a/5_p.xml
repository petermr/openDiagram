<p>An objective criterion is therefore needed. The detection limit was defined in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B121-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] in the following way: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>The reaction is detectable in at least three repeated experiments;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The reaction is also detectable at the next slower cooling rate;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The specific precipitation heat is at least 0.1 J/g; and</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Peak temperatures are in the same region as for the next slower rate.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>

<p>Both 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> and 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic> are noted for their pioneering effects in driving adipogenesis. Therefore, gene interaction networks were formulated for both genes and were comparatively analysed against DEGs list from each MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min lists. Gene interaction networks for murine sources were downloaded from BioGRID and uploaded to Cytoscape [
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> network, consisting of 117 interactions, 63 and 35 genes were observed in DEGs list of MEFD3plu/MEFD3min (upper panel: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min (upper panel: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5c</xref>; 
 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), respectively. Whereas in the 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic> network, consisting of 16 interactions, 11 and 8 genes were observed in DEGs list of MEFD3plu/MEFD3min (lower panel: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min (lower panel: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4c</xref>; 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>), respectively. Most interactions identified are directed through a protein targeted manner.

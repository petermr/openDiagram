<p>We describe the transcriptional signatures as “robust” because at E14.5 and E17.5 a large number of genes in our differential expression analysis surpass stringent statistical significance of FDR &lt; 0.05, and substantial fold change (FC) difference, with many genes exceeding 2 FC (log2 = 1) or even 4 FC (log2 = 2) (Figure 1B-D). We acknowledge that the term robust is non-specific, but thought it captured the overall results. We are happy to substitute for another word or drop if the reviewers prefer, but we left this phrasing for now.</p>

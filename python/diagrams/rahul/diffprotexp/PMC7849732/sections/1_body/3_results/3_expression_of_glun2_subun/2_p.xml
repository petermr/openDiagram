<p>To further quantify potential differences in GluN2 expression across the mediolateral axis, we next compared the ratio between GluN2 immunoreactivity in the medial versus lateral sampled regions – the opposite ends of the dorsal horn where visible differences in intensity were greatest for GluN2B. We found that the medial/lateral OD ratio was near 1 for both GluN2A (1.04 ± 0.09, n = 6) and GluN2D (1.09 ± 0.11, n = 5), while GluN2B had a medial/lateral immunoreactivity ratio of 1.64 ± 0.12 (n = 5). This medial/lateral ratio for GluN2B was significantly higher than for both GluN2A and GluN2D (p = 0.003, n = 6, n = 5, n = 5; post hoc Tukey test GluN2B vs GluN2A: p = 0.004; GluN2B vs GluN2D: p = 0.011;

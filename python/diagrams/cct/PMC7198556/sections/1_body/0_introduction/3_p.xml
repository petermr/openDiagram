The concrete difficulty of obtaining the temperature data for a given process can vary wildly from one facility to another. Many modern industrial heat treatment facilities are sealed off from any outside interference, simultaneously increasing the controllability of the process and decreasing the risk of injury due to interaction with moving, conducting, and/or hot parts

<p>All identifications were manually validated, and extra precursors were selected for fragmentation if the obtained data were judged as insufficient. When high quality spectra were not matched to sequences, a sequence was determined manually and/or the spectra were used for searches allowing for semi-tryptic peptides and common post-translational modifications (PTMs). This resulted in the identification of several signal cleavage sites that were confirmed either by homology to known signal cleavage sites or by using predictive software [

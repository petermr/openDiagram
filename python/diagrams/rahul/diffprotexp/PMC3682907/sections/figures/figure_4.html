 <caption> Protein expression profile for fraction Q2. (A) Scatter plot of scores for principal components 1 and 2 obtained from a PCA analysis showing the segregation of data into EAE (blue) and controls (red). (B) Hierarchical clustering resulted in two major clusters: EAE stage 3 samples (E2-E5) and control (C1-C3) + EAE stage 1 (E1) samples. The * indicates the four differentially expressed proteins that were subjected to trypsin digestion and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing with a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer. </caption>

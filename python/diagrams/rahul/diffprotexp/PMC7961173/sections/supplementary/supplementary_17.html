  <caption> Supplementary file6 Multidimensional scaling plots for villous explants treated with DCVC. First trimester placental villous explants were treated in vitro with 0 (control) or 20 ÂµM DCVC for 12 h. Multidimensional scaling analysis was performed using the edgeR package for R. Plots depicting multidimensional scaling were clustered by: treatment group, gestational week, biological sex of placenta and placental donor. Color keys are provided for each plot (TIF 286 KB) </caption>

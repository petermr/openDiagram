<p>The preparation of whole cell lysates and western blot analysis of protein expression were performed according to the previous routine procedure [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In brief, total protein was extracted from H9C2 cells and protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid protein detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The whole cell lysis buffer was mixed with SDS loading buffer. After centrifugation at 13,000 g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatants were collected. Equal amounts of proteins (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 or 5% pre-casted gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 g at 4 °C for 20 min. According to the previously established protocol, protein expression was detected [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-SORBS2 (1:200, SAB4200183, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-ENH (1:200, SAB2101761, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-actin (1:500, A5385, Sigma-Aldrich). The secondary antibody used were anti-mouse IgG (1:10000, A5385, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000, B7389, Sigma-Aldrich). Quantification was performed by measurement of the intensity of the signals with aid of ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

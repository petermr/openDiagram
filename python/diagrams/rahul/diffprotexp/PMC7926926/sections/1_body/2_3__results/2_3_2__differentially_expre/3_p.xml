<p>Similarly, when comparing LB-04 vs. LB-0 groups (effect of Al stress on 
 <italic>S. luteus</italic>-inoculated masson pine seedlings), we identified 210 DEPs, including 82 up-regulated and 128 down-regulated proteins in LB-04 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-11-00177">Table S4</xref>). GO annotations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-11-00177-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) identified the main functions of these DEPs as metabolic process, organic substance metabolic process, cellular metabolic process, and primary metabolic process. These DEPs were involved in response to a stimulus, cellular component organization or biology, and localization.

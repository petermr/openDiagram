<p>The filler material is a hypo-eutectoid steel with a low carbon content of C â‰¤ 0.07% and increased percentage of silicon and manganese. Thus, almost no pearlite was formed during cooling (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f012">Figure 12</xref>). The microstructure was mainly composed of different proportions of intermediate structure (bainite) and ferrite at moderate cooling rates. At very high cooling rates, e.g., in the first weld bead, martensite formed.

 </sup>. In our human data, the bilateral reduction in pre-movement beta activity in Early Adaptation trials was present when controlling for these parameters, suggesting that the change in beta activity is independent of these kinematic properties. Moreover, in the human data there was no significant change in beta power during the Early Aftereffect epoch, in which motor errors are equal in magnitude to the Early Adaptation epoch. This suggests that the beta modulation was not related to error feedback processing per se, which is thought to occur largely in the cerebellum

 </sup>. Instead, the beta modulation was present only when adaptation occurred to a

 </sup>). The difference in beta activity between the Early Adaptation and Early Aftereffect epochs raises the possibility that the neuronal processes underpinning adaptation and aftereffect are distinct, and that the adaptation effect is not related to error magnitude. Such a possibility is consistent with the idea that, whilst initial adaptation is supported principally by a recalibration of internal models, the aftereffect can be more easily supported with a strategic influence

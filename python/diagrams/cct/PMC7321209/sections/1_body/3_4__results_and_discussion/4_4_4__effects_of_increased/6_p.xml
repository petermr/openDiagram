<p>From the 12th layer on, the resulting t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times adjusted to an increasingly stationary state between 15 and 20 s. This can be explained by the low amount of introduced thermal energy and the resulting lower temperature gradients between the structure and the substrate. As a result, stationary cooling conditions of the set layers can be observed. Herein, a difference in the t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-time of approximately 2.5 s results for the different CTWD adjustments. A correlation between the energy input per unit length (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and the resulting cooling rates (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f013">Figure 13</xref>) can be shown throughout decreasing t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times at reduced energy input. According to the CCT-diagram [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], a microstructural composition of 63% bainite and 37% ferrite occurred for t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times between 15 to 20 s with hardness values below 191 HV.

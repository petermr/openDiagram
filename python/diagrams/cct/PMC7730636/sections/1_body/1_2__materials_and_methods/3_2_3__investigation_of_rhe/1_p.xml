<p>Deformation dilatometer (TA Instruments, Milford, MA, USA) used in this study utilizes compression of the samples in axisymmetric test. The results of the experiments are presented in form of true stress–true strain curves, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It is a relation between the true stress and corresponding true strain, also called flow stress curves. Elastic deformation has a negligible value and therefore is omitted. There are four characteristic points in the curve. The point [0;

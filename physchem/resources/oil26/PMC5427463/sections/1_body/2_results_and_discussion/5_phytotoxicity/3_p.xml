<p>The inhibition of seedling growth could be attributed to camphor and 1,8-cineole, the main compounds of the SoEO
 <italic>, </italic>which are potent inhibitors of oxygen uptake by mitochondrial suspensions (Romagni et al., 2000[
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Moreover, several monoterpenoids of the SoEO, including linalool (Singh et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]), α-pinene (Singh et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]) and limonene (Singh et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]) are potent inhibitors of seedling growth. Previous studies have documented that essential oil and their constituents induce oxidative stress and inhibit root growth (Singh et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], 2009[
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; Mutlu et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). They reported an enhancement of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide accumulation and an increase of electrolyte leakage in root tissue (Singh et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; Mutlu et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). However, the SoEO does not cause any inhibitory effect on root and hypocotyl elongation and fresh weight on
 <italic> S. lycopersicum</italic> seeds. López-Iglesias et al. (2014[
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) suggested that enhanced plant growth/plant growth inhibition, could be the result of a positive or negative balance between nutrient and polyphenol concentration. Santana-Méridas et al. (2014[
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) reported a stimulating effect of rosemary residues on 
 <italic>L. sativa </italic>and a moderate phytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>L. perenne</italic>. The phytotoxic effects of the SoEO appeared to be species seeds-dependent.

<p>Recombinant CARDS TX also shows cytopathic effects in mammalian cells in tissue and organ cultures, eventually leading to cell death, which is consistent with the process during 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="cit0220" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. Vacuolization of the bronchial epithelium is another function of rCARDS TX observed in rCARDS TX-treated mice. Neutral red-uptake tests revealed that the rCARDS TX-induced vacuoles are acidic. The vacuoles originate from Rab9-associated compartments and late endosomes since they are rich in Rab9, LAMP1, and LAMP2; the ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and monensin can abrogate this vacuolization [

 <xref rid="cit0224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>], demonstrating that vacuolization mediated by rCARDS TX is dependent on V-ATPase enzymes, which are also found in endosomes and lysosomes.

 <caption>
  <p>(A) Complete SARS-CoV-2 genome map with ORF6 illustrated in blue. (B) Nucleotide sequences at consensus ORF6 site 27241-27310. Both 34-nt (D34) and 26-nt (D26) deletion regions, beginning at position 27267, are denoted by dashes. (C) Partial ORF6 region at consensus nucleotide position 27250â€“27291 with corresponding amino acids depicted in the coloured blocks above the nucleic acid sequence. Nucleic acids and amino acids are illustrated in gray for the consensus sequence, in green for the deletion variant sequences, and in black for the alterations resulting from the ORF6 deletions, with presumptive premature stop codons.</p>

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Genomic DNA material was extracted from dried leaf tissue of each plant using E.Z.N.A<sup>&#174;</sup> Poly-Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the protocol given by the company. For amplification of <italic>matK</italic> region, PCR was performed in a 50 &#181;L reaction mixture that consisted of 36.5 &#181;L of nanofiltrated (NF) water, 5.0 &#181;L of 10&#215; Advantage Buffer, 1.0 &#181;L of deoxynucleotide (DNTP), 0.5 &#181;L of Taq-DNA polymerase, 5.0 &#181;L template DNA, 1.0 &#181;L of <italic>matK</italic>-Lau001 (F-5&#8217;-TCCTTTCTTGAGCGAACACA-3&#8217;), and 1.0 &#181;L of <italic>matK</italic>-Lau002 (R-5&#8217;-CTGACAAATCGGACCGAAAC-3&#8217;) primers purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA). Amplifications conditions for <italic>matK</italic> primers consisted of an initial denaturation step for 2 min at 95 &#176;C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 &#176;C, 30 s at 61 &#176;C, 60 s at 68 &#176;C, and 60 s at 72 &#176;C for final extension. Amplifications were performed in an Eppendorf MasterCycler Pro thermocycler, the PCR products were visualized in agarose gel (1%), purified, and then they were sent to Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA) for sequencing.</p>

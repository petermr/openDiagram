<p id="Par30">For protein analysis, samples were divided into methylation high, methylation intermediate, and methylation low groups based on the beta-values across MAP2K3 DMR1 and samples from each group were randomly chosen as a representative subset of the discovery cohort. Protein lysates were prepared by manually homogenizing frozen tissue in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% TGX SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked in 5% dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated at 4 °C overnight in primary antibody; MKK3 (Cell Signaling #5674), p38 (Cell Signaling #9219), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling # 4511), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101), and β-Actin (Cell Signaling #3700). Densitometry was done in ImageJ.</p>

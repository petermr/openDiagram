<p id="Par31">The effect of microstructure on the impact toughness and temper embrittlement of SA508Gr.4N steel was investigated. The results are summarized as follows:
 <list list-type="order">

   <p id="Par32">The strength of the martensitic structure is ∼25 MPa higher than that of bainitic structure. Similarly, the impact toughness of the martensitic structure is better than that of the bainitic structure, and the DBTT values differ by 60 °C.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par33">Compared with the bainitic structure, the martensitic structure consists of finer blocks (i.e., block width is smaller) and more HAGBs. This leads to an improved crack-propagation path at break, and the propagation direction of the cleavage crack is deflected more frequently (than in the bainitic structure), resulting in a high impact toughness of the martensitic structure.</p>

   <p id="Par34">The segregation of S is significantly higher in the martensitic structure than in the bainitic structure and, hence, the martensitic structure will be more susceptible to temper embrittlement.</p>

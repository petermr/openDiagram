 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f055">Figure 55</xref>, the experimentally obtained values for the total specific precipitation enthalpy after cooling and the hardness after artificial ageing of six different AlZnMg(Cu) alloys are compared to the predictions of the model derived in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B119-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. A general chart of these values as a function of cooling rate for each 7xxx Al alloy investigated is given in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-04083">Appendix A</xref>, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f0A4">Figure A4</xref>. As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f055">Figure 55</xref>, the model predictions are found to be very accurate to a wide range of AlZnMg(Cu) alloys and the total specific precipitation enthalpy generally decreases with increasing cooling rate for all alloys. A high level of similarity to the AlMgSi alloys is found for the general kinetic behaviour. However, the specific enthalpy values, as well as the obtainable hardness values, are generally higher for the 7xxx alloys. This is reasonable, as the latter contain higher concentrations of alloying elements. As for the 6xxx alloys, the hardness after ageing reaches a saturation level for cooling rates above the UCCR ranging from about 3 K/s for 7020 to about 300 K/s for highly concentrated alloys such as 7150 or 7049A.

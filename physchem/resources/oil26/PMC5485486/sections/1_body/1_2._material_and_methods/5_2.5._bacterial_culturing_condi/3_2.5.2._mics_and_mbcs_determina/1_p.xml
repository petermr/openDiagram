The essential oils were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma). Serial dilutions (1&#8201;:&#8201;2) from 2.5%&#8201;(v/v) as the essential oil concentrations to be incubated at 37&#176;C for 24&#8201;h with the bacterial suspensions adjusted to 10<sup>5</sup>&#8201;CFU/ml in wells of 96-well microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Untreated control (wells containing bacteria with DMSO at a concentration of 1%) was included in the assay.</p>

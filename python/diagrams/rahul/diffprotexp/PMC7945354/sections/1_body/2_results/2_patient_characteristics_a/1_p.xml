<p id="Par41">Before we screened the potential biomarker that could differentiate LAC in T2DM patients, we first tried to compare the general pathological parameters in the main two groups in the whole set consisting of 40 serum samples from T2DM patients and 40 serum samples from T2DM patients with LAC. In the T2DM group, there were 23 males and 17 females with an average age of 61.05 ± 9.78 years and an average fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 7.95 ± 1.91 mmol/L. In the T2DM + LAC group, there were 19 males and 21 females with an average age of 64.68 ± 7.10 years and an average FPG of 7.41 ± 2.55 mmol/L. There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age and FPG between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Besides, there was also no significant differences in therapeutic regimens for hypoglycemia between these two groups (P &gt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Moreover, we compared the concentrations of the most commonly used tumor biomarkers in the clinic between these two groups. The results showed that there were no significant differences in serum AFP (P = 0.101), CEA (P = 0.304), CA125 (P = 0.693) and CA199 (P = 0.994) levels between the T2DM + LAC group and the T2DM group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These results suggested that the identification of novel biomarkers is urgently needed for the detection of LAC in T2DM patients.

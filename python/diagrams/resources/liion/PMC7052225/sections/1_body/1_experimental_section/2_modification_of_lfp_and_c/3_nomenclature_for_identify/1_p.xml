<p id="Par12">To easily identify the grafted powder, a simple nomenclature is adopted. When aryl-COOH groups are attached to the surface of LFP, Denka, CNT, and VGCF carbons, the powders are named LFP–COOH, Denka–COOH, CNT–COOH, and VGCF–COOH, respectively. When aryl-SO
 <sub>3</sub>H moieties are immobilized on the carbon surface, the modified powders are identified as graphite–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H, Denka–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H, CNT–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H, and VGCF–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H.

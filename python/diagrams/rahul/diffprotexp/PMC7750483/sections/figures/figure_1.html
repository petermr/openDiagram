 <caption> Comprehensive molecular profiling of m 5C writers and reader in GI cancer. (A) The workflow of the study. (B) The regulation mechanism of m 5C in GI cancers (esophageal cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer). m 5C formation is catalyzed by writer and SAM ( S-adenosylmethionine). In addition, reader can recognize methylated mRNA and mediate its export from the nucleus. They work together on m 5C RNA methylation modification. </caption>

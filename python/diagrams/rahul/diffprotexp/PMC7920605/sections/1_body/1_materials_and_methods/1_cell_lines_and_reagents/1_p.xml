<p>MH7A cells were provided by JENNIO Biological Technology (Guangzhou, CHN). MH7A cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco), which 10% FBS (Gemini) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) were added and maintained at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. MH7A cells were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL), which was defined as the TNF-α group, and unstimulated MH7A cells were defined as the control group. After culturing for 24 h, MH7A cells were collected for the subsequent experiment.

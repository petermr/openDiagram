<p>Understanding of the molecular aspects associated with COVID-19 and the search for understanding the complex response of the host after viral infection have been gaining space.

 </sup> Approaches that evaluate viral infections from the perspective of the molecular impact on the host contribute to the understanding of the disease, which is important for outlining potential antiviral strategies.

 </sup> Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which allow 
 <italic>in silico</italic> characterization of the molecular response and the impact of infection, can be applied. Some databases contain a collection of expression data, but their results are mostly obtained by text mining with automatic and semiautomatic approaches, which may lead to nonaccurate data being deposited.

 </sup> Furthermore, the results may present redundancy and ambiguity, and a postanalysis is necessary for data conference.

 </sup> In the same way, the need for bioinformaticians to extract raw data in many of the available databases is another important limitation of its use; it can be especially limiting for medical workers without bioinformatics skills who are facing the COVID-19 impact in real time and need information promptly. This scenario hampers the access of the medical community and also other nonspecialized scientists who may need this information in their research. Recently, our group developed the ZIKAVID, a database based on gathering all up-to-date gene expression data generated after Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, containing different experimental approaches, hosts and strains, and other related information.

0: In addition, resistance of recurrent thyroid cancers to radioactive iodine treatment, confirmed by observations, poses another challenge for early diagnostics of tumors prone not to respond to the standard therapy regimens [ 7].
1: Such diagnostics could be used to individually tune treatments, e.g.
2: by adjusting dosage of therapeutic agents and timeline of treatment [ 8].
3: Two decades ago, a connection between thyroid cancer radioactive iodine resistance and activity of sodium iodide symporter gene  SLC5A5 was discovered [ 9].
4: Also,  BRAF and  TERT mutations were found as the predictors of radio iodine refractory thyroid cancer, especially in duet [ 10,  11,  12].
5: However, it is clear that the problem has not been solved yet as there are no effective instruments in clinics to predict thyroid cancer resistance to radiation therapy [ 13].

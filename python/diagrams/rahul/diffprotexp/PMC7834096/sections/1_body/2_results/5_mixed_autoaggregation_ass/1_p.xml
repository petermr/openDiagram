<p>The well-known AAF-dependent stacked-brick adherence pattern formed by EAEC on epithelial cells suggested that the fimbriae do not only interact with receptors on eukaryotic cells, but also with each other. However, it was unclear, if these are specific interactions in between the same AAF fimbrial subtype, in between AAF fimbriae in general, or if the fimbriae can also bind to non-AAF surfaces on the bacterial cell wall. In order to analyze the composition of the bacterial aggregates when 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <sup>−</sup> expressed different AAF subtypes, we mixed two strains marked with otherwise identical plasmids that either expressed the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). Afterward, we induced the expression of the different AAF variants as described above. This allowed us to microscopically analyze the resulting EAEC aggregates (

 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <sup>−</sup> containing the empty vector did not form any aggregates whereas homogeneously mixed aggregates were formed when the bacteria were expressing the same AAF subtype with different fluorophores (

 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <sup>−</sup> expressing AAF/I, AAF/III, AAF/IV, and AAF/V with the identical host strain containing the empty expression vector did not result in the systematic inclusion of planktonic bacteria into the aggregates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>, far right panels). When bacteria expressing the different AAF subtypes were mixed together, less homogenously mixed aggregates were formed with rather patchy characteristics, in which cells expressing one AAF subtype appeared to cluster within the aggregates, e.g. for AAF/I and AAF/III (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, EAEC strain 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <sup>−</sup> expressing AAF/V was often found to form dense spherical aggregates that were not observed when the same host strain expressed the other AAF subtypes (

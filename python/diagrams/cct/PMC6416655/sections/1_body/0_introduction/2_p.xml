<p id="p0010">Nowadays, most of the forgings are produced through mould casting and forging process, especially in the production of high-alloy steels [

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The high-alloy steels receive mounting attention in the iron and steel industry, due to its high added value in the manufacturing market. However, there are difficulties in the quality control of these steels due to their high carbon and alloy content, and hence high cracking susceptibility [

The high quality mould steel is produced after forging, which should qualify via flaw detection, high surface quality, and ±2HRC (Rockwell hardness) difference in hardness uniformity (between the surface and core). It is widely used to the large long-life plastic injection mould, such as home appliances, computer shells,

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, it is not possible to perform the quality check of the steel ingot before the forging process, which caused a high defective ratio of 5–10 % [

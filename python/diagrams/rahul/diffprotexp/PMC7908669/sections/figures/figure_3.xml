  <p>Differential mRNA profiles caused by MEL in human BMSCs. 
   <bold>a</bold> Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed mRNAs in MEL-treated human BMSCs. Differentially mRNA expression was defined by a fold change of &gt; 1.5 and a 
   <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; 0.05. Red and green colors, respectively, show the increase and decrease of mRNAs. 
   <bold>b</bold> A volcano plot presenting the differentially expressed mRNAs in BMSCs induced by MEL treatment. Upregulated and downregulated mRNAs were represented by red and green spots, respectively. The mRNAs showing no significant expression changes are indicated by black spots. 
   <bold>c</bold> Functional categorization of differentially expressed mRNAs in MEL-treated human BMSCs. The enrichment of differentially expressed mRNAs in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions was analyzed by the GO method. 
   <bold>d</bold> Significant enrichment of MEL-induced differentially expressed mRNAs in KEGG signaling pathways. The number of mRNAs in each pathway and the significance of enrichment are indicated by the circle diameters and blue colors, respectively. CON: control; MEL: melatonin; GO: gene ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes

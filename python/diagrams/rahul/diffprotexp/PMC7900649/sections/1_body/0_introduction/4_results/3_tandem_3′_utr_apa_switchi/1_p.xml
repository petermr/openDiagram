<p id="Par23">According to different switching sites, APA events can be classified into four general types: tandem 3′ UTR APA and alternative terminal exon APA, which involve cleavage in 3′ UTRs; intronic APA, which is less frequent; and internal exon APA, which is the least frequent type [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The tandem 3′ UTR APA is the most frequent APA form. Association of tandem APA with various biological effects has previously been demonstrated, including cancer transformation, embryonic development, immune responses, neuronal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], as well as antiviral innate immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, we analyzed the differential use of tandem APA sites located within the 3′ UTR in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV GDS01.

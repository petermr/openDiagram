<p>Then, according to biological function, we selected WTAP, RIPK2, JAK3 and TNFRSF10A for further analysis. The sequencing, RT-qPCR and Western blot results in MH7A cells after stimulation with TNF-Î± all clearly indicated that the m6A methylation levels of WTAP, RIPK2 and JAK3 were significantly reduced, while the mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased. Interestingly, the m6A methylation as well as mRNA and protein expression levels of TNFRSF10A presented the completely opposite trends compared with the above three genes. To further validate the above experimental results, we established and detected the mRNA and protein expression levels of the above genes in synovial tissues of AA model rats. The expression levels of WTAP, RIPK2, JAK3 and TNFRSF10A showed the same trends between the cellular level and animal level.</p>

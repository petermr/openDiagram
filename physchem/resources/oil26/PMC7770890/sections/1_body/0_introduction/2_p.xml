<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In vitro experiments suggest that RaTG13
also binds to human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (hACE2) and can use hACE2 as an entry receptor;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> thus, it could be possible that a progenitor
of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., RaTG13 or RaTG13-like CoV, infected humans and
evolved during human-to-human transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> However, recent experiments showed that the binding efficiency of
RaTG13 to hACE2 is quite low,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> probably
due to the lack of critical hACE2-binding residues. Besides, no evidence
has shown that RaTG13 can directly infect humans in nature.</p>

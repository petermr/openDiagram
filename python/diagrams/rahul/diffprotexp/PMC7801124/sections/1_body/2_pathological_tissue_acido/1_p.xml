<p>Nociceptors express ASICs and other acid sensors, suggesting that the ability of the body to detect and respond to acidosis is physiologically important [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As will be discussed further on, ASIC3, like many sensory transduction ion channels, can be sensitized by inflammatory mediators and modulated by other proteins, all of which can alter ASIC3â€™s biophysical properties, including sensitivity toward extracellular protons. Here we will first discuss how tissue acidosis itself can be generated, thus revealing the circumstances in which ASIC3 activation can occur and why it could be considered an appealing therapeutic target in analgesia.

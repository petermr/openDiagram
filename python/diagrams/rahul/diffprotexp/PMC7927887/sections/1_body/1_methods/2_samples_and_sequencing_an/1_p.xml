<p>We analyzed 598 newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) samples from the CoMMpass dataset which contains whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq data that were uniformly processed. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig001">Figure 1</xref> shows a CONSORT flow diagram of the breakdown of available samples for the four different analyses performed on the data. WES data were analyzed for mutations using a previously described pipeline.

<p>In summary, we report differential proteome analyses of nuclear preparations from D1 versus D2 MSNs and a novel workflow for low protein input TMT analyses of FANS-isolated nuclei from cell-type-specific populations of striatal MSNs. This method can now be used to improve our understanding of many neurological diseases including characterizing the short and long-term impact of drugs of abuse on the proteomes of these two neuronal populations. The importance of this novel workflow that now permits proteome analyses of D1 versus D2 MSNs was well demonstrated by comparing unpublished BacTRAP RNASeq data with the D1 and D2 MSN nuclear proteome analyses (both obtained from the same transgenic BacTRAP mouse lines). Based on a plot of the log2-fold-change between D1 and D2 MSNs for the 646 gene products that were common to both data sets, there was negative correlation (r = âˆ’0.10) between mRNA and protein expression levels (data not shown), thus highlighting the need to carry out proteomic measurements. Lastly, we note that one limitation of the current study is that its focus on the nuclear proteome requires that other components of the cellular proteome be discarded. To obviate this concern, we and others are currently exploring alternative approaches (e.g., LCM, controlled tissue fixation, organelle and sub-cellular fraction enrichment) using alternative fluorescent tags under cell-type-specific control.</p>

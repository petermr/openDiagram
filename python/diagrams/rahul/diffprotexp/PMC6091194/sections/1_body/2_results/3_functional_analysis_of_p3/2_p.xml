<p id="Par54">IPA was utilized also to understand the functions of exclusively and differentially expressed proteins between P3 and P30 sensory epithelia. Analyses show that 27% of proteins upregulated on P3 associate with hereditary disorders (Additional file

 <bold>:</bold> Table S8). In contrast, proteins downregulated on P3, are significantly involved in tissue morphology, nervous system and tissue development, while 65% of P3 downregulated proteins associate with neurological diseases (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>
 <bold>:</bold> Table S9). Of additional interest were proteins exclusively expressed in the respective proteomes of P3 and P30 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>
 <bold>:</bold> Tables S10, S11). There were 11 and 24% of proteins exclusively expressed on P3 that are relevant to tissue morphology and renal and urological disease, respectively. On P30, proteins predominate that are relevant to tissue morphology and development. Proteins exclusively expressed on P30 associate with neurological disease and hereditary disorder.

<p>The miRCat tool in the sRNA Toolkit package was used to predict novel miRNAs. The signature microarray structure of microRNA precursors could be used to forecast new microRNAs. After comparing the unanalyzed reads in the annotations (the sample name was _unannotated.csv) with the rat genome, the sequence was initially determined as a candidate for new microRNA through the folding model when it was located on the stem-loop structure.</p>

<p id="Par26">The DETFs can be classified depending on the genes that are being regulated and the effect they produce when expressed. Thus, it is not surprising that many of the DETFs regulate the transcription process itself. For example, TAF1A, MYBBP1A and PWP1 are involved in the assembly of RNA polymerase I preinitiation complex, processing of ribosomal RNA and ribosome assembly, respectively

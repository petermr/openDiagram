<p id="Par36">The practical capacity of 165 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> for the LTO electrode is slightly higher than that obtained for the LFP self-standing film (160 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>); hence, electrochemical cells with an LFP/LTO mass ratio of approximately 1 can be used. Apart from this ratio, however, the use of a minimal amount of excess LTO material achieves an LFP/LTO mass ratio of ~0.85. This excess is preconized for safety concerns and is generally employed in commercial batteries. A full Li-ion battery is assembled with a standard Celgard separator and another with a Kodoshi paper separator to produce an all-paper battery. Compared to the cell assembled with a Celgard separator, the battery that employs a paper separator is observed to achieve a better electrochemical performance: for every C rate ranging from C/24 to 2 C, 10 mAh∙g
 <sup>−1</sup> is added to the obtained discharge capacity (Fig.

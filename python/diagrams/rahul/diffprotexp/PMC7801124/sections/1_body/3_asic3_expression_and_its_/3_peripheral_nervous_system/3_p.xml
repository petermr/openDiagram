<p>However not all studies support such a key role for ASIC3 in pain. For example, in transgenic dominant-negative ASIC3 mice, Mogil and colleagues [
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] observed no difference in sensitivity to heat, but observed an increased response to a mechanical (von Frey and tail-clip test) and chemical/inflammatory (formalin and acetic acid writhing test) stimuli, compared to WT mice, the authors noted this may be attributed to a change in ASIC1a and 2a activity [
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A further paper also found that ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice were hypersensitive to high-intensity thermal stimuli compared to WT mice [
 <xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. One possibility for these conflicting findings is differential dysregulation of alternative ASIC subunits, or other sensory ion channels in different mouse genotypes.

 <caption> CNTN1 enhances LNCaP cell proliferation. ( A) Western blot analysis for CNTN1 and Actin expression in the indicated stable lines. ( B) LNCaP empty vector (EV) and LNCaP CNTN1 cells were seeded at 10 4/well in 6-well plate. Cell numbers were counted every two days. Experiments were repeated three times. Mean ± SD (standard deviation) was graphed; 2-way ANOVA was used to analyze the two growth curves. ( C, D) LNCaP EV and LNCaP CNTN1 cells were seeded in 60 mm plates at the indicated densities for colony formation. Experiments were repeated three times. Typical images from a single repeat are presented ( C); quantifications were graphed using Mean ± SD. ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001 in comparison to the respective EV control by 2-tailed Student t-test ( D). </caption>

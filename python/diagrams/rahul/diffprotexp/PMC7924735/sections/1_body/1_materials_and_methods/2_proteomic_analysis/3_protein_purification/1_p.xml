<p>The collected supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. Then, the supernatants were dialyzed against distilled water through a Spectra 3 membrane with a 3.5-kDa pore size (Spectra/Por, Rancho Dominguez, CA) at 4°C for five days. Once dialyzed, 300 ml of dialyzed supernatants were freeze-dried at −45°C and 133 ×10
 <sup>−3</sup> mBar for 48 h in a Freezone 4.5 Dry Freeze system (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). The resulting powder was reconstituted with ultrapure DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a 1:10,000 ratio. Protein concentration was determined with the 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) following the manufacturer’s protocol (

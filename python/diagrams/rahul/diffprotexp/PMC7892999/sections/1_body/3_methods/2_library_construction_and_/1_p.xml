<p id="Par21">Twelve samples (two genotypes × two tissues × three biological replicates) were sent to the Macrogen sequencing service (Seoul, Korea). Once in destination they were checked for total RNA integrity using a Bioanalyzer RNA Nano 6000 chip. All the samples qualified to proceed with the library construction having an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 7. NGS transcriptomic libraries were constructed using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). To verify the size of PCR enriched fragments, the template size distribution was checked on an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer using a DNA 1000 chip. The sequencing of libraries was performed as paired-end 101 bp reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The quality of the raw reads in the FastQ files was checked through FastQC

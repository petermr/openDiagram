<p id="Par57">The application of MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics resulted in the identification of 447 differentially expressed proteins in the developing mouse cochlear sensory epithelium at P3, P14, and P30. Proteins such as SPARC and unconventional myosin-VI (Myo6), known to be associated with cochlear development, hearing, and deafness, were identified among these proteins. In addition, newly identified proteins recently reported to be associated with the cochlea, such as Parvin [

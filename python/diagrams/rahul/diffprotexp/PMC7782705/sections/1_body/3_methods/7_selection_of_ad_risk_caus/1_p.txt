0: The complete list of AD risk/causal genes used in this study is described in Supplementary Table  10.
1: Briefly, AD risk loci were selected from previous work using genome-wide association studies and whole exome sequencing 29,  30.
2: AD risk genes within these loci were determined based on regional association plots, assuming that the functional risk variants are located in the vicinity of the SNP producing the top signal and taking into account the linkage disequilibrium patterns and the recombination peaks within the loci of interest 31.
3: Early-onset AD causal genes used in this study are APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2.

<p>The swelling behavior was studied by immersing preweighted (initial mass

 <sub>0</sub>) circular disks (~5 mm diameter) of the PVA, PC5, PC12, and CAR hydrogels in 100 mL of distilled water, respectively, and 100 mL of aqueous media with different pH values (between 3 and 7.3) at room temperature. The values of pH were adjusted by the addition of HCl, respectively, NaOH of different concentrations to maintain a constant ionic strength of the swelling media. The values of pH for assessing the hydrogels swelling were chosen to be representative for the control release experiments. The cryogel disks were taken out of the swelling media at determined time intervals, dried at the surface with filter paper, and weighed (

<p id="Par25">In addition to measuring tandem 3′ UTR APA variety, SAPAS method could also be used for digital gene expression analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We identified 912, 260, 786, 568, 58, 244 and 163 differentially expressed genes at 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 hpi, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), among which 638 genes were up-regulated, 311 genes were down-regulated and 728 genes were dynamically regulated at different time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). These DEGs were clustered into cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus and other biological process, few genes were involved in immune system process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). After the pathway enrichment, metabolic pathways, RNA transport, ribosome, biosynthesis of antibiotics, cell cycle and protein processing in ER pathways were enriched with highly significant

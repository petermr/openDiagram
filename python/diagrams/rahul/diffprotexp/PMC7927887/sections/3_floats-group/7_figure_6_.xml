   <bold>Patients with high levels of novel splice loci are associated with poor outcome</bold>. (A and B) Kaplan-Meier curves in high novel splicing (top 20%) (n=117) 
   <italic>versus</italic> low/medium novel splicing (bottom 60%) (n=464) patient samples: (A) progression-free survival; (B) overall survival. (C and D) Outcome of patients with a t(4;14) with low/medium (n=70), and high (n=5) novel splice groups: (C) progression-free survival; (D) overall survival.

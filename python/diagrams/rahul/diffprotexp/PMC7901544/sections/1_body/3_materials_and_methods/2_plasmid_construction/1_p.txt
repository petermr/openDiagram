0: pcDNA3.1-KPNA3, pcDNA3.1-KPNA4, and different  fiber-2 truncates including pcDNA3.1-F2-del_1-40aa and pcDNA3.1-F2-del_61-114aa were constructed by a CloneExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme biotech, Nanjing, China).
1: The primers used for these constructors were listed in  Table 1. pcDNA3.1-F1 and pcDNA3.1-F2 were stored in our laboratory.
2: The sgRNAs targeting the FAdV-4  fiber-2, and the KPNA3 and KPNA4 genes were designed using CRISPR guide RNA designing website ( www.benchling.com) and cloned into the CRISPR/Cas9 vector lentiCRISPR v2.
3: The sequences of the sgRNAs were listed in  Table 2.
4: The donor plasmid with homologous arm (HA) at both ends flanking the truncated  fiber-2 was constructed by PCR, then assembled as HAL-F2-HAR, and finally cloned into the pMD19 simple vector.

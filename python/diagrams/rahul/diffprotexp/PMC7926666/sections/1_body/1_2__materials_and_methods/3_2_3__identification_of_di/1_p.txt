0: The gene expression profiles of RCC subtypes were analyzed together with the obtained PPI data through the differential interactome algorithm revised in the study of Gulfidan et al.
1: [ 8] using R (version 3.6.1).
2: This algorithm presents the differential PPIs (dPPIs) between the tumor phenotype and normal phenotype, taking into account the relative observation frequencies ( q-value) of each PPI as described earlier [ 8, 9].
3: The criteria of the algorithm for obtaining significant dPPIs were set as  q-value< 0.10 (significantly repressed in tumor phenotype),  q-value > 0.90 (significantly activated in tumor phenotype), and a normalized observation frequency either in normal or tumor phenotype > 20%.

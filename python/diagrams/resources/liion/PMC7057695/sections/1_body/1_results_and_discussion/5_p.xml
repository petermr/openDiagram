 </xref> that the Δ
 <italic>S</italic> value for 0–10% SOD (high-voltage lithium-deficient phase) is almost the same. It can be inferred that it conforms to the characteristics of first-order two-phase transformation, which is often accompanied by large volume change, resulting in large internal stress, particle fracture, and deterioration of cycle performance. In the range of 10–40% SOD, Δ
 <italic>S</italic> shows a slope change, which indicates that the reaction in this region is closer to the single-phase reaction of a solid solution rather than the two-phase reaction. The 40–60% SOD region is a transition region, indicating that there are new phases in the region, which is a multiphase coexistence region. In the 60–80% SOD range, Δ
 <italic>S</italic> also shows a slope change, indicating that the region is closer to the reaction mechanism of a single-phase solid solution. The OCV in the 80–100% SOD range is always unstable during measurement, and the calculation error of the mean value is large. However, it can also be seen qualitatively that the absolute value of Δ
 <italic>S</italic> in this area is large, and the volume changes greatly along with a huge amount of change in heat; therefore, this area corresponds to the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> → Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> redox couple, rather than Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> → Ni
 <sup>3+</sup> → Ni
 <sup>4+</sup> redox. It has been reported that the lithium intercalation reaction is a two-phase reaction in LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, corresponding to the two-half plateau high-voltage regions.

 </sup> In this paper, the intercalation is more like a single-phase solid solution reaction based on the evolution trend of Δ
 <italic>S</italic>.

 </sup> The reason of the discrete conclusion with the previous report needs to be studied more in the future. One possible reason may be the content of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> in the samples, as it is reported that the increase in the degree of disorder by doping can make the Δ
 <italic>S</italic> get inclined to the slope.

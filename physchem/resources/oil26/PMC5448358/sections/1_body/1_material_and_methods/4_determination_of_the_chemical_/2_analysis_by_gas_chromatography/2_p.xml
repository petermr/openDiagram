<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The quantitative analysis of the essential oil was carried out using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 6,890 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20&#160;m&#160;&#215;&#160;0.18&#160;mm; 0.18&#160;&#956;m). The oven temperature was programmed to 50&#176;C for 3.2&#160;min, then heated to 300&#176;C at a rate of 10&#176;C/min. The temperatures of the injector and the flame ionization detector (FID) were maintained at 280&#176;C. The essential oils were diluted in acetone to 3.5% (v/v) and injected in split mode (1/60); hydrogen was used as the carrier gas (1&#160;ml/min), and the injection volume was 1&#160;&#956;l. At the same time, a solution of <italic>n</italic>&#8208;alkanes (C8&#8208;C30) was analyzed under the same conditions to calculate retention indices (RI) using the Van den Dool and Kratz equation (Van Del Dool &amp; Kratz, <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1963</xref>). The relative concentrations of the compounds were calculated from the peak area obtained by gas chromatography without using correction factors.</p>

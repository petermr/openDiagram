<p>Next, the predictive ability of the module genes for the recurrence process was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the central or module genes, NOL6, CDK15, MOV10, SAMM50, COL24A1, EPHX1 and DCP1A, showed that the patients could be divided into two groups with different risk in the recurrence, according to the median value of each gene expression as the cut-off value. Compared with patients at low risk, the PFS time of patients at high risk was significantly shorter (P&lt;0.05;

<p id="Par29">The sample was mixed in an equal ratio with 10 mg/mL α-cyano-4-hydroxcinnamic acid, directly spotted onto a spotting plate, and allowed to dry at room temperature. Peptide mass spectra were obtained with a 5800 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Foster City, USA). The MS/MS data of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) were submitted to the online software Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) for identification according to the NCBIProt database. The parameters were as follows: taxonomy, Homo sapiens; enzyme, trypsin; allowed missed cleavages, two; variable modification, oxidation (M); fixed modification, carbamidomethylation (C); and number of peptide charges, + 1. The peptide and fragment mass tolerances were set at ± 1.2 Da and ± 0.6 Da, respectively. The data format was selected as Mascot generic, and the instrument was selected as MALDI-TOF-TOF. Proteins with a score greater than 30 were regarded as trustworthy proteins[

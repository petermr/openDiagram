<p>Bioinformatic analysis has proved to be useful for protein identification and characterization. Three main research approaches have been reported. First, transcriptomic data (mRNA) can be used for the computational prediction of the signal peptide in genomic sequences and characterize them by computational tools [

Second, EST tags (EST2secretome) can be generated in a bioinformatic approach, where the signal peptide is identified, the sequences showing transmembrane motifs are eliminated, and ontological analyses are performed to infer functions. The mapping relies on known domains and metabolic pathways, as well as on the search for homologs [

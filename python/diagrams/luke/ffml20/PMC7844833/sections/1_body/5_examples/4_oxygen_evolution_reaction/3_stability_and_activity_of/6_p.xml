<p>Another approach to reduce the catalyst costs is the synthesis of core–shell NPs with the shell made of a noble metal and the core consisting of an earth-abundant materials. Tackett et al. proposed NPs with an Ir shell and a core consisting of Fe
 <sub>4</sub>N. Because of the inability of iridium to form nitrides, Ir segregates to surface and a stable catalyst structure is expected. 
 <italic>Operando</italic> XAS studies at the Ir L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge and Fe K-edge confirmed that the nitride core remained stable under OER conditions, while Ir–Fe bonding was confined only to NP surface.

 </sup> Alternatively, the catalysts price can be reduced by dispersing the IrO

 <italic>ex situ</italic> EXAFS data collected at Ir L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge showed that the majority of the Ir species in the resulting catalyst are in a highly distorted environment, consistent with the structure of rutile-type SnO
 <sub>2</sub>, suggesting Ir-doped SnO
 <sub>2</sub> as an important active site in this material.

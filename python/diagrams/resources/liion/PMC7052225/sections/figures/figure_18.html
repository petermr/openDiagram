 <caption> ( a) Initial charges (— and ‒ ‒ ‒) and discharges ( and ) obtained at a constant current of C/24 between 1.5 and 3.5 V versus graphite of two prelithiated PTCDA/graphite batteries. A paper Kodoshi separator is used, and an excess anode capacity is employed. ( b) Corresponding long cycling experiments are performed at a C/10 rate. The occurrence of a rapid formation is observed at 5 C. Full and empty characters represent charges and discharges, respectively. </caption>

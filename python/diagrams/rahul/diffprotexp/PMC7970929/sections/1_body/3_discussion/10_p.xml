 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>, heat shock proteins of zeaxanthin epoxidase which is a precursor of ABA synthesis and involved in abiotic stress has been identified

 <sup>2+</sup> permeable channels of the plasma membrane which further catalyse the Ca

 </sup>. Plant cells are capable of detoxification of ROS through its antioxidant machinery. One of the most prominent systems for removing hydrogen peroxide is an ascorbate–glutathione cycle which includes different antioxidative enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase

 </sup>. In present experiment, it was found that L-ascorbate peroxidase (DN34366_c0_g1_i1) and mono dehydro-ascorbate reductase (DN48599_c0_g1_i1) are up-regulated with increasing salt levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Catalase (DN29893_c0_g1_i1), and peroxidases (DN37483_c1_g1_i1) were also found to be up-regulated with an increase in the salt concentration as has been reported earlier in various studies

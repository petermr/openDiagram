0: Interlayer expansion and collapse, respectively, resulting from the intercalation and withdrawal of water, were monitored by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).
1: AcidBir and -MnO 2 powders were first heated to 105 C for 3 h under a dry N 2(g) flow to remove all interlayer water.
2: This was confirmed by the resulting XRD-derived  d-spacing.
3: After cooling to 25 C under the same dry N 2(g) flow, humidity was then incrementally increased to 98% during an adsorption leg and then incrementally decreased during the desorption leg.
4: The samples were allowed to equilibrate at each preselected RH value for 30 min prior to collecting the diffractograms.
5: The data were acquired using a PANalytical XPert 3 Powder instrument (1.54187 A CuK beam at 45 kV and 40 mA) at a resolution of 0.0334 in the 250 2 range.

Other steps for the Isoelectric focusing (Ist dimension run) and Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (IInd dimension run) were followed as mentioned in our earlier publication [

The IPG strips (18 cm, 3–10 linear pH gradients) was hydrated with 40 μg extracted protein diluted with rehydration buffer and IEF100 instrument was used for the separation of the proteins based on pI value. The image of the protein spots on the gels were scanned using Gel Documentation system (Bio-Rad, USA) and further, IMP7 version 7.0.6 software (GE Healthcare) was used for the image characterization. Based on the relative fold expression, 20 DEP spots (10 each) from HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk were used for the protein identification through MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis. The silver stained spots were picked up and processed for MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis as mentioned in Kumar et al. [

<p id="Par18">DBA Artemis samples were used for sRNA, transcriptome and degradome sequencing, based on the improvement of selected traits in DBA Artemis under the effects of transgenerational stress. A total of 90.30 million raw reads were generated for eight sRNA libraries (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Over 69.19 million valid sRNA reads were obtained after reads filtering. From the eight sRNA libraries, a total of 1739 MIR-miRNA entries were identified (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), considering both different MIR gene origins and different mature miRNA products. Of these, 965 were conserved miRNAs from 52 MIR families registered in the miRBase, and 774 were novel miRNAs (unique to

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>a) illustrate the distribution of miRNA numbers between different biological groups. The biological group with the highest number of unique miRNAs was AtCW, in both the flag leaf tissue and the developing grain tissue. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>b shows the conservation profile of the identified durum wheat miRNAs among the reference plant species. Expectedly, the highest conservation was found in bread wheat (

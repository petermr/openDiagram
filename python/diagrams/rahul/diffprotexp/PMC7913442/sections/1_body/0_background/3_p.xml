<p id="Par19">To further demonstrate the role of SMAD3 as a molecular partner of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> in aGCT progression on a genome-wide level, we carried out RNA-seq analysis in HGrC1 overexpressing FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> together with SMAD3, compared to FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup>/SMAD3 as a control. We further explored the FOXL2 antagonistic tumor-suppressive transcription factor FOXO1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] to study its influence on the SMAD3/FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> induced alterations. FOXO factors are considered as tumor suppressors for their parts in the initiation of apoptotic process and in the cell cycle arrest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We report that FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> over-expression was associated with altered signaling pathways previously recognized by transcriptomic studies from GC in situ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and additionally identified novel candidate FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> targets. Furthermore, we observed that FOXO1 strongly mitigated the overall FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> action with important implications for both aGCT onset and future therapeutic development.

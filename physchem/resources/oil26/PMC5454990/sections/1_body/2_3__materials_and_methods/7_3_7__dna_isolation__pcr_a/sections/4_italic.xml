<italic>matK</italic> primers consisted of an initial denaturation step for 2 min at 95 &#176;C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 &#176;C, 30 s at 61 &#176;C, 60 s at 68 &#176;C, and 60 s at 72 &#176;C for final extension. Amplifications were performed in an Eppendorf MasterCycler Pro thermocycler, the PCR products were visualized in agarose gel (1%), purified, and then they were sent to Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA) for sequencing.

<p id="Par3">The partitioning of paraxial mesoderm into repetitive segments, termed somites, is a key feature of vertebrate embryos. During amniote gastrulation, mesoderm cells emerge from the primitive streak and migrate in characteristic trajectories to generate axial, paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm (LPM)

 </sup>. Paraxial mesoderm is located on either side of the midline tissues, neural tube and notochord. As the body axis extends, it consecutively generates pairs of somites

 </sup>. On the ventral side cells undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form the sclerotome, while on the dorsal side the cells in the dermomyotome remain epithelial. From the dermomyotome edges cells transition to form the myotome, in-between the sclerotome and dermomyotome

 </sup>. Concomitantly with somite morphogenesis, the differentiation potential of somite cells becomes more restricted, with cells eventually becoming specified towards the lineages of the musculoskeletal system, including chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Overall the process of somitogenesis generates a spatiotemporal gradient of differentiation within the paraxial mesoderm along the embryonic body axis

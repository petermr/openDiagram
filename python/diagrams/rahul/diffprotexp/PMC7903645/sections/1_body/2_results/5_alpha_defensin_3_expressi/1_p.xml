<p id="Par45">RNA-Seq analysis identified DEFA3 as one of the top upregulated DEGs in the CI group compared to in controls; it was also significantly upregulated in the CI-term compared to in the CI-preterm group. Moreover, the DEFA3 mRNA expression pattern was consistent with the results of RNA-Seq analysis. Therefore, we performed an immunoassay to confirm the differential expression of serum alpha defensin 3 in women with CI (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25) and normal controls (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17). The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Alpha defensin 3 was significantly upregulated in the CI group compared to in the control group [14.9 ng/mL (10.5–47.2 ng/mL) vs 9.9 ng/mL (4.6–17.2 ng/mL), 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a]. We further analyzed the expression of alpha defensin 3 between the CI-term group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) and CI preterm group (n = 17). Although the median concentration of alpha defensin 3 in the CI-term group was higher than that in the CI-preterm group, it was not significant [26.4 ng/mL (11.0–86.3 ng/mL) vs. 14.0 ng/mL (7.4–29.6 ng/mL), 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.215; Fig.

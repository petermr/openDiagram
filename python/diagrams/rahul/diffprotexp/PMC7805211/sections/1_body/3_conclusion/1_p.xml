<p id="Par20">The epigenetic distinctions between CNFs and PNFs extend from the level of chromatin conformational change down to altered expression of proteins that regulate or modulate RAS signaling. These findings are intriguing given that the analyzed tumors arose in the context of RAS deregulation as a result of NF1 deficiency. Based on KEGG pathway analysis, it is likely that methylation events are involved in regulation of pain signaling down to the level of inflammatory mediator production. More work is needed in many aspects of neurofibroma epigenetics, including studies targeting p38 and its downstream effectors. As such, we present a new signaling paradigm where differential methylation between tumor types results in reinforcement of inflammatory signaling in CNFs, and classical RAS/MEK/ERK activation towards growth in PNFs.</p>

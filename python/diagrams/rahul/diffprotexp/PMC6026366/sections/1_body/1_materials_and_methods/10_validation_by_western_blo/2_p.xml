<p id="p0085">Six differentially expressed proteins (VATA, GPDA, HSP70, 1433Z, ALF, and UCHL1) were randomly selected for further verification using Western blotting. Total protein from both wild type and RGE-treated flies were extracted using lysis buffer and concentrations determined (as described above). Equal amounts of proteins (40–50 μg) were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide–SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) using standard methods blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (NFDM; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) freshly made in TBS-T [Tween-Tris buffered saline: 0.1% Tween-20 in 100mM Tris–HCL (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl], rock on a rotating shaker for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies (dilution 1:1,000 in TBS-T/1% NFDM) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, washed three times of 15 min each with TBS-T, and then incubated for an additional 1.5 h with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilution 1:2000 in TBS-T/1% NFDM) at 37°C. The levels of selected proteins were visualized using an ECL system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). The Western blots were performed in triplicate, and the target protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry using Image J (version 1.50) (National Institutes of Health, MD, USA) processing software and normalized to the signal intensity of GAPDH.</p>

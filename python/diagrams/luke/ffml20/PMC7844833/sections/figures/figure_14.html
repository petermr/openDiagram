 <caption> (a) Contraction of the Au–Au bond lengths in size-selected micellar Au NPs encapsulated by PS-P2VP ligands and supported on γ-Al 2O 3 compared to similar model Au NPs with and without the surface ligands as a function of the 1st shell CN. Structure models of NPs with and without ligands are shown in the insets. Reproduced with permission from ref ( 259). Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society. (b) Relation between the Cu–Cu interatomic distance and the 1st shell coordination numbers in ultrasmall soft-landed Cu clusters deposited on ZrO 2 and ZnO. Reproduced with permission from ref ( 37).

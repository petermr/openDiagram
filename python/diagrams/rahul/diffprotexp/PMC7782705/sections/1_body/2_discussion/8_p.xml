 </sup>. BIN1 comprises a N-BAR domain involved in membrane curvature sensing, an SH3 domain that binds to proline-rich motifs, and a clathrin-binding domain (CLAP) specific of the neuronal isoform 1

 </sup>. We show that the transcript encoding for this latter isoform is significantly reduced in the temporal lobe, suggesting that expression of BIN1 isoform 1 in neurons could be reduced. This observation is in line with decreased BIN1 isoform 1 protein expression in the AD brain compared with controls (our own results)

0: Full-length CPSF1 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian vector pENTER for overexpression and confirmed by sequencing.
1: The plasmid was transfected into HCC cell lines using Lipofectamine TM 3000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States).
2: For knockdown assays, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CPSF1 were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
3: Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine TM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).
4: The siRNA sequences used are listed in  Supplementary Table 1.

0: For cohort 3, the extraction of chondrocytes has previously been described 35 in the majority of these samples, with the remaining samples following the same protocol.
1: The protocol was based on that for cohorts 1, 2, 4 and highly similar as described in the following.
2: Each cartilage portion was minced with a scalpel and placed in 20 ml of Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 6 mgml 1 collagenase A (Sigma).
3: The tissue culture flasks were incubated overnight to digest the cartilage pieces.
4: The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 30 m filter (Miltenyi) and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min.
5: The cell pellet was then re-suspended in 1 ml of PBS and counted on a haemocytometer following 1:1 mixing with trypan blue to determine cell viability.

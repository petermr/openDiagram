<p>The sea anemone toxin polypeptide π-AnmTX Hcr 1b-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8b</xref>), can be extracted from 
 <italic>Heteractis crispa</italic> and has a similar amino acid identity to APETx2 (49%), also being found to inhibit the transient phase with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.5 µM at pH 4 [
 <xref rid="cit0201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. Another sea anemone toxin is PhcrTx1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8c</xref>), extracted from 
 <italic>Phymanthus crucifer</italic>, which partially inhibits acid-evoked currents (≤44%) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 100 nM, however, this was conducted in DRG neurones and thus the effect may not be specific to only inhibition of homomeric ASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Lastly, Ugr9-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8d</xref>) is a further sea anemone toxin extracted from 
 <italic>Urticina grebelnyi</italic> and completely inhibited the transient component of hASIC3 currents, at pH 5.5 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 10 μM), as well as partially inhibiting the amplitude of the sustained component (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.44 μM); however, whilst APETx2 inhibits NaV1.8 and PhcrTx1 inhibits voltage-gated K
 <sup>+</sup> channels, such inhibition was not observed with Ugr9-1 [
 <xref rid="cit0203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>].

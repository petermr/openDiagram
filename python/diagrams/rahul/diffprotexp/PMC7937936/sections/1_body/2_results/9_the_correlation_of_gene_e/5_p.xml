<p>CCR4 demonstrated its independent predictive value of OS in the univariate Cox regression analysis in TCGA-HNSC data set (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis of CCR4, although not significant, it showed a predictive value that was not weaker than that of the T-stage (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.057) (

 <italic>P &lt;</italic>0.05) (see in

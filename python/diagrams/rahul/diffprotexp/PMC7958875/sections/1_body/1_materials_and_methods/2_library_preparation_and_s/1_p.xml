<p>Reverse transcription, PCR, and library preparation were performed as detailed previously (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Howick et al., 2019</xref>) using a modified Smart-seq2 (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>) protocol with a non-anchored oligoDT and 25 PCR cycles. Libraries were multiplexed up to 384 and sequenced on a single lane of HiSeq 2500 v4 with 75 bp paired-end reads.

<p>Five up-regulated DEGs (
 <italic>S100A9, IL1R2, IRAK3, NFKBIA</italic> and 
 <italic>GAS7</italic>) were selected based on AUROCC ≥ 0.82 and whether the genes have secretory functions of proteins as they may be better suited to a point-of-care assay. Gene expression was measured by RT-qPCR in survivors (n = 8) at day 0, day 5, day 12, and day 28 to test whether expression decreases as patients recovered. The trend of gene expression at day 0, day 5, day 12, and day 28 were determined by calculating the fold change reduction. None of the five genes had major changes in expression at day 5 but 
 <italic>S100A9, IRAK3</italic> and 
 <italic>IL1R2</italic> subsequently had decreased expression over time as patients recovered (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and Supplementary Table 7). Expression of 
 <italic>S100A9, IRAK3, IL1R2</italic> and 
 <italic>NFKBIA</italic> significantly decreased at day 28 relative to day 5. Expression of 
 <italic>S100A9</italic>, 
 <italic>IRAK3</italic>, and 
 <italic>NFKBIA</italic> in patients decreased at day 28 but did not reach to the expression level of healthy controls (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). However, expression of 
 <italic>IL1R2</italic> and 
 <italic>GAS7</italic> rapidly decreased to the same level of healthy controls and did not change further after day 12 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The mean fold changes (day 28/day 5) for gene expression of 8 individual patients and 95% CI are shown in Supplementary Table 8.

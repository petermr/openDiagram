<p id="Par10">This problem is particularly relevant for 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, whose genome annotation is relatively incomplete despite its clinical significance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Even with the advancement of sequencing techniques and computational power, over 33% of predicted genes in the parasite genome remain functionally unannotated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which represent a great challenge for discovering vaccine candidates and therapeutic drugs. Furthermore, untranslated region such as 5′ and 3′ UTRs are also absent in the annotation, which have been shown to regulate protein expression in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The lack of annotation despite community efforts can be attributed to several factors. As an 
 <italic>Apicomplexan</italic> parasite, it is evolutionarily distant from other eukaryotic model organism where less than 25% of the protein sequences share significant similarity with those outside the phylum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Even within the same phylum, many of the parasites have evolved pathways for cell invasion of their specific host and, therefore, only 12–34% of the protein-coding genes are shared by all apicomplexans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, there is a pressing need for improving the genome annotation of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

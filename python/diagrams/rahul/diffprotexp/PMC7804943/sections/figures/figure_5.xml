  <title>Variable contributions of transcriptomic regulatory layers to the definition of neuronal identity.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Heatmap showing the Pearson correlation (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup>) between pairs of latent factor weights assigned to each sample inferred when only GE data is analyzed (
   <italic>y</italic>-axis) and when only APA_AS_IR data are analyzed (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis). Latent factors that are highly correlated indicate neuronal population groupings identified by GE data only, and independently by APA_AS_IR data. 
   <bold>b</bold> Combined scatter and contour plot comparing the latent factor weights between GE-LF1 and APA_AS_IR-LF5. Both factors identify a cluster of hippocampal neurons. However, each factor distinguishes the neurons differently (see Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> for description of contour plots). 
   <bold>c</bold> Comparison between GE-LF4 and APA_AS_IR-LF4. Both factors identify a cluster of peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons. However, GE-LF4 specifically identifies a subset of PNS neurons belonging to the olfactory system. 
   <bold>d</bold> Multiple “layers” of coordinated transcriptomic regulatory networks collectively and differentially contribute to establishing neuronal identity throughout the nervous system. Brain schematic by Patrick Lynch

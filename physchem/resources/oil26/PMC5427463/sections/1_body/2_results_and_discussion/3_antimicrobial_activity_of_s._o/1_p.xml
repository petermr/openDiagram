<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The ability of the SoEO to inhibit bacteria and fungi (indicator organisms) was summarized (see Table 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T3">(Tab. 3)</xref> and 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T4">(Tab. 4)</xref>). Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were inhibited by the SoEO. According to MIC and MBC values reported in Table 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T3">(Tab. 3)</xref>, the SoEO showed an interesting activity against the Gram-positive pathogens (<italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>M. luteus</italic>) and also a very good activity against <italic>B. cereus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with MIC values of 0.625 and 0.312 mg/mL, respectively. However, the SoEO cultivated in south Brazil, showed no activity against several <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> strains (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]).</p>

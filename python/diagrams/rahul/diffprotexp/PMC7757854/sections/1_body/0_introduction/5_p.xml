<p>In the current study, adipogenesis in MEFs transcriptome profiles was explored using generated DEGs at different timepoints. DEG lists relevant to adipose were generated based on statistical significance and used for an RRA method, and in construction of PPI and gene networks. Therefore, this study aims to utilizes transcriptome analysis methodology to acquire resourceful understanding in gene expression changes in MEFs that underlie adipocyte differentiation.</p>

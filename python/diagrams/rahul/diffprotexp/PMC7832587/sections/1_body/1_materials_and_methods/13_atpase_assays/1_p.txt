0: Between 5 and 10 L of home-made GFP-Trap  beads coupled with PcATP2-GFP-BAD/Cdc50B-10xHis (wild-type and mutant), and corresponding to 100 ng of PcATP2-GFP-BAD, were diluted into 50 L of the reaction buffer (50 mM MOPS-Tris pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM NaN3, 0.5 mg/mL DDM, 0.1 mg/mL CHS), supplemented or not (no lipid experiments) with 0.45 mg/ml of the phospholipid substrate and, when indicated, with 0.025 mg/ml of PI4P.
1: Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and moved to ice for 15 min more.
2: The reaction was initiated after the addition of 1 mM ATP-Mg 2+ and incubated at 37C for 25 min.
3: The reaction was stopped by dropping the test tubes into liquid N 2.
4: To quantify the hydrolyzed ATP, we used the BIOMOL Green solution (Enzo Biochem Inc), a proprietary mixing solution that uses a molybdate/malachite green-based assay to quantify the released Pi.
5: Thus, 100 L of BIOMOL Green solution was added to each sample, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
6: After incubation, samples were quickly spun down to pellet the beads, and 100 L of clear supernatant were deposited in a 96-well plate to measure the absorbance at 620 nm.
7: Standard calibration curves at each experimental buffer condition were made using a phosphate standard solution provided by the BIOMOL Green supplier.

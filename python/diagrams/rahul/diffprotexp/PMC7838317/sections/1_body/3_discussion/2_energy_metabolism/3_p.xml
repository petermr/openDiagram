 </sup>. We found that metabolites involved in energy metabolism (e.g., fructose, galactose, glucose, lactate, arabinose) and most lipids did not differ between captive and wild mussels. These results led us to conclude that energy metabolism was not affected by captivity. However, our present results show that energy metabolism is impacted by the stress of captivity. It may be that while the 
 <italic>levels</italic> of metabolites in the organism remain constant, the 
 <italic>flux</italic> of these metabolites through the energy pathways has increased, which may explain the up-regulation of metabolite-interconverting enzymes. However, these studies were conducted in different years and energy metabolism may have been influenced by different factors, such as temperature, natural food availability, or reproductive state.

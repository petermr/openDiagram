<p id="Par63">Clustering analysis split all DETs into six clusters displaying distinct expression patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Cluster 1 included transcripts up-regulated in the sexual samples at all stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Clusters 2 and 3 showed transcripts up-regulated in apomictic samples at all stages, while clusters 4, 5 and 6 displayed variable divergent expression patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Particularly, Cluster 6 includes a group of transcripts showing expression heterochronicity, with entities overexpressed at postmeiosis/anthesis in apomictic plants but at premeiosis/meiosis in sexual ones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). In the case of all DEATs, two major clusters were established (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). In Cluster 1, members show variable expression in sexual samples in the course of development, while in apomictic ones the expression seems lower or null (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). The opposite behaviour was observed in Cluster 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).

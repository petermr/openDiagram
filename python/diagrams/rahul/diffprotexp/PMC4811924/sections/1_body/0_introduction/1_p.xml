 <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> (
 <italic>S. suis</italic>) is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes a wide range of diseases in pigs, including meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and arthritis (Gottschalk et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In addition, this pathogen is an emerging zoonotic agent and an important public health issue in East and Southeast Asia (Sriskandan and Slater, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gottschalk et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). During a single outbreak in China in 2005, more than 200 human cases of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> were reported, with a death total of 39 (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Current studies show that 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> can cause persistent infections by forming biofilms 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).

<p>To summarize, we report protein profiles differing between benign cystic thyroid lesions and cPTCs based on proteomic analyses of cyst fluids. The findings may potentially lead to improved overall sensitivity of FNAB for thyroid cysts. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive catalogue of the protein content in fluid from thyroid cystic lesions. Based on data from LC-MS/MS, IHC, WB and ELISA we hypothesize that CK-19 could be determined in cyst fluid by ELISA and potentially used as a diagnostic marker of cPTC complementary to FNAB. The role of S100A13 and CK-19 proteins should be evaluated in prospective studies on independent tumor material using FNAB samples taken preoperatively.</p>

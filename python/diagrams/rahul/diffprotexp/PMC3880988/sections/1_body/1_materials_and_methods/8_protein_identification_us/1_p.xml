<p>Identification of protein spots were performed through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Protein samples were extracted according to the standard techniques described previously 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. The peptides were analysed using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (Dionex, Thermoscientific, CA, USA) coupled to a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The peptides were loaded onto a C18 PepMap100, 3 Î¼m (LC Packings, Dionex, Thermoscientific, CA, USA) before being separated by a linear gradient of water/acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (v/v).

<p>A plethora of DEGs induced in 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> by the endosymbiont 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> were revealed in this study. However, 38.3% (1,930 of the 5,042) of 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> genes were identified to be hypothetical proteins. Proportions of theses hypothetical proteins in the 12 and 24 hr pi groups can be ascribed to the lack of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. database. Our investigation of the DEGs in 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> by an endosymbiont provides important information to understanding the survival strategy utilized by notable intracellular pathogen 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic>. Future studies investigating the presence of an endosymbiosis-specific gene may help elucidate the underlying mechanism involved in 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> pathogenesis, which would contribute to understanding the inhibition of phagocytosis within 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> or even immune evasion mechanism in human macrophages.

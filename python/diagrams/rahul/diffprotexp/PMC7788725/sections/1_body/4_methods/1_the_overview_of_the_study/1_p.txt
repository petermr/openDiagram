0: In order to make this study more comprehensible, we draw a flowchart.
1: Through the analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA-seq data, some key differential expressed genes whose binding sites on euchromatin were changed by LMNA mutations were obtained, and these genes were deeply analyzed to further clarify the pathogenesis of DCM caused by LMNA mutations.
2: It is visualized in Fig.

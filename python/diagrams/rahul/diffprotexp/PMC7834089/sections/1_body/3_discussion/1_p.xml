<p>In the present study, we investigated the effects of the vagus nerve on VMC, demonstrating that right cervical vagotomy aggravates the inflammatory response through regulation of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. We found that right cervical vagotomy increases the proportion of Th1 and Th17 cells, decreases the proportion of Th2 and Treg cells in the spleen, upregulates the expressions of T-bet, Ror-γ, IFN-γ, and IL-17, and downregulates expression levels of Gata3, Foxp3, and IL-4 in the heart. Furthermore, our study showed that blocking CAP inhibited JAK2-STAT3 activation, enhanced NF-κB activation in splenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, increased the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells, and decreased the percentages of Th2 and Treg cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Additionally, vagotomy-upregulated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbated the severity of myocardial lesions and cellular infiltration, and worsened cardiac function in VMC mice. In contrast, pnu282987 administration showed the opposite effects. Moreover, the abnormalities observed in VMC+Vag mice were alleviated by pnu282987 treatment. These results demonstrate that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in protecting myocardium from virus infection, which may benefit by regulating CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation in VMC. Activation of CAP by pnu282987 inhibited production of proinflammatory cytokines, regardless of the integrity of the vagus nerve in this model.

<p id="Par20">Considering the differences in subcellular localization between the different brain samples, we investigated whether subcellular localization of lncRNAs could vary between different tissue contexts. When we compared the subcellular localization patterns of lncRNAs in the brain samples and ten cell lines from the ENCODE project, we clearly show that some lncRNAs have opposite subcellular localization patterns in different samples. This indicates that the subcellular localization of certain lncRNAs is dynamic, which could be explained by several processes including tissue-specific functionality or regulation, or that some lncRNA are retained in the nuclear compartment to regulate their function, assuming that their site of action is in the cytosol. Our results provide a resource for lncRNAs enriched in cytosol and nucleus in both fetal and adult human brain samples. We also provide evidence for the differential subcellular localization of lncRNAs in tissues. These data further encourage the need to understand the mechanisms that control the subcellular fate of lncRNAs and the biological consequences of this process.</p>

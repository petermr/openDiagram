 <caption> Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway terms. Differentially expressed proteins from the depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus, A), anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus, C), and insusceptible (Insus, E) groups were analyzed with Gene Ontology (GO) database, and the top ten enriched biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) terms were shown. The significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway terms in the Dep-Sus ( B), Anx-Sus ( D), and Insus ( F) groups were indicated with titles in red. The x-axis displays the negative p value (log10). </caption>

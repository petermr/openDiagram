<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Both identified critical sites associated with large spectral shifts (i.e., S134A in gerbil and A48T in elephant-shrew) occur in exon 2. By comparing orthologous exonic sequence across vertebrates, we found the same S134A replacement in some ray-finned fishes, lobe-finned fishes, and jawless fishes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2002235117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S3</ext-link>). Thus the mechanism underlying the &#8722;6-nm &#955;<sub>max</sub> shift in the gerbil may have evolved independently in multiple vertebrate lineages. Indeed, the S134A replacement may also explain tuning in the cave fish, where a reported shift from 564 nm to 558 nm could not be fully explained by the five critical sites (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The second replacement, A48T, was only seen in hedgehog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2002235117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S3</ext-link>).</p>

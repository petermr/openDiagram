 <italic>Amelogenesis imperfecta</italic> (AI) and tooth loss are the diseases that characterized by genetic defects in the formation of enamel and teeth. Multiple studies have suggested these genetic disorders are mainly caused by mutations of protein-coding genes functioned in formation of enamel and teeth (

 <italic>AMBN</italic> and

 <italic>C4orf26</italic>, 
 <italic>AMTN</italic>, 
 <italic>ODAM</italic>,

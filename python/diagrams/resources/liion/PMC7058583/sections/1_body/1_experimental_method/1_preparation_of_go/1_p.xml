<p>GO was prepared based on improved Hummers method. 1.5 g of potash nitrate (NaNO
 <sub>3</sub>) and 3.0 g of flake graphite were dissolved in 100 mL of sulfuric acid (H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, 98%), and stirred for 0.5 h under 10°C. Then, 10.0 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>) was slowly added to the mixture, followed by continuous magnetic stirring for 0.5 h. This mixture was diluted with 700 mL deionized water and continued to stir at 95°C for 1 h. Afterward, 30% hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, 15 mL) was dropped to the mixture and turned dark green solution into a bright yellow one. The suspension was then washed with 1:10 HCl solution and deionized water for several times. Finally, the obtained GO was freeze-dried for 48 h.

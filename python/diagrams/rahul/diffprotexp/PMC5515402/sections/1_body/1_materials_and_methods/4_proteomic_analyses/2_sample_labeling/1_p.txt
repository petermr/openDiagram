0: Cy5 and Cy3 labeling for analytical gels: Five (5) g of total protein from GT1-7 cells samples (4 controls, 4 AAS) were speed-vacuum dried and resuspended in cell lysis buffer.
1: Samples were reduced by incubation with 2 nM TCEP (tris-[2-carboxyethyl] phosphoine hydrochloride; GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) at 37C for 1 h and then labeled with 4 nM of Cy5 saturation dye (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) for 30 min at 37C.
2: One volume sample buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS), pH3-10NL IPG buffer, and 130 mM DTT was added to the samples.
3: An internal standard was prepared by pooling 5 g total protein of each sample, mixed together, and then speed vacuum-dried.
4: Protein pellet was resuspended with cell lysis buffer and reduced with 2nM TCEP per 5 g protein for 1 h at 37C.
5: The proteins were labeled with 4 nM of Cy3 saturation dye per 5 g protein for 30 min at 37C.
6: One volume sample buffer was added to the samples.
7: Each 5 g of sample labeled with Cy5 was mixed with 5 g of internal standard labeled with Cy3.
8: Rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS), and 60 mM DTT, pH 3-10NL IPG buffer was added to a final volume of 450 l.

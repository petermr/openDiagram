 <caption> Distribution of differentially regulated genes across the human genome for each comparison performed on the HLHS cohort. The outermost circle represents minimally differential gene regulation in pre-operative samples for patients with and without low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS). The second inner circle compares the differentially regulated genes in post-operative samples of patients with and without LCOS, again showing minimal differential in gene regulation. The third inner circle represents gene expression between pre-operative and post-operative samples in patients who did not develop LCOS, and shows a robust signature. The innermost circle represents the most abundant differential expression, both in terms of number of genes and absolute fold changes, when comparing post-operative samples over pre-operative samples in patients who developed LCOS. Red color indicates increased expression and the blue color indicates decreased expression for the respective comparison.

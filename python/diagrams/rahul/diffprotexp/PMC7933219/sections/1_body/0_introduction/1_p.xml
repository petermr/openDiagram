<p>Tumor metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related death in humans. It is a complex process that involves a wide variety of cell–cell communication (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">HDaF, 1996</xref>). According to the “seed and soil” hypothesis, primary tumor cells first invade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) and stromal cell layers, intravasate into the bloodstream, and then survive and disseminate in the circulation and reach distant organs (

During this complex cascade of events, tumor cells have shown an ability to induce endothelial changes by directly targeting cells via soluble factors, adhesion receptors, gap junctions, and vesicles (

Evidence has been provided that tumor cells can increase the number of dead endothelial cells when they were co-cultured and that tumor cell-induced endothelial necroptosis promotes tumor cell extravasation and metastasis, leaving gaps in the endothelial barrier (

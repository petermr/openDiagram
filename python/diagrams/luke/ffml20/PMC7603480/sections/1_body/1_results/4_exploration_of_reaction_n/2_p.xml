<p id="Par31">To validate the proposed ML models for this application, additional DFT calculations were performed on the out-of-sample systems. Unfortunately, these systems mostly decompose or rearrange upon DFT geometry optimization. Note that this does not necessarily mean that they are inherently unstable, however, just that the corresponding local minima were not found when starting from a (inaccurate) UFF geometry. We therefore used DFT single point calculations on UFF geometries here. Overall, a good correlation between DFT and ML-predicted energies is found, with systematically lower ML AEs (see SI). This systematic bias can easily be understood since the ML models predict the DFT energies of relaxed geometries, but the validation energies are for frozen UFF geometries. The latter is by definition larger than the former. This shows that the ML model can be used to estimate relaxed DFT energies even when these are not readily available from DFT calculations.</p>

0: The GC analysis of AcEO was performed on an Agilent 5973 N GC-MS coupled to an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with an injector at 250 C (Splitless mode) and equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column coated with 5% phenyl-methyl siloxane (30 m length  0.25 mm internal diameter  0.25 m of film thickness, Agilent 19091S-433).
1: The column pressure was set to 51.6  103 Pa.
2: The oven temperature was held at 40 C for 2 min, and then programmed to 250 C at a rate of 8 C/min.
3: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min.
4: Diluted sample in diethyl ether was manually injected.

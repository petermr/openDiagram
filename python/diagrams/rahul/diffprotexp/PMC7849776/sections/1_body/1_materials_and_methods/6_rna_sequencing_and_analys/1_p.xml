<p>The overnight culture of the strains was diluted 100-fold and incubated at 37°C with aeration until A
 <sub>600</sub> was 1.0. RNA stabilization, extraction, and sequencing were performed, as explained in the previous report [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Differentially expressed genes were identified using CLC Genomics Workbench software, version 12.0 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Reads were aligned to the USA300 genome allowing a minimum length fraction of 0.95 and minimum similarity fraction of 0.95. Genes with false discovery rate (FDR) 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and minimum fold expression 2 were classified as having significantly different expression. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using GO enrichment analysis, as explained previously [

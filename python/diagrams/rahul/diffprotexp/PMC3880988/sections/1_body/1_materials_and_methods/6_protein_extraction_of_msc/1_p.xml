<p>Alginate constructs were solubilized in 55mM sodium citrate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. The dissolved alginate beads were centrifuged at 300 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. The MSC and ACs were then lysed in 2-D Protein Extraction Buffer (GE Healthcare, USA) containing urea and NP-40 and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) for 1 hour using shaker at room temperature. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 15000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at 4Â°C. Protein concentration was quantified using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockfold, IL USA).

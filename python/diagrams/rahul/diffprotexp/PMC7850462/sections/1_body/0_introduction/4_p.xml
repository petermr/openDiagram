<p>Considering the negative role of miR-34b-5p in sepsis-induced organ injury, we hypothesized that the deficiency of AQP2 might be associated with dysregulated miR-34b-5p in septic AKI. Online database further predicted that miR-34b-5p could bind AQP2. Therefore, we conducted experiments to validate the interaction of miR-34b-5p with AQP2 in septic AKI using a HK-2 cell model.</p>

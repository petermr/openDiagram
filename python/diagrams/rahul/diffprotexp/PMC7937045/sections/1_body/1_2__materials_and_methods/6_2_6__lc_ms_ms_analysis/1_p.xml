<p>The prepared samples were separated and identified by liquid chromatography- (Ultimate3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) tandem mass spectrometry (Q-Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Samples were first loaded separately on a trap column (150 
 <italic>μ</italic>m × 20 mm) packed with SP-300-ODS-AP (3 
 <italic>μ</italic>m particle diameter; 100 nm pore size in house). Each sample was eluted into an analytical column (75 
 <italic>μ</italic>m × 15 mm), packed with SP-300-ODS-AP, and separated at a flow rate of 500 nL∙min
 <sup>−1</sup> with an elution gradient consisting of mobile phase B (80% acetonitrile, 20% H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase A (99.9% H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 0.1% formic acid). Elution gradient solutions were added as follows: B was increased from 4% to 10% in 5 minutes, from 10% to 12.5% in 10 minutes, from 12.5% to 27.5% in 75 minutes, from 27.5% to 50% in 110 minutes, and from 50% to 95% in 10 minutes. The LC system was automatically equilibrated with mobile phase A for approximately 10 minutes before the next analysis. Fractions were continuously detected in the Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer with a nanoelectrospray ionization source at a capillary temperature of 250°C and a spray voltage of 2,500 V.

<p>Before induction, cells were spindle-shaped, which is the typical morphology of MSCs (

 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs acquired a neural-like shape (
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). However, if the NIM supplemented with ERK inhibitor was used, neuronal differentiation was somewhat retarded. After the induction of MSCs for 7 days and 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs for 5 days, both groups expressed the dopaminergic neuron marker TH and mature neuronal marker MAP2. However, neither the neural progenitor marker Nestin nor the glial cell marker GFAP were expressed. The expression of the neural markers TH and MAP2 was significantly reduced when the ERK pathway was blocked during neuronal induction.

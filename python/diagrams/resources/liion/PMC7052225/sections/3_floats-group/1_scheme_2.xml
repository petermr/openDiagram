  <p>Schematic of new method developed for the fabrication of self-standing electrode films. The first step is the formation of a carbon current collector made of cellulose fibers and VGCF. The second step is the formation of a Li-ion electrode directly on the carbon current collector (red color refers to PTCDA cathode material).</p>

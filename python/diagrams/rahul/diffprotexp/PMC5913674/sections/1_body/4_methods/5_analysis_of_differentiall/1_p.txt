0: Relative quantitation of protein abundance in MtzR compared to MtzS isogenic lines was derived from the ratio of the TMT label detected in each MtzR to MtzS replicate.
1: As such, there were 9 ratios for each MtzR vs MtzS comparison, and the geometric mean was calculated to establish the fold change for each protein identified.
2: Further to ratio-derived fold changes, protein abundance between MtzR and MtzS lines was evaluated statistically via a 1-sample  t test using the tenth channel (pooled control) to normalize MtzR and MtzS replicate labels.
3: Differential expression required proteins to meet both ratio fold change (<1.3 or >0.77) and a significant  P value (> 0.05) [ 36,  37].
4: Further statistical evaluation of the dataset was performed, with an unsupervised multivariate PCA performed on the entire dataset using the log-transformed ratios of samples over the pooled control (tenth channel) and an analysis of the  P value distribution using paired  t tests between triplicates of MtzR and MtzS lines.
5: The Pearson correlation between log-transformed fold change in transcript [ 18] and protein abundances was calculated in R and visualized using the ggplot2 library.
6: For brevity, the gene accession prefix, GL50803, was omitted during further discussions of individual genes.

<p>Instead of dissolving the active material completely, attempts can be made to refresh or reactivate it to recover any capacity or properties lost during cycling. This is referred as direct recycling. It is claimed to be less costly than leaching because intervention on the active material is minimized. One may argue that full refunctionalization needs at least the same number of steps as the leaching/resynthesis process and, thus, may not represent an economic advantage.</p>

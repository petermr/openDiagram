 <p>Glycoside scutellarin enhanced inhalable 
  <italic>Î³</italic>-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework particles anchoring in larynx. As a proof-of-concept, dexamethasone co-delivered with scutellarin (SCU) had enhanced laryngeal deposition. Laryngeal deposition of dried powders was evaluated using the Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor. Molecular simulation revealed the scutellarin incorporation in CD-MOF and its effect to the surface properties.

<p id="Par58">To further assess the prognostic value of different clinical characteristics in BLCA patients from the TCGA database, we performed Cox regression analysis. The result of univariable analysis showed that age, tumour stage, and risk score were related to OS in BLCA patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>a). In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, only tumour stage and risk score remained independent prognostic indicators for BLCA patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>b).

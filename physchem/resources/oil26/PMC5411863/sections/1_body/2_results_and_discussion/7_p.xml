<p>Altitudinal changes sea level is an important factor influencing terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, significant change in altitude level can bring about corresponding changes in temperature, relative humid, wind speed, available water, and radiation rate. As a result, changes in environmental conditions will alter many eco-physiological reactions in plant bodies. Secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>K. anatolica</italic> are strongly influenced by edaphic factors, climate and geologic formation. The study area is located in transition area of Mediterranean climate and Mediterranean-Steppe climate. Climatic characteristics can show significant variations at short distances due to topographic structure. Sample areas at high altitudes located in Mediterranean-Steppe climate have calcareous soil textures with semi dry cool and semi mountainous humid climates. Low altitudes sample areas are located in Mediterranean climate with in general red and decalcified soils and very humid climates (Fakir et al., 2015). Hence, it is expected that changing ecological niches will alter the essential oil compositions and its components, as seen in the present study especially in the case of the constituents like: a-Pinene, Î²-Pinene, a-Phellandrene, a-Thujene and l-Limonene.

<p>It has been previously demonstrated that NSAIDs help to improve clinical outcomes of specific antiviral agents and combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy of the acute RSV infection looks most promising, as it was previously demonstrated with the combination of anti-RSV antibody therapy with NSAID or corticosteroids [

It blocks virus entry by inhibiting the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. The BRSV model was used to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of this therapeutic agent, GS-561937 (or GS1). It is a close structural analog of GS-5806, RSV FPI, developed for humans. GS1 demonstrated clear therapeutic effect by reducing the viral load, disease symptom score and lung pathology in experimental calves [

 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These promising results raised a question regarding the efficacy of combined FPI and COX inhibitor therapy and the possible benefit of this combination suggesting that the combination of a NSAID and a specific antiviral agent can improve the outcome of the disease even more than one treatment alone.

<p>In this paper, the mixture of nitrate, glacial acetic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid was used to nitrate GO. The mixed acid could protonate the nitrate ion and subsequently make water elimination, which could produce nitronium cation (NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) with high concentration effectively and safely. Then the nitrification reaction process was determined by the structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The dispersion ability of the NGO in solvents was explored and molecular dynamics (MD) was employed to simulate the changes in hydrophilicity, reflecting the hygroscopicity of NGO indirectly. Simultaneous analysis measurements were used to analyze the thermal stability and the combustion performance of NGO has been observed preliminarily.

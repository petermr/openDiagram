  <p>Gene expression patterns of RNA-seq and correlation with RT-qPCR. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) at day 1 of regeneration. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Volcano plot of DETs at day 3 of regeneration. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Bar plots show upregulated and downregulated DETs in one or both days of regeneration. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Plot showing correlation line, squared Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value between 12 expression values (Log2FC) of seven genes in regeneration stages compared to the normal stage. RNA-seq values are located in the x axis and RT-qPCR values are located on the y axis. Green colored points are from day 1 values, while red colored are from day 3.

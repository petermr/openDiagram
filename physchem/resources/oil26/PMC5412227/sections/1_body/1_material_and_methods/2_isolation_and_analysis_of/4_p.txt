0: GC-MS analysis was carried out in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent 5973 MSD applying helium as the carrier gas (0.9 ml/min, and the same capillary column previously mentioned).
1: The column temperature was raised from 50 (hold 3 min) to 180 C at the rate of 5 C/min and to 240 C at 10 C/min rate; and then was kept stable for an additional 20 min at 280 C. The injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 280 C, respectively.
2: A 0.3-l sample was injected using the split mode (split ratio 50:1).
3: Oil components were analyzed and identified by comparison of MS fragmentation pattern with that of pure compounds, corresponding data in the literature (Adams 2007) and/or computer mass spectra libraries (Wiley 138K and NIST 98).
4: For gaining the retention indices, a standard solution of  n-alkanes (C6-C26) was used (Jennings and Shibamoto 1980).
5: Also, the electronic integration of the FID peak areas without using any correction factors was employed for obtaining quantitative data.

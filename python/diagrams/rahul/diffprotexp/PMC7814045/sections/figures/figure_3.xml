  <title>Summary of intracellular changes in protein synthesis machinery induced by acetic acid treatments.</title>
  <p>Changes after exposure of 45 (light yellow background), of 120 (pink background), and of 200 (gray background) min determine: differential expression of the cytosolic ribosomal protein couples of ohnologs, altering their relative content in the ribosomes (altered ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) ohnologs ratio); differential expression of snoRNAs and of mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes (MRPGs); upregulation of EDC1, encoding an mRNA decapping protein, the downregulation of ASC1, affecting translation rate and frameshifting; enrichment of ribosomal and translation related gene ontologies (GOs). These phenomena are also associated to a general decrease of cytosolic RPGs expression and to the increase of the mitochondrial RPGs expression.</p>

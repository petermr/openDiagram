0: These populations were expressed in terms of the number of H 2O bound per unit cell (UC).
1: We note that a single UC consists of two MnO 2 units.
2: Additionally, the conversion of the experimentally obtained mass of bound H 2O per mass of MnO 2 to H 2O/UC is made using the molar masses ( mMnO  2) of MnO 2 (0.20 K) for AcidBir and of MnO 2 (0.17 K) for -MnO 2.

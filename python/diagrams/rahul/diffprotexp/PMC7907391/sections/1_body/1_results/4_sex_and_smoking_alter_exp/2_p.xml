<p id="Par10">Notably, a number of the cancers included in this study have a strong association with smoking such as colon, lung, esophagus, bladder, and cervical cancers. Recall, all of these smoking-related cancers exhibited above average expression of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> and 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> amongst the 20 cancer types analyzed and the rank expression of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> was increased in these malignant tissues compared to their normal tissue counterparts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Smoking status TCGA annotations were available for 4 out of 5 smoking-related cancer sites, including lung, esophagus, bladder, and cervix for 873 samples. Within these data, smokers demonstrated significantly upregulated expression of 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). On further categorization of smoking by age, it was identified that this smoking-related increase in 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> was most notable amongst the older patients i.e. for those aged 40–60 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and &gt; 60 years (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).

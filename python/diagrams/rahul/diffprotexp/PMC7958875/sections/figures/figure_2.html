 <caption> Ookinetes display variant gene expression depending on the mosquito individual. (A) A tSNE of 310 high-quality cells collected from four An. stephensi blood boli at 24Â h after infectious blood meal. Cells are colored by individual mosquito origin. (B) Cells were staged using the Malaria Cell Atlas data as a reference index for scmap-cell. Cells that mapped to asexual stages (trophozoites and schizonts) were removed for further analyses. (C) 304 cells that matched ookinetes, possible retorts, or female gametocytes were ordered in pseudotime based on their scmap-cell assignment from the Malaria Cell Atlas. (D) A density plot of the distribution of cells over pseudotime from each mosquito. There was no difference in ookinete maturation across the 4 individual mosquitoes (ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05). Immature ookinetes were removed based on the distribution for further analysis (cut off at red vertical line). In total, 275 mature ookinetes were used for further analysis. (E) CelTOS was one of 12 genes identified as a highly variable gene across all cells and was differentially expressed across the four midguts. Expression of CelTOS (log CPM) is shown on the tSNE. (F) A boxplot of CelTOS expression (log CPM) by mosquito origin. Expression of all 12 genes differentially expressed across midguts can be found in Figure S6 and S7 . </caption>

0: A 3050 mm incision was made through the skin, muscle layers, and parietal peritoneum, through which the temperature data logger and very high frequency (VHF) transmitter (see below) were inserted into the abdominal cavity.
1: The data logger that recorded locomotor activity of the aardvark was inserted and tethered intramuscularly ( Musculus transversus abdominis) using non-absorbable polyamide suture (Nylon, Scimitar Surgical Sutures, Gabler Medical, United Kingdom), to ensure that the activity records were not affected by free movement of the logger inside the animals body.
2: Incisions were closed using absorbable polyglycolic acid suture material (Viamac, Scimitar Surgical Sutures, Gabler Medical, United Kingdom).
3: The wound was sprayed with a topical antiseptic (Necrospray, oxytetracycline hydrochloride: 40 mg, gentian violet: 4 mg, Animal Health Division  Bayer HealthCare, South Africa) and coated with a topical ectoparasiticide (Tick Grease, chlorfenvinphos: 0.3%, SWAVET RSA, South Africa).
4: After surgery, each study aardvark was released as close as possible to its capture site, where a drug to reverse the immobilisation was administered slowly intravenously (Antisedan, atipamezole hydrochloride: 0.5 mg kg 1, Pfizer Laboratories, South Africa).
5: For further details about surgical procedures and data logger implantation, see  Weyer (2018).

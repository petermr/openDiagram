<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par33">Ecosystem engineers may be influential species in conservation and restoration strategies, as numerous other species may be affected by the activities of a single ecosystem engineer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>, especially where the species is an important biogeomorphic agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. Due to ecosystem engineering potentially having site-specific impacts, management and conservation decision making involving ecosystem engineers are therefore not straightforward. As a result, to be able to use ecosystem engineers effectively as tools in conservation and restoration, we need to be able to understand and predict their impacts to some extent in different environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. It therefore remains an important and relatively underexplored challenge to be able to predict variation in the impacts of ecosystem engineers across abiotic and biotic gradients.</p>

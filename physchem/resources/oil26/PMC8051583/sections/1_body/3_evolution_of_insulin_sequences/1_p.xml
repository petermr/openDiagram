<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In addition to changes in the numbers and structure of insulin genes, sequences of insulin genes have also changed. Typically, genes evolve at a near steady rate, but occasionally they display episodes of more rapid change, which are hypothesized to signal a change in gene function. Studies of mammalian insulins have provided support for this hypothesis. Insulin sequences from the guinea pig (<italic>Cavia porcellus</italic>) and relatives (rodents of the suborder Hystricomorpha) are well known for having insulin sequences with highly divergent sequences (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The biological activities of these insulins also differ, acting more as a growth factor than as a metabolic hormone (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). These changes, in sequence and function, have been accompanied with an acceleration of the rate of evolution of the insulin protein sequence in the guinea pig and relatives (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Similar, but less dramatic, episodes of accelerated evolution of insulin sequences have been observed in some species of New World monkeys (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), species that have insulin hormones with lower potency (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>

0: In the human study there were three trial blocks each of 200 individual reach trials.
1: The first block consisted of baseline trials in which the participants performed the joystick task as normal.
2: The second block induced visuomotor adaptation by implementing a clockwise 35 rotation transformation of the on-screen joystick (green) cursor, requiring participants to modify their outward movement to overcome this perturbation.
3: The final block, identical to the first, was used to probe the participants behavioural adaptation to the transformation through the presence of an aftereffect.
4: Participants were not informed of the rotation transformation or the ordering of each block, and none reported explicit awareness of the rotation transform other than that their performance had worsened.
5: Participants did not report the use of an explicit aiming strategy.

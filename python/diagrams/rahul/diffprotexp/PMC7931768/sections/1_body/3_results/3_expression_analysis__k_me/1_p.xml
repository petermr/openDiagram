<p>After determining that tape-derived RNA gene expression from a 94-candidate gene panel could distinguish disease groups, we sought to compile gene clusters with the greatest potential to differentiate between CLE and HV groups. We examined gene expression across all groups using the consensus of 1000 K-means clustering results from bootstrapping. Genes amplified from skin tape-collected RNA were segregated into four clusters, as shown in

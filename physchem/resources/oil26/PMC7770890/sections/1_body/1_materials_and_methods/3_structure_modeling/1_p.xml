<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It should be mentioned that in reality,
the ACE2 receptors of some animals may not bind to S-RBD. However,
to quantitatively compare the capability of different ACE2 receptors
to bind to S-RBD, we first constructed initial ACE2/S-RBD complex
models through homology modeling, assuming that all the ACE2 receptors
could bind to S-RBD, and then computed the binding energies between
the two partners.</p>

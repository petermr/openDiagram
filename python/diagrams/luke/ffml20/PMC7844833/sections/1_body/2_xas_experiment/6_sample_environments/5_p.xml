 </xref>b features a cell with a relatively small central electrochemical compartment to minimize the thickness of the electrolyte layer, allowing measurements both in transmission and fluorescence modes. The limitations due to the small volume of the cell and bubble formation are partially addressed by ensuring the continuous electrolyte flow through the cell using a syringe pump.

 </sup> Degassing the electrolyte before the experiment to increase the solubility of the reactant gases in the electrolyte can further help to reduce the measurement problems related to bubble formation.

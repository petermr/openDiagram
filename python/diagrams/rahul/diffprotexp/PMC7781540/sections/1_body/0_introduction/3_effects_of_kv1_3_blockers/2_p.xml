<p>In these types of

 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition or genetic deletion reduces the expression and production of multiple inflammatory mediators measured at 24- or 48-hours following microglia activation. About 20 years ago the laboratory of Lyanne Schlichter reported that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitors suppress phorbol ester stimulated respiratory burst [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and NO production in cultured neonatal rat microglia, thus reducing microglia mediated neuronal killing in a transwell culture system [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In a more recent study from our own laboratory [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which compared the effects of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 and K
 <sub>Ca</sub>3.1 blockers with the widely used microglia inhibitor minocycline on differentially polarized neonatal mouse microglia, we observed that Kv1.3 inhibition reduced expression and production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α at 24 and 28 hours and prevented upregulation of the inflammation associated enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The later effect was probably responsible for the reduced NO production observed in microglia treated with K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitors at 24 and 48 hours after LPS stimulation. Similar to the earlier work, we also observed that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitors prevent microglia mediated neuronal killing in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures 3 days after microglia were activated either through 1-hour of hypoxia/aglycemia to simulate ischemic stroke [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or by treatment with oligomeric amyloid-β to simulate microglia activation in AD [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition to reducing AβO induced microglia activation, a phenomenon which can be clearly shown by staining microglia for CD11b or Iba-1 and evaluating fluorescence intensity, the K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitor PAP-1 has also been found to prevent AβO-induced, microglia-mediated impairment of long-term potentiation (LPT) in hippocampal slices and to reduce AβO-induced production of IL-1β, TNF-α and NO in cultured mouse microglia [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], very similar to what had been found for K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitors with LPS stimulated microglia [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In experiments where cultured neonatal mouse microglia from wild-type and K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice were stimulated with aggregate α-synuclein (αSyn
 <sub>Agg</sub>), which activates microglia through binding to the pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and CD36 [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], both pharmacological K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition with PAP-1 and genetic deletion of the channel resulted in reduced IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α production and prevented NLRP3 inflammasome protein upregulation at 24 hours after microglia stimulation [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Conversely, overexpression of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 in a microglial cell line increased αSyn
 <sub>Agg</sub>-induced expression or secretion of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12 at 24 hours after stimulation [

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par13">Data were gathered at three microsites at each burrow: (1) at the burrow entrance, (2) at the impacted area around the burrow (i.e. disturbed by the deposition of excavated soil), and (3) at a control site close to the burrow. In the mesic grassland and the semi-arid savannah, the impacted area was the area opposite the burrow entrance where soil was displaced to by the burrower (i.e. the excavated soil mound). In the arid scrubland burrows were exclusively located on heuweltjies (i.e. aardvark burrowing was limited to nutrient-rich earth mounds)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and it was difficult to distinguish heuweltjie soil from excavated burrow soil. Thus, the impacted area was considered as the whole heuweltjie around the burrow, with the control taken as the nearest heuweltjie that showed no signs of medium-sized mammal burrowing (i.e. in the arid scrubland all sampling was conducted on heuweltjies). In the mesic and the semi-arid sites, the control area for each burrow was chosen two meters away from the burrow at a 90&#176; angle to the orientation of the burrow tunnel (to avoid sampling the surface potentially above the burrow tunnel), where there were no visible signs of burrowing disturbance. At all sites the burrow entrance measurements were taken below the edge of the tunnel roof, avoiding heavily shaded areas deeper within the burrow where plants are unlikely to establish due to a lack of solar radiation.</p>

<p id="p0030">Urea, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate (CHAPS), Pharmalyte, dithiothreitol (DTT), and iodoacetamide were obtained from AMRESCO (Solon, OH, USA). ReadyPrep 2-D cleanup kit and reagents used for 2 DE and Western blotting were purchased from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA, USA). The primary antibodies for Western blotting included rabbit anti-14-3-3 zeta (1433Z) polyclonal antibody, rabbit antivacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (VATA) polyclonal antibody, rabbit antiheat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) polyclonal antibody, rabbit antiglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDA) polyclonal antibody, mouse antiubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL1) monoclonal antibody mouse antifructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALF) monoclonal antibody, and mouse antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:1000; Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA). The secondary antibody used in this study was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit/mouse IgG (dilution 1:2,000; Proteintech).</p>

<p>Interestingly, 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> showed differential expressions of methyltransferase-associated proteins. In addition to the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases and lysine methyltransferase enzyme domain-containing protein (
 <xref rid="t1-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 11 DEGs associated with methyltransferase were upregulated, and 19 DEGs were downregulated upon infection with 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> for 12 hr. Furthermore, 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> also demonstrated differential expressions of acetyltransferase-associated proteins. Histone acetyltransferase-associated protein was upregulated and 8 other acetyltransferases were downregulated 12 hr pi with 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. Icm/Dot type IV secretion system and its effectors of 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> modulate host gene expression by altering the chromatin structure or by affecting the activities of transcription factors [
 <xref rid="b19-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Post-translational modifications such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and histone methylation have been shown to play a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of eukaryotic gene expression [

 <xref rid="b20-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our results revealed that 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> showed differential expressions of 30 kinds of methyltransferase-associated proteins and 9 kinds of acetyltransferase-associated proteins at 12 hr pi. Based on the changes to epigenetic regulatory gene expressions, it can be speculated that 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> can alter the gene expression of 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> through epigenetic mechanisms.

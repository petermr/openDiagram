 <italic>solium</italic> cysticercal ESPs were obtained and characterized by 2D-PAGE gels. The proteins were separated according to IP and MW as discrete spots. Each cysticercus culture showed a unique protein profile in terms of the number and location of spots on the gel; however, most culture samples share a common distribution pattern. Two distinct regions can be observed in all 2D-PAGE gels: a low-MW region (&lt; 20 kDa) was protein-enriched, irrespective of IP values, while another enriched region is found at IP values between 5 and 8, regardless of MW.

<p>However, it is worth noting that the 
 <italic>var</italic> gene we identified to be expressed in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> midgut samples is the same gene that was detected in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> oocysts from field samples (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Díaz et al., 2017</xref>) but different from the 
 <italic>var</italic> gene detected in mosquito stages in another study (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zanghì et al., 2018</xref>). Although to date it is unclear why 
 <italic>var</italic> gene transcripts are found in mosquito stage parasites, as the PfEMP1 proteins they encode for have a very prominent role in antigenic variation in asexual blood stages (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, this finding suggests that there may be a favoritism of expression in 
 <italic>var</italic> genes in mosquito stages and that not all 
 <italic>var</italic> genes are predisposed to be expressed at this stage.

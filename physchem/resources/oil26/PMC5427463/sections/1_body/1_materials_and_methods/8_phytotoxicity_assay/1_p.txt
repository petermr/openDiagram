0: The biological activity of SoEO was conducted by phytotoxicity assay based on the root/shoot growth and seed germination as described by Moiteiro et al.
1: (2006[ 36]).
2: Four vegetable species namely,  Triticum aestivum,  Raphanus sativus,  Solanum lycopersicum and  Trigonella foenum-graecum were selected for this study.
3: Surface-sterilized seeds from each species ( n = 40) were aseptically transferred on two pre-sterilized layers of Whatman filter paper in petri dishes.
4: After dispensing the essential oil solution to the filter paper, the petri dishes were tightly sealed with parafilm and then incubated at 24 C, in the dark.
5: Germination was monitored for 7 days and the root/hypocotyl lengths and fresh weights were measured at the end of the experiment (25 digitalized plantlets randomly selected for each experiment) with the application Image J Version 1.37 r, 2010 ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov./ij/).

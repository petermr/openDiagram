<p>To investigate the role of LINC00466 in glioma tumor growth 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, T98G cell line with lentivirus-coated LINC00466 overexpression plasmid was inoculated into nude mice (oe-LINC00466 group), and the cell line with blank lentivirus plasmid was used as oe-NC (oe-NC group). The results displayed that LINC00466 overexpression noticeably fostered tumor growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7A</xref>). Besides, the tumor size was significantly larger in oe-LINC00466 group compared with oe-NC group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7B</xref>). These findings noted that LINC00466 had a promoting effect on tumor growth of glioma. In addition, we also detected the expression levels of LINC00466/miR-137/PPP1R14B in the tumors. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7C</xref>, we discovered that compared to the oe-NC, LINC00466 and PPP1R14B expression levels were markedly enhanced and miR-137 expression was decreased. In the treatment group of oe-LINC00466, the protein expression levels of PPP1R14B, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Î²-catenin, MMP-2, MMP9 and Cyclind1 were higher than the expression levels of these proteins in oe-NC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7D</xref>). The expression level of E-cadherin was opposite. IHC was performed to measure the expression of PPP1R14B and proliferation-related protein Ki67 in nude mice tissues of oe-NC and oe-LINC00466 groups, and it was found that the expression levels of PPP1R14B and Ki-67 were evidently increased upon overexpression of LINC00460 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7E</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrated that overexpression of LINC00466 could promote tumor growth of glioma.

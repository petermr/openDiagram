<p>The droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the selected nanoemulsions were investigated through dynamic light scattering adopting N4Plus submicron particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, UK). Samples were appropriately diluted with distilled water and measured at room temperature. The average values of three measurements ± SD were recorded. A conductivity meter (CM 180) was used to determine the electrical conductivity of the selected nanoemulsions by direct dipping of electrode into the sample at 25 °C.</p>

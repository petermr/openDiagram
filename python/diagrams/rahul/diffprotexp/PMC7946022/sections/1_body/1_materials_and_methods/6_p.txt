0: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of explanted catheters for evaluation of   in vivo-grown biofilms .
1: In order to visualize the biofilms formed within the lumen of the catheters, representative fragments from each group were processed for SEM analysis.
2: Explanted catheters were rinsed with PBS then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
3: Catheters were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS for 1 hr, washed with buffer, dehydrated in a series of graded ethyl alcohol, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 3 times in 100% for 10 mins each.
4: Specimens were critical-point dried in CO 2, mounted on SEM pin mounts, and sputter coated with platinum-palladium (EMS 150 T ES).
5: SEM images were acquired using a Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR), and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software.

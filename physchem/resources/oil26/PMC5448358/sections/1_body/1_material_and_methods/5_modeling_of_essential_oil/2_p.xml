<p>The variables influencing extraction yield were as follows: time, temperature, condensation rate, the state of division of the plant material, the mass ratio of the plant material to water, and water loss from the plant material (Denny, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). A model with six variables, even in the case of a first‐degree model, would require 2
 <sup>6</sup> = 64 experiments (Goupy, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). For experimental convenience, some variables were thus kept constant. We considered three variables: the extraction duration (X
 <sub>1</sub>), the residual water content (X
 <sub>2</sub>), and the state of the division of the plant material (X
 <sub>3</sub>). These three factors offered the advantage of being easy to control. Extraction yield (y), 
 <italic>p</italic>‐menthadienol isomers, and aristolone contents (Z) depend on factors X
 <sub>1</sub>, X
 <sub>2</sub>, and X
 <sub>3</sub>. Mathematically, this is expressed as y or z = f(X
 <sub>1</sub>, X
 <sub>2</sub>, X
 <sub>3</sub>), where y and z are the responses, f(X) is the response function, and X
 <sub>1</sub>, X
 <sub>2</sub>, and X
 <sub>3</sub> are the factors taken into account. The experiment is designed to determine the effects of certain factors on each response.

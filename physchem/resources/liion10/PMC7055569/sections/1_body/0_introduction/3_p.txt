0: Typically, metalair batteries (Li or Na) exhibit higher theoretical specific energy than LIBs which can make metalair battery systems attractive and useful for hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles.
1: 6 Electrochemical power devices based on metal as anode and oxygen as a cathode active material have the highest energy density because the latter is not stored inside the device but is accessible from the environment.
2: The theoretical specific energy of lithiumair batteries (LABs) is comparable with the theoretical specific energy of gasoline.
3: [qv: 5c,7] The air cathode performance limits the cell capacity jeopardizing the commercial success of LAB technology.
4: First, there is the consumption of solvent during the discharge process in the cathode reaction for both alkaline and acidic aqueous electrolytes.
5: Second, there is the incompletion of discharge due to the blockage of pore orifices/openings.
6: 8 Therefore, one of the possible avenues toward LAB performance enhancement is the cathode material architecture, 9 which can keep the active lithium ion and oxygen transport and can be filled with a substantial amount of products of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without the pores blockage.
7: Dual pore materials, proposed in a field of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for fuel cells are promising for energy capacity increase.
8: 10 Third, there is the air cathode degradation.
9: Delivering most of the cell energy, the air cathode has the most of the cell voltage drop.
10: 11 The accumulation of LiO 2 during discharge process yielding a mixed products as well as high voltages on charging caused the decomposition of solvent in parallel to lithium peroxide reduction.
11: 12 The oxygen solubility and rate of diffusion became crucial factors for battery energy capacity.
12: The use of electrolytes with high oxygen solubility and high oxygen diffusivity yields in an enhancement of cathode capacity.

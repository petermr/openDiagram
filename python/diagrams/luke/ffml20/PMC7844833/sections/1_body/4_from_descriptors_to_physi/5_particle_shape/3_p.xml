<p>Studies on shape-selected model NPs have demonstrated that small NPs with different shapes indeed exhibit different XAS spectra (

 </sup> The determination of the average NP shape from XAS data is usually based on coordination number analysis. As mentioned above, the relationships between CNs and particle size are somewhat different for particles of different shapes, giving the possibility to discriminate between different shapes from the analysis of experimental XAS data, provided that the sample under investigation consists of size- and shape-selected particles. A common approach thus relies on generating a large library of cluster models of particles of different sizes and shapes, calculating for them coordination numbers in the first few coordination shells, and then selecting the model that gives the best agreement with the CNs extracted from experimental data.

 </sup> If TEM data are available, the shape determination should also involve adding the TEM NP diameter as a relevant selection parameter together with the CNs for the first NN shells. Such an approach was used by Roldan et al. to solve the shape of Pt NPs on Al

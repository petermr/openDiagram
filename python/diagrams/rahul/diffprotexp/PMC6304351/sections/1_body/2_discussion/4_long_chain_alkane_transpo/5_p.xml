<p>TOL_3187 is also a member of the LolA-like superfamily consisting of two proteins in the Lol system, the periplasmic molecular chaperone LolA and the outer membrane lipoprotein receptor LolB. The Lol system comprises five Lol proteins (A–E) which catalyzes the sorting and outer membrane localization of lipoproteins (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Remans et al., 2010</xref>). This LolA-lipoprotein complex crosses the periplasm and then interacts with the outer membrane receptor LolB, which is essential for the anchoring of lipoproteins to the outer membrane (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Jeeves and Knowles, 2015</xref>). For example, the Pul secretin, a homododecamer of the outer membrane protein PulD, requires the outer membrane lipoprotein PulS for outer membrane localization (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Nouwen et al., 1999</xref>). It has been suggested PulD might “piggy back” on PulS to co-opt LolA for outer membrane localization. The porin (TOL_3188) was exclusively expressed on

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). When the size of the substrate is too large for the generalized porins, an alternative specific or specialized porin is used (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>). We propose that this specialized porin may be actively transported by TOL_3187 across the inner membrane into the periplasm, then across the periplasm to the outer membrane where it is assembled. Following this it then facilitates passive diffusion of long-chain alkanes.

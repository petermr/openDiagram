<p>The GC-MS analyses were performed in EI mode (70 eV) with an Agilent 7890 GC system, equipped with model 5975 mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, USA). SGE BPX5 fused silica capillary columns (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness) were employed for separation; the column oven temperature was raised linearly from 80°C (hold for 2 min) to 280°C (hold for 5 min) at 20°C/min. Helium was used as carrier gas at constant flow of 1.2 mL/min. The samples were analyzed in splitless mode at injection temperature of 250°C, EI source temperature 230°C, and quadrupole analyzer at 150°C, ionization current at 235 eV.</p>

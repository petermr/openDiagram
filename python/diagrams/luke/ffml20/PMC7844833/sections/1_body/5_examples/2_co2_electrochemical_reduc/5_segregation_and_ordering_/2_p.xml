<p>Alloying of two metals with different properties and interactions with adsorbates provides new ways to tune the catalytic properties through geometric effects, such as changes in the interatomic distances and surface strain, and ligand effects involving changes in the surface electronic structure. However, the bulk and surface structure of the bimetallic catalysts often change under reaction conditions; thus, the presence of the desired bimetallic structural motifs needs to be validated by 
 <italic>in situ</italic> measurements. The element-specificity of XAS makes it well-suited for the investigations of multielement systems and their transformations because it provides the possibility to look independently at the local geometric and electronic structure around each of the constituent metals.

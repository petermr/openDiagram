<p>Supplementary KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed 17 significantly enriched pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246695.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Most of the pathways were related to immune functions and response to pathogens. Non-specific pathways enriched in all treatment groups were: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection, complement and coagulation cascades and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis. All of these functions were reduced in LL compared to the LN. The greatest number of pathways were enriched in group 6, including a series of connected terms, such as antigen processing and presentation, graft-versus-host disease, those pathways associated with some non-viral diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis). Also, 2 pathways that mapped nearby were Pertussis and Toll-like receptor signaling. Another 2 KEGG pathways connected to each other and characteristic to group 6 were B cell receptor signaling pathway and Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway. Expression of genes encoding most of the molecules belonging to these pathways was lower in LL. In group 6 only one pathway demonstrated increased function; it was autophagy. Increased chemokine signaling pathway was observed in LL of groups 1 and 6.

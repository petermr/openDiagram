<p>Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for human. Many animal experiments and clinical studies had indicated that Se plays an important role in diverse physiologic actions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The essentiality of Se depends on its role at the catalytic site of multiple selenoproteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), thioredoxin reductase (TRR), and deiodinases (ID) are also some of the enzymes with Se in their structure. These enzymes perform many important biological functions. The reduction of hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by GSH-Px through the reduced glutathione. As for TRR, it catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the redox protein thioredoxin [

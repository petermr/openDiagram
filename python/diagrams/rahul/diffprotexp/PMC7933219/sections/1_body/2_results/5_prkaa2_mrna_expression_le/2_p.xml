<p>Furthermore, we used the Targetscan database to predict the binding sites of miR-124-3p with the 3’UTR region of PRKAA2. The microRNA sequence was 5’-uaaggcacgcggugaaugcc-3’. Targetscan predicted two binding sites of the PRKAA2 3’UTR region, Position 6166–6172 and Position 6893–6899, and the results are shown in

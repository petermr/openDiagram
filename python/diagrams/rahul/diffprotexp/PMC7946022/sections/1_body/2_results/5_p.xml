  <italic>S. aureus</italic> lrgB mutant biofilms exhibit accumulation of eDNA in the ECM and enhanced susceptibility to vancomycin upon DNAse treatment of biofilm
 </bold>. Compared to the WT strain, analysis of 24 hr-biofilms demonstrated reduced metabolic activity (**, p &lt; 0.01;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5c</xref>). In contrast, the lrgA mutant exhibited similar biofilm-forming ability as the WT strain and increased susceptibility was observed for reduced vancomycin concentrations (WT x ∆lrgA: p = 0.0008 using Multiple Effect analysis;

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Qualitative analysis was performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 7,890 coupled to a Agilent mass spectrometer model 5975 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20&#160;m&#160;&#215;&#160;0.18&#160;mm; 0.18&#160;&#956;m). The oven temperature was 50&#176;C and remained constant for 3.2&#160;min; then, it was increased to 300&#176;C at a rate of 8&#176;C/min. The injector temperature was 280&#176;C. Ionization was obtained by electron impact at 70&#160;eV, and the electron multiplier was maintained at 2200&#160;eV. The temperature of the ion source was 230&#176;C. Mass spectral data were acquired in the scan mode in the range m/z 33&#8211;450. The flow of carrier gas (helium) was set at 0.9&#160;ml/min; compound identification was made by comparison of their spectra and RI with those of libraries such as Adams (<xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), Nist (<xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), and K&#246;ning, Hochmuth, and Joulain (<xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) and were incorporated in the laboratory.</p>

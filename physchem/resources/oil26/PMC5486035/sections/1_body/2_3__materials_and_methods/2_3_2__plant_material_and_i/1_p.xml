<p>The ripe pistachio hulls (
 <italic>P. vera</italic> L., variety Bronte) were harvested on 3 October 2016 by a local farmer in Bronte (Catania, Italy) and immediately sent to the laboratory. Four hundred grams (400 g) of fresh pistachio hulls were manually separated from the inner woody shells and subjected to hydrodistillation, according to the current 
 <italic>European Pharmacopoeia</italic> method, until no significant increase in the volume of the collected oil was observed (3 h). The HEOs were dried on Na

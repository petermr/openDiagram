<p id="p0165">This is the first comprehensive study of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> treated with RGE using a 2-DE-based quantitative proteomic approach. In this study, we found that RGE had longevity-enhancing effects on 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> by altering the expression of antioxidants and regulating by multiple pathways. Further studies are warranted to explore the novel molecular mechanisms underlying the antiaging effects and life span extension by treatment with red ginseng.

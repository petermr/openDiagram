It performs many important functions including increasing the stability of the membrane, reducing the permeability of water-soluble materials, and adjusting the liquidity of the membrane.[<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] The decrease in membrane stability and increased in permeability of water-soluble materials suggest the decrease in lipid content.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] The previous studies regarding volatile compounds have been reported to disrupt the lipid structures of the cells.[<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] A significant decrease in lipid content of <italic>A. niger</italic> and <italic>A. flavus</italic> cells in fumigated and nonfumigated cells with 1 &#181;L/mL of <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> essential oil (<italic>A. niger</italic>) and <italic>C. citratus</italic> essential oil (<italic>A. flavus</italic>) were reported by.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] In the present study, the addition of MPE significantly decreased the lipid content of <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic>. These results suggest that MPE is capable of acting on the cell membrane structure and disrupt the cell membrane integrity.</p>

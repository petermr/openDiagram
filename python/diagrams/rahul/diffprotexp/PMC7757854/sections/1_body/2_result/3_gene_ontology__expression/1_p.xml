<p>Functional aspects of DEGs were examined using gene GO databases. Firstly, DEGs from both timepoint sets were organized into a Venn diagram to eliminate redundancy of genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>). The diagram showed 5314 DEGs shared between MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min and 3872 and 2912 uniquely expressed genes between MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min, respectively.

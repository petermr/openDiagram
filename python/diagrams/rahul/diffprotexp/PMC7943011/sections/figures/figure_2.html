 <caption> Expression of selected proteins in endometrial cancer cells after treatment with metformin or insulin. Differences in protein abundance between sample groups are presented as log 2-fold changes (log 2FC). Proteins were selected based on the following criteria: |log 2FC| ≥ 0.5 and/or adjusted p value ≤ 0.05. Proteins were defined as significantly differential for |log 2FC| &gt; 0.5 and adjusted p values &lt; 0.05; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, **** p ≤ 0.0001 (metformin/insulin vs. control); # p ≤ 0.05, ## p ≤ 0.01, ### p ≤ 0.001, #### p ≤ 0.0001 (metformin vs. insulin). </caption>

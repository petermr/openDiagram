0: St. Louis Encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a neglected reemerging mosquito-borne virus serologically related to other relevant encephalitic flaviviruses such as  Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and  West Nile virus (WNV) [ 1, 2].
1: Disease caused by SLEV is mostly asymptomatic or characterized by flu/dengue-like symptoms [ 3, 4].
2: Yet, severe disease pathogenesis is associated to an acute inflammatory process set in the central nervous system (CNS) [ 5, 6].
3: Symptoms include intense headache and neurological alterations such as memory loss, disorientation and meningoencephalitis.
4: Mortality rates in severe cases may reach up to 20% with possible sequelae to survivors [ 7, 8].

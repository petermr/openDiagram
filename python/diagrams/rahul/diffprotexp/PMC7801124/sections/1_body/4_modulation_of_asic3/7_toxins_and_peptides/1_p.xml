<p>In addition to endogenous modulators, a range of exogenous poisons and toxins have been identified as modulators of ASIC3. To date, the sea anemone 
 <italic>Anthopleura elegantissima</italic>-derived toxin APETx2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8a</xref>), is the most potent rASIC3 inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 63 nM; although less potent against hASIC3 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 175 nM [
 <xref rid="cit0198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Although APETx2 has been used in various animal studies, e.g. subcutaneous administration reduced acid-evoked paw flinching [
 <xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and intraarticular administration ameliorated OA pain [
 <xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], being a 42 amino acid peptide makes it inappropriate for systemic use due to it being prone to rapid degradation. Moreover, it is also not selective for ASIC3 homomers, but rather also inhibits certain ASIC3 containing heteromers (1a/1b/2b), as well as inhibiting the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.8 [
 <xref rid="cit0198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Through in silico methods, there have been two predicted sites of interaction, the base of the thumb and the base of the palm [
 <xref rid="cit0200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>], but this has not yet been functionally proven.

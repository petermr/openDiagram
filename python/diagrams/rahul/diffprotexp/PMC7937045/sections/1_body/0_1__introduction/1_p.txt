0: The incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer are higher than those of other cancers [ 1].
1: The overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15% [ 2].
2: Lung cancer is divided into small cell carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell carcinoma (NSCLC).
3: SCLC accounts for 10%-15% of lung cancers and is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy [ 3,  4].
4: However, approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC [ 5].
5: The median survival time of patients with advanced lung cancer is only 10 months [ 6].
6: Although the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer have significantly improved, the current treatment methods are still not satisfactory.
7: Improved early diagnosis and targeted treatment of lung cancer are required in clinical practices to improve patient outcomes.

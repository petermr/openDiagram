<p>The richness of information provided by the metaproteomic data allow researchers to look at complex biological questions that can be addressed using protein abundances (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009245.g002">Fig 2</xref>). For example, species abundances can be calculated by summing the relative protein abundances for each species; these estimates can then provide the microbial community composition in terms of biomass contributions of different taxa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009245.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For differential abundance analyses of proteins, various statistical methods with correction for multiple hypothesis testing can be used to identify proteins that differ significantly in abundance between treatments, conditions, and body locations. Abundance differences and significance thresholds can, for example, be displayed using a volcano plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009245.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Differential abundance analyses are often a critical tool for identifying genes/proteins of particular relevance under a given condition and thus helps to narrow the focus. Understanding how samples/treatments as a whole differ can also help narrow the results. For this, multivariate analyses visualized by principal component analysis (PCA) plots and hierarchical clustering help characterize the differences across samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009245.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). For example, hierarchical clustering identifies similarities and differences among all samples by separating them from different experimental states based on their protein abundance values. This enables the identification of protein clusters of similar abundance changes across treatments. These types of tests and visualizations are accessible through R packages or the free GUI-based software Perseus [

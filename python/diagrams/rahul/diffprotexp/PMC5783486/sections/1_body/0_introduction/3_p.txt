0: These results indicate that KD may exert long-term effects on the coronary artery and cause pathophysiological insults of the cardiovascular system leading to CAD or CAA.
1: To further understand complications in patients with KD, it is important to investigate the mechanisms of CAD and CAA formation, and to characterize the differences among normal coronary arteries, CAA and CAD.
2: Coronary artery specimens are optimal for CAD and CAA studies; however, they are difficult to collect from patients with KD.
3: Thus, blood samples were used in the present study.

0: The morphology of the obtained materials was studied by transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM 1010) (Tokyo, Japan).
1: XRD measurements were taken in a step-scan mode using an ItalStructures diffractometer APD2000 (Riva del Garda, Italy) with monochromatized CuK radiation (graphite monochromator).
2: XRD patterns were scanned in 0.05 steps (2 ), in the 2  range from 10 to 80, with a fixed counting time (15 s).
3: In cases where more than one crystalline phase coexists in the sample, we provided a quantitative analysis using Rietveld refinements of powder diffraction patterns [ 62] in order to determine the share of each crystal phase in the sample.
4: For Rietveld refinements, we used the computer program MAUD [ 62].

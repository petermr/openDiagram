0: Many studies have been reported on the biological activities of  Ocotea metabolites: the alkaloid reticuline isolated from extract of  O. duckei showed potent central nervous system depressant action [ 13].
1: ()-Caaverine, a noraporphine alkaloid isolated from  O. lancifolia, has shown high antiprotozoal activity against  Leishmania and  Trypanosoma cruzi parasites [ 14].
2: The chloroform fraction obtained from an extract of fruits of  O. puberula and the alkaloid dicentrine displayed antinociceptive effects [ 15].
3: The butanolides isolated from roots of  O. macrocarpa showed good cytotoxic activities against the A2780 ovarian cell line [ 16].
4: The flavonoids of  O. notata showed antimycobacterial activity and ability to inhibit NO production by macrophages [ 17].
5: The essential oil of  O. quixos, rich in  trans-cinnamaldehyde and methyl cinnamate, showed anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo models [ 18].
6: Studies on the chemical characteristics of the species  O. caudata,  O. cujumary, and  O. caniculata are rare and important because  Ocotea species are classified as threatened to extinction by the Brazilian List and the risk of extinction is increased due the reduction of genetic variability [ 19, 20] so knowledge of the genetic diversity is necessary for our understanding of the factors that determine essential oil quantity and quality in these economically important species [ 21].

0: The resulting simulated molecules were subsequently energy minimized to yield van der Waals sphere at variable pH from 4.0 to 9.0 depicting electrostatic potential 59.
1: Equations used for the electrostatic interactions is Coulomb's law, and the equations used for the van der Waal's component is the 612 LennardJones potential.
2: Both type of interactions contributes to the adhesion of particles.
3: For the ease of clarity 1.0G PAMAM generation was chosen here, as simulations of all generations are beyond the scope of this paper.

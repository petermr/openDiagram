<p id="Par41">Based on GO analysis, most differentially expressed proteins were binding proteins. A variety of binding proteins that affect the virulence of influenza viruses have been discovered, such as poly (rC)-binding protein 2 and nuclear export protein 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We found that these differentially expressed binding proteins may be related to the mechanism of influenza virus infection. Therefore, our findings are helpful for further analysis of the mechanism that binds proteins to influenza viruses.

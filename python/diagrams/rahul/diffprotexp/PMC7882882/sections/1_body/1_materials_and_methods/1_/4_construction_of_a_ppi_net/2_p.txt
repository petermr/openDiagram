0: First, a PPI subnetwork was generated by mapping all the DEGs and extracting them from the PPI network.
1: To improve reliability, network reconstruction was limited to the first interacting protein neighbors of these DEGs.
2: Second, the DEG-adjacent protein axis was detected, and a DEG-central PPI network was constructed.
3: Third, after mapping all DEGs to the PPI network to detect internal interactions between the DEGs, Cytoscape was used to select nodes with all edges to create a subnetwork.
4: The single-node and self-interactions of proteins in these subnets were deleted.
5: Pearson's correlation test was used to calculate the coexpression relationships between lncRNAs and PCGs, and the coexpression relationships with a P<0.05 and a Pearson coefficient absolute value of >0.9 were selected.
6: Finally, an lncRNA-mRNA network related to NFPA composed of differential genes was obtained.
7: The PPI-lncRNA network was visualized using Cytoscape, and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) ( 38) was used to identify important modules in the PPI network.
8: The key modules and hub genes were further analyzed and visualized using the MCODE plugin in Cytoscape.
9: The screening criteria for module genes were as follows: Degree cut-off, 2; node score cut-off, 0.2; k score, 2; and maximum depth, 100.

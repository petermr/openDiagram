<p>The endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant pathway was studied as described by Monteiro et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10
 <sup>−4</sup> M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), the NO scavenger, hydroxocobalamin (3.10
 <sup>−5</sup> M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10
 <sup>−5</sup>M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), and the competitive cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (3.10
 <sup>−6</sup> M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) for 20 min prior the contraction with Phen (1 μM), then, the cumulative concentration–response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.

<p>To conclude, in light of the fact that there remains no gold standard diagnosis and no reliable disease-specific prediction for pediatric sepsis, we summarized the differential expression profile of genes in the disease. Several target genes established a specific expression manner, which initiated new insights into the management of pediatric sepsis therapeutic biomarkers discovery and provided a very valuable data reference for future clinical research.</p>

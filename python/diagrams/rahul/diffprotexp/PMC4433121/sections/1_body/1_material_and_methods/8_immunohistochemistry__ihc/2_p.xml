A semi-quantitative scoring system was applied to evaluate the intensity of cytoplasmic staining as weak (1), weak-to-moderate (1.5), moderate (2), moderate-to-strong (2.5) or strong (3). In addition the proportions of positive tumor cells were estimated for each target protein and presented in percentage.

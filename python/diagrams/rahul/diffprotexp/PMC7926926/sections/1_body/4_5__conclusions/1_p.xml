<p>We reported the proteomic profile changes in 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> attributed to Al stress and examined the effect of 
 <italic>S. luteus</italic>. As a result, we identified 12 core Al responsive proteins differentially expressed between different sets of treatments. Furthermore, we identified 198 specific proteins differentially expressed under SL-inoculated Al stress conditions. Further molecular characterizations of these proteins and their corresponding genes can provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying Al-stress resistance in 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> under S. 
 <italic>luteus</italic> inoculation.

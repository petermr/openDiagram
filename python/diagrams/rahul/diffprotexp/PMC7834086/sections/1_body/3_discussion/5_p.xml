<p>Most studies have revealed that the AHPND causing bacteria usually release their toxins after invading the digestive tract, which results in the production of the characteristic symptoms [

 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although the details of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AHPND are still unknown, it is believed that PirA and PirB form a heterodimer that binds to receptors, after which PirB enters the cell through pore formation and then circulates to the hepatopancreas where it exerts cellular damage including sloughing of epithelial cells into the lumen (see recent reviews by [
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). Thus, damage to the hepatopancreatic tubules allows PirB toxin to be released into the intertubular space, which is then carried into hemolymph to infect hemocytes. Once it enters hemocytes, PirB could then bind to histones in nucleosomes to cause the dephosphorylation of histone H3 and to induce apoptosis (

Given that PirB was localized to the cytoplasm, it suggests that PirB also interacts with other cytosolic proteins to induce other functions; hence, the mechanism of AHPND pathogenesis could be a complicated process that requires additional studies to delineate.

<p id="Par27">The surface topology of cellulose electrode films made of unmodified and modified VGCF carbons and with/without LFP is obtained through 3D confocal microscopy experiments. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the optical and 3D confocal microscopy images of the FB-rich side of these different cellulose films. In the first fabrication step, the carbon current collector is created, thus producing carbon-rich and FB-rich sides, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The FB-rich side is particularly inhomogeneous and highly porous, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>. After the second step, which involves the filtration of the mixture of LFP and unmodified VGCF carbon, the surface appears smoother (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c,d</xref>) and is mainly composed of carbon that has not migrated inside the electrode. The poor dispersion of carbon in the electrode results in an inferior electrochemical performance, which is worse than the performance of an electrode made of modified VGCF-COOH carbon. In fact, after aryl-COOH groups are grafted, the carbon fibers become more soluble in water and are well-distributed in the bulk of the electrode. The FB-rich side of the LFP electrode made of VGCF–COOH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e,f</xref>) is basically similar with that obtained for the cellulose film without an active material (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>) except that some voids are filled with LFP and carbon. This is attributed to the better penetration of modified carbon into the pores of the electrode.

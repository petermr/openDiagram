<p>In order to provide constant gas shielding conditions on the weld bead, a constructional adaptation of the shielding gas nozzles was applied for the experimental trials with increased CTWD. Herein, the increased distance between substrate and contact tube requires a focused gas flow to the weld bead equally to the initial setup. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f003">Figure 3</xref>b shows the adjustment of the lengths of the shielding gas nozzles for increased CTWD.

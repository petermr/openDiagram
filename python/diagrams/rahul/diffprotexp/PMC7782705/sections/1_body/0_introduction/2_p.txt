0: Recent work has begun to address this important gap in the study of AD pathology using bulk brain tissue RNA sequencing (RNAseq) 5 or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) 6,  7.
1: However, these studies have focused on samples obtained from different brain regions, namely the dorsolateral prefrontal 5,  7 and entorhinal cortices 6, which could lead to important discrepancies in the results.
2: In fact, AD pathology shows a progressive impact on different brain regions, characterized at early stages by the presence of TAU protein inclusions in the locus coeruleus, the transentorhinal and entorhinal regions (stages I and II).
3: This is followed by the presence of TAU inclusions in the hippocampal formation and some parts of the neocortex (stages III and IV), followed by large parts of the neocortex (stages V and VI) 8.
4: This temporal progression of AD pathology could differently impact gene expression in those brain areas.
5: Accordingly, a recent study has shown that changes in protein expression are much more prominent in areas affected at early and intermediate stages, such as the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and cingulate cortex in the temporal lobe, compared to other brain regions affected at later stages of AD pathology, such as sensory cortex, motor cortex, and cerebellum 9.

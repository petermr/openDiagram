[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), and to explore the role of calcium channels in the vasorelaxant effect, endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel type VOC, verapamil (10<sup>&#8722;5</sup> M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+-</sup>ATP<sub>ase</sub> (SERCA) inhibitor, thapsigargin (10<sup>&#8722;7</sup> M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) for 20&#160;min prior to contraction with phenylephrine (10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> M), then, the cumulative concentration&#8211;response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.</p>

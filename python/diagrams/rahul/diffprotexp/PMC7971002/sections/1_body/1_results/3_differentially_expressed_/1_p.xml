<p id="Par9">The secondary structures of the inverted repeats were predicted, and novel micro RNAs (miRNAs) regulating mRNAs (detected in this study) were identified using the RNA fold. We detected 238 novel miRNAs, and 244 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with significant differences in H1 vs H3, and H1 vs H8 ovarian groups respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). An average of 42,899, 42,899 and 42,885 miRNAs were detected among the three biological replicates of 1-month-old (H1), 3 months old (H3) and 8 months old (H8), respectively (results not shown). Out of these, 101, 114 and 116 miRNAs of known functions with a significant difference were found in H1 vs H3, H1 vs H8 and H3 vs H8, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Also, among the significant miRNAs, 486, 606 and 548 were novel with unknown functions in H1 vs H3, H1 vs H8 and H3 vs H8, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

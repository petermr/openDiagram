<p>The material studied is an advanced medium Mn steel. Its chemical composition is shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02127-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and its mechanical properties are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02127-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The microstructure consists of main martensite and 10~15 vol.% retained austenite. The high yield strength of 650 MPa, ultimate strength of 770 MPa, and superior cryogenic toughness of around 200 J at −60 °C were obtained by optimized intercitical annealing. The transformation temperature was measured as Ac1 = 626 °C and Ac3 = 790 °C on a slow heating rate of 3 °C/min by Gleeble 3800 (Dynamic Systems Inc., Poestenkill, NY, USA) [

<p id="Par15">Through a combined computational and experimental approach, a substantial endeavor has been dedicated for the synthesis of dendrimer. In this work we performed an extensive MD simulation on PAMAM dendrimers, with the purpose of elucidating several structural aspects. The effects associated with changes in pH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) are reflected by the electrostatic, and van der Waal forces. The work was pondered to develop minimal step, defect free, rapid and cost-effective synthesis. This study investigated the optimization and molecular dynamics as an approach to enhance the potency of molecules. The structural composition of dendrimer was successfully achieved via a divergent approach by reacting EDA and methyl acrylate in repeated steps. The synthesized dendrimer was characterized by UV–Vis, IR spectroscopy. For the assessment of morphological information UV–Vis spectroscopy was used. The Infrared spectroscopy was employed for the evaluation of chemical transits under way at the periphery of dendrimers, such as the disappearance of amine groups in the synthesis of half generation of dendrimers. The analysis data revealed synthesized dendrimer as suitable nanostructured candidate suitable for neutral as well as charged molecule delivery. Understanding the molecular dynamics as well as experimental studies governing the synthesis of dendrimer alludes that an interplay of essential parameters needs to be considered in order to achieve enhanced clinical application of dendrimers.

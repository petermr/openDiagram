<p>The CV curves of the B-SFO@C electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> from 0.005 up to 3.0 V were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f004">Figure 4</xref>a. The reaction between B-SFO@C and lithium occurs in three domains from 0.7 to 1.41 V, with the three regions very analogous to the ones identified for other Sn-based materials, for example, SnO
 <sub>2</sub>/C, Co
 <sub>3</sub>Sn
 <sub>2</sub>/SnO
 <sub>2</sub>, and SnS-ZnS@C. Thus, the peaks emerging at 1.41 V, 0.77 V and &lt; 0.7 V in the first cathodic scan process can deal with conversion reaction of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, formation of SEI film and alloying process of Li
 <sup>+</sup> inserting into Sn, respectively [

 <xref rid="B46-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the subsequent anodic scan process, the strong peaks at 0.59 V and the weak peak at 1.89 V originate from the dealloying event of Li

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, respectively. The peak occurring around 1.3 V is assumed to be reversible conversion reaction of Sn to SnO
 <sub>2</sub> although the conversion reaction of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> is universally deemed irreversible [
 <xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. To set forth the chemical valence state of Sn-based oxides at a full-charged state, the XPS was conducted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). The XPS spectrum of the Sn 3d core shell can be partitioned into four main peaks. The ones at 487.4 and 495.9 eV belong to the 3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> and 3d
 <sub>3/2</sub> for Sn
 <sup>4+</sup>, respectively. The signals at 486.7 and 495.2 eV match with the 3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> and 3d
 <sub>3/2</sub> for Sn(0), respectively, supporting the fact that the metallic Sn phase was indeed oxidized to SnO
 <sub>2</sub>. In addition, the SAED pattern of the full-charged B-SFO@C electrode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f004">Figure 4</xref>c) clearly demonstrates the diffraction rings attributable to SnO
 <sub>2</sub>, Sn and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, while the HRTEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f004">Figure 4</xref>d) reveals the characteristic crystal lattice stripes of SnO
 <sub>2</sub>, Sn and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. This further indicates the coexistence of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Sn. The supra results doubtless suggest the reversible conversion reaction between Sn and SnO
 <sub>2</sub>. The most recent reports have also postulated that metallic nanoparticles such as Fe, Co and Mn can work as a trigger or catalyst to trigger off the decomposition of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O, thereby conducive to the reversible generation of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The different oxidation potentials of Sn to SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe to Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> in B-SFO@C allow the Fe phases produced from the conversion reaction of Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> to call into play the unique role of such triggers or catalysts. Therefore, the electrochemical reactions of the B-SFO@C electrode during cycling can be described as follows:
 <disp-formula>SnO
  <sub>2</sub> + 4Li
  <sup>+</sup> + 4e
  <sup>−</sup> ↔ Sn + 2Li

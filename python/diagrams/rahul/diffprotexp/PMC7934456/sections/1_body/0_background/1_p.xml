<p id="Par13">Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) refers to plants’ inability to yield functional pollen, and this natural occurrence is widespread in vascular plants, specifically in flowering plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Researchers use CMS to adequately breed crops for hybrid seed production, which is a highly effective approach to use heterosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CMS appears to be mainly caused by rearrangements, deletions, or mutations of genes located in mitochondria, which can be eliminated by the fertility restoration factor genes present in the nuclear genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CMS not only can be used to study the relationship between cytoplasmic genes and nuclear genes but can also be a suitable donor for examining heterosis, providing a theoretical basis for three-line breeding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As researchers continue to elucidate the factors that lead to abnormal pollen development, several factors can cause this phenomenon to be discovered. Scientists have made corresponding assumptions regarding CMS mechanisms, such as cytotoxicity, advanced programmed cell death (PCD), energy deficit, and reverse inverse regulation hypotheses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although there is no direct evidence to prove the toxic protein hypothesis, the fertility suppression effect of sterility genes on prokaryotic cells has been well documented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Rearrangement of mitochondrial genes leads to energy loss, which might be a significant reason for anther abortion in CMS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that during the CMS-T of maize, the mitochondria split rapidly during anther development. Therefore, elevated expression of CMS genes might cause mitochondrial function defects, resulting in insufficient energy supply for male organ development, thus triggering abortion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. ATP synthesis requires the flow of hydrogen ions generated by the concentration gradient of hydrogen ions produced by complex I, II, III, and IV in the mitochondria, and the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane structure is crucial to the generation of ATP [[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]]. Many proteins encoded by CMS genes, including 
 <italic>URF13, ORF138, ORF79</italic>, and 
 <italic>ORPH79,</italic> are transmembrane proteins. These proteins may bind to the mitochondrial inner membrane, affecting the hydrogen ion concentration gradient, thus affecting ATP synthesis [

0: The composition of dendrimers principally encompasses two steps; Michael addition and amidation.
1: The reported method here involved ethylene diamine (EDA) as core, which was attached by acrylate resulting in 0.5G tetra ester.
2: The next step followed the amidation of terminal carbomethoxy group by EDA.
3: This tetra ester with an excess amount of EDA gave 0.0G tetra amine, Fig.
4: 8.
5: The process was repeated until the desired generation was achieved i.e.
6: 4.0G.
7: To circumvent the obstruction due to incomplete reaction, excess of EDA was used 61.
8: Excess of reagents was removed employing the usage of rotary vacuum evaporator maintained at 5060 C, in every step.
9: All the reactions were advanced using tightly corked amber colored round bottom flasks obscured at room temperature for minimal step, defect-free, rapid and cost effective synthesis.
10: The addition reaction took 2 days, whereas the amidation reaction took 4 days for the accomplishment of the array of reactions.

<p>The phase constitution and crystal structure of the synthetic LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites are here investigated. XRD patterns of the composites are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. It can be seen that there is no noticeable difference between LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites. All the sharp diffraction peaks corresponding to the (200), (101), (210), (011), (111), (211), (301), (311), (121), (410), (221), (401), (112), (222), and (123) planes can be indexed to the orthorhombic olivine-type structure LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> with the Pnma space group (JCPDS card No. 83-2092) (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and no excess impurity peaks are observed. The results manifest that the synthetic composites have high crystallinity and purity; this is mainly because microwave synthesis has the advantage of increasing the crystallinity and purity of products. The diffraction pattern of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene shows that no diffraction peak of graphene oxide (at around 12Â°) is observed, proving that the graphene oxide has already been reduced into graphene directly without any reducing agent or atmosphere. This is mainly because the graphene oxide with a large amount of oxygen functional groups on the surface that can absorb microwaves easily, and electromagnetic energy is converted into heat and molecular kinetic energy; the reactive oxygen groups are then exfoliated, and, finally, the graphene oxide is restored into graphene. Also, the introduction of graphene has no effect on the structure of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>. Moreover, the diffraction pattern of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C shows no diffraction peaks corresponding to residual carbon, indicating that the carbon decomposed from sucrose in the sample exists in an amorphous state.

<p>Aluminum could also be dissolved in NaOH, as demonstrated by several authors [

 <xref rid="B106-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], and concluded that no significant effect was observed when the molar ratio of Al/(Ni + Co + Mn) was below 3 to 100, but capacity could decrease by 40% if this threshold was exceeded. In addition to Al current collector dissolution, a pre-leaching step may be allowed to remove plated Cu contaminating Li-ion cathode. Hence, the addition of 5 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>OH to 1 M NaOH created strong complexing conditions, which facilitate dissolution of both Cu contaminants as soluble copper ammonium complex and Al current collector [

<p id="Par22">We considered four different comparisons within the patient cohort. We first examined differential gene expression pre-operatively comparing the LCOS (patients that will develop LCOS) and No-LCOS (patients that will not develop LCOS) groups; then we examined differential gene expression post-operatively comparing LCOS and No-LCOS patient groups. Next, we assessed the transcriptomic impact of the surgical procedure. For the LCOS group we compared post-operative gene expression to pre-operative gene expression, and we did a similar before and after comparison for the No-LCOS group.</p>

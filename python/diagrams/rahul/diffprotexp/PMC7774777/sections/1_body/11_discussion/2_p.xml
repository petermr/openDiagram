<p>A summary of a hypothetical model of action of raloxifene and estrogen in females and males, respectively, which emerges from this study, is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>, where the pink writing indicates the effect in females, and blue writing the effect in males. Disease-linked proteins, such as mutant SOD1, are known to form high molecular weight ubiquitinated aggregates in the cytoplasm; these aggregates are resistant to degradation by the proteasome. In females, we hypothesize that the modulation of DUBs by raloxifene promotes Ub-K48 chain editing, leading to a reduction in their lengths and limiting their aggregation, thereby enhancing their accessibility to proteasome degradation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>, arrow 1). Importantly, raloxifene stimulates the transcription of a large number of proteasome genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>, arrow 2) and promotes the assembly of the proteasome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>, arrow 3). Collectively, these effects of raloxifene synergize to enhance proteasome function. In males, estrogen activates transcription of proteasome genes, but to a lesser extent than raloxifene in females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>, arrow 2). However, estrogen does not modulate DUB or the assembly of the proteasome and therefore the proteasome in males treated with estrogen is not as active as in raloxifene-treated females. In fact, estrogen may be detrimental in males since the level of proteins in the insoluble fraction and the SOD1-G93A aggregates increased following treatment. The reasons for this increase are unclear, but it argues against the use of estrogen in males as a therapeutic for neurodegeneration.

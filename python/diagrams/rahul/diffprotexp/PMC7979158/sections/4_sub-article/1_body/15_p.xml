<p>We thank the reviewers for the suggested revisions to better define lamination phenotypes. In addition to clarifying the methods and more accurately describing the results, we performed new IHC experiments with TBR1 and SATB2 co-staining, as requested, and re-analyzed cell count and layer thickness data for consistency. The new IHC results further define differences in in MIA-exposed fetal cortex and provide evidence that the altered lamination is associated with differences in neuronal migration.</p>

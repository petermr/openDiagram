<p>The hemolysis of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> was thought to be attributed to the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> produced during glycerol metabolism [
 <xref rid="cit0205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. However, Großhennig et al. had found that the erythrocytes under a low concentration environment remained intact but had unexpected α-hemolytic activity in the supernatant following 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. After knocking out GlpO, 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>’s ability to metabolize glycerol to produce H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is reduced, so the mutant lost the ability to cause α-hemolysis, which impelled them identified an unusual cysteine desulfurase/desulfhydrase HapE, which exhibits cysteine desulfurase and cysteine desulfhydrase double activities, and can convert cysteine to pyruvate and H
 <sub>2</sub>S to cause the modification of hemoglobin and damage to the erythrocytes [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In other mycoplasmas such as 
 <italic>M. genitalium, M. gallisepticum, M. amphoriforme</italic>, and 
 <italic>U. parvum</italic>, HapE homologous sequences also annotated in their genomes, of which, the highest homology is with 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> MG336, but its function remains unclear. H
 <sub>2</sub>S is a novel potential virulence factor for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, which can cause the modification of heme and lysis of erythrocytes to allow the bacteria to get efficient access to the host’s resources together with other virulence determinants such as H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

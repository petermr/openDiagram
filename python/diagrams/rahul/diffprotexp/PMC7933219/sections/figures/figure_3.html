 <caption> Pathway analysis of 504 differentially expressed mRNAs in TCâ€“EC interaction. (A) The most enriched 11 (-LgP &gt; 3) of 40 pathways among up-regulated mRNAs (-LgP &gt; 1). (B) The most enriched pathways among down-regulated mRNAs (-LgP &gt; 1). The bar graphs represented the enrichment of these mRNAs. The value of (-LgP) was P-value taking the negative logarithm with base 10. (C) The interaction between the KEGG pathways of 504 differentially expressed mRNAs. The circle represents the pathway, and the size of the circle represents the degree of the pathway in the network. The larger the degree, the greater the circle, representing more pathway interaction. Lines between pathways represent their interrelationships. Red pathways represent the relative mRNAs that were upregulated, blue pathways represent the relative mRNAs that were downregulated, yellow represents the pathways with both up- and downregulated mRNAs. </caption>

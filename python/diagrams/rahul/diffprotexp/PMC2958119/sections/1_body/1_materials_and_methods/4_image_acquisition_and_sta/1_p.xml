<p>Gels were fixed overnight in 50% (v/v) ethanol with 10% (v/v) acetic acid, washed with water, and stained with CBB G-250. The best 3 reproducible runs of both larvae's gel images at 72 and 120 hours were used for further analysis. PDQuest V 8.0 (Bio-Rad) was used to analyze the data from 2-DE gels. The authenticity and outline of each spot was validated by visual inspection and edited if necessary.</p>

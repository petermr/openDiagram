0: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have become a popular choice in the field of energy storage due to their graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) layered structure, in which lithium ions tend to migrate among the 2D layers due to the weak van der Waals interactions (Yang et al.,  2015; Cook et al.,  2016; Wang et al.,  2016).
1: Among a variety of TMDs, MoS 2 is an ideal anode material for lithium ion batteries because its proper interlayer spacing endows this material a higher theoretical specific capacity (Kadam et al.,  2019; Santhosha et al.,  2019).
2: However, its poor conductivity and large volume variations have limited its application as an advanced anode material.
3: To address the above issues, MoS 2 has been engineered into different nanostructures and nanocomposites (Kadam et al.,  2019; Santhosha et al.,  2019; Sun et al.,  2019; Wang M. et al.,  2019; Wang Y. et al.,  2019; Xie et al.,  2019; Zhu et al.,  2019).
4: Recently, due to its excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties, graphene has been used to combine with MoS 2 to form an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (Huang et al.,  2017; Tan et al.,  2018; Anwer et al.,  2019).
5: The high mechanical strength and extraordinary conductivity of graphene greatly improve the structure stability and the electrical performance of the graphene-based MoS 2 nanocomposites.
6: However, large volume changes occurred when lithium ions were embedded in the MoS 2 layers and preferentially interacted with S layers to form LiS bonds.
7: The significant capacity degradation triggered by the changes in MoS 2 volume still can not be eliminated.
8: Moreover, the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer produced by organic electrolyte decomposition deforms and fractures during the expansion and contraction of MoS 2.
9: The new SEI on the newly exposed MoS 2 surface results in low coulombic efficiency.
10: The gradual accumulation of SEI further impedes the transfer of lithium ions.
11: By self-assembling 2D MoS 2 nano-sheets into three-dimensional (3D) layered porous nano-spheres with uneven surfaces, the capacity of the MoS 2 electrodes can be further improved.
12: As we known, two-dimensional single-layer nanosheets are highly resistant to volume changes, while highly uneven surfaces ensure more active sites (Wang M. et al.,  2013; Qi et al.,  2018).
13: It was predicted that the self-assembly of 3D hierarchical MoS 2 nano-flowers with open architecture will maximize the advantages of 2D MoS 2 nanosheets.
14: Additionally, the conventional chemical exfoliation process will introduce oxygen functional groups to form a single layer of graphene oxide (GO).
15: The loss of  system leads to a poor conductivity of GO.
16: GO have to be reduced to the reduced GO (rGO) to reconstruct the sp2 hybridized network before binding to MoS 2.
17: Although GO can be partially reduced through high-temperature annealing or chemical reduction, large aggregates are easily formed under van der Waals force.
18: Moreover, MoS 2 nanostructures tend to separate from the rGO/GO surfaces due to the weak interaction between rGO/GO and MoS 2.
19: Therefore, the assembly of micron-scale 3D hierarchical MoS 2 pore nanospheres on the surface of rGO nanosheets was a major challenge.

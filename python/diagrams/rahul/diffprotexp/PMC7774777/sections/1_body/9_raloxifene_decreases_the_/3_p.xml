<p>Further, since a decrease in ubiquitin-linked proteins may also be due to an increased in de-ubiquitinating enzymes (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), we next compared the expression of deubiquitinases (DUBs) between the 2 groups. We found that raloxifene has a wide impact on several DUBs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>), while estrogen in males had limited effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3L</xref>). The other treatments had little effect on DUB expression in either sex (data not shown). Deubiquitination can also contribute to the editing of the length of the ubiquitin chains and prevent aggregation. We noticed that the spinal cord is characterized by the presence of Ub-K48 immunoreacting high molecular weight bands migrating above 240 kDa that cannot be resolved under normal electrophoresis conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Therefore, to further test the potential impact of the effect of raloxifene on length of ubiquitin chains, we performed Western blots that focused specifically on the very high molecular weight bands. We found that raloxifene also reduces these very high molecular weight protein complexes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3M</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3N</xref>), while estrogen in males did not (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3O</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3P</xref>).

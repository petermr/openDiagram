0: LMNA, the component of nuclear inner membrane protein, is located mostly at the nuclear periphery [ 14].
1: Cheedipudi SM et al.
2: reported that Lamin A/C interacted with heterochromatic lamina-associated domains (LADs) to regulate gene expression in DCM [ 9].
3: However, according to recent reports, the combination of LMNA and euchromatin attracts high attention, and the role of LMNA binding to euchromatin in LMNA mutation-associated DCM is still unclear.
4: Although LMNA is mainly distributed around the nuclear periphery, it is less tightly linked to the inner nuclear membrane (INM).
5: They are also found in a more mobile and dynamic throughout the nucleoplasm pool.
6: LMNA can bind euchromatin directly or by the complex with lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP2, a protein from the Lamina-associated polypeptide 2 family), which plays an important biological function [ 15].
7: LAP2 is a non-membrane protein associated with the nucleoskeleton and is uniformly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm [ 16].
8: It may help to dynamically associate with chromosomes by interacting with LMNA via their unique C-terminal tails [ 17].
9: The binding disorders of nucleoplasmic LAP2-lamin A/C complexes cause late onset striated muscle diseases or erythroid and epidermal progenitor hyperproliferation, and the disorders also impair heart function and stress response [ 18,  19].
10: However, the regulation and specific functions of this dynamic, nucleoplasmic pool of lamin A/C are still poorly understood.

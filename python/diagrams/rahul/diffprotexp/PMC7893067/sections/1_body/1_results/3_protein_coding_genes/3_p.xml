<p id="Par11">Although not evident in the GO analysis, when we manually investigated lists of differentially localized genes in the cellular fractions, we observed that many nuclear-encoded-mitochondrial proteins (NEMPs) were abundant in the cytosol. To further analyze the enrichment of NEMP transcripts, we extracted a full list of genes (1158) encoding proteins with evidence for mitochondrial localization from Mitocharta2.0

 </sup>. By investigating gene expression and fold change differences for NEMP transcripts in the cytosol and nucleus, we observed a clear shift for NEMP transcripts to the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) and that NEMPs were significantly enriched in the cytosol compared to all other protein-coding genes (p = 2.8 × 10e−76, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In our cellular fractionation protocol, we used a centrifugation power of 10,000 rpm, which results in the mitochondria being pelleted together with the nuclear fraction. Therefore, it is unlikely that the enrichment of NEMPs in the cytosol was due to NEMP RNAs being physically anchored to the mitochondria. We further validated this by showing that the transcripts produced by the mitochondria were clearly nuclear in their localization (p = 6.4 × 10e−08, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B) indicating that the mitochondria themselves indeed end up in the nuclear fraction. The results of preferential cytosolic localization of NEMPs and nuclear localization of mitochondrial transcripts were consistent across all the tissues (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>). To experimentally validate the cytosolic localization of NEMPs, we performed RNA Fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH)

 </sup> on two highly expressed NEMP targets in SHSY-5Y cells. The results demonstrated that both of the NEMPs targets were preferentially localized in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). To further test if the cytosolic enrichment of NEMPs was consistent across various tissue types, we extended our analysis to cytosolic and nuclear RNA-seq data from 11 cell lines from the ENCODE project

 </sup>. In agreement with our brain data, we found that NEMPs exhibited preferential cytosolic localization in all the cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">5</xref>), indicating that the cytosolic localization of NEMPs is a general phenomenon that involves various human tissues.

<italic>ACPT</italic> sequences (human, cow, tenrec) were used for identifying inactivating mutations (including mutation of initiation codons, frame-shift insertions and deletions, premature stop codons, splice sites mutation of intron/exon boundary (GT/AG), etc.). The inactivating mutation was identified based on BLAST searches against whole genomes of the relevant taxon from NCBI. The information on gene function, related key amino acid sites/domains was searched from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (

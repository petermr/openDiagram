0: RSV is a non-flavonoid polyphenolic compound produced by plants when treated.
1: It is a bioactive component in wine and grape juice and can be synthesized in grape leaves and grape skins ( 11,  12).
2: Research has shown that RSV has functions in anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and cardiovascular protection ( 11,  13 15).
3: Moreover, RSV has a significant inhibitory effect on a variety of tumor cells, such as liver cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and leukemia ( 9,  16).
4: RSV can enhance cancer radiotherapy and effectively inhibit the role of cancer stem cells ( 17).
5: For TNBC cells such as MDA-MB-231, RSV can inhibit its metastasis by reversing TGF-1-induced epithelial matrix transformation ( 18).
6: However, due to the complex anti-tumor mechanism of RSV, researchers have yet to reach a consensus on its mechanism of action, hence, the anti-cancer mechanism of RSV on TNBC remains unclear.
7: In addition, the DNA polymerase delta catalytic subunit gene (POLD1) is one of the subunits of pol in DNA polymerases ( 19).
8: High expression or point mutations may lead to DNA replication and cell cycle abnormality of common cells, which may then progress to cancer cells.
9: POLD has been confirmed to be regulated by a variety of upstream factors, such as p53 and SIRT1 ( 20,  21), which are the direct regulatory targets of RSV.
10: However, no studies have discussed the regulation of POLD1 by RSV.
11: Additionally, the role of POLD1 within RSV-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells is also unclear.

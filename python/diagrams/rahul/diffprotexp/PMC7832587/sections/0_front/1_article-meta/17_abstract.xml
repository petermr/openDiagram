 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>Gene targeting approaches have demonstrated the essential role for the malaria parasite of membrane transport proteins involved in lipid transport and in the maintenance of membrane lipid asymmetry, representing emerging oportunites for therapeutical intervention. This is the case of ATP2, a 
  <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-encoded 4 P-type ATPase (P4-ATPase or lipid flippase), whose activity is completely irreplaceable during the asexual stages of the parasite. Moreover, a recent chemogenomic study has situated ATP2 as the possible target of two antimalarial drug candidates. In eukaryotes, P4-ATPases assure the asymmetric phospholipid distribution in membranes by translocating phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet. In this work, we have used a recombinantly-produced 
  <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> ATP2 (PcATP2), to gain insights into the function and structural organization of this essential transporter. Our work demonstrates that PcATP2 associates with two of the three 
  <italic>Plasmodium-</italic>encoded Cdc50 proteins: PcCdc50B and PcCdc50A. Purified PcATP2/PcCdc50B complex displays ATPase activity in the presence of either phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine. In addition, this activity is upregulated by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Overall, our work describes the first biochemical characterization of a 
  <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lipid flippase, a first step towards the understanding of the essential physiological role of this transporter and towards its validation as a potential antimalarial drug target.

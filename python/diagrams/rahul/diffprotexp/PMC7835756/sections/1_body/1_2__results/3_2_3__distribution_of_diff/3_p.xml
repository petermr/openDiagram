<p>In order to identify direct linkages between the DmCs found and the phenotype of the overproducing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> transgenic tobacco plants, we focused on the DmCs within the protein-coding regions. The higher DmCs on exons was observed in the CHG context (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,E), in which 360 DmCs hypermethylated and 636 DmCs hypomethylated were found. By contrast, in the CG context, 107 DmCs hypermethylated and 105 hypomethylated were detected. For the CHH context, just three DmCs hypermethylated and 23 DmCs hypomethylated were identified. The data of DmCs identified on exons are listed in

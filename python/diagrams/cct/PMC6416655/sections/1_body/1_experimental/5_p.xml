<p id="p0050">The high temperature in situ observation was performed with a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM, VL2000DX-SVF17SP, Lasertech, Japan) to inspect the morphology during the cooing of slab, and also examine the thermal expansion and CCT curve. The sample was heated up to 1473 K firstly, held 5 min, and then cooled down with a rate of 8, 12, and 15 K/s.</p>

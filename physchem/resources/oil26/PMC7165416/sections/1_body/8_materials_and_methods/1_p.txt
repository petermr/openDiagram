0: To interrogate reported shifts in M/LWS spectral sensitivity in rodents (Rodentia, Euarchontoglires) and some lineages of Afrotheria, we expressed pigments in vitro using published sequences ( Dataset S1) and directly measured spectral sensitivity following previous experimental protocols ( 7).
1: We confirmed extreme phenotypes by repeating these steps based on either newly generated sequences (Damaraland mole-rat and gerbil) or additional published sequence from elephant-shrew ( Datasets S1 and  S2).
2: For the latter two taxa, we also determined the phenotypes for SWS1 and RH1 pigments.

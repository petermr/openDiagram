 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Plants have inherited defence mechanisms to counter the vagaries of the nature by triggering the network of signaling molecules, antioxidant enzymes and by increasing the expression of SAGs/ SAPs [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Signaling molecules played very important role in making the plant robust enough to tolerate the cues of environmental factor. The sensing ability of different kinases acts as first line of defence and triggers the defense network linked with tolerance in plant system [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The signal transduction based on protein phosphorylation plays very important role under various extracellular stimuli in plant system [

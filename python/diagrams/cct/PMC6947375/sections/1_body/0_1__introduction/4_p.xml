<p>Generally, GCr15 bearing steel is subjected to cold deformation before heat treatment with the aim of shape-forming for bearings, such as cold rolling or cold forging. In fact, combining the prior cold deformation with phase transformation provides a novel approach for tailoring microstructures and improving the mechanical properties of high carbon steels. Lu et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] combined the prior cold deformation with martensite pre-quenching and bainite transformation to obtain ultrafine martensite-bainite duplex microstructures in GCr15 bearing steel. The resultant impact toughness and fracture toughness were superior to that of the conventional quenching &amp; tempering (QT) specimens. Chakraborty et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] refined the thickness and size of bainitic sheaves and obtained significantly enhanced impact strength with high levels of tensile strength via the recrystallization of prior cold-deformed ferrite during austenitizing/austempering of SAE 52100 steel. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that the prior cold deformation plus austenitizing treatment increased the impact of absorbed energy by approximately 7% in the spheroidized 1.0C-1.5Cr bearing steel. Recently, it was reported that Nb-Ti microalloying could be successfully used to suppress grain growth in gear steels for high temperature carburizing [

<p id="Par41">VTE is a systemic disease. A study of more than 1 million cancer patients showed that the incidence of VTE increased by 28% between 1995 and 2003 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] studied the mechanism of cancer-related VTE and found that biomarkers formed by Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are related to the occurrence of VTE in cancer patients, and can become a new pathogenic mechanism reflecting cancer-related VTE. At present, although a lot of work has been devoted to the study of VTE molecular mechanism, the related research is still in the exploratory stage. Therefore, the research on VTE related molecular mechanisms can not only re-understand the pathogenesis of VTE, but also provide new ideas for clinical treatment. Omics and bioinformatic algorithms, mostly network-oriented, are one of the most effective ways to capture new pathways of cardiovascular disease [

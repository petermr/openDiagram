0: The present work, represent for the first time the co-loading of loratadine and sulpiride into nanoemulsion for nasal delivery as a new approach with enhanced therapeutic effect for the management of allergic rhinitis.
1: Lecithin based nanoemulsions of combined loratadine and sulpiride were formulated.
2: The developed nanoemulsions were investigated for in vitro characterization.
3: Biological studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the selected formulation in ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis rabbit models.

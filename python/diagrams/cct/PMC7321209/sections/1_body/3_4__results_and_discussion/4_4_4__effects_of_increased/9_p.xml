<p>In the cross sections of the 1st layer, a primarily bainitic structure with accumulations of ferrite grains is apparent for a CTWD of 12 mm and 44 mm. According to Seyffarth et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], martensitic phase can be seen in addition to the bainitic microstructure due to t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times &lt; 2 s in the first layer. With increasing CTWD of 44 mm, the microstructure becomes fine grained, although the measured cooling rates were equal. This phenomenon can be explained by lower energy input with increasing CTWD (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Thereby, lower heat input resulted in decreased grain growth as well as decreased dilution between filler material and substrate.

<p>To identify novel NKCC2-binding partners, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of a human kidney cDNA expression library, using a sequence of bait fragments comprising the predicted cytoplasmic C terminus (residues 661–1095) of murine NKCC2 termed C1-term (residues 661–768), C2-term (residues 741–909), and C3-term (residues 898–1095) as shown in

 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Several positive clones encoding putative interacting NKCC2 proteins were identified from the screen. Among these candidates, one clone (number # 62) encoding Hsp70-like stress 70 protein chaperone (STCH) was isolated as a novel and specific binding protein of the proximal region (C1-term) of NKCC2 terminus (

To this end, HEK cells were transiently transfected with Myc-NKCC2 plasmid expressed either singly or in combination with GFP-STCH construct and cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc or anti-GFP antibody. The resultant immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As we previously described [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], exogenously expressed NKCC2 in renal cultured cells is detected as two major bands, one of ~130 kDa and another of ~170 kDa, corresponding to the core/high-mannose and complex N-glycosylated forms of the co-transporter, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, NKCC2 was detected in the precipitation complex containing anti-GFP antibody and obtained from cells co-transfected with NKCC2 and GFP-STCH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, 
 <italic>lane 2</italic>), indicating that STCH specifically interacts with NKCC2 protein. Interestingly, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B (
 <italic>lane 3</italic>), this interaction between STCH and NKCC2 involves mainly the immature and ER-resident form of NKCC2. Altogether, these results not only confirm the interaction between NKCC2 and STCH revealed by Y2H but also clearly show that STCH interacts mainly with the core glycosylated and immature form of NKCC2 in vivo.

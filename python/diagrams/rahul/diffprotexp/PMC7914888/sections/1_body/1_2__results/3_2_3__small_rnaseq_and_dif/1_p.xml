<p>The alteration of different cellular programs in melanoma, control of the cell cycle, pigmentation, and senescence are associated with changes in the expression of miRNAs and their effect on the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes [

 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For the phenotypes induced in B16F1 cells, exposure to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU causes changes in hundreds of genes [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether there are differences in the expression of miRNAs in these phenotypes. For this reason, we proceeded to identify and quantify by small RNAseq the expression of miRNAs in cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU and L-Tyr (

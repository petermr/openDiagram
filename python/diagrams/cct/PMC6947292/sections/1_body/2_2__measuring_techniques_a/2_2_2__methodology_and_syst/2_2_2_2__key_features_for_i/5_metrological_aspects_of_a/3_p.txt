0: Another aspect is that in general, if cooling becomes faster, precipitation is increasingly suppressed, and the amount of heat released decreases with increasing cooling rate when approaching the UCCR.
1: This is because precipitation reactions are diffusion-controlled, and diffusion is increasingly suppressed if the time available shortens.
2: One very important aim of these studies from a technological point of view is the detection of the UCCR at which precipitation during cooling is completely suppressed, i.e., at which all alloying elements dissolved during solution annealing remain in a supersaturated solid solution.
3: The UCCR is very relevant in technological applications, and it is shown below that the maximum age-hardening potential can be exploited only if the alloy is cooled at the UCCR or faster.
4: However, faster cooling may result in undesired residual stresses and distortion of age-hardened aluminium components [ 38, 41, 42, 43, 104, 135, 136, 137].
5: Although this is of lower importance for extrusions or rolled products, which are stretched after quenching, residual stresses and distortion are very important for complex cross-section extrusions and net-shaped cast and forged products.

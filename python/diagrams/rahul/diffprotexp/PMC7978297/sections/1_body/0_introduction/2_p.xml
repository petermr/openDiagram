<p>In females, primordial follicle (PF) formation (or assembly) occurs perinatally in mice and around mid-gestation in humans; this results in a finite follicle reserve termed the ovarian reserve or PF pool

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. After primordial germ cells arrive at the murine gonad, they undergo mitosis to produce germ cell cysts (or nests), from which oogonia mature after sexual differentiation. Subsequently, oogonia enter meiosis around 13.5 days post coitum (dpc) to become oocytes. Shortly afterwards, germ cell cysts breakdown following the invasive activity of proliferative pre-granulosa cells from 17.5 dpc to a few days postnatally. A substantial loss of germ cells, and the surviving oocytes become enclosed within a layer of flattened granulosa cells, which signifies PF formation

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. It is known that the PF pool is non-renewable once established and that it progressively diminishes following the first-wave of follicle recruitment during puberty, and is almost exhausted at menopause in humans

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Thus, the size of the PF pool is the primary determinant of reproductive lifespan in females 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Notably, the available oocytes within PFs naturally undergo irreversible exhaustion or atresia during development; however, they are prone to damage from adverse external environmental chemicals (such as plasticizers) as well as cellular aging

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Meanwhile, the ovarian dysgenesis syndrome hypothesis proposes that an early disruption to ovarian development can potentially lead to ovarian disease and disorders in adulthood; this is particularly pertinent at times that are sensitive to disruption by exogenous chemicals, such as PF assembly

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Consequently, attention needs to be focused on the protection of female fertility from toxic materials.

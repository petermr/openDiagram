<p>To evaluate the electrochemical performance of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, coin-type lithium metal battery cells were assembled using cathodes with 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> and lithium foil as anodes. The pellet cathode samples were composed of 30 wt% 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, 60 wt% carbon black (to improve electrical conductivity), and 10 wt% PVDF.
 <xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Before conducting electrochemical experiments, the solubilities of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, HAT-CN, and HHTP in the electrolyte were checked. While slight elution of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> into the electrolyte was observed, HHTP and the HAT-CT monomer were well dissolved under the same conditions, demonstrating that elution was suppressed by CT complex formation. The voltage range used to evaluate the battery performance of the coin-type cells was determined from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) peak position and the reversibility. CV measurements in three voltage ranges (1.0–4.0 V, 1.5–3.5 V, and 1.75–3.0 V) demonstrated that peak reversibility at 2.67 V was observed only when the voltage range was 1.75–3.0 V (Fig. S10
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). Therefore, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out at voltages of 1.75–3.0 V with a current density of 500 mA g
 <sup>–1</sup>. Despite using high current density conditions, the discharge capacities in the first and second cycles were 416 and 288 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and the numbers of electrons were 11.0 and 7.6 per HHTP/HAT-CN dimer, respectively. The energy densities in the first and second cycles were 151.0 and 73.7 W h kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively, and the power densities in the first and second cycles were 331.7 and 232.9 W kg
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively. As two kinds of multi-redox-active molecules are present in 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, HHTP and HAT-CN, multiple electron reactions can occur. We assume that each HAT-CN and HHTP molecule undergoes an ideal 6e
 <sup>–</sup> redox reaction and that the total maximum theoretical capacity of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> is 454 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>, which is of the same order as the first discharge capacity. In addition, the high capacity of the lithium metal battery cell under these high current density conditions suggests that lithium ions can pass through the intercolumnar space in 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, and therefore, HHTP and HAT-CN molecules inside the crystal lattices react efficiently. Although the capacity of the battery after 100 cycles was 48.1% of that after 2 cycles, the coulombic efficiency was maintained at ∼100% over 100 cycles, and all electric energy obtained in the charge process could be utilized in the discharge process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The low cycling performance is therefore attributed to the gradual elution of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> into the electrolyte, despite 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> being stabilized by CT complex formation, as mentioned above. In contrast, the abrupt decrease in capacity in the first cycle, which is sometimes observed in batteries that use molecular cathode active materials, can be ascribed to several factors.
 <xref rid="cit22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Possible reasons for this phenomenon include the dissolution of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> in the electrolyte, the formation of a solid electrolyte interface, and supercapacitance effects on the electrode surface. In addition, HHTP possesses six hydroxy groups, which can be deprotonated and lithiated under the conditions in the cell. The deprotonation process is irreversible; hence, it may also be responsible for the dramatic capacity decrease observed in the second charge/discharge curve. The properties of a battery using 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold>, where DMF molecules are present in the intercolumnar spaces, were also examined. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles revealed that the discharge capacity in the second cycle was 103 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> and the number of electrons was 4.4 per HHTP/HAT-CN dimer, which is lower than the performances of degassed 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> (Fig. S11
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). These results suggest that the stable hydrogen bonds between the DMF molecules and hydroxy groups prevent Li
 <sup>+</sup> ion diffusion. In contrast, when the amount of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> in the cathode was increased or the thickness of the cathode was increased, the cell capacities decreased, likely due to the low electrical conductivity of the alternately stacked CT complex, 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> (Fig. S12 and S13
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). The capacity of a battery without the active material (only the carbon additive) was quite low (&lt;14 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>), indicating that the contribution the carbon additive is limited or negligible (Fig. S14
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>).

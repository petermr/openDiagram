1: It was first isolated and identified in domestic geese in Guangdong Province, China, in 1996.
2: The spread of H5N1 avian influenza illness in poultry populations increases the risk of human infection [ 3].

4: As of 2019, H5N1 IAV had migrated to at least 17 countries, caused 861 confirmed infections and 455 deaths in humans [ 4].
5: To date, more than 850 cases of human infection with the H5N1 virus have been confirmed, with a mortality rate of approximately 60% [ 5].
6: H9N2, another IAV, is a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus [ 6].
7: Individuals infected with LPAI H9N2 viruses generally have a mild upper respiratory tract illness, with only one death to date.

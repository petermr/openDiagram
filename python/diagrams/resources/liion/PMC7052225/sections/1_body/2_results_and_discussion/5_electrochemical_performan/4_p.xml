<p id="Par38">The cyclability of a complete LFP/LTO battery made of 70 mg of active material is evaluated over 1000 cycles at a 2 C rate after several cycles of formation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). An initial discharge capacity of approximately 130 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> is obtained with a high capacity retention of ~91.6% after 1000 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the foregoing is one of the best results reported in literature for an all-paper full cell. In contrast, the LFP/LTO battery reported by Cornell 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup> delivered an initial discharge capacity of 140 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> at C/10. Apart from a low coulombic efficiency, a poor capacity retention of 87% is observed after only 20 cycles. The decrease in the active mass loading is found to deteriorate the cyclability of the battery. In fact, the same experiment with electrodes made of 40 mg of LFP and LTO has resulted in a capacity retention of only 82.9% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI7</xref>; Supporting Information). In both cases, however, a high Coulombic efficiency of ~99.9% is obtained. This observation may possibly be explained by the better contact between the active material (LFP or LTO) and carbon in the heavier film, leading to slightly higher capacities and avoiding the progressive electrical isolation of the active material (i.e., better capacity retention). This capacity loss is already observed among electrodes made of LFP sub-micrometer plates

 </sup> cycled at 1 C. Further cycling experiments at C/2 among different electrode compositions are performed, and the same conclusion is obtained. These results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI8b</xref>, which also shows that capacity retentions of 89.6, 90.8, and 91.4% are obtained when 40, 60, and 70 mg of LFP are used, respectively.

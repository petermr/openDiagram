<p id="Par30">An absolute cutoff value of log2 fold change up to 1.5 has been taken to identify the commonly differentially expressed genes (CDEGs) in the three AVM samples when compared to control samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The CDEGs included both upregulated and downregulated genes. We observed 38 CDEGs of which 35 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were downregulated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a subset of genes that are involved in retinoic acid signaling in CDGEs and another subset of genes involved in regulation of inflammation and immune responses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Further, we validated the deregulated genes by qRT-PCR in 10 different cerebral AVM and control tissues and found consistent upregulation and downregulation as we have observed in the transcriptome analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Previously, we reported that cerebral AVMs are terminally undifferentiated and contains a mixture of arteries, veins, and capillaries [

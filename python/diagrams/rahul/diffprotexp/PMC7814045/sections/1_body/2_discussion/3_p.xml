 </sup>. This suggests the involvement of the upregulation of a MRP also in acetic acid programmed cell death. Moreover, we here highlight that a typical expression pattern involves other mitoribosomal protein genes when compared with cytosolic ones. The expression of MRPGs does not dramatically change levels when compared with the control, since only 17 of 71 genes resulted significantly upregulated in the first two time points. However, 66 genes over 71 increase their expression levels in the three experimental time points, showing an opposite pattern compared with the one highlighted for cytosolic ribosomal proteins. Indeed, the cytosolic RPGs have a general decrease in gene expression in treated samples when compared with the control. This is also associated with the decrease of expression levels along the three time points after the treatments, in contrast with the constant increase shown in the control experiments.

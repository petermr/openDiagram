<p>We also do not think the structure is a result of technical factors. We performed PCA on PAS usage (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). The top PC explains 41.8% of the variation and is highly correlated with species. The second PC explains 13.1% of the variation and is slighty correlated with extraction date and the author who collected the data. Because we balanced these technical factors with respect to species in the original study design (Supplementary file 4), the technical factors likely do not contribute to the structure the reviewer identified in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. From each patient, we obtained one sample of ICRS grade 3 or 4 signifying high-grade degeneration ('high-grade sample'), and one cartilage sample of ICRS grade 0 or 1 signifying healthy tissue or low-grade degeneration ('low-grade sample'). For cohorts 2 and 4, we also collected synovial membrane from the suprapatellar region of the knee joint.

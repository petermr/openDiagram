<p>Overall, we may presumptively declare that gene expression profiling is a promising approach to elucidate molecular roles of targeted gene in the HD occurrence. On the basis of our findings, BDNF is found to be down-regulated in HD, and its detrimental effects of low expression in the pathogenesis of HD might be mediated by MAPK, Ras and cAMP signaling pathways.</p>

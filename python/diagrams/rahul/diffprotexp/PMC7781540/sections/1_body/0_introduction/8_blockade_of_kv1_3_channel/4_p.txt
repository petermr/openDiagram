0: Under physiological conditions, SOCE can be triggered subsequently to store depletion following activation of G-protein coupled P2Y receptors and contributes to the combined [Ca 2+] i elevation during activation of P2Y and P2X receptors elicited by common purinergic agonists, such as ATP.
1: The magnitude of the SOCE varies significantly among LPS differentiated cells, which may be a function of the unique combination of differential expression of store-operated channels and channels controlling membrane potential, such as K V1.3.
2: Reduction in peak SOCE by ShK-223 indicates that K V1.3 channels are potent regulators of SOCE and uncover an additional mechanism by which K V1.3 blockers attenuate calcium signaling and subsequent functional responses (e.g.
3: cytokine production) following calcium dependent transcription factor activation in microglia.

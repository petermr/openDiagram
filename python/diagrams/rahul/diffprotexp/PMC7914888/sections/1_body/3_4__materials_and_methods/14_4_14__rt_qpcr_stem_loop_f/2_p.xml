<p>For the RT-qPCR of the mRNAs, we synthesized cDNA from 2 ng of total RNA and 500 µg/mL of OligodT (Invitrogen) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen); the samples were run in a thermal cycler (BIO-RAD) for 50 min at 42 °C and 15 min at 70 °C. For real-time PCR (qPCR), 600 ng of cDNA, the sense and antisense primers corresponding to each evaluated mRNA (

The amplification in a BIO-RAD Chromo4™ under the following conditions: 95 °C 15 min to activate the polymerase and 36 cycles that included 10 s at 96 °C to denature, 30 s annealing temperature according to each set of primers, and 30 s at 72 °C extension. We identified the respective melting curve of 55–95 °C with data obtained from the Opticon Monitor 3 (BIO-RAD) program for both qPCRs of miRNAs and mRNAs. To quantify mRNA and miRNA Differential expression analysis with qPCR, we use the relative expression ratio (rER) model to establish the mRNAs’ miRNAs’ differential expression [

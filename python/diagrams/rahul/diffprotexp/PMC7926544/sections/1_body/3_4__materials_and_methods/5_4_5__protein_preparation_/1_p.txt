0: 1648 h post-transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 0.2 or 0.5 mL lysis buffer (120 mM Tris/Hepes, pH 7,4; 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 3 mM KCl; 1% ( v/ v) Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Roche 1697498, Meylan, France).
1: Samples were harvested and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 C. Protein expression levels were assessed after normalizing and loading equal amounts of total protein for 7.5% SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotting with the antibodies of interest.
2: For immunoprecipitation, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl; 0.5 mM EGTA; 1.5 mM MgCl 2; 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9; 5% ( v/ v) glycerol; 0.5% ( v/ v) Nonidet P-40) and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics, Meylan France).
3: Immunoprecipitation was carried out using the primary antibody of interest, and affinity purification using protein G-agarose beads (Dynal).
4: After incubation with protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at room temperature, the immunocomplex was washed three times in PBS (Invitrogen).
5: The protein samples were boiled in loading buffer, run on gradient 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, probed with primary antibodies of interest and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, according to standard procedures.
6: Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) according to the manufacturers instructions.

0: Before and after a 5-day differentiation induction,  me_SWH-treated MSCs were harvested using trypsin-EDTA and centrifuged to yield cell pellets.
1: These pellets were added to lysis buffer containing urea (7 M), thiourea (2 M), CHAPS (4% w/v), DTT (50 mM), and Bio-Lyte ampholyte, pH 310, (0.2%) for cell disruption under sonication for 30 min and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
2: The resultant suspension was centrifuged at 20,000   g at 4C for 30 min and the supernatant was collected and then precipitated with a four-fold volume of acetone at -20C for 16 h. The total protein content was quantified based on the method of Bradford.
3: Protein precipitates were stored at -80C prior to 2-DE.

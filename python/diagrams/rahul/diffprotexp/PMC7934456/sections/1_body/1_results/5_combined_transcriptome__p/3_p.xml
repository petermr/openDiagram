<p id="Par28">Studies have shown that the pathways related to RNA editing, respiratory electron transfer chain, anther development, energy transport, tapetum development, and oxidative phosphorylation involve interactions between infertility genes and restoration genes. We used yeast two-hybrid to find the protein that interacts with the restorer gene to analyze the mechanism by which the restorer genes restore fertility. The results showed that the restorer gene and the protein involved in RNA editing might work together in the 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS 
 <italic>atp6/orf224</italic> transcript. Mutual work of the restorer gene and the protein involved in RNA editing was shown to induce the infertility gene to be non-functional. We also concluded that restorer genes also interacted with proteins related to energy, respiratory electron transfer chain, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that the occurrence of CMS and fertility restoration might be strictly associated with energy metabolism.

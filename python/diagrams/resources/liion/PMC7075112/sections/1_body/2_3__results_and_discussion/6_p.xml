 <sup>−1</sup> for 1000 cycles. The semicircles in the high-frequency region are contact with the interface charge-transfer process, and the straight lines in the low-frequency region correspond to the Warburg diffusion inner the networks [

 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It can be found that the semicircle of the electrode becomes smaller and that the slope of the straight line becomes larger after 1000 cycles, which is due to the dissolution and redistribution of the active material. The SEM image of the HPC anode after 1000 discharge/charge cycles at 1000 mA g

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. Many macropores maintain their initial shapes and sizes after cycling at such a high current density, which is favourable for obtaining good cycling stability. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d presents digital photographs of a yellow light emitting diode (LED) bulb propelled by an HPC half battery. The bulb darkens gradually. After 5 min, the brightness of the LED bulb decreases obviously compared with its initial state, while the bulb still can work.

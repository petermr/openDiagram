 <italic>In vitro</italic> acquisition of MtzR variably affects trophozoite fitness among MtzR lines relative to their MtzS parents, implying varying clinical 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance. The 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> WB-MtzR line exhibits markedly decreased growth rate with the development of MtzR compared to its susceptible parent [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and lower rates of trophozoite adherence and confluence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). Reduced growth rate is also reported for other MtzR lines [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], some of which also failed to encyst 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. While 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth appears less affected in 106-MtzR and 713-MtzR lines, the ability of trophozoites to attach 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to inert surfaces (culture tubes) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to gastric epithelium (suckling mice intestine) is significantly impaired [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Of the 3 lines explored here, only 106-MtzR retains infectivity in suckling mice [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

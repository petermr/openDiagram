 </sup>. Movement initiation was determined when the joystick cursor exceeded a Euclidian distance of 5 pixels from the starting position. Reaction time was measured between the time of target presentation (joystick trigger press), and movement initiation. Reach duration was measured between the time of movement initiation and crossing of the task boundary.

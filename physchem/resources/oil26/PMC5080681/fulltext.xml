There are about 3000 species of plants containing essential oils, from which 10&#x000a0;% are commercially important and used in perfumes, cosmetics and medicines or used as food and drugs preservatives and flavoring agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutically, essential oils have been approved for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anthelmintic, local anaesthetic, antispasmodic, carminative, expectorant, antimutagenic and many other therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]<italic>.</italic>
</p><p>It is well known that plant biodiversity is greatly affected by geographic location. The Holy Land, especially, West Bank-Palestine, is considered one of the richest areas in plant biodiversity. This may be due to its special climate and topo-geographic terrains. In fact, this location is covered with thousands of plant species. Since ancient time, Jericho was highly advanced in the field of agriculture and horticulture, where peas, lentils, barley and wheat were cultivated. For centuries, thyme was considered one of the most used herbs in the Palestinian folkloric food and medicine. The genus <italic>Thymus</italic> (Lamiaceae family) is known in several Mediterranean and other countries as food and a spice and is employed for the treatment of several diseases including cough, cancer and many fungal skin infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Thymus bovei</italic> Benth. is a native species of the eastern Mediterranean regions. It is an aromatic, perennial herbaceous plant and is considered one of the most important <italic>Thymus</italic> species for culinary and medicinal purposes. In the West Asian and North African regions, this herb has been utilized for treatment of various skin and blood infections as well as other infectious diseases. In the Palestinian folk medicine <italic>T. bovei</italic> has been used as anthelmintic, expectorant, antispasmodic, antiseptic as well as for treatment of injuries, upper respiratory system inflammations and anorexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the chemical composition and biological activity of <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil originating from this area. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of the essential oil of wild-growing <italic>T. bovei</italic> from the city of Jericho in Palestine. The goal was also to test the anthelmintic, antioxidant, antifungal and antibacterial activities of the analyzed essential oil as a potentially new source of biologically active natural products, especially that this plant has been used in the Palestinian folk medicine from ancient times as anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory and as antiseptic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>The following reagents were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity: methanol (Lobachemie, India), n-hexane (Frutarom LTD, Haifa), Trolox ((s)-(&#x02212;)-6 hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethychroman-2-carboxylic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich, Denmark), and (DPPH) 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany).</p><p>Reagents used for the screening of the antimicrobial activity of <italic>T. bovei</italic> volatile oil included nutrient broth that was ordered from Himedia, India, and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was purchased from Riedeldehan, Germany.</p><p>While ethanol (Lobachemie, India) and piperazine citrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Denmark) were the used reagents for the anthelmintic assay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Instrumentations</title><p>In this study, the following instruments were used: Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) (QP-5000 GC-MS Shimadzu, Japan), ultrasonic-microwave cooperative extractor/reactor (CW-2000, China), rotary evaporator (Heidolph OB2000, VV2000, Germany), UV visible spectrophotometer (Jenway 7315, England), grinder (Moulinex model, Uno.

In this method, the volatile oil was extracted using a microwave oven with ultra-sonication. However, during the extraction process, the powder suspension being extracted was exposed to ultrasonic waves to improve the extraction process. In this study, the apparatus consisting of a microwave oven combined with an ultrasonic extractor was used (Ultrasonic-microwave Cooperative Extractor/Reactor (CW-2000, China)). A one L round bottom flask containing about 100&#x000a0;g of the plant was placed in this apparatus. In this flask, the plant was suspended in about 500&#x000a0;ml deionized water. Then, the flask was connected with Clevenger apparatus, which was placed in the same apparatus. While carrying out the extraction process, the power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000&#x000a0;W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was adjusted at its maximum power as well (50&#x000a0;W and at a frequency of 40&#x000a0;kHz). The extraction process using this apparatus was conducted for 10&#x000a0;min at 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. This process was repeated three times. The obtained volatile oil was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried and stored in well closed dark amber colored bottles in the refrigerator at &#x02212;4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

</p><p>It can be seen that 88.59&#x000a0;% was oxygenated monoterpene, the high percentage of this class is due to the high percentage of trans-geraniol (lemonol) (35.38&#x000a0;%), &#x003b1;-citral (20.37&#x000a0;%), &#x003b2;-citral (14.76&#x000a0;%), cis-geraniol (7.38&#x000a0;%), DL-camphor (1.95&#x000a0;%), eucalyptol (1.63&#x000a0;%), thymol (1.28&#x000a0;%), &#x003b2;-linalool (1.17&#x000a0;%) and others comprising less than 1&#x000a0;% of the constituents.</p><p>Other major compounds belonging to monoterpene hydrocarbons were represented in camphene, &#x003b2;-ocimene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, &#x003b1;-terpinene, &#x003b1;-limonene, &#x003b1;-phellandrene and &#x003b2;-pinene and their total percentage was only 2.06&#x000a0;%. On the other hand, farnecene and isocaryophyllene were identified in a total percentage of 2&#x000a0;%, these belong to the hydrocarbon sesquiterpenoid group of essential oils. Oxygenated sesquiterpenoid was found only as nerolidol (0.17&#x000a0;%). Other compounds that are not terpenoid were identified such as 3-octanol (4.38&#x000a0;%) and 3-octanone (1.42&#x000a0;%).</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Anthelmintic activity</title><p>A perusal of Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> reveals that the <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil showed powerful anthelmintic activity which was even higher than the control drug piperazine citrate.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p>Multi-antibiotic resistance is becoming one of the major global concerns. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and many other <italic>&#x000df;-</italic>lactamase inhibitors have become a major clinical problem. Increased attention has been focused on the usage of natural antimicrobial agents, especially from plant origins, due to their safety and efficacy as well as the fact that the majority of essential oils are classified as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In fact, natural products are used intensively as food preservatives, nutraceuticals as well as potential drugs for the treatment and prevention of various diseases and conditions including: cancer, cardiovascular disorders, aging and many others. For these reasons, in recent decades, worldwide studies have been conducted for the characterization, utilization and extraction of biological and pharmacological active compounds from plant origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The results of our phytochemical analysis showed consistent differences in the content of Palestinian <italic>T. bovei</italic> when compared with the only study which was conducted on the similar species by Tepe et al. 2011. Trans-geraniol, &#x003b1;-citral and &#x003b2;-citral were identified as major components of the Palestinian <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil while the major components of the Turkish <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil were carvacrol, p-cymene and thymol. This may be due to the differences between the two geographic and topographic areas, which may greatly affect their constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, these differences in the chemical composition may explain the differences in the antimicrobial activities. In fact, our <italic>T. bovei</italic> showed higher activity than the corresponding Turkish species, which were 0.5 and 31.25 for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 0.25 and 31.25 for <italic>Candida albicans</italic> respectively, which means that our studied species had more powerful antibacterial activity against studied microbial species than the Turkish <italic>Thymus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In addition, our results are in agreement with the literature with regards to the antimicrobial effects of these compounds which were reported in a study conducted by Pattnaik et al. 1996. In this study citral, linalool, geraniol, menthol and cineole were tested against eighteen bacterial strains and twelve fungal strains. The results showed that geraniol and citral are the active constituents in the aromatic plants with strong antibacterial and antifungal potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Another study performed by Singh et al. 2012, found that geraniol and terpineol, the major components of geranium oil, were active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Antifungal activity was also observed against yeast, <italic>Dermatophytes</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In addition, citral isomers such as trans-citral and cis-citral and geraniol were found to have potential antioxidant activity compared to Trolox standard, in studies performed by Choi et al. 2000 and Francesco et al., 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In our study the free radical scavenging activity in comparison with Trolox standard for <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil was higher than <italic>T. bovei</italic> from Turkish origins which may again be caused by differences in the chemical compositions between the two species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In fact, geraniol is an alcoholic monoterpenoid and is commercially used in flavors and fragrances. In addition to its aromatic odor, geraniol is known to exhibit insecticidal and repellent properties and is used as a natural pest control agent exhibiting low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Accordingly, conducting research studies in order to discover other therapeutic agents is a striving challenge. Again, herbals are currently considered the most important door to be addressed. <italic>Thymus bovei</italic>, is extensively used as anthelmintic herb in the Palestinian heritage and folk medicine. Accordingly, it was extremely important to investigate the efficacy of its essential oil as an anthelmintic agent by comparing it with piperazine citrate.</p><p>The anthelmintic activity of <italic>T. bovei</italic> was tested in comparison with piperazine citrate. The obtained results showed significant potency for <italic>T. bovei</italic> against worms, which is supposed to be due to the presence of high content of geraniol in this plant species. In addition, these results showed a concentration dependent effect, since the time of paralysis and death decreased as the concentration of geraniol in the extract increased. These finding are in accordance with the literature, since plants with high geraniol content exhibited anthelmintic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Further pharmacological and toxicological examination of <italic>T. bovei</italic> essential oil are needed to explore its synergistic effects with first line antibiotics, especially against bacteria that have developed resistance, as well as to study its safety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that the essential oil extracted from <italic>T. bovei</italic> was comprised of a mixture of several volatile bioactive components, especially the oxygenated monoterpenoids, which showed strong anthelmintic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. This natural essential oil can be used for manufacturing of food supplements, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals formulations due to its potential biological and pharmacological activities. However, further investigation should be carried out on the <italic>T. bovei</italic> activities against other pathogens as well as cancer, and more studies are required to investigate its anthelmintic activity.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ATCC</term><def><p>American type culture collection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSO</term><def><p>Dimethyl sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPPH</term><def><p>2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GC-MS</term><def><p>Gas chromatography mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GRAS</term><def><p>Generally recognized as safe</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IC<sub>50</sub></term><def><p>Half-maximal inhibitory concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIC</term><def><p>Minimal inhibitory concentration</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the assistance of the technicians Mohamad Arar and Linda Esa and for An-Najah National University and Birzeit University for their support.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data are all contained within the article.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NJ carried out experiments.

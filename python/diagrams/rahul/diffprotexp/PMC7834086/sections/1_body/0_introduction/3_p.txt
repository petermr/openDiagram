0: Thus far, most of the AHPND associated cellular damage caused by PirB is found in the hepatopancreas, stomach and other digestive organs [ 14, 17].
1: The effect of PirB on other shrimp tissues or organs is therefore worthy of evaluation, given that these toxins are transported to other tissues via hemolymph [ 14].
2: Moreover, a recent shrimp transcriptome study revealed the dysregulation of many genes, including apoptosis-related genes in hemocytes of VP AHPND-challenged  P. vannamei [ 18].
3: The dysregulation of apoptosis-related genes in shrimp hemocytes suggests that VP AHPND induces apoptosis in hemocytes, in addition to the typical AHPND-associated damage to hepatopancreas, stomach, and other digestive organs.
4: Given that PirB is more toxic than PirA [ 15], the current study used various techniques to explore how the PirB toxin protein from  V. parahaemolyticus induces apoptosis in shrimp hemocytes.

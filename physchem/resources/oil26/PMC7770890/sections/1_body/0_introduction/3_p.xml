<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It is widely believed that the novel CoV was transmitted from its
natural host to humans via some intermediate host, during which a
progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 acquired the critical ACE2 binding residues
and/or furin cleavage site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> This point
of view is supported in part by the fact that pangolin-CoV isolated
from <italic>Manis javanica</italic> shares almost identical key ACE2-binding
residues with SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#8722;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> However, it is controversial whether pangolins are
the intermediate host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> or natural host,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> or whether they are a host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Phylogenetic analyses
show that some pangolin-CoVs are genetically related to SARS-CoV-2
but do not sufficiently support SARS-CoV-2 emerging directly from
these pangolin-CoVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Obtaining related
viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive approach
to identify the zoonotic origin of a virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> For instance, the full-length genome sequences of viruses isolated
from palm civets and camels are 99.8% and 99.9% identical with human
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> respectively, thus consolidating
that civets are the intermediate host for SARS-CoV and camels for
MERS-CoV. In contrast, RaTG13 shares a genome identity of 96.2% with
SARS-CoV-2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> and pangolin-CoVs only 85&#8211;93%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#8722;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> which is not high enough to justify
that bats or pangolins are a direct zoonotic host of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

 <caption> Protein–protein interaction and parallel reaction monitoring analyses of the differentially expressed proteins. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of the three groups (depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus, A), anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus, B), and insusceptible (Insus, C)) were constructed based on protein alterations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway term enrichments. Proteins/genes were represented by circular nodes. The KEGG pathway is indicated by the rectangle, shaded based on the p value. Higher p value is shown in yellow and lower p value in blue. D Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis of the differentially expressed proteins in the Dep-Sus, Anx-Sus, and Insus groups relative to the control (Cont). Gfap, Rhog, Gnai2, Ppp1r1b, Uqcrh, Tubb6, Urod, Cul1, Spred1, Gpcpd1, Acadl, Ppp1r1a, Grm2, Mtor, Lsm8, Cplx2, Tsta3, Thy1, Unc13a, and Adcy1 were detected on the prefrontal cortical protein extracts of the rats; n = 4–5, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01. </caption>

<p>Five signature genes of each intersection pathway were listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, the expression of BDNF were significantly positively or negatively correlated with each of the signature genes (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the non-dementia controls, the significantly enriched biological processes in HD were mainly related to neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil migration, positive regulation of angiogenesis, regulation of protein maturation and processing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, biological processes of neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil migration, positive regulation of angiogenesis, regulation of protein maturation and processing, were significantly enriched in BDNF-low group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>).

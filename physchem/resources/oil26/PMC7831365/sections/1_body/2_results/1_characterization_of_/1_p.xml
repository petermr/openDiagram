<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A total of 120 sequences were obtained in this study. Due to the poor quality and low coverage of sequences among three pangolins (<italic>Manis javanica</italic>, <italic>M. javanica</italic>, <italic>Phataginus tricuspis</italic>) and one sloth (<italic>Choloepus hoffmanni</italic>), they were not used for subsequent analysis. However, some inactivating mutations (most of them are indels) were found in these sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Fig. S2</xref>). The complete protein-coding sequence of <italic>ACPT</italic> in 116 taxa were used for alignment by PRANK. Interestingly, one or more inactivating mutations (frame-shift mutation, initial codon mutation, premature stop codons, splice site mutations, etc.) were detected in another placental taxa without teeth or without enamel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Table S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Fig. S3</xref>). For example, among toothless baleen whales, the initial codon mutation (n. ATG &#8594; GTG, p. M &#8594; V) was found in <italic>Balaenoptera borealis</italic>, <italic>B. physalus</italic>, <italic>B. musculus</italic>, <italic>Eschrichtius robustus</italic>, <italic>Eubalaena glacialis</italic>. Meanwhile, premature stop codons were found in <italic>B. acutorostrata</italic> and <italic>B. bonaerensis</italic>, frameshift indels were also found in baleen whales. Interestingly, two shared single-base site deletion was found on exon 4 and 5 of <italic>ACPT</italic> among all living baleen whales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Fig. S3</xref>). The splice site mutations were detected in <italic>B. acutorostrata</italic>, <italic>Eubalaena japonica</italic> and <italic>Megaptera novaeangliae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Table S4</xref>). Whilst, the premature stop codons were found in enamel-less <italic>D. novemcinctus</italic> and <italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>. Besides, frameshift indels were found in enamel-less <italic>Kogia breviceps</italic>.</p>

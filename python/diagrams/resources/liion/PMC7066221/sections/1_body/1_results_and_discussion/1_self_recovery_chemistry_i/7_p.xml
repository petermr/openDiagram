<p id="p0085">Resulting from the removal of the salts after the molten-salt synthesis, the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets formed loose-packed particles with a size of several micrometers (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>). The loose packing morphology results in abundant secondary pores, which demonstrates a high specific surface area (139 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and a large total pore volume (0.50 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>), as presented in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>. Owing to the mild condition utilized for the cobalt modification, the resulting material shows a flower-like morphology (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), exhibiting similar surface area (161 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and porosity (0.48 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>) (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). Based on the observation of TEM images, the thickness of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets is approximately 5 nm (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). This value was in accordance with the linear analysis of the 2D height sensor signals using atomic force microscopy (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>), which indicates that the thickness is in the range 3–5 nm. HR-TEM in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>D and 3E demonstrates the [001] view direction of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheet, which clearly shows the (010), (100), and (110) planes with a lattice distance of 2.4, 2.4, and 1.4 Å, respectively. This result is also confirmed by the SAED (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) and XRD (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>) patterns.

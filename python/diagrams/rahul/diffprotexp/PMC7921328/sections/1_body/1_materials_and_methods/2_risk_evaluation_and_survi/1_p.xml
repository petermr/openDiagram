<p>Expression levels of individual differential lncRNAs across all prostate cancer samples were used to investigate the relations between expression variations and patient prognosis. The Cox univariate proportional hazards regression model was adopted to determine risk lncRNAs in prostate cancer. For each lncRNA, all patients were dichotomized into high- and low-expression groups using the median expression level as cut-off. The Kaplanâ€“Meier algorithm was further utilized to compare overall survival times between the two groups as described in previous study (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Differences of overall survival times were estimated by using the log rank test.

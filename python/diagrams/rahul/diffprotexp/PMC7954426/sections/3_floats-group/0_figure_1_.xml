   <bold>Schematic diagram of virulence factors in mycoplasmas</bold>. Virulence factors in mycoplasmas include invasiveness, toxin-like substances, exotoxins, pathogenic enzymes, and some membrane components. Invasiveness refers to the ability of mycoplasmas to break through the hostâ€™s defense function and to settle, reproduce, and spread 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>; it is mediated by various factors that comprise adhesins and accessory proteins, capsular polysaccharides, invasive enzymes, and biofilms. Toxin-like substances primarily include metabolites generated during the process of proliferation, such as H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>, NH
   <sub>3,</sub> and H
   <sub>2</sub>S. Certain mycoplasmas can also secrete some exotoxins including CARDS TX and hemolysin, as well as express various pathogenic enzymes, such as lipolytic enzymes, peptidases, phosphatases, ecto-ATPases, cytotoxic nucleases and nucleotidases, which are considered important pathogenic factors for mycoplasmas. In addition, some inherent molecules of the cell membrane such as lipids, membrane lipoproteins, and the superantigen produced by 
   <italic>M. arthritidis</italic>, may also have a significant pathogenic effect on the host cells or the immune system

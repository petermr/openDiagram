<p id="Par12">Total RNA samples from cultured BMSCs or mouse tissues were prepared using the Total RNA Extraction Kit (#17200; AmyJet Scientific, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were determined by the Nanodrop 2000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cDNA for qRT-PCR was subsequently synthesized from 3 μg total RNA using the Omniscript RT Kit (#205111; Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacturer. Subsequently, the real-time quantitative PCR assay was then conducted using the TransStart® Green qPCR SuperMix kit (#AQ101-01; TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The final expressional levels of circRNAs, microRNAs, or mRNAs were calculated by the standard 2
 <sup>−△△Ct</sup> method based on at least three biological replicates. The covalently closed-loop structures of circRNAs were measured by PCR using divergent primers, whereas opposite-directed primers targeting linear genomic DNA were used as controls. The sequences of all primers used for quantitation are listed in Table

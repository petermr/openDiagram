 <caption> Correlation of the average vdW or electrostatic interaction energies with logBB, TPSA, and logPS at the position of the maximum force experienced by the compound in the case of the GROMOS54a7 force-field, the DOPC membrane model and pulling velocity v = 0.5 nm/ns. The correlation coefficient R for each case is indicated on the top left corner of each graph. </caption>

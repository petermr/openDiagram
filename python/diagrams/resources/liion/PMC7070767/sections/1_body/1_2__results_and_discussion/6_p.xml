 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00891-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows FT-IR spectra of samples. All three samples show a broad band ranging from 3700 to 3200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> associated with the stretching mode of hydrogen in Si-OH groups. A strong band at 2280–2080 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is in the range of silicon hydrogen species (SiH
 <sub>x</sub>, x = 1–3) [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], but due to the characteristic shape of the band, we assigned this band to the adsorbed CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The characteristic asymmetric stretching mode for Si-O corresponds to the band in the range of 1100 to 1400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for samples S1 and S2, which is in line with the PL effect present in the Raman spectrum of S2 [

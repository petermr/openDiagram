0: After complete semen liquefaction, semen analyses (volume, progressive motility, and viability) were performed according to the WHO guidelines for the examination of human semen.
1: [ 519] The motility was determined using direct observation of an aliquot of the sample at 40, and graded as follows: I = progressive motility; II = nonprogressive motility and III = immotile.
2: Sperm concentration was determined by using a Makler chamber (Sefi-Medical Instruments, Haifa, Israel)[ 20] and morphology was evaluated according to the Tygerberg strict criteria.
3: [ 21] In addition, the teratozoospermia index was calculated as the number of abnormalities present  per abnormal spermatozoon.
4: The respective numbers of abnormalities in head, neck/midpiece and tail defects or presence of cytoplasmic droplets are then added together and the resultant sum is divided by the number of abnormal spermatozoa.
5: [ 519]

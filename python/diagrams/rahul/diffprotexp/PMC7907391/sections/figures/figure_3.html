 <caption> ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL expression in adult and pediatric malignancies. Comparison of median ( a) ACE2, ( b) TMPRSS2, and ( c) CTSL expression from 7 pediatric cancer tissues from TARGET (n = 734), and 33 cancer tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 10,535) was conducted. Gene expression is expressed as log 2-transformed function of TPM. ANOVA with Tukey’s test was performed for comparison of expression between studies. *** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>

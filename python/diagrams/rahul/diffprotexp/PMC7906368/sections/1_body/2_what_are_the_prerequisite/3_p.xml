<p>Proteins are usually identified by searching the acquired mass spectra against a protein sequence database. In this strategy, experimental spectra are compared to theoretical spectra predicted from a comprehensive protein database. The database should contain the expected protein sequences for a given sample. Research over the last few years has shown that, ideally, the protein sequence database used for metaproteomics should be derived from a metagenomics/metatranscriptomics sequencing experiment of the same samples used for metaproteomics [

<p>Expression patterns of the genes identified in the common enrichment list were further analysed using a metric heatmap (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). The heatmap included all DEGs in each previous enrichment into a single list (119 genes), by removing redundant genes and normalizing gene counts on a log2 scale. The identified genes were categorized according to the timing of up or down differential expression (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). Some genes were upregulated in both MEFD3plu and MEFD5plu, upregulated only in MEFD5plu, upregulated only in MEFD3plu, and downregulated in both MEFD5plu and MEFD3plu. The first category consisted of 15 genes, namely, 
 <italic>Rorc, Dgat2, Adipoq, Mrap, Fabp4, Lrg1, Lamb3, Cebpa, Adrb2, Retn, Zbtb16, Slc2a4, Ffar2, Fam57b</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rgs2</italic>. The second category consisted of 12 genes, namely, 
 <italic>Rarres2, Adrb3, Scd1, Plac8, Ucp1, Bnip3, Selenbp1, Wfdc21, Fabp3, Steap4, Psmb8</italic>, and 
 <italic>Plac8</italic>. The third category consisted of 13 genes, namely, 
 <italic>Ppargc1a, Cebpb, Arl4a, Pex11a, Aldh6a1, Sh2b2, Frzb, Fgf10, Nr4a3, Nr4a1, Cebpd, Smad3</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sod2</italic>. The fourth category consisted of 13 genes, namely, 
 <italic>Wnt10b, Msx2, Hmga2, Ccnd1, Htr2a, Wisp1, Inhbb, Tgfb1i1, Itga6, Metrnl, Alms1, E2f1</italic>, and

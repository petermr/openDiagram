 </xref> one should distinguish between coordination numbers and hydration numbers: the coordination number of an ion is the number of water molecules in the immediate vicinity of the ion and depends on the distance between the molecule of water and the ion; the hydration number is based on the dynamical behavior of the water molecules in solution. The values inferred from ion‐water pair distribution function analysis are coordination numbers and have no bearing on the strength of the ion‐water association. For example, both the potassium and magnesium ions have an ion‐water coordination number around six. However, the characterization of the dynamics of the ionic solvation shell using ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) has shown that no water exchanges around Mg

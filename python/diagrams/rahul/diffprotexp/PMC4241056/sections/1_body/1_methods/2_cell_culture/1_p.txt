0: The cells of Caco-2 were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China).
1: The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U ml -1 penicillin, and 100 g ml -1 streptomycin at 37C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air.
2: When the cells approximately covered all the bottom of the tissue culture flask, Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS, pH7.4) was used to wash the cells three times.
3: Then trypsin digestion followed to detach the cells from the culture flask.
4: The reseeded density was 30,000 cells per cm 2.

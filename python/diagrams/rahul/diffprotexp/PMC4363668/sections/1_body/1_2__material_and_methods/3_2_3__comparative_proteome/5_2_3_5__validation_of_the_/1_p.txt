0: Western blot analysis was performed to ensure the reliability of the MAlDI-TOFTOF-MS/MS results.
1: Selected differentially expressed proteins in cell samples were verified as previously reported [ 23].
2: HBMEC infection, protein extraction and protein concentrations were performed as previously described in this study.
3: Rabbit anti-DJ-1, vimentin and heat shock proteins 27 polyclonal antibodies were primary antibodies for the immunodetection.
4: HRP-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody (Santa, USA).
5: Tubulin and GAPDH (Santa, USA) was used as a loading control.
6: Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence with ChemiDocXRC+ Imaging System (Bio-Rad, USA) using ECL detection reagents (GE Healthcare, USA).
7: Quantification of the detected bands density value was performed using the version 4.6.2 Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, USA).
8: All immunoblots were run at least in triplicate.

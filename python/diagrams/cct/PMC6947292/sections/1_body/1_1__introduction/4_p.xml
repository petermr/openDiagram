<p>For Al alloys, the most relevant heat treatment that influences strength is age-hardening [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To allow age-hardening in the first instance, alloying element atoms need to be added to the Al base material. This is mostly done in the liquid phase during casting. Age-hardening makes use of the decreasing solubility of aluminium with respect to the major alloying elements and decreasing temperature (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The heat treatment process of age-hardening consists of three major steps: solution treatment, quenching and ageing. The solution treatment aims to achieve a solid solution. A certain duration of soaking at solution temperature is often used to finalise the dissolution processes and/or to obtain a homogeneous distribution of the dissolved alloying element atoms within the matrix. The amount of dissolved major alloying elements typically substantially exceeds the solubility at room temperature. However, during cooling or quenching, the alloying elements need to be kept in solid solution, resulting in supersaturation of the base material. This condition is far from the thermodynamic equilibrium and is thus unstable (this is often referred to as meta-stable since the stability is relative within the timescales considered). From this unstable supersaturated solid-solution during the final ageing treatment, a high particle number density of nano-scale precipitates grows, which hinder the dislocation movement and thereby increase the strength.

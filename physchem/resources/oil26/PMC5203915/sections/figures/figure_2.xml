 <p> Effects of Rhaponticum carthamoides HR and SGR essential oils on IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF- α, and GM-CSF levels in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. The levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated astrocytes were measured by ELISA Kit. Astrocytes were incubated for 24 h with 25, 50, and 100  μg/mL of HR and SGR essential oils and LPS (1  μg/mL). The data is represented as means ± SD and was obtained from three independent experiments. ∗ p &lt; 0.05 versus LPS-treated cells; # p &lt; 0.05 SGR essential oil versus HR essential oil. </p>)

<p>Mid-exponential growth phase cultures of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> were adjusted to 0.2 of OD600. Then, 100 μL of cultures were added to each wells of a 96-well microplate with equal volume of tylosin solution with the final concentrations of 1/2 MIC (0.25 μg/mL), 1/4 MIC (0.125 μg/mL), 1/8 MIC (0.0625 μg/mL), and 1/16 MIC (0.03125 μg/mL), respectively. In addition, a negative control (with THB alone) and a positive control (with bacteria alone) were also included. After incubation at 37°C for 72 h without shaking, the medium was removed by aspiration and the wells were washed three times with sterile physiological saline. The remaining attached bacteria were fixed with 200 μL of 99% methanol (Guoyao Ltd., China) per well, and the plates were emptied after 15 min and left to dry. Then, the plates were stained for 5 min with 200 μL of 2% crystal violet (Guoyao Ltd., China) per well. The excess stain was rinsed off by placing the plate under running tap water. After the plates were air dried, the dye bound to the adherent cells was resolubilized with 200 μL of 33% (v/v) glacial acetic acid (Guoyao Ltd., China) per well. The amount of released stain was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm with a microplate reader (DG5033A, Huadong Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). The reported values are the means of three measurements. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

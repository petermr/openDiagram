  <title>Effect of exogenous ETHE1 protein on the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell apoptosis after DU exposure.</title>
  <p>HEK293 cells were pretreated with or without ETHE1 (100 ng/ml) for 0.5 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. (
   <bold>a</bold>) The cells were stained with JC-1 probe and visualized by confocal microscope. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Mitochondrial depolarization was expressed as the ratio of green to red fluorescence. (
   <bold>c</bold>) The ultrastructures were observed by transmission electron microscopy. (↑) swollen mitochondria; (→) nuclear chromatin concentration and edge accumulation. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry, followed by Annexin V-FITC (FL 1 channels) and PI (FL 2 channels) double staining. Results represent means ± SD of five separate experiments. *

 <caption> MBP is not observed in mitochondrial fractions from fresh brain tissue. Western blot showing (A) the presence of MBP in a mitochondrial fraction derived from frozen control (left) and frozen EAE (right) mouse brain and (B) the absence of MBP in mitochondrial fractions derived from fresh mouse brain tissue (left) together with a positive control prepared by adding purified bovine 18.6 kDa MBP isoform to the mitochondrial fraction derived from fresh mouse tissue (right). </caption>

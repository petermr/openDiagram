<p>With the fast advancement in science and technology, and even faster growing demands by society, the field of energy production and storage is becoming critically important. Regarding high‐density energy‐generating approaches, there has been continuous progress in advanced nuclear power such as breeder/burner technology, thorium reactors, generation IV, and even small modular fission concepts.

Technically speaking, the performance of a Li/Na‐ion battery, determined, for example, by its cell voltage, capacity, and reversible cycling number, essentially depends on the assembly of the electrodes and electrolytes.

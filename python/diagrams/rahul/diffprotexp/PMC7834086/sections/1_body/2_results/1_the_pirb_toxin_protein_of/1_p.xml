<p>The PirA and PirB toxin protein of VP
 <sub>AHPND</sub> were cloned, expressed, and the purified recombinant proteins (His-rPirA and His-rPirB) determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a</xref>). After ascertaining that the correct were obtained (expected molecular weights of about 15 and 50 kDa, respectively), primary shrimp hemocytes were treated with His-rPirA and His-rPirB, followed by immunofluorescence analysis to determine their cellular localization. Immunofluorescence signals of only His-rPirB were found mainly in the cytoplasm and nucleus of treated cells but not in His-rPirA or untreated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1b</xref>), which suggest that only PirB protein could enter shrimp hemocytes.

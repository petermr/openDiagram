<p>The current studies extend our previous observations to a bioinformatic analysis of changes that occur in the Calu-3 cell proteome in response to exposure to a physiologically relevant concentration of carbon nanotubes. The current results corroborate the earlier studies showing that there is an inverse dose response relationship between the concentration of CNT and the functional effects on barrier epithelial cells [

The quantification and bioinformatic analysis of protein expression changes in response to CNT exposure provides a comprehensive understanding of CNTs effect on epithelial cells as well as a background for future toxicological studies.

<p>As proteins are the main players of reactions and cellular processes, the identification of their subcellular localization is important for understanding their function. For example, Zhang and colleagues found that particular proteins in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the intestinal mucosalâ€“luminal interface were much more abundant in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [

Moreover, they were able to discern that it was the host proteins that were more abundant in EVs, whereas microbial proteins were less abundant. This study highlights the power of using subcellular compartment-resolved metaproteomics to reveal associations/interactions between the microbiome and the host. Similarly, as pathogens can induce alterations in specific subcellular compartments of their hosts, the use of subcellular fractionation can help us to better understand these interactions.

<p>In detergent micelles, P4-ATPases hydrolyze ATP only in the presence of their phospholipid substrates [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This property not only permits evaluating the activity of the transporter, but also it allows to assess substrate specificity. We assayed the functional properties of recombinant PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50B-His complex by measuring the lipid-stimulated capacity of PcATP2 to hydrolize ATP. Detergent-solubilized PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50B-His was immobilized in home-made GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads, and the liberated inorganic phosphate upon ATP hydrolysis was quantified spectrophotometrically after 25 min at 37°C in the presence of two putative phospholipid substrates. As negative control, we generated a predicted non-functional mutant of PcATP2 after replacing the aspartate residue at position 596 by an asparagine (Figure supplement 1). This aspartate is part of the conserved P-type ATPase motif DKTG, and undergoes phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation during each transport cycle [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the resulting PcATP2-D596N-GFP mutant is expected to be fully deficient in ATP hydrolysis, as verified in all the tested P-type ATPases [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The presence of both PcATP2 variants and the co-expressed PcCdc50B in the GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, upper panel). Although both PcATP2 versions were visible by Coomassie staining (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, upper panel, A), PcCdc50B was only visible after immunoblotting (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, upper panel, C). In addition, anti-GFP western blot analysis of the two PcATP2 variants eluted from the GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads confirmed the absence of protein degradation fragments containing the GFP (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, upper panel, B), thus validating the use of the GFP fluorescence to measure the concentration of PcATP2 in the beads. Immobilized PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50B-His (called “WT” hereafter) in GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads displayed ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the phospholipids, POPS and POPE (grey bars in 
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), with an apparent ATPase activity between ∼0.5 and 0.7 nmols Pi min
 <sup>−1</sup> μg protein
 <sup>−1</sup>. In the same conditions, the apparent activity obtained from the samples containing the functionally-impaired mutant PcATP2-D596N-GFP/PcCdc50B-His (called “DN” hereafter) ranged from ∼0.2 to 0.4 nmols Pi min
 <sup>−1</sup> μg protein
 <sup>−1</sup> (white bars in 
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, in the absence of added lipids, the apparent activites of both WT and DN (“no lipid” in 
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>,) were in the same range as the DN sample in the presence of POPS and POPE. The slightly higher apparent activity of WT with respect DN in the “no lipid” conditions (“no lipid” in 
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) is probably due to the presence of lipids carried by the protein during purification. Therefore, these results showed that the heterologously produced PcATP2 catalyzes ATP hydrolysis induced by the presence of the phospholipids POPS and POPE. The C-terminal end of PcATP2 and its 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> orthologs contain the equivalent residues Tyr1235 and His1236 of Drs2p, recently identified as a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate PI4P recognition motif [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (Figure supplement 6). In Drs2p, PI4P binding induces a strong increase of the substrate-stimulated ATPase activity [
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our experimental set up, the presence of PI4P slightly increased the signal background in all samples, since we observed a small increase in the average apparent activity in all control experiments (see the non-lipid assays and the DN assays in the presence of POPS and POPE), with increases of the apparent ATPase activity between 0.02 and 0.08 nmols Pi min
 <sup>−1</sup> μg protein
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Nevertheless, we observed a larger increase of the POPS or POPE-stimulated ATPase activity of WT in the presence of PI4P (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The net increase of WT ATPase activity, that is the difference of the apparent ATPase activities of WT in the presence and absence of PI4P after substracting the contribution of the DN sample at each condition were 0.13 and 0.14 nmols Pi min
 <sup>−1</sup> μg protein
 <sup>−1</sup> in the experiments with, respectively, POPS and POPE (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In summary, the detergent-solubilized PcATP2/PcCdc50 complex produced in yeast is functionally competent as it catalyzes lipid-stimulated ATP hydrolysis in the presence of POPS and POPE, being also upregulated by PI4P.

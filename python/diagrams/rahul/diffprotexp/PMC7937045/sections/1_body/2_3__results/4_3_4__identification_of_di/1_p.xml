<p>A total of 441 proteins were identified in serum samples. Serum samples from healthy controls were compared to serum samples from different lung adenocarcinoma groups to obtain differential protein levels. Proteins that were upregulated by &gt;1.3-fold or downregulated by &lt;0.77-fold in serum were considered significant. Based on this rule, 425 proteins increased, and 73 proteins decreased (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S4</xref> serum), and then we made the heat map for the changed in serum proteins (

Elongation factor 1-alpha 2 (Q05639), proteasome subunit alpha type (B2RDG0), and a spermatogenesis-associated protein (A0A0R4J2F1) were significantly increased (&gt;1.3-fold) in all stages of lung adenocarcinoma compared with those of healthy controls (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref>). Transmembrane protein 143 (Q96AN5), cadherin 5 (Q59EA3), fibronectin 1 (A0A024R462), and collectin-11 (Q9BWP8) were significantly lower (&lt;0.77-fold) in adenocarcinoma cancer stages III and IV compared with the level of expression in stages I and II (untransferred) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(d)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(g)</xref>). ELISAs were used to verify the four proteins, and the results were consistent with those of the LC-MS/MS (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(h)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(k)</xref>).

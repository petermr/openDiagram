<p id="p0230">From the characterizations of the powders, there was little difference between SCU@CD-MOF and the blank CD-MOF. Thus, the molecular configurations and SCU locations in CD-MOF were helpful to elucidate the mechanism for the interactions among particles, especially the potential interaction between the particles and the surface of the throat in the NGI device, which in turn changed the laryngeal particles distribution.</p>

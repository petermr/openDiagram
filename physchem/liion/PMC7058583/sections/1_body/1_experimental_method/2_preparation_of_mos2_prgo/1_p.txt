0: MoS 2@rGO was synthesized through one step hydrothermal method.
1: Forty milligrams of rGO and 6.9 mg of PEO (Mw = 100,000) were dissolved in 60 ml of deionized water and homogenized by stirring for 12 h. After the addition of 200 mg of Sodium Molybdate Dihydrate (Na 2MoO 42H 2O) and 500 mg of Sulfourea (NH 2CSNH 2), the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h and poured into 100 ml reactor to reacted at 210C for 24 h. Naturally cooling to room temperature, the obtained products were washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times.
2: The MoS 2/rGO nanocomposites were harvested after drying in vacuum at 60C for 48 h.

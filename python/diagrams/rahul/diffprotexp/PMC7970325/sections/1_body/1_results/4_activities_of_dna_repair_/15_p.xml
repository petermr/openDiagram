<p id="p0130">Overall, in PC compared with FC, we detected upregulated 
 <italic>ATM, p53 and base excision repair pathways</italic> and downregulated 
 <italic>KEGG Fanconi anemia and cell cycle g2-m checkpoint pathways</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). 
 <italic>P53 signaling pathway</italic> is involved in many mechanisms of DNA repair [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. ATM-related pathways participate in double strand DNA breaks repair [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Fanconi anemia pathway coordinate a complex mechanism that enlists elements of three classic DNA repair types: homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, and mutagenic translesion synthesis in response to genotoxic insults [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, we can highlight that PC compared with FC has more active double strand DNA breaks repair and base excision repair pathways, and also more intensively involves homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, and mutagenic translesion synthesis mechanisms.

 <caption> The hydration numbers ( h) of MgCl 2 as a function of concentration computed from the water reorientation dynamic analysis of ab initio and classical MD simulations, and from the THz‐DR experiments. Standard errors of the MD values obtained from the variations of block averages, each lasting 5 ps, using four different time origins. Also reported are values of the integration of the Mg−O radial distribution functions at the second minima, which gives the coordination number (CN) of the first and second shell. </caption>

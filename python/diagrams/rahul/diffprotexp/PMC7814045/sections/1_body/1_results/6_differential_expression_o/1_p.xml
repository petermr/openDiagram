<p id="Par16">Because of their relevance in rRNA post-transcriptional maturation, we analyzed the expression patterns of snoRNAs. Twenty-nine over 77 snoRNAs annotated in the yeast genome are DEGs in at least one treatment. In particular, at 45 minutes, 3 snoRNAs are downregulated and 8 snoRNAs are upregulated; at 120 min, 17 snoRNAs are all downregulated and, at 200 min, 8 snoRNAs are downregulated and 2 snoRNAs are upregulated (Supplemental Table S

<p>Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine
 <sup>®</sup> (250 ng/µl) 2000 transfection reagent (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and a BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi Entry Vector kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). In order to generate stably transfected clones, the transfected cells were selected with Geneticin (KangWei Technology, Beijing, China) for 3–4 weeks (the successfully transfected Caki-1 cell exhibited Geneticin resistance). The stably transfected Caki-1 cell clones were cloned and collected, and were termed Caki-1/XIAP-shRNA-pENTR, with Caki-1/pENTR as the control cells. Due to the fact that the PENTR/U6 plasmid possesses the GFP gene, it is able to produce green fluorescence under a certain wavelength laser and thus, a fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to identify transfected cells. Following formation of the clone cells, the monoclonal cell colony with green fluorescence was selected and transferred onto a 24-well plate for amplification.

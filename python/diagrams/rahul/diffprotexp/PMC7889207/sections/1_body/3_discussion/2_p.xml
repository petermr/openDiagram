<p>The endocrine functions of adipocytes are largely influenced by their size, with larger adipocytes being associated with insulin insensitivity, inflammation and metabolic dysfunction [

In the current study, we observed that VAT from CD-fed rats contained a greater percentage of larger adipocytes compared to SAT, which was accompanied by elevated serum insulin and triglycerides and increased expression of leptin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-6 family [

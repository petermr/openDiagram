<p>While this study advances the current understanding of CNTN1 in PC, we like to emphasize the complex nature of these LE genes with respect to their contributions to CNTN1-mediated PC pathogenesis. This interpretation is based on the upregulation of these LE genes in LNCaP CNTN1 cells over the LNCaP EV cells and their differential expressions are not always positively correlated with PC progression. For instance, C1orf106 is consistently downregulated following PC initiation and metastatic progression. However, it is not uncommon for tumor suppressor genes to be upregulated in response to its tumor surveillance role following oncogenesis [

 <italic>M. suis</italic>, formerly known as 
 <italic>Eperythrozoon</italic> spp. of the family Anaplasmataceae in the order Rickettsiales, was reclassified as a distinct new cluster in the genus mycoplasma based on 16S rRNA gene sequences [
 <xref rid="cit0184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. Although there is a close phylogenetic relationship between 
 <italic>M. suis</italic> and organisms belonging to the pneumoniae group of mycoplasmas, this zoonotic pathogen colonizes erythrocytes, and takes the latter as the preferred target, causing infectious anemia in pigs [
 <xref rid="cit0185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Recent evidence shows that 
 <italic>M. suis</italic> can also interact with the porcine endothelial cells (ECs) and shaping biofilm-like micro-colonies through a budding-like replication mechanism, which makes them capable of propagating on ECs and thereby protect the organism from antibiotics and immune factors to establish persistence infections [
 <xref rid="cit0182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> can produce biofilms both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (swine respiratory tract) and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (PK-15 monolayers and abiotic surface) [
 <xref rid="cit0180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. In addition, its biofilm contains extracellular DNA (eDNA), which initiates the process of biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="cit0171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>].

  <p>PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. 
   <bold>a</bold> Light microscopy and immunofluorescence of IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV strain GDS01 at 7 and 13 hpi. Mock-infected cells at 13 hpi were used as control. 
   <bold>b</bold> One-step growth curve of GDS01 in IPEC-J2 cells. Infected cells were collected at 6-h interval. The virus titers were determined by plaque assay. The error bars represent SEM

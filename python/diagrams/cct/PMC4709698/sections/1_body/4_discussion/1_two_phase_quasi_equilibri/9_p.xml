 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Below the eutectic temperature, the glass should decompose into various crystalline phases (e.g.

 <sub>7</sub>) if the system is given sufficient time. Due to the relatively fast cooling, which we apply here, this process is suppressed as is the transformation of β-Ti to α-Ti. These two metastable phases are retained and the green dotted lines describe their compositional changes on further cooling. Since diffusion is rather limited at these relatively low temperatures, these lines are rather steep (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> a). This is also a result of the negligible changes in the Gibbs free energy differences of both phases at very low temperatures

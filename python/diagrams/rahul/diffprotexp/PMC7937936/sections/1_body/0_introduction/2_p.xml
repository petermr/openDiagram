<p>Tumor microenvironment (TME) is the internal environment for the production and growth of tumor cells, which provides conditions for the initiation, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of the tumor. It is closely related to the survival of tumor cells (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These immune cells and related stromal components, recruited and activated by tumor cells, form a tumor-suppressive inflammatory microenvironment in the early stages of tumor colonization or growth, thereby impeding tumor progression. However, after continuous tumor antigen stimulation and immune activation, the relevant effector cells in the microenvironment are in a state of depletion or remodeling. They cannot perform their normal functions or even promote tumorsâ€™ malignant manifestation, resulting in an immunosuppressive microenvironment (

However, a significant proportion of patients still have limited or no response to immunotherapy. Strong immunosuppressive TME will cause tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells exhausted and lose their ability to eliminate cancer cells, thus reducing the effect of immunotherapy (

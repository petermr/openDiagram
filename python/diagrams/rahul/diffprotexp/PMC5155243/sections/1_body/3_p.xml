<p>To further study the molecular mechanism underlying the resistance to DU-induced nephrotoxicity conferred by MT and investigate the effects of DU exposure on the expression of proteins in kidney tissues, in the present study, we first performed two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and stained proteins with a silver stain which exhibits higher sensitivity. The obtained gel images were analysed using Image Master 2D Elite 3.01. Then, 2-DE was performed again, and the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The differentially expressed protein spots visible to the naked eye were selected for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to perform peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis, and the PMF results were subjected to searches using the Mascot database. The differences in protein expression in kidney tissues following DU exposure in MT−/− mice and MT+/+ mice were analysed to investigate the mechanism of action underlying DU-induced nephrotoxicity and the protective function of MT, to obtain many clues regarding DU intoxication and the protection mechanism of MT.</p>

0: Genes expressed in all fetal and adult tissues (base mean expression  10) were sorted by length.
1: We then employed a sliding window of 200 genes in steps of 40 genes.
2: The log2-fold-change values for the 200 genes within each length bin were averaged and standard errors (SE) for a bin were calculated by propagating the SE determined from the bins log2-fold-change values and the mean SE of the individual genes reflecting their sample variability.
3: Similarly, we computed the relationship of transcript and UTRs length, and gene length with expression (RPKM).

 <caption> CircRAB11FIP1 promoted autophagic flux dependent on ATG14 and ATG7. A, B LV2-NC, LV2-1, LV2-1 + PCMV5-ATG14, LV2-1 + PCMV5-ATG7, or LV2-1+miR-129 inhibitor was transfected into SKOV3 cells. Then, confocal microscopy was performed to analyze the distribution of mRFP-GFP-LC3 in SKOV3 cells. C– D LV6-NC, LV6, LV6 + siATG14, LV6 + siATG7, or LV6 + miR-129 mimics was transfected into A2780 cells. Thereafter, confocal microscopy was conducted to analyze the distribution of mRFP-GFP-LC3 in A2780 cells. The Image-Pro Plus 6.0 was used to quantify LC3 dots. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and typical results were displayed. Error bar represents standard error. * P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.01 . Scale bar = 5 µm. </caption>

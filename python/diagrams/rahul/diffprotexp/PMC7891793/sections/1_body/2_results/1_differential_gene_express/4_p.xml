<p>Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis demonstrated that these differentially expressed genes are associated with a total of 33 GO terms, among them, there were 24 GO terms with adjusted p&lt;0.05 (
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 10 out of 24 significantly enriched terms were related to the immune system functions, such as innate immune functions, including activation of neutrophils and the classical pathway of complement activation. Adaptive immune functions included: B cell differentiation and activation, antigen recognition, and humoral immune response mediated by circulating immunoglobulin. However, none of the immune system related terms were specific to a certain treatment group. granulocyte/neutrophil activation GO terms (GO:0042119, GO:0036230) were not enriched in samples from group 6 (day 3â€“10 FPI and ibuprofen). In other treatment groups, the ANXA3 (annexin A3) and/or FCGR3A genes from granulocyte/neutrophil activation GO terms were differentially expressed; in all groups these genes had significantly lower levels of expression.

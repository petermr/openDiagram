<p>Gene differential expression analysis was applied to uncover the effects of DEHP exposure to PG cells. In BPG cells, exposure to DEHP significantly increased 186 genes and decreased 159 genes at PD0, while the number of DEGs up-regulated by DEHP at PD3 reached 279 and with 571 down-regulated (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S6</xref>). Similarly, for EPG cells, 149 and 474 genes were up-regulated by DEHP at PD0 and PD3, respectively, and 236 and 313 genes were down-regulated (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>F, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S7</xref>). In addition, 192 key DEGs in BPG and 248 key DEGs in EPG were affected by DEHP both at PD0 and PD3, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S6</xref>C-D). GO enrichment analysis indicated that the key DEGs of BPG cells were involved in the processes of “ribosome assembly”, “catabolic process”, “positive regulation of cell death”, and “reproductive system development” (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>G). Meanwhile, genes of EPG cells were enriched in “cytoplasmic translation” and “regulation of transition”, as well as “positive regulation of cell death” and “reproductive system development” (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>H). Furthermore, Metascape enrichment analysis of protein-protein interaction revealed that the key DEGs of BPG were enriched in terms of “regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity” and “positive regulation of cell cycle” (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S6</xref>E); while those of EPG were associated with “regulation of binding”, “protein localization to cell surface”, and “cellular response to cadmium ion” (

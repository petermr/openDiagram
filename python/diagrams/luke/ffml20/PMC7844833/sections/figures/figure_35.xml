  <p>Comparison of the experimental and simulated Au L
   <sub>3</sub>-edge and Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra for a Rh–Au NP system. Theoretical data are obtained from Monte Carlo modeling with classical MEAM force field models, and correspond to an ensemble consisting of NPs of two types: small Rh clusters and larger Rh–Au alloy NPs. A structure model is constructed based on the analysis of coordination numbers extracted from EXAFS, TEM measurements, as well as computational screening of different models until the best agreement between experiment and simulation was obtained.

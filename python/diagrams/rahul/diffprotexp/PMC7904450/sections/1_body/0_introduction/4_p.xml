<p id="p0035">Recently, Zhou et al. performed phylogenetic analyses of multiple human coronavirus genomes to identify evolutionarily conserved targets for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Their quantification of interactions between the human coronavirus-host interactome and subsequent gene set enrichment analyses comparing coronavirus-infected host cells and drug-treated human cells identified the SSRI paroxetine as a novel COVID-19 therapeutic candidate

 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Preliminary reports also suggest that fluoxetine demonstrates direct inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral protein expression

<p id="p0110">To investigate the function roles of RGE in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the altered proteins were subjected to GO-based enrichment analysis using STRING version 10.0 (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). The most significantly enriched terms in each GO category were included for “biological process,” “cell component,” and “molecular function” (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The biological process category showed that most proteins were associated with small molecule metabolic process (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.56 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>), nucleotide metabolic process (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.69 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>), and cytoskeleton organization (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.98 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>). In addition, most of the differentially expressed metabolic related-proteins (such as CYC2, 1433Z, GPDH, VATA, and ND75) were found to be up-regulated in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The “cell component” annotation revealed a major spectrum of organelle part (
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.53 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup>), actin filament (5.14 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup>), and cytoskeletal part (2.21 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup>). Proteins that participated in the “molecular function” were related to the structural constituent of cytoskeleton (
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.72 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>), oxidoreductase activity (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.51 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), and catalytic activity (
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.25 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Most proteins enriched within these GO terms were up-regulated in the RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> compared to the wild type.

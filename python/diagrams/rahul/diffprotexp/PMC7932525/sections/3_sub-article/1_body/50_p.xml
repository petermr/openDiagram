<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript entitled " Genome-wide differential expression analysis of vegetative cell and heterocyst responses to nitrogen deprivation in the Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120" is quite interesting and has a potential use of great knowledge to know the nitrogen fixing capabilities of Anabaena’s heterocyst and vegetative cell. Though the manuscript is only based on transcriptome level analysis, as per my consideration, the current manuscript can be considered in Plos one, it satisfies all the comments. Thus, I am suggesting a major revision.</p>

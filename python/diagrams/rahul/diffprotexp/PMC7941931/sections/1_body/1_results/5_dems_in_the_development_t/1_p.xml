<p id="Par34">To identify Tartary buckwheat seed development-associated miRNAs and understand their potential regulatory mechanisms, the DEMs were identified by comparing the TPM expression value. A total of 76 miRNAs, including 39 conserved and 37 novel miRNAs, displayed significant differential expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Among these, 45, 43, and 22 miRNAs were found in the comparisons between S1 and S2, S1 and S3, and S2 and S3, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). When compared with S1, 1 miRNA (fta_novel_miR110) was differentially expressed in both S2 and S3 stages, and 22 and 17 miRNAs were specifically differentially expressed in the S2 and S3 stage, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). When compared with S2, 4 miRNAs were specifically differential expression in S3 stage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). In addition, between stages S1 and S2, 19 and 26 miRNAs were up- or down-regulated, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In the S1 vs. S3 comparison, 23 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated miRNAs were found. In the comparison of S2 vs. S3, 11 and 11 miRNAs were up- or down-regulated, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).

0: NMR spectra were recorded at 30 C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Pola Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a cryoprobe.
1: Samples were dissolved in DMSO- d6, and the solvent peak was used as the reference at the chemicals shifts  H 2.50 ppm and  C 39.52 ppm.
2: LRESIMS data were recorded on a Water ZQ ESI mass spectrometer (Milford, MA, USA).
3: (+)-High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) was used to determine the accurate molecular weight and molecular formula of the isolated compounds.
4: HRESIMS were recorded on a Applied Biosystems Mariner Biospectrometry TOF workstation (Foster City, CA, USA) using positive electrospray ionization.
5: Ultraviolet (UV) spectra were acquired on a Shimadzu UV-1800 UV spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan), and infrared (IR) measurements were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer (Zurich, Switzerland).
6: Fluorescence intensity spectra were recorded in MeOH by 3D top scanning on a Tecan Spark Plate Reader (Mannedorf, Switzerland) with excitation wavelengths from 250 to 700 nm incremented by 10 nm and emissions intensity recorded from 280 to 700 nm at 10 nm steps at each excitation wavelength.
7: HPLC separations were performed on a Merck Hitachi L-7100 pump equipped with a Hitachi L-7455 PDA detector, D-7000 interface (Tokyo, Japan), and a Gilson 215 liquid handler (Middleton, WI, USA) to collect the fractions.
8: The guard column (20 mm  10 mm) was packed with Altech Davisil 3040 m 60 A C 18 silica gel (Columbia, MD, USA).
9: The guard column was attached before the preparative column, a Thermo Fisher Scientific BetaSil C 18 (150 mm  21.2 mm, 5 m) (Waltham, MA, USA).
10: The solvents used were HPLC grade MeOH (Lab-Scan) (Barcelona, Spain), Milli-Q PF (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) filtered water, and spectroscopy grade trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Alfa Aesar) (Ward Hill, MA, USA).

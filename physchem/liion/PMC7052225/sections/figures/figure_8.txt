0: Figure 8 ( a ) Cyclic voltammetry experiments performed at a scan rate of 0.03 mVs^1 for three LFP electrodes containing VGCF (), VGCFCOOH ( ), and VGCFSO_3H (   ) as carbon additives.
1: The inset shows a photograph of self-standing films made of VGCF and VGCFCOOH carbons.
2: ( b ) Comparison of rate capabilities among the same electrodes.
3: Full and empty characters represent charges and discharges, respectively.

<p>Males and females were analyzed separately. Whisker pad mechanical thresholds were averaged for FRICT-ION-injured mice receiving TAT-C3P or TAT-C3D peptides. The behavioral data were expressed as mean ± SEM using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc testing with Tukey’s multiple comparisons over time. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Normalized fold change between TAT-C3P-peptide-treated and control TAT-C3D-peptide-treated mice was compared with t-tests for the Western blots. Statistical analysis of the transcript cluster-level data comparisons was done via paired t-tests.</p>

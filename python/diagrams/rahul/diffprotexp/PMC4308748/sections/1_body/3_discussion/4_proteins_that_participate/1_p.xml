<p>In the ischemia group, we observed up regulation of the calcium binding proteins calgranuliin B and annexin A1, which participate in inflammatory reactions to protect against pathological microorganisms. These proteins are primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes, which migrate to extracellular regions and produce high levels of calcium binding proteins during inflammation[

In the ischemia/reperfusion group, we observed up regulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor which functions as a pleiotropic protein and participates in inflammatory and immune responses, regulates the active defense functions of macrophages, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by up regulating anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids. In addition, we observed down regulation of alpha1-acid glycoprotein, a stable acute-phase reactant that inhibits neutrophil migration by a nitric oxide-dependent process, although its biological functions remains poorly understood[

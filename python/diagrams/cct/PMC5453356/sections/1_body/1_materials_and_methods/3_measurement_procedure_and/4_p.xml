<p>If the baseline measurement is also performed with two inert reference samples, the value of the excess specific heat capacity results after data evaluation [
 <xref rid="b27-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This evaluation usually includes normalizing the heat flow values by the scanning rate and sample mass to the value of the specific heat capacity. This allows the comparison of different experiments with varying scanning rates. In this work, it was not possible to normalize the heat flow by the scanning rate, as the scan rate of the soaking step equals zero. Therefore, the isothermally measured heat flow after scanning an alloyed sample 
 <italic>versus</italic> a pure aluminum reference sample was used for evaluation. The heat flow curve obtained from the same temperature time profile for two pure aluminum samples was subtracted as a baseline measurement. This baseline subtraction is necessary to distinguish the sample heat flow from instrumental artefacts. Due to small asymmetries between the baseline and sample measurement (e.g., due to different sample or lid positions [
 <xref rid="b36-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]), this does not necessarily result in a zero value in reaction-free time ranges. However, one basic assumption for the evaluation is that heat flow equals zero as long as no reactions are occurring in the sample. Therefore, the heat flow curves were vertically shifted with respect to time ranges where no reactions are expected (

<p>Spinal cord tissue was shattered after pre-cooling with liquid nitrogen and then ground under liquid nitrogen flow. Subsequently, spinal cord tissue was processed with 20 μL/mL cocktail protease inhibitor. After addition of lysis buffer, the suspensions were homogenized by sonication using a Dounce homogenizer in iced water and then pure water, and centrifuged. The supernatant was used to determine the protein concentration and then stored at −80°C.</p>

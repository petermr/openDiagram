<p>Studies leveraging MIA models in mice have demonstrated the role of maternal immune signaling as a risk factor for cellular, anatomical, and behavioral outcomes in offspring. Nonetheless, a systems-level perspective of the early neurodevelopmental trajectory of pathology associated with MIA has been lacking. Our results offer a time course resolved map of molecular targets aberrantly transcribed in developing cerebral cortex following MIA. MIA-associated transcriptional signatures were robust, changed greatly across the surveyed time- points, and revealed novel pathways and processes involved in pathology. Among MIA-associated DE up-regulated and down-regulated genes, there was strong enrichment for ASD-relevant loci, indicating the general translational relevance of our MIA model to ASD. Both male and female samples were examined, and we did not find evidence for strong sex-specific DE signatures or impacts on neuroanatomy. Elucidating the trajectory of transcriptional changes across embryonic cortical development following mid-gestational MIA represents a valuable step toward understanding the progression of MIA-induced pathology in the developing brain of offspring.</p>

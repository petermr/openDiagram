<p>In sum, in order to solve the interfacial problems of anode and cathode simultaneously, it is necessary and feasible to develop multi‚Äêlayer symmetrical/asymmetric SCEs according to the characteristics of anode and cathode.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref> These SCEs could better adapt to the interface changes in the charging and discharging process and reduce the interfacial impedance. In addition, the addition of an extremely small amount of liquid electrolyte or ionic liquid at the interface could better wet the interface and keep the properties of the solid state for batteries.

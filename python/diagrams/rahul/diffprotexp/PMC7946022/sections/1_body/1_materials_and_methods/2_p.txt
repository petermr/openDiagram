0: Strains and growth conditions.
1: The  Candida albicans wild-type strain SC5314 [ 43] and the methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus strain (USA300 LAC) were used in this study.
2: S. aureus mutant derivatives of the reference WT strain defective in cell autolysis regulation (lrgA and lrgB) were obtained from the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (University of Nebraska, NE).
3: C. albicans was grown on yeast peptone dextrose broth (YPD) (Difco Laboratories) overnight at 30C and  S. aureus cultures were grown overnight in trypticase soy broth (TSB) (Difco) at 37C.
4: Cells were washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and resuspended in RPMI 1640-HEPES (Invitrogen) media to final cell density needed.

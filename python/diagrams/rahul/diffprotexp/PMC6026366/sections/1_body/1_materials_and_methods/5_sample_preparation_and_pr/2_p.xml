 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (21 d old, about 20 flies each) were resuspended in 600 μL lysis buffer (7M Urea, 2M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Bullet Blender (Next Advance, Averill Park, NY, USA) was used to break the tissue as described previously 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Supernatants were collected after sharking in ice for 2 h and centrifugation at 12,000
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min. Concentrations of proteins were detected using the 
 <italic>RC DC</italic> Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The protein samples were purified using the 2D Cleanup kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments in this study were performed in triplicate gels (

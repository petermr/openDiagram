<p>To reduce sample complexity during liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis (Strong cation exchange chromatography; SCX), the iTRAQ labeled peptide samples were reconstituted in Buffer A (25% ACN, 10 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>; pH 3.0) and fractionated using Ultremex SCX column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA; Luna SCX 100A) via the LC-20AB HPLC Pump system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a gradient of Buffer B (25% ACN, 2 M KCL, 10 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>; pH 3.0). Buffer B reached 100% in 10 min. The column flow rate was maintained at 400 nl/min, and the column temperature was maintained at room temperature and at a pressure of 1,000 psi. The collected fractions were desalted using Strata X C18 column (Phenomenex), and were vacuum centrifuged (4°C and 20,000 × g for 30 min) and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. The mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis was performed using a Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Nanoflow electrospray ionization MS/MS analysis of peptide samples was performed using an Eksigent NanoLC-2D system (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA).

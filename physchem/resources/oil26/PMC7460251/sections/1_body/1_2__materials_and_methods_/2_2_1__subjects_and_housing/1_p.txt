0: Four aardvarks housed in two social groups at the Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak, MI, USA, participated in this study.
1: Although a small sample size, this represents 11.4% of the aardvark population housed in AZA facilities [ 23].
2: A fourteen-year-old male, Baji, and a six-year-old female, Roxaane, comprised one group.
3: A second group was comprised of a thirteen-year-old female, Rachaael, and a three-year-old female, Kaatie.
4: Baji and Rachaael are the parents of both younger aardvarks.
5: During the study, the aardvarks rotated daily between two behind-the-scenes indoor habitats of similar size with varied substrates and features ( Table 1).
6: The habitats shared a barrier that allowed for limited contact between the two groups.
7: Light cycles for both habitats were created using a combination of artificial lighting and skylights, with the dark phase lasting from approximately 22:00 to 08:00 during this study.
8: These aardvarks have never been housed on a reversed light cycle at the Detroit Zoo due to concerns about how that practice could potentially affect their welfare.
9: Animal care staff usually serviced the habitat between 16:00 and 18:00, while the aardvarks slept.
10: Fresh food (roughly 0.68 kg per aardvark of Mazuri  insectivore diet; St. Louis, MO, USA) and water were provided nightly by 22:00, prior to the final light being turned off and animal care staff leaving the building.

<p>The results demonstrated that expression of lncRNAs ENSRNOT00000080713, ENSRNOT00000090564, ENSRNOT00000082588, ENSRNOT00000091080 and ENSRNOT00000091570 were markedly decreased in MIRI group compared with those in the control group, whilst ENSRNOT00000087777, ENSRNOT00000082061, ENSRNOT00000091108, ENSRNOT00000087028 and ENSRNOT00000086475 were markedly increased. In addition, the mRNAs Frs3, Zfp523, Dnajc6, Nedd4l and Tep1 were markedly decreased in the MIRI group compared with those in the control group, but Myef2, Tgfbr1, Fgf12, Mef2c and Tfdp1 were markedly increased. These RT-qPCR results were consistent with the results from the transcriptome sequencing (

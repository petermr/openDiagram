<p>In patients diagnosed with 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> pneumonia, a significant seroconversion of CARDS TX has been observed [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], indicating that the toxin is synthesized 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and possesses highly immunogenic epitopes. When 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> was co-cultured with host cells, CARDS TX expression was significantly increased compared with that in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inanimate medium, thereby supporting the fact that the synthesis of this toxin depends on the interaction between host cells and 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At the same time, 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>-infected mice showed significantly increased amount of CARDS TX protein in lung tissues compared with that cultured in SP-4 liquid medium [
 <xref rid="cit0211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. This suggested that the transcription and translation processes of CARDS TX are strengthened after 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> receives the environmental stimulation signal from the host cell. In addition, different strains appear to exhibit multifarious CARDS TX producing capabilities. Techasaensiri et al. suggested that although the S1 strain (subtype 2) and two M129 strains (M129-B7 and M129-B9, subtype 1) can produce CARDS TX, the former expresses more CARDS TX in contrast to the latter two [
 <xref rid="cit0212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. The differential expression of CARDS TX in these subtype strains was further verified using transcriptome and proteome analysis [
 <xref rid="cit0213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. This is consistent with a previous report that subtype 2 strains are more prolific in biofilms [
 <xref rid="cit0174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>], which indicates that subtype 2 is more virulent.

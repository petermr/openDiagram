0: We present a novel concept to achieve high performance and high safety simultaneously by passivating a Li-ion cell and then self-heating before use.
1: By adding a small amount of triallyl phosphate in conventional electrolytes, we show that resistances of the passivated cells can increase by ~5, thereby ensuring high safety and thermal stability.
2: High power before battery operation is delivered by self-heating to an elevated temperature such as 60C within tens of seconds.
3: The present approach of building a resistive cell with highly stable materials and then delivering high power on demand through rapid thermal stimulation leads to a revolutionary route to high safety when batteries are not in use and high battery performance upon operation.

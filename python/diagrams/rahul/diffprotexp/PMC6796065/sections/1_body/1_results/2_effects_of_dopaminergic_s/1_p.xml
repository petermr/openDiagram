<p id="Par9">We examined the effects of 55 SNPs in 8 dopaminergic system associated molecules (
 <italic>ANKK1</italic>, 
 <italic>DRD2</italic>, 
 <italic>PPP1R1B</italic>, 
 <italic>PPP3CA</italic>, 
 <italic>PPP3CB</italic>, 
 <italic>PPP3CC</italic>, 
 <italic>PPP3R1</italic>, 
 <italic>and PPP3R2</italic>) on the protein expression levels of DARPP-32 or CaN in a cohort of patients and controls (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) as described in Materials and Methods. The levels of protein expression were compared between minor allele carriers and non-carriers of these SNPs. The results are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2a</xref>. Significant associations were observed with 4 SNPs in the 
 <italic>DRD2</italic> (2), 
 <italic>PPP3CB</italic> (1), and 
 <italic>PPP3CC</italic> (1). These SNPs predicted protein expression (DARPP-32 or CaN) in the postmortem brains (BA10 or NAc). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2b</xref>, analysis of a second independent sample set confirmed only 1 SNPs out of 4SNPs: exm956405 (=rs1801028). There was a significant association between the expressions of CaN in the NAc and exm956405 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; first sample set: U = 10.0, p = 0.016; second sample set: U = 0.0, p = 0.046).

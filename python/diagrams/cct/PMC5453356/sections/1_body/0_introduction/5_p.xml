<p>Some publications have shown that it is possible to measure 
 <italic>in situ</italic> precipitation reactions at an isothermal soaking step with different calorimetric techniques [

 <xref rid="b23-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, typically, the whole heat treatment was not performed in the calorimeter device. Solution annealing and quenching were performed outside the calorimeter, for example in a salt bath or in an air circulating furnace. For the isothermal soaking step, the samples were inserted in a preheated calorimeter. Hence, a relatively large time step cannot be measured, because the temperatures of the sample and furnace have to equilibrate first.

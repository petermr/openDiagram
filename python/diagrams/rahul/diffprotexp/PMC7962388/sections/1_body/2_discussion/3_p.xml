<p id="Par71">The development of the first 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> floral transcriptomes of reference for apomictic and sexual genotypes widened the opportunities for identifying reproductive genes and provided a whole catalogue of full-length molecules related to traits of agronomical interest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the scarcity of reliable statistical information due to the absence of replicates was a serious challenge to network interaction predictions and functional analysis preparation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Moreover, since the reference transcriptomes were produced from bulked samples representing different developmental stages, the temporal variation of expression during development remained unexplored at a wide-genome level. Indeed, stage-specific qRT-PCR analyses were carried out for some of the candidates in several genotypes of contrasting reproductive modes, in order to evaluate the chronological evolution of the expression in the course of development. Finally, no information on the antisense/sense orientation of the DETs was available, a fact that partially constrained the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the sexuality/apomixis transition. In particular, since the differential expression of several retrotransposons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and pseudogenes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] was associated with the occurrence of apomixis in 
 <italic>Paspalum</italic>, determining the sense/antisense nature of these groups of transcripts is central to disclose their possible role on molecular mechanisms regulating reproduction.

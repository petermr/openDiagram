<p id="p0050">The extent of lipid peroxidation in whole tissue was estimated by measurement of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) formation 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The MDA assay was performed using an MDA kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 0.2 mL thiobarbituric acid and antioxidant reagents were respectively pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube containing 0.1 mL of wild type or RGE-treated homogenate and MDA standard solution. Tubes were vortexed and then incubated at 95°C for 40 min and centrifuged at 4,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Then, 0.3 mL of the supernatant from each of the tubes was transferred to the quartz sampling cell, and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Lite; Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The content of MDA was expressed as nmol MDA/mg homogenate protein. The total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

 <caption> (a, b) Effect of the synthesis parameters on the structure of MnO x catalysts for OER. (a) Mn K-edge EXAFS and XANES (inset) after deposition on the electrode (thick lines) and after 3 min at 1.76 V in 0.1 M K 2HPO 4 and 0.1 M KH 2PO 4 mixture for samples prepared via the synproportionation method (black lines) and impregnation-based synthesis (red lines). The former results in a structure dominated by edge-sharing octahedra, as in δ-MnO 2, while the latter leads to corner-sharing structure units as in β-MnO 2 and γ-MnO 2, as shown in panel b.

(c, d) Activation of δ-MnO 2 films by incorporation of Mn 3+ species. (c) In situ Mn K-edge XANES after applying a sequence of potential pulses between 1.1 and −0.4 V (NHE). The inset shows the edge position after a sequence of pulses terminated at an anodic (“A”) or a cathodic (“C”) potential. (d) Changes in Mn–O (red) and Mn–Mn (blue) coordination numbers, as extracted from EXAFS data fitting signifying the transition from a δ-MnO 2-like structure to a spinel-like α-Mn 3O 4 phase (structure models are shown in the insets in panel c).

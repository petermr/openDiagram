0: We report here CNTN1 upregulation in LNCaP cell-derived xenografts produced in castrated mice compared to the xenografts generated in intact mice.
1: Ectopic expression of CNTN1 in LNCaP cells enhances cell proliferation.
2: RNA-sequencing analysis of LNCaP empty vector (EV) cells and LNCaP CNTN1 cells identified an enrichment of the CREIGHTON_ENDOCRINE_THERAPY_RESISTANCE_3 gene set in LNCaP CNTN1 cells.
3: The 10 leading-edge genes of this enrichment are novel to PC; they display differential expression in PC compared to normal prostate tissue, PCs with  TMPRSS2-ERG fusion compared to those without the fusion, and mPCs compared to primary PC.
4: Furthermore, this 10-gene panel robustly predicts PC relapse in two independent cohorts, the TCGA PanCancer ( n = 492) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC,  n = 140), as well as poor overall survival (OS) in another urogenital cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
5: Collectively, we observed a novel aspect of CNTN1-associated genes; this research is promising not only in our understanding of PC but also in improving the clinical management of PC patients.

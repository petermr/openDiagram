0: RT-qPCR was used to detect candidate gene m6A methylation and mRNA expression levels.
1: Total RNA from MH7A cells and synovial tissues of AA rats was extracted by Mireasy Mini Kit (cat 217004, Qiagen).
2: A Nanodrop nd-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Science, Walsham, Massachusetts, USA) was used to determine the concentration and purity of RNA.
3: Then, cDNA reverse transcription and RT-qPCR reactions were performed using StepOne SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (ABclonal, RK20404).
4: Reactions proceeded using the following conditions: 95C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 5 s, 60C for 30 s. Melting curves ranging from 60C to 95C were included in each run.

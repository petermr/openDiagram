<p>The AAF/V encoding genes (
 <italic>agg5DCBA</italic>) were amplified by PCR using plasmid DNA of the aUPEC isolate 147/06 (alternative designation 1352) as template and primer pair agg5_for/agg5_rev. The resulting PCR product was cut with 
 <italic>Xba</italic>I and ligated into pBAD24 that had been digested with

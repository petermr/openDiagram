<p>On the other side, eight proteins were up-regulated in the stationary growth phase; some of these proteins were involved in maintaining osmotic balance of the living cells under stress such as glucose-methanol-choline and dibenzothiophene desulfurization enzyme C, which have oxidoreductase activity. This result was previously confirmed at the transcriptomic level of

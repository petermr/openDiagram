<p>The mRNA–lncRNA expression correlation networks in the TC-EC model and in EC alone were constructed using Affymetrix microarray profiling data. To assess network characteristics, we computed the degree of each node in both networks. We compared the values of each group and subtracted them to get the | Diff| value. Both mRNA–lncRNA co-expression correlation networks were constructed using the top 10 mRNAs/lncRNAs arranged from large to small and visualized using Cytoscape v3.7.2. Those mRNA/lncRNAs without interaction relationships were not displayed in the network.</p>

<p>Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed by using R package clusterProfiler from Bioconductor to analyze the functional profile of gene clusters from differentially expressed genes (up- and downregulated genes of individual glioma grade) and transcription factor regulon clusters (positively and negatively regulated targets for each ETS regulon) [
 <xref rid="B39-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The enriched GO term and KEGG pathways were determined by using a Benjamini &amp; Hochberg corrected

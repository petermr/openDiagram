 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] have been documented. However, the global gene expression pattern and small RNA profile of sweet and bitter quinoa varieties during virus infection was lacking prior to this study. To inspect the molecular interaction of CMV infection on the host transcriptome over time (1 and 4 dpi), three varieties were inoculated with either buffer or CMV-infected leaf sap. Based on bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome sequences, DEGs were detected between mock- and virus-inoculated samples. Furthermore, integration of sRNA analyses including miRNA, endogenous siRNA, and vsiRNA provided the knowledge on complexes recruited in host sRNA biogenesis and filled the knowledge gaps on antiviral gene silencing factors in quinoa during CMV infection.

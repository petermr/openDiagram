0: Fastq data files were trimmed using Trim Galore (version 0.5.0) 19.
1: The trimmed sequences were aligned against the human genome (GRCH38) using HISAT2 before sorting reads using samtools 20,  21.
2: Finally, reads were quantified using featureCounts (version 1.6.4) against the GENCODE gene reference 22,  23.

<p>In summary, we systematically explored the expression and prognostic value of differently expressed RBPs by a series of bioinformatics analyses in tongue cancer. The prognostic risk model based on the hub RBP genes was constructed, and served as an independent prognostic factor for tongue cancer. In addition, we revealed these hub RBPs functioned through multiple critical tumor metabolic processes. Our results would contribute to show the pathogenesis of tongue cancer and to develop new treatment targets and prognostic molecular markers.</p>

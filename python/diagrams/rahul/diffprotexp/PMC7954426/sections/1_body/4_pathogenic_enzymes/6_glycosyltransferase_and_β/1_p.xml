 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> glycosyltransferase is involved in the biosynthesis of galactocerebroside, that is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome [
 <xref rid="cit0249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. In certain mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas, glycosyltransferase is involved in the formation of capsule, and thereby participating in anti-phagocytosis and promotes survival in the host [
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Bgl is a 6-phospho-β-glucosidase that is related to the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar: Phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS). Both of them participate in the incorporation and phosphorylation of β-D-glucoside [
 <xref rid="cit0250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>]. Moreover, Mmm SC possesses a β-glucosidase encoded by 
 <italic>bgl</italic>, while the gene diversity is associated with the degree of virulence of Mmm SC [
 <xref rid="cit0251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. Comparative genome sequencing analysis of 
 <italic>bgl</italic> revealed that the homology is also present in Mmc and 
 <italic>M. leachii</italic>, but their function remains to be identified.

<p id="Par24">We identified 196, 146, 470, 416, 209, 81 and 75 APA switching genes at 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 hpi, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), among which 171 genes switched to longer 3′ UTR, 273 genes switched to shorter, while 360 genes showed dynamic switching of 3′ UTR length at different time points, which suggests that these dynamic switching genes may play an active role in the host–pathogen interaction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). According to the tandem APA switching genes at different time points, we found that 3′ UTR tended to be shortened at the early stage after infection, while the number of genes with lengthened 3′ UTR increased at 7–10 hpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), which were consistent with previous research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Then we investigated the biological processes of the tandem 3′ UTR APA switching genes and found that most genes were involved with cellular process, metabolic process and response to stimulus etc., few genes were involved in immune system process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). After pathway enrichment, the genes with highly significant 
 <italic>p</italic> values were mainly involved with spliceosome, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Epstein-Barr virus infection, endocytosis pathway etc. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). For immune response after PEDV infection, several associated pathways were found, such as antigen processing and presentation, TGF-beta signaling pathway, etc. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d).

<p>No systematic study of the interacting influences of prior solidification rate, solution treatment and alloying element concentration on quench-induced precipitation is currently available for cast alloys. However, there are differences of several orders of magnitude in the solidification rates for the three alloys considered here. These solidification rates are estimated to be around 10
 <sup>5</sup> K/s for LBM [

 <xref rid="B217-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>], 10
 <sup>3</sup> K/s for die casting and 10
 <sup>1</sup> K/s for conventional casting [
 <xref rid="B218-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. Further, the solidification structure is greatly changed by prolonged soaking at solution temperature. For the AlSiMg cast alloys, it appears that both the alloy composition and the microstructure prior to quenching have an influence on the kinetics of quench-induced precipitation. The microstructure at the end of the solution treatment is a result of the structure after casting (or LBM) and the coarsening caused by the solution treatment. The latter can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f071">Figure 71</xref>, which compares the microstructure of the two Al10Si0.3Mg variants in the initial condition and after different soaking durations at solution temperature. This figure shows that the initial difference in the microstructure virtually disappears after six hours of soaking at 525 Â°C, and similar coarse microstructures are seen for both materials.

<p>To study the gene expression differences between

 <italic>pasteurii</italic> growth in different media groups and reveal metabolic pathways associated with urease expression, we collected nine bacterial fluid samples (three biological replicates per treatment condition) and constructed complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to confirm the correlation between the three biological replicates in each condition (

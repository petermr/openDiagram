<p>Assays to detect the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and N-acetyl-β-glycosaminidase (NAG) were performed in tissue samples as a measure of leukocyte recruitment into target organs. To measure MPO and EPO activity, tissue homogenates were prepared in 1 mL of PBS containing 0.5% hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) and 5 mM EDTA. Saline/Triton X-100 0.1% v/v was used to process tissues for NAG activity measurement. Test protocols were performed as already described [

Briefly, samples were evaluated for their ability to convert the substrates p-nitrophenyl-β-glicosaminide (for NAG), 3,3ʹ 5,5ʹ tetramethylbenzidine (for MPO) or o-phenylenediamine (for EPO) to generate a colored solution proportional to the amount of enzyme in the sample. Plates for each assay were read at 405, 450 and 495 nm, respectively, and results were expressed as absorbance.

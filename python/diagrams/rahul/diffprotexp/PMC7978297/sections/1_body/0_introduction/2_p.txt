0: In females, primordial follicle (PF) formation (or assembly) occurs perinatally in mice and around mid-gestation in humans; this results in a finite follicle reserve termed the ovarian reserve or PF pool  11- 13.
1: After primordial germ cells arrive at the murine gonad, they undergo mitosis to produce germ cell cysts (or nests), from which oogonia mature after sexual differentiation.
2: Subsequently, oogonia enter meiosis around 13.5 days post coitum (dpc) to become oocytes.
3: Shortly afterwards, germ cell cysts breakdown following the invasive activity of proliferative pre-granulosa cells from 17.5 dpc to a few days postnatally.
4: A substantial loss of germ cells, and the surviving oocytes become enclosed within a layer of flattened granulosa cells, which signifies PF formation  14,  15.
5: It is known that the PF pool is non-renewable once established and that it progressively diminishes following the first-wave of follicle recruitment during puberty, and is almost exhausted at menopause in humans  16- 18.
6: Thus, the size of the PF pool is the primary determinant of reproductive lifespan in females  19.
7: Notably, the available oocytes within PFs naturally undergo irreversible exhaustion or atresia during development; however, they are prone to damage from adverse external environmental chemicals (such as plasticizers) as well as cellular aging  14,  20.
8: Meanwhile, the ovarian dysgenesis syndrome hypothesis proposes that an early disruption to ovarian development can potentially lead to ovarian disease and disorders in adulthood; this is particularly pertinent at times that are sensitive to disruption by exogenous chemicals, such as PF assembly  21- 23.
9: Consequently, attention needs to be focused on the protection of female fertility from toxic materials.

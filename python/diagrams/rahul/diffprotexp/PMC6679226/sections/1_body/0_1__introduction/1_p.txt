0: Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory process of the lungs that develops in response to direct (pulmonary) or indirect (extra-pulmonary) insults to the alveolarcapillary membrane, resulting in increased permeability with subsequent interstitial/alveolar edema and diffuse alveolar damage [ 1].
1: Pulmonary and extra-pulmonary ARDS are distinct syndromes with important pathophysiologic differences [ 2].
2: The causes of pulmonary ARDS include pneumonia (most common), aspiration and lung contusion, whereas the causes of extra-pulmonary ARDS include sepsis of non-pulmonary origin (most common), shock, burn injury and mass transfusion, among others [ 1, 2].
3: In pulmonary ARDS, the direct insult primarily affects the alveolar epithelium with a local alveolar inflammatory response, whereas in extra-pulmonary ARDS, the indirect insult affects the vascular endothelium by inflammatory mediators through the bloodstream, exhibiting more severe endothelial injury with increased plasma markers including angiopoietin-2 and greater degradation of endothelial glycocalyx [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

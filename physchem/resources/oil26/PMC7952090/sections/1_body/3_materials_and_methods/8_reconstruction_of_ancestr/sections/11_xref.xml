<xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1995</xref>), and the unrooted species tree for Atlantogenata. We considered ancestral state reconstructions to be reliable if they had Bayesian Posterior Probability (BPP) &#8805; 0.80; less reliable reconstructions were excluded from pathway analyses. We note that there may be 'ghost' duplication events, that is genes that duplicated in, for example, the Tethytherian stem-lineage that are maintained in the Stellar&#8217;s sea cow genome and lost in the manatee genome. These genes will be reconstructed as a Proboscidean-specific duplication events because we cannot determine copy number in extinct species that lack genomes.

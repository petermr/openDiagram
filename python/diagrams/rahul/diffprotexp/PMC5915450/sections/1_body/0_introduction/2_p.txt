0: The strong activity of ribosome-targeting macrolides against many gram-positive microorganisms indicates that they effectively inhibit protein production.
1: Like the antibiotics chloramphenicol and puromycin, macrolides stop protein synthesis in the elongation phase of translation.
2: However, instead of directly binding to the PTC and disrupting its structure, macrolides bind in the exit tunnel one or more nanometers from the PTC 1,  8.
3: These macrolides decrease the diameter of the exit tunnel, leading to steric clashes with nascent peptides 8.
4: For instance, the  64KVE 62 segment of the MarR peptide clashes with the cladinose and lactone moieties of both erythromycin (ERY) and Azithromycin (AZ) causing ribosome stalling 8.
5: In the case of the EngD peptide, only AZ induces ribosome stalling while ERY does not.
6: The mechanism of ribosome stalling by macrolides is not limited to a narrowing of the exit tunnel.
7: Vazquez-Laslop and coworkers 6 showed that when the cladinose sugar group of ERY is replaced by substituents that are as bulky as cladinose, the resulting macrolide cannot stall protein synthesis.
8: While Vazquez-Laslop 9, Johansson 10, and Arenz 11 and their coworkers observed that mutating amino acids in the region  6IFVI 9 of the peptide ErmCL can relieve stalling and allow synthesis of the nascent protein.
9: These results demonstrate that the ability of macrolides to inhibit protein synthesis involves a combination of excluded volume interactions and attractive inter-molecular interactions between the nascent protein and antibiotic.

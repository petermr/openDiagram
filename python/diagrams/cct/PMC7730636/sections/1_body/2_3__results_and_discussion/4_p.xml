<p>From all eight curves, three dilatation curves for comparison were selected, which represent the limit values of the formation of individual phase transformations. At the highest cooling rate, i.e., 100 °C/s, determined martensite start temperature 
 <italic>Ms</italic> was 321 °C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f005">Figure 5</xref>a shows a green line of the dilatation curve, which is covered by a red tangent line. For a more accurate determination, the figure is supplemented by the superimposed derivation of the given dilatation curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, black line). At this high cooling rate, the resulting structure was evaluated as martensitic with a small percentage of retained austenite, which was not further investigated in this paper.

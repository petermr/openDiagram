<p>Pyrosequencing analysis of 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> showed that the CD induced hypomethylation of one CpG site situated 668 bp downstream from the TSS in VAT, which corresponded with increased expression of 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> in this depot. While we acknowledge that DNA methylation changes in a single CpG site in response to CD may appear subtle compared to those reported in other obesity-related genes [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it has been previously demonstrated that even small methylation changes can alter gene expression with significant effects on phenotype. For example, Barrès et al. [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated that methylation of a single cytosine residue at the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α (
 <italic>PGC1α</italic>) promoter is sufficient to reduce gene activity in luciferase reporter assays and can also modulate 
 <italic>PGC1α</italic> mRNA expression. Furthermore, while we note that the CpG affected by the CD in our study is not situated in the upstream promoter region of 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic>, it has been suggested that DNA methylation downstream of the TSS, particularly in the region of the first exon, is much more tightly linked to transcriptional regulation compared to methylation upstream of the promoter [
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Based on this, we propose that DNA hypomethylation of the above identified CpG site may play a functional role in the epigenetic upregulation of 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> expression in VAT in response to CD feeding, although additional mechanistic studies are required to confirm this.

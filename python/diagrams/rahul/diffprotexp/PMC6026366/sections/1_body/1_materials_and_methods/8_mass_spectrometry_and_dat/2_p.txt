0: Protein spots were manually excised from the preparative gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS/MS) with a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
1: The peptide mass fingerprint was analyzed with GPS (Applied Biosystems) MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK).
2: The identified proteins were named according to the corresponding annotations in the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI,  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and/or Universal Protein Resource (Uniprot,  http://www.uniprot.org/).
3: For proteins without functional annotation in the databases, homologs of these proteins were searched against the NCBI nonredundant protein database with BLASTP ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to annotate these identities.
4: The experimental molecular mass of each protein spot was estimated by comparison with molecular weight standards, whereas the experimental isoelectric point (p I) was determined by the migration of protein spots on linear IPG strips.

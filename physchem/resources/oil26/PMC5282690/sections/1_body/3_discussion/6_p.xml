<p>Another pathway of vasorelaxation endothelium-dependent has been studied; itâ€™s about the COX product: PGI
 <sub>2</sub> which is recognized for its potential ability to relax vascular smooth muscle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] via activation of second messenger cAMP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Hence, the possible role of PGI
 <sub>2</sub> seems to be ruled out, because the pretreatment of aorta with, indomethacin, the COX inhibitor, did not change the vasorelaxant effect induced by AcEO.

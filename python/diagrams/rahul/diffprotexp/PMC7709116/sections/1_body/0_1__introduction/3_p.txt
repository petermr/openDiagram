0: Although TRAP-based translational profiling and other single-cell- or single-nuclei-RNA sequencing methods provide a massively parallel approach to mRNA expression analyses of individual types of neural cells, these approaches do not account for differential control of protein synthesis, degradation, and post-translational modification.
1: As a result, there often is relatively poor correspondence between transcriptomic and proteomic expression [ 23].
2: The poor correspondence between mRNA and protein expression in neural tissues was reinforced by an in-depth proteomic survey of the human brain that compared fold-changes in protein and mRNA levels across brain regions [ 24].
3: In general, this study found more pronounced inter-regional differential expression at the protein level which highlights the critical importance of MS/proteomics analyses.
4: Surprisingly, and as noted previously [ 10], the proteomes of the two major types of striatal MSNs have yet to be effectively compared.
5: To address this challenge, we have begun to compare the proteomes of D1R versus D2R-containing MSNs from mouse.

<p>Abnormalities in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> genes have been reported previously to be strong risk factors for developing PD (
 <xref rid="b28-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In the present study, the GCase activity level was decreased in fibroblasts of patients with PD with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants [c.1309delG (pV398fsX404) and IVS2+1G&gt;A] compared with that found in fibroblasts of healthy controls. In addition, the GCase activity from peripheral blood leucocytes of patients with PD carrying 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants was lower than that observed in patients with PD without heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants and in healthy subjects (data not shown). Low GCase enzymatic activity has been previously reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with PD and Lewy body dementia (
 <xref rid="b29-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="b30-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and in two brain autopsy studies (
 <xref rid="b31-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="b32-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The GCase activity in peripheral blood samples of 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-PD was reported to be lower than that of PD patients without 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants from the Ashkenazi Jewish population (
 <xref rid="b33-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). These findings are consistent with the observations of the present study.

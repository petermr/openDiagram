 <sub>2</sub> molecules exhibit free rotation at pressures below 40 GPa and temperatures below 900 K (orange hexagon symbols); at higher pressures the rotation is inhibited but there is no long-ranged orientational order. At low temperatures, Phase II becomes stable (red triangles), and the stable temperature region increases gradually with pressures. At high temperatures, the hcp lattice collapses to a liquid state. The calculated melting curve has a strong positive slope (

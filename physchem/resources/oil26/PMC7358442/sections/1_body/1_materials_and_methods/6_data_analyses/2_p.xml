<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We used a series of generalised linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) to determine the effects of environmental variables on aardvark body temperature patterns. We used each 24-h period as a sampling unit in the GLMMs, and added a first order autocorrelation structure to account for temporal autocorrelation. We included aardvark identity as a random factor. The dependent variable was minimum or maximum or amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm. Independent variables included photoperiod, minimum or maximum or range of 24-h air temperature, and vegetation greenness as a proxy of resource abundance for aardvark prey. This vegetation greenness index consisted of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometry (MODIS)-derived time-series enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data for the Gordonia duneveld vegetation (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Tokura, 2016</xref>). EVI was measured every 16 days and averaged per month. We previously have shown that EVI as an index for aardvark prey&#8217;s food availability correlated with aardvark body condition (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Weyer, 2018</xref>). We tested for multicollinearity of independent variables within each model using variance inflation factors (VIF) and ensured that all VIF &lt;2, based on a conservative cutoff (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zuur et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

 <caption> Pulling force versus time from the SMD simulations in which the non-bonded parameters are turned on gradually as nascent chain residues enter the exit tunnel for ErmCL ( A) and H-NS ( B) with ERY bound in the exit tunnel. Black lines represent the average force across trajectories, while gray lines are the force traces for each individual trajectory. </caption>

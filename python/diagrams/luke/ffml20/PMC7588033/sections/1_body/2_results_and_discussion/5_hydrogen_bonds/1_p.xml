A hydrogen bond is formed when the distance between the donor D and acceptor A is ≤ 3.5 Å and the D–H–A angle is ≥135° (H denotes the hydrogen atom). The number of hydrogen bonds was estimated as the average number of hydrogen bonds from the ensemble of our trajectories separately for each compound. Analysis of the hydrogen-bond formation between compounds and water molecules (

Moreover, the profiles are rather symmetric with water molecules being also present in the middle of the lipid membrane during simulations. The latter effect may be a consequence of water molecules being dragged by the compounds during the pulling process, which mostly takes place for compounds with low logBB (high tendency of forming hydrogen bonds). In the case of hydrogen-bond formation between the compound and the lipids, we can observe that the presence of hydrogen bonds is related to the barrier that a compound needs to overcome in order to translocate through the membrane. In particular, the hydrogen bonds formed between mannitol and the lipid molecules is the highest among all compounds reaching the value of 3.8 (

Moreover, because of the apparent symmetric composition of the two membrane layers in lipids, the profiles seem to be symmetric with a first high peak in the number of hydrogen bonds appearing in the left layer (

Finally, compounds that translocate easily through the membrane (high logBB values) do not form as many hydrogen bonds.

<p id="Par16">As shown in Fig. S1, a total of 104 genes were found to be differentially expressed in granulosa cell proximal to the GD (G5p cells) and distal to the GD (G5d cells) of F5 follicles. Among them, 78 genes showed a higher abundance in G5p cells and 26 genes showed a higher abundance in G5d cells. The top 25 up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes were listed in Table

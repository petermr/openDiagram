<p id="par0110">The control and HS-treated samples were used for the native-PAGE assay of SOD following the method as mentioned by Beauchamp and Fridovich [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In brief, 20 μg of protein from each treatment was loaded for run in 10% native-PAGE at 4℃. The gel was incubated with NBT for 15 min in dark after run followed by washing with water. Further, the gel was incubated with riboflavin for 15 min under dark condition. The gel was illuminated with light for 10−15 min leading to the appearance of white SOD activity band in the blue background. The steps for the native-PAGE of amylase enzyme were followed as explained by Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The alcohol soluble protein fractions (25 μg) extracted from 100 mg of developing endosperm tissue was used for the native-PAGE assay. The bands appeared on the gel was scanned using Gel Doc Easy (Bio-Rad, USA).

<p>The purified fungus was inoculated in Pachlewski medium and cultivated for 15 days. According to Fan Yongjunâ€™s method, DNA extraction was performed, followed by PCR-based amplification. The amplified DNA was sequenced, and the ITS sequence was cut and uploaded to NCBI, and the Blastn comparison was performed in the NCBI database. The fungal strain was confirmed with 99% similarity, as formerly elaborated by Du et al. [

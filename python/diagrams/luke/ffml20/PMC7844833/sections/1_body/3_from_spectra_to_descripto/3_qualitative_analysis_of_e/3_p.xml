<p>Although the visual examination of the FT-EXAFS data provides information about interatomic distances only, EXAFS features themselves are much more informative and provide the possibility to distinguish between different types of neighbors, even if they are located at the same interatomic distance. The chemical sensitivity of EXAFS is based on the fact that the scattering functions 
 <italic>F</italic>

  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, and Ï•

  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub> in 
 <xref rid="eq8" ref-type="disp-formula">eq 
  <xref rid="eq8" ref-type="disp-formula">8</xref>
 </xref> depend on the type of neighboring atoms. As a result, different neighbors contribute differently to the EXAFS spectrum. For example, for relatively light elements in the 
 <italic>k</italic>-range relevant for EXAFS analysis, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub> is a function with a single maximum, whose position shifts to larger 
 <italic>k</italic> values with increasing absorber atomic number 
 <italic>Z</italic>. Much more complex 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub> dependencies on the wavenumber 
 <italic>k</italic> are characteristic for heavy elements such as Au due to the Ramsauer-Townsend effect.

 </sup> Note here that the contrast between scattering functions for elements that are neighbors in the Periodic Table is small, making the discrimination of their respective contributions challenging.

0: Metformin is an insulin-sensitizing biguanide drug, commonly used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus [ 14], especially in obese patients [ 15].
1: Besides its effects on glucose metabolism, metformin displayed anti-cancer effects in various human cancer cell lines and diabetic patients with various cancer types [ 16 18], including EC [ 19 21].
2: The effects of metformin on malignant tissue may be direct or indirect.
3: Indirect effects include a reduction in circulating glucose and insulin levels via a blockage of gluconeogenesis in the liver, which diminishes insulin resistance due to an inhibition of the IGF1 signaling pathway in tumor cells [ 22 24].
4: Direct anti-cancer effects of metformin target signaling pathways that are involved in cellular growth and proliferation, e.g.
5: by activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator in energy homeostasis.
6: Upon activation by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMPK induces various tumor suppressor genes, e.g.
7: phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and thus downregulates growth-related pathways, especially mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling [ 25].
8: Alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT/PKB)/mTOR pathway mediate EC growth and development and can be caused by a loss of PTEN or mutations of PI3K family members [ 26 30].
9: Additionally, metformin may act on growth and proliferation independent of AMPK, e.g.
10: via downregulation of the proliferation marker Kiel-67 antigen (MKI67), via the transcription factor paired box gene 2 (PAX2), or via Ras-related guanosine triphosphate hydrolases (Rag GTPases) [ 25,  31 33].
11: Growing attention was also given to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) by metformin in recent years.
12: Like AMPK, the complex is involved in cellular energy homeostasis, but a direct involvement of AMPK in this mechanism is still a matter of debate [ 22,  34 36].
13: Further affected proteins and pathways like the inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [ 37], various routes of apoptosis induction [ 38], or regulation of microRNA (miRNA) [ 39] have been suggested as potential targets for the biguanide drug, but the underlying mechanism of action of metformins anti-cancer activity is still not completely understood.

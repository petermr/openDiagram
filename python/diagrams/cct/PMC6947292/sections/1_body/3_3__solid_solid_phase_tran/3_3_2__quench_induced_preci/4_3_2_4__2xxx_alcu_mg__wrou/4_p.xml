<p>The authors of Ref. [
 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>] ascribe precipitation in an AlCuMg alloy at high temperatures to the formation of S-Al
 <sub>2</sub>CuMg or S’-phase. In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B102-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], the S-phase was also revealed by SAXS for cooling rates lower than 0.5 K/s. As the HTR in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f066">Figure 66</xref>A is substantially suppressed at rates higher than 0.5 K/s, it can be concluded that the HTRs revealed by DSC refer to the formation of S-Al
 <sub>2</sub>CuMg. In addition, also isothermal experiments on a 2024 type alloys suggest the formation of the S-Al
 <sub>2</sub>CuMg phase [

 <xref rid="B208-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>] at high temperatures occurring on grain boundaries [

 <xref rid="B207-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>] and for medium temperatures precipitation of the S-Al
 <sub>2</sub>CuMg as well as the θ-Al
 <sub>2</sub>Cu phase, both nucleating on dispersoids [

 <xref rid="B207-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. The quench-induced formation of the θ-Al
 <sub>2</sub>Cu phase in AlCuMg alloys is also supported by Refs. [

 <xref rid="B210-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B211-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>], indications of quench-induced precipitation of the T-Al
 <sub>20</sub>Cu
 <sub>2</sub>Mn
 <sub>3</sub> phase were found in a Jominy end quench sample of another AlCuMg alloy. Continuous cooling SAXS measurements in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B102-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] revealed the precipitation of Cu-Mg co-clusters below 250 °C. This shows good agreement with the low-temperature DSC peak for 2618 and 2024.

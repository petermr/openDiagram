<p>A significant protein upregulation compared to the untreated control was induced by metformin, but not by hyperinsulinemia, for immune regulatory factors such as IL5 and peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3, elafin (ELAF)). IL5 is involved in the regulation and recruiting of eosinophils, which are critical for the suppression of tumor metastasis [

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], while an upregulation of PI3 counterbalances the mitogenic effects of the PI3 substrate elastase from activated neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment, thus reducing proliferation, tumorigenesis and migration [

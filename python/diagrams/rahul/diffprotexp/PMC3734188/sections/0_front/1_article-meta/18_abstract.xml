  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Liver perfusates exhibit theoretical advantages regarding the discovery of disease biomarkers because they contain proteins that readily enter the blood-stream, and perfusion preserves the disease state in its natural context. The purpose of the study is to explore the value of liver perfusate proteome in the biomarker discovery of liver diseases.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>In this study, 86 differentially expressed proteins were identified in perfusates from isolated rat livers metastasized by Walker-256 tumor cells. Among these proteins, 27 were predicted to be secreted, and 59 were intracellular or membrane proteins. Most of the secretory proteins (70.4%) were decreased in metastasized liver perfusates. The main canonical ingenuity pathway to which these secretory proteins belonged was acute phase response, which indicated that the liver-associated immune reaction was damaged by the metastasis. In contrast, most of the intracellular or membrane proteins (86.4%) exhibited higher relative abundances in the metastasized liver perfusates. Some of these proteins, including Rpl21, Atic, Eif3s2, Echs1, Eps15 and Ywhab, have previously been reported to be involved in cancer genesis and progression. As a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, Ywhab plays a key role in cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation and has been reported to be involved in the development of breast cancer. Its abundance was elevated by 3.5-fold in the metastasized perfusates. Validation by Western blotting revealed a 3.7-fold increase in the abundance of this protein in metastasized plasma.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>These results show that perfusate proteome can be used as an alternative initial resource for biomarker identification, which ultimately requires validation in serum.</p>

0: To acquire the excess specific heat capacity ( excess c  p), the alloyed sample is placed in the sample sensor, while the reference sample is placed in the reference sensor.
1: Since both sample and reference have very similar absolute heat capacities, this setup retains the symmetry within the differential scanning calorimeter and its entire measurement setup.
2: This supports the basic idea of DSC, which is a steady comparison of two equal measuring systems.
3: In an ideal system, the only remaining differencesand therefore the only remaining thermal asymmetriesare thermal effects related to reactions within the sample.
4: The resulting signal can therefore be directly and solely related to the phase transformation of interest.

   <bold>Molecular characterization of post-natal ovaries. (A)</bold> A schematic pipeline of sample collection, 10Ã— Genomics platform sequencing, and data analysis. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> UMAP plots of ovarian cells based on sample group (upper) and Seurat cluster (below). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Dot plot of the three marker genes identified from ovarian cell types in each cluster. Dot size represents the percentage of gene expression in each cell cluster; color intensity refers to the intensity of expression, with strong color indicating high gene expression. The dendrogram of cell clusters is presented in the left panel. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Feature plots of specific marker genes from six main ovarian cell types. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> The six main ovarian cell types are identified on a UMAP plot.

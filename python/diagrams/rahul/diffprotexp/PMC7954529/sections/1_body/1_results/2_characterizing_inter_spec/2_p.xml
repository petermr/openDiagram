<p>To better understand the mechanisms that underlie inter-species differences in PAS usage, and the potential functional impact of such differences, we considered the APA data in different contexts. First, we noticed that the spatial distribution of differentially used PAS reflects the distribution of all PAS; namely, differentially used PAS are most often located in 3' UTRs, followed by introns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Within the 3' UTR, however, differentially used PAS are more frequently the first ones compared with PAS that are used similarly in the two species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, difference in proportion test, p=0.0015). This pattern is intriguing, because changes in the usage of the first PAS in the 3' UTR may have the largest overall impact on the transcript length, and hence potentially the largest functional impact. However, it is also possible that we are more likely to detect differences in the usage in the first PAS in the 3' UTR because this site is transcribed earlier, and our estimate of usage is relative to all other sites in each gene.

<p>Proteasome activity was assessed as has been described (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Ten micrograms of protein lysate was added to proteasome activity assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) along with (Ac-RLR-AMC) (Boston Biochem, cat. no. s290) fluorogenic proteasome substrate. Reactions were allowed to incubate at 37Â°C protected from light for 3 hours. Following incubation, samples were transferred to black walled 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, cat No. 655097). Release of free 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin was determined using a SpectraMax M5e microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation at 380 nm and emission recorded at 460 nm. Reported values are the fold increase over a no-protein control that was incubated along with every experiment.

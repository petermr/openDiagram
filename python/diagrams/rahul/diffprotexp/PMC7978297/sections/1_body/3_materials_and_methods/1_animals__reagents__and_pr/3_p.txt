0: For the preparation of single cells, the ovarian tissues (4-6 ovaries per sample) were cut into pieces within the digestive solution, which comprised 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone, Beijing, China) and collagenase (2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, C5138).
1: Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into centrifuge tubes and placed in a 37 C incubator for 6-8 min, and then agitated with a pipette once every 3 min to produce single cells.
2: After the termination of digestion with serum, the mixture was then filtered using 40 m cell strainers (BD Falcon, 352340, CA, USA), and flushes were performed three times with PBS containing 0.04% BSA.
3: Finally, cell viability and counts were assessed to meet the requirements of sequencing.

<p>The “Ribosome” term assigned to ribosome structural constituents and related proteins was specifically enriched within WB-MtzR and reflected in its STRING interaction network (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), with 29 DEPs compared to 5 and 3 in 106-MtzR and 713-MtzR, respectively. A total of 24 structural constituents of ribosomes were downregulated in WB-MtzR, which coincides with transcriptional data; transcripts of multiple ribosomal and ribosome-associated proteins as downregulated in WB-MtzR were also observed [

A set of P-loop containing nucleotide hydrolases (IPR027417), particularly AAA+/AAA-type ATPase domains (IPR003593/IPR003959), were enriched among DEPs in 3 isolates, albeit with differences in directionality of expression, with 17, 11, and 7 DEPS in WB-MtzR, 106-MtzR, and 713-MtzR, respectively. This gene set featured 2 main classes of proteins, including DNA/nucleic acid binding proteins, and transmembrane ABC transporters, which are frequently associated with the membrane translocation of toxic compounds, including drug compounds [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). In WB-MtzR, 3 ABC transporters were upregulated (113 876, 28 379), including 1 that was also upregulated in 713-MtzR (16 592), which is specifically involved in lipid transport (GO:0 006869). However, in 106-MtzR, the 3 differentially expressed ABC transporters were downregulated (17 132, 38 104), including 1 also downregulated in 713-MtzR (115 052). Several proteins within this set were functionally related to transcriptional regulation, 3 of which were upregulated in WB-MtzR (89 112, 8228, 2098) and differentially expressed in 106-MtzR (112 978, 8228). Further, the MAD-2 mitotic regulator was downregulated in 713-MtzR compared to universal upregulation between isolates at the transcript level [

0: The volatile compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography using an Agilent 6890 GC with an HP-5 ms column, and mass spectrometry with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (MSD) operated in the electron impact (EI) mode with electron energy = 70 eV.
1: The scan range was 40400 atomic mass units (amu) and the scan rate was 3.99 scans/s.
2: The data were processed with an Agilent ChemStation data system.
3: The gas chromatography (GC) column was a fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase that had a film thickness of 0.25 m and a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm.
4: Helium was the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a column head pressure of 48.7 kPa.
5: The injector temperature was 200 C and the detector temperature was 280 C. The GC oven temperature was programed to start with an initial temperature of 40 C, which was held for 10 min.
6: The temperature was then increased at a rate of 3 C/min to 200 C, and then increased at 2 C/min to 220 C. A 1-L injection of a solution (0.2%  w/ v in CH 2Cl 2) of the sample was performed using a splitless injection technique.
7: The percentages of each component were based on total ion current and are reported without standardization.
8: Individual components were identified by comparison of both their mass spectra and GC retention data with authentic compounds present in commercial libraries [ 44] and our own in-house library.

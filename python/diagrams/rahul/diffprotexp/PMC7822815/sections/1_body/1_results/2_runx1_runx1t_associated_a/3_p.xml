<p id="Par17">Together, these results clearly indicate that RUNX1/RUNX1T1-dependent splicing events are characterizing features of the transcriptome of t(8;21)-positive AML cells. The occurrence of these events in combination with selected RUNX1/RUNX1T1-independent splicing events distinguishes t(8;21)-positive from t(8;21)-negative AML cells and normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.</p>

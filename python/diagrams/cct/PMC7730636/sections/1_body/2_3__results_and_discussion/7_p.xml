<p>The average temperature of 
 <italic>Ms</italic> was determined from the dilatation curves in which only the martensite structure was formed. We used the first five cooling curves from 100 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup> to 0.5 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f008">Figure 8</xref>. By averaging these five temperatures from the individual curves, the average temperature 
 <italic>Ms</italic> was of 282 °C. We could not measure the temperature 
 <italic>Mf</italic> on any curve, because the austenite to martensite transformation occurred below RT (room temperature). We can observe that as the cooling rate lowers, the temperature 
 <italic>Ms</italic> also decreases.

0: Although significant advancements on both battery architectures have been achieved during the past few years, still major challenges remain unsolved.
1: In this report, we review the recent progresses for the development and advancement in the area of sodium metalbased air battery systems and attempt to summarize and answer critical questions.
2: First, the concept and operation principle of sodium metalbased air batteries that include nonaqueous NaO 2 battery and hybrid Naair battery will be discussed.
3: We will clarify the difference in their cell design and their electrochemical redox processes followed by a brief discussion on Naion conducting membrane and anode.
4: Second, the relevant published reports will be briefly explained which mainly involves different explored air electrodes for hybrid Naair battery.
5: Finally, a brief discussion will be provided whether hybrid Naair cell can outperform the nonaqueous NaO 2 cell and the challenges associated with it.

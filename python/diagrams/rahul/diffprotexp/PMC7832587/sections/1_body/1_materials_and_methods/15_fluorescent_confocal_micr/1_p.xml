<p>1 mL of small-scale cultures was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 
 <italic>× g</italic> followed by two washing steps with 1 mL of PBS pH 7.4. The cells were re-suspended in 1 mL of PBS pH 7.4, and 2 µL were deposited on an agarose pad (1% (w/v) agarose gel in milliQ water). The pictures were taken in the Light Microscopy Facility of ImaGif (I2BC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) using a Leica confocal microscope SP8 controlled by the LAS-X software and using an oil immersion objective lens with 100 x magnification. Samples were excited with a 488 nm laser.

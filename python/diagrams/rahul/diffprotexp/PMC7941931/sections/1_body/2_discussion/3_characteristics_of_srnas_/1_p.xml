<p id="Par41">By sequencing six sRNA libraries from three differently developmental stages seeds, we obtained abundant sRNAs with a length of 18–30 nt. Among them, the 24 nt sRNAs were the most abundant in developmental Tartary buckwheat seed, which was similar to previous observations in the developmental seed of many plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, the 24 nt sRNAs exhibited differential accumulation during Tartary buckwheat seed development. These suggested that the 24 nt sRNAs might play crucial roles in Tartary buckwheat and other plant seed development. It has been reported that many of the 24-nt sRNAs were heterochromatic siRNAs (hetsiRNAs), which mediate transcriptional gene silencing through DNA methylation (RdDM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Generally, the 24-nt sRNAs need from cytoplasm imported into the nucleus before they were methylated, and the process was mediated by AGO4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Notably, our study observed that 
 <italic>FtAGO8</italic>, which was the 
 <italic>AGO4</italic> ortholog, exhibited special high expression in the development Tartary buckwheat seed. These observations implied that 
 <italic>FtAGO8</italic> might has a role similar to 
 <italic>AGO4</italic> in 24-nt sRNAs methylation, and these 24-nt sRNAs might mediate transcriptional gene silencing through the RdDM pathway during Tartary buckwheat seed development.

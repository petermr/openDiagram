  <p>Correlation of expression of miRNAs and their target genes. (a) Density plot showing correlation between expression levels of miRNAs and their target genes in Himchana 1 and JGK 3. The solid straight line represents a negative correlation value of ≤−0.25. (b) Enriched GO (biological process) terms among the target genes showing negative correlation (≤−0.25) with miRNA expression in the two chickpea cultivars. The enriched GO terms for up‐ and down‐regulated genes in Himchana 1 and JGK 3 are shown separately. The color scale and values in the colored boxes represent 
   <italic>P‐</italic>value of enrichment

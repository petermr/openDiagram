0: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common form of thyroid malignancy.
1: The tumor is usually well-differentiated and is characterized by typical cytological and histopathological features [ 1].
2: The cystic variant of PTC (cPTC) constitutes 413% of all PTCs [ 2,  3].
3: It exhibits classical histopathological features of PTC, but different morphological properties due to its presentation as a mural nodule within a thyroid cyst.
4: The diagnosis is challenging, since the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a cystic thyroid nodule usually results in a relatively large volume of cyst fluid, but may contain insufficient amounts of representative tumor cells.
5: This may lead to cytological reports in which malignancy is not recognized [ 4].
6: Attempts have been made to identify diagnostic markers for thyroid cystic lesions by using biochemical, immunohistochemical or genetic markers [ 4 6].
7: The most frequently used immunohistochemical markers to confirm a PTC diagnosis are cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) and Hector Battifora mesothelial antigen-1 (HBME-1) [ 6,  7].
8: Although these proteins are commonly up-regulated in PTC, they can also be expressed in benign thyroid lesions, leading to difficulties in establishing the preoperative diagnosis [ 8].
9: Routine cytological investigation is performed mainly on the cellular component of the FNAB specimen, and less attention is given to the fluid component [ 3,  5,  6,  9,  10].
10: Identification of novel diagnostic markers to distinguish cPTC from benign cystic thyroid lesions is warranted and could be based on protein-based screening approaches.

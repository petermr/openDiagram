<sub>2</sub> as the carrier gas; column head pressure 10 psi; oven temperature program isotherm 2&#160;min at 70&#160;&#176;C, 3&#160;&#176;C/min gradient 250&#160;&#176;C, isotherm 10&#160;min; injection temperature, 250&#160;&#176;C; detector temperature 280&#160;&#176;C. Gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS) analysis was performed using a Perkin Elmer Turbomass GC&#8211;MS. The GC column was EQUITY-5 (60&#160;m&#160;&#215;&#160;0.32&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;0.25&#160;&#181;m); fused silica capillary column. The GC conditions were injection temperature, 250&#160;&#176;C; column temperature, isothermal at 70&#160;&#176;C for 2&#160;min, then programmed to 250&#160;&#176;C at 37&#160;&#176;C/min and held at this temperature for 10&#160;min; ion source temperature, 250&#160;&#176;C. Helium was the carrier gas. The effluent of the GC column was introduced directly into the source of MS and spectra obtained in the EI mode with 70&#160;eV ionisation energy. The sector mass analyzer was set to scan from 40 to 500 amu for 22&#160;s. The identification of individual compounds is based on their retention times, retention indices relative to C

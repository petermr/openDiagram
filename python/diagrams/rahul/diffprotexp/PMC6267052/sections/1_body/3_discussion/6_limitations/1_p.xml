<p id="Par33">Since this was a pilot analysis, the sample size was limited; hence resulting in a lower power and a higher risk of type 2 errors, i.e. the comparison of single proteins between the tissues should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, we chose to narrow down the number of included proteins in order to make the analyses less complex e.g. as OA is a disease that markedly affects the ECM, therefore only ECM proteins were included in the analyses. The ECM proteins were filtered by the GO accession term GO:0031012. There are some limitations connected with the usage of GO accession terms e.g. the fact that there are several terms that refer to ECM proteins and that there is a possibility that some ECM proteins might have been lost in the filtration. However, we chose the one we thought would be most suitable for this study and the most common ECM proteins have been included in the analysis, which is sufficient since the main aim of the filtration was to select a number of proteins to include in our method comparison.</p>

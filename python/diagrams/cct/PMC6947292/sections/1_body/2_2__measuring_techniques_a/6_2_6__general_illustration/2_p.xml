<p>DSC curves are generally presented in terms of the specific excess heat capacity as a function of temperature. The associated zero level of the DSC curve is plotted as a dashed straight line. In the case of DSC heating experiments, the zero level allows us to assess whether exo- or endothermic reactions predominate, while endothermic reactions are plotted in the upward direction. For cooling DSC curves, only precipitation reactions can occur. For cooling experiments, by definition, exothermic precipitation reactions are plotted in the upward direction. In plots with multiple cooling DSC curves at various scanning rates, the zero levels are in most cases shifted by a fixed offset, with the DSC curve with the slowest scanning rate on top. The specific solution treatment applied prior to the DSC cooling experiments is stated in plots of this type.</p>

<p>Under physiological conditions, SOCE can be triggered subsequently to store depletion following activation of G-protein coupled P2Y receptors and contributes to the combined [Ca

 <sub>i</sub> elevation during activation of P2Y and P2X receptors elicited by common purinergic agonists, such as ATP. The magnitude of the SOCE varies significantly among LPS differentiated cells, which may be a function of the unique combination of differential expression of store-operated channels and channels controlling membrane potential, such as K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3. Reduction in peak SOCE by ShK-223 indicates that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are potent regulators of SOCE and uncover an additional mechanism by which K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers attenuate calcium signaling and subsequent functional responses (e.g. cytokine production) following calcium dependent transcription factor activation in microglia.

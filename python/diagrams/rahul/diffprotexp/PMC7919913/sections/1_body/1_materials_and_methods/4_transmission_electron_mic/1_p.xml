<p>First, using a droplet of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, MV pellet was placed and fixed. Then the sample was fixed at 1% osmium tetroxide and embedded, fixed, segmented into several blocks (&lt;1 mm
 <sup>3</sup>). After being dehydrated by an increased concentration of alcohol, the sample was soaked in an increased concentration of QuetoL-812 epoxy resin mixed with propylene oxide. Then in a pure, fresh quetol-812 epoxy resin, the sample was embedded and polymerized. Using a Leica (Solms, Germany) UC6 ultramicrotome, the sample was cutted into sections (100-nm thick) and post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for 10 min and 5 min at room temperature respectively. Using an FEI Tecnai T20 transmission electron microscope the sample was observated, operated at 120 kV.

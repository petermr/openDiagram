<p>The results presented herein B16 cells on microRNA expression changes extend our knowledge on other molecular effects generated by 5-Brd-2′-dU exposure in terms of a possible regulation of these processes mediated in a post-transcriptional manner. In B16F1 melanoma cells, 5-Brd-2′-dU causes an absence of melanosomes, an interruption of the lamellar matrix of the endoplasmic reticulum, and an irregular perinuclear microfilament arrangement [

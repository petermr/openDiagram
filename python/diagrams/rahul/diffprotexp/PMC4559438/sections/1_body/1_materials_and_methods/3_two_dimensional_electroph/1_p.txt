0: All 2-DE was performed as described [ 14].
1: Briefly, aliquots in sample buffer (260 g) were applied to immobilized pH 310 nonlinear gradient strips (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden).
2: Isoelectric focusing was performed at 80,000 Vh.
3: The second dimension was analyzed on 916% linear gradient polyacrylamide gels (18 cm  20 cm  1.5 cm) at a constant 40 mA per gel for 5 hours.
4: After protein fixation in 40% methanol and 5% phosphoric acid for 1 hour, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 for 12 hours.
5: Gels were then destained with H 2O, scanned in a Bio-Rad GS710 densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and converted into electronic files (12 bit tiff).

<p>The binding energy calculation did not consider the impact of possible N-glycosylation of ACE2 and Spike. Although no N-glycosylation site is present at the interface of the hACE2/S-RBD complex,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
 </sup> some ACE2 variants may have N-glycosylation sites at the interface region, which may prevent their binding to S-RBD due to steric hindrance. Thus, the analysis of interface N-glycosylation may help refine the list of effective ACE2 receptors classified by binding energy. N-glycosylation of asparagine occurs predominantly at the NX(T/S) motif, where X is any amino acid except proline. However, not all N-X-(T/S) sequons are glycosylated, so the motif alone may not be sufficient to discriminate between glycosylated and nonglycosylated asparagines. We tried three predictors, NGlycPred,

 </sup> N-GlyDE,
 <sup>

 </sup> and NetNGlyc (

All seven NX(T/S) motifs are glycosylated in the experimentally determined structure (PDB ID: 6M17),

 </sup> indicating that ACE2 is highly N-glycosylated. To avoid the omission of potential glycosylation sites, we systematically examined all of the NX(S/T) motifs for the 285 ACE2 proteins and manually checked if any N-glycosylation sites were present at the interface.

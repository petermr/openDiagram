<p>Further, GO enrichment of target genes of miRNAs included in these modules revealed their involvement in various developmental processes (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5f, g</xref>). The target genes of miRNAs included in the pink module were enriched in the cell differentiation process GO term (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). This suggests that these miRNAs may play a role in seed development and determination of seed size/weight. Delayed differentiation at embryonic stages is one of the crucial factors for determining larger seed size/weight (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In addition, miRNAs included in dark red module targeted the genes involved in cell wall modification. This may be another probable reason for bigger seed size/weight in JGK 3 via limiting the mechanical resistance of the cell wall (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Green module miRNAs were downregulated in JGK 3 at the S3 stage and were found to target genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, auxin‐mediated signaling pathway, and biomolecule synthetic pathway, which were upregulated at the S3 stage in JGK 3. These results suggest the possibility of the activation of genes involved in cell cycle processes due to the downregulation of their cognate miRNAs in JGK 3. This observation is in agreement with our previous study, which showed that higher degree of cell division at the S3 stage is associated with large seed size (Garg et al.,

<p>The combination of highest deformation rate 
 <italic>φ</italic>´ = 10 s
 <sup>−1</sup> and lowest temperature 
 <italic>T</italic> = 900 °C has the most significant observed effect on grain size. At this temperature, there is no dynamic recrystallization present, and the grains remain deformed.

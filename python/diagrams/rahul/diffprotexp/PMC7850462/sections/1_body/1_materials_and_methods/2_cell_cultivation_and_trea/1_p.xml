<p>Human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) were purchased from Shanghai Institute of Cell Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. HK-2 cells were cultivated in DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cell model of sepsis was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). HK-2 cells were treated with 1 μg/mL LPS (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h and then seeded into a culture plate. The cells were incubated in the plate for 16 h and then subjected to transfection.

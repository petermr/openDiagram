0: The desired protein bands were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion using a procedure employed at the Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University.
1: Gel plugs were covered with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) at room temperature for 10 minutes.
2: The supernatant was replaced with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mM ABC for 10 minutes.
3: These first two steps were repeated twice.
4: Gel plugs were then dried in a Thermo Speed Vac vacuum concentrator.
5: 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 25 mM ABC was added and the reaction allowed to proceed at 56C for 45 minutes.
6: The supernatant was then replaced with 55 m M iodoacetamide and the reaction proceeded at room temperature in the dark for 45 minutes.
7: Trypsin solution (2 ng/L trypsin in 25 mM ABC) was added and the digestion proceeded at 37C overnight.
8: Formic acid was used to quench the reaction.
9: The digest solution containing the extracted peptides was stored at -4C.

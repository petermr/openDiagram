<p>The activation of microglial cells by SLEV infection led us to further characterize the response of glial cells to SLEV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Primary 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures of glial cells, composed by microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, were established from the brains of newborn mice, plated and infected with SLEV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>). Cell culture supernatants were collected at 24–96 h p.i. and assessed for viral load (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7a</xref>) and proinflammatory cytokine levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7b-d</xref>). Our results show that SLEV infects and persists in mixed glial cell cultures. Although both WT and ABR-/- cultures had viable, infective SLEV in supernatants, viral load in WT cultures remained steady throughout the evaluated time points, whereas viral load in ABR-/- cultures increased after 48 h p.i. and were significantly higher than WT cultures at 72 and 96 h p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7a</xref>). We also observed that SLEV caused the release of CCL5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7b</xref>) and IL-6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7c</xref>) into cell culture supernatants, but not of IL-1β (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7d</xref>), which was undetected in all experiment groups. The levels of CCL5 and IL-6 were markedly increased after 48 h p.i. in ABR-/- glial cell cultures in comparison to WT. These results indicate that SLEV infects mouse glial cells in vitro and induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines. ABR-/- glial cells are more permissive to SLEV replication and respond with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

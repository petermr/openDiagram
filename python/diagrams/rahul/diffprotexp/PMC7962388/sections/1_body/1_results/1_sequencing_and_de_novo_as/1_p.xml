<p id="Par53">To get a compressive characterization of sense/antisense transcripts expressed during the 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> reproductive development, Illumina TruSeq floral cDNA libraries representing two reproductive modes (apomixis and sexuality) and four developmental stages (premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis, anthesis), each one including three biological replicas, were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 1500 technology. The procedure involved 24 libraries and generated a total of 60.94 Gb, of which 97% had a Phred value &gt; 30. After demultiplexing, 292,647,558 pass filter (PF) reads were selected, which, after cleaning and trimming, yielded 234,957,559 high-quality reads (Q score &gt; 30) (available under the NCBI SRA accession PRJNA511813). De novo assemblies were carried out with the Trinity software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], considering two groups of samples (apomictic and sexual), each of them containing 12 libraries. In a first trial, the available Roche 454/FLX + 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> reference floral transcriptome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was used as a guide reference. Then, a second de novo assembly, without any reference, was constructed to detect novel transcripts. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the output basic statistics derived from both procedures. As expected, the de novo assembly without a guide reference generated a higher number of contigs for both samples, probably reflecting the inclusion of low expressed transcripts and/or allelic variants absent in the Roche 454/FLX + transcriptome. Subsequently, the four assemblies were concatenated in one file and filtered to obtain 199,074 non-redundant transcripts corresponding to a global transcriptome assembly (GTA), representing both reproductive modes (apomixis and sexuality), and the four developmental steps (premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis, anthesis) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This transcriptome shotgun assembly was deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession GIUR00000000. With an average length of 1182.31 bp and an N50 of 1508 bp, the assembled sequences resulted in good quality for annotation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Mapping of raw reads onto the GTA with Bowtie2 and TopHat showed 99.09 and 98.3% of match with the reference, respectively. These results indicated the GTA covered almost the complete set of sequence reads. To validate the assembly identity, a BLASTN assay was performed onto the Roche 454/FLX + reference transcriptome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Ninety-four % of the transcripts showed homology with the reference and 92% of them exhibited more than 95% identity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A survey of the assembled contigs with TransDecoder identified 108,011 (54.24%) entities with protein-coding capacity, while BUSCO estimated a gene coverage of 93.1% (35.6% single copy and 57.5% duplicated genes). This value was higher than the coverage achieved with the Roche 454/FLX + reference transcriptome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which rounds about 82.2% (Additional file

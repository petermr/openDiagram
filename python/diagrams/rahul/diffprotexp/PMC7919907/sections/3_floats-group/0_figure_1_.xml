  <p>Antiviral activity of bovine and human lactoferrins against multiple common HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. (A) The antiviral activity of bovine lactoferrin (BLF) against HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 in CPE assay and SARS-CoV-2 in immunofluorescence imaging assay (from left to right). (B) The antiviral activity of human lactoferrin (HLF) against HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 in CPE assay (from left to right). (C) Secondary viral yield reduction (VYR) assay of BLF against HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 (from left to right). (D) Growth curves of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 (from left to right) in the absence (black) or presence of 500 µg/ml BLF (blue). EC
   <sub>50</sub> curve fittings in the CPE and VYR assays were obtained using log
   <sub>10</sub> (concentration of inhibitors) vs. percentage of CPE or percentage of positive control with variable slopes in prism 8. The cellular cytotoxicity test was included in CPE experiment and the resulting curves were shown in blue. All data are mean ± standard deviation of three replicates. (E) EC
   <sub>50</sub> and CC
   <sub>50</sub> values of BLF and HLF against multiple HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture.

<p>We identified non-synonymous 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations in 1.7% (n=21) of NDMM samples. The mutations consisted of 21 missense and one splice site mutation (one sample had 2 mutations) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig002">Figure 2</xref>). Of the 21 samples with mutated 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>, 11 had accompanying RNA-seq data. Of the missense mutations, six were in known hotspots at codons K666 and K700. To confirm that only the hotspot mutation in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> contributed to aberrant splicing, the 11 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutants were compared against 11 wild-type 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> samples for aberrant splicing patterns. The comparator group was matched for key MM molecular subtypes (
 <xref rid="table001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) resulting in just four significantly differentially spliced genes.

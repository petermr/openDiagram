<p>In this study, we employed the state-of-the-art proteomic technique SWATH-MS to identify and quantify the changes in proteins from hemocytes and plasma of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>siamensis goniomphalos</italic> following 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> infection. We revealed several proteins potentially involved in the immune response of the snails that could play a critical role in the snail-trematode relationship, although future functional studies are needed to clarify the role of these proteins and better understand the immune response of 
 <italic>Bithynia</italic> snails to 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic>.

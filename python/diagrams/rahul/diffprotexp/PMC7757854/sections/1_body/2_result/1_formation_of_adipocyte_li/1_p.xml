<p>We used MEFs in an initial incubation of cells – from day 0 (D0) – with adipogenic differentiating factors in culture medium (see Material and Method section) for 3 days (D3) followed by the removal of these factors and an additional incubation for 2 days (D5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a</xref>). Lipid accumulation was assessed with Oil Red O (ORO) staining on days 3 and 5. As expected, lipid accumulation was observed as droplet formation in treated (+) cells, but not in untreated (-) cells at both timepoints. Qualitatively, more and larger droplets were seen on D5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1b</xref>). This finding was confirmed quantitatively using spectrophotometry with extracted stain. Higher optical density (OD) was recorded incrementally from treated cells, where OD was higher on D5 than on D3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1c</xref>). We also examined endogenous expression of specific gene markers that are constitutively active in AT to confirm that results were not due to a random effect of treatment. Expression of mRNA levels for the adipocyte protein 2 (

 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1d</xref>; right chart) were significantly upregulated after treatment. Comparatively, mRNA expression levels of the 
 <italic>aP2, Lpl</italic>, and 
 <italic>Adipoq</italic> genes were higher on D3, but not significantly, than on D5. These observations indicate that MEF developed adipogenic identity and functional activity. Thus, the process used to induce cells towards differentiation into adipocytes is a useful platform for transcriptome analysis.

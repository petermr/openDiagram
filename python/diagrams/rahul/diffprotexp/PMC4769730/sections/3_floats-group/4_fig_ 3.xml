  <p>Confirmation of gelatinolytic activity of MMPs. Non-glaucomatous post-mortem and POAG TM (

   <italic>1</italic>–
   <italic>7</italic>) extracts were electrophoresed on a gelatin-containing SDS gels (see the “
   <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section). Note the presence of gelatinolytic activity at 80/92 kDa (active/pro MMP9) and 62/72 (active/pro MMP2). Representative zymogram from three similar experiments. Both 80 and 92 kDa MMP9 bands are clearly visible in control TMs. Distinct 62 and 72 kDa bands specific for MMP2 were not detected in post-mortem extracts, while specific bands occur in POAG extracts.

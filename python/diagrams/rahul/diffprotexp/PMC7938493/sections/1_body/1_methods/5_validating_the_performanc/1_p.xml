<p id="Par47">The BLCA patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups according to the median risk score. Survival differences between the two groups were evaluated by the Kaplan–Meier method using log-rank tests. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the accuracy of the prognostic model [

A nomogram survival model was performed using the R package

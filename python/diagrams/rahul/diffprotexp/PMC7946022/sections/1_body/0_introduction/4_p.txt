0: In addition to secreted proteins and carbohydrates one major distinguishing feature of biofilms is the presence of secreted extracellular DNA (eDNA), particularly in staphylococcal biofilms where it is crucial for biofilm structural integrity and maintenance [ 3335].
1: In fact, the extracellular matrix of  S. aureus biofilm is primarily composed of eDNA and the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) [ 36, 37].
2: The formation of the eDNA matrix appears to be necessary for early staphylococcal biofilm development, as early DNase treatment profoundly impairs biofilm formation [ 33].
3: In  S. aureus, the generation of the eDNA matrix is facilitated by autolysis of a subset of initial biofilm cells, regulated by the  cidABC and  lrgAB operons [ 3840].
4: Gene regulation in  S. aureus biofilms is complex and involves the activity of several major global regulators [ 41, 42]; however, the environment in a biofilm can be altered by the presence of co-infecting microorganisms where polymicrobial interactions can result in augmented pathogenesis.
5: To that end, the overall goal of this study was to elucidate the impact of inter-species interactions during a biofilm-associated infection in a host.
6: Specifically, we used an established mouse model for  in vivo grown biofilms to demonstrate the therapeutic implications of device-associated polymicrobial infections.
7: Further, we aimed to provide lacking insights into the transcriptional changes governing the interactions between these diverse pathogens, particularly within the context of antimicrobial resistance.

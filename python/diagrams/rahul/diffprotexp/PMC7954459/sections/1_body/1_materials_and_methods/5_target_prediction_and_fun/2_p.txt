0: Putative targets of miRNAs were predicted using psRNATarget (v2) webserver with an expectation (e) cutoff of 3 (Dai et al.,  2018).
1: The transcriptome assembly generated from RNAseq data of different stages of seed development (Garg et al.,  2017) was used for the prediction of putative targets of identified miRNAs.
2: GO enrichment analysis of target genes was performed using BiNGO plugin of Cytoscape (v3.4) (Maere et al.,  2005).
3: EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) based classification of target genes was performed using COGNITOR (Tatusov et al.,  2000).

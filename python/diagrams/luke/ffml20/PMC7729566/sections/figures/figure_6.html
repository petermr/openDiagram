 <caption> ( A) Metal concentration in the NiMH battery leachate composed of 27.0 wt.% CH3COOH aqueous solution and in the 73.0 wt.% [P 44414]Cl + 27.0 wt.% CH 3COOH mixture (t = 24 h, T = 323 K, S/L = 0.1). ( B) Co(II) selectivity (S) in the biphasic [P 44414]Cl + CH 3COOH + H 2O from the principal metals in the NiMH leachate. The total composition of systems 1 and 1* are provided in Table 1; individual metal distribution coefficients are available in Table S1. </caption>

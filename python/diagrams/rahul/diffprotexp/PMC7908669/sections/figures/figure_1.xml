  <p>Enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by MEL treatment. 
   <bold>a</bold> Relative mRNA levels of osteogenic marker genes in human BMSCs treated with MEL. The 
   <italic>ALP</italic>, 
   <italic>RUNX2</italic>, and 
   <italic>OPN</italic> mRNA levels in BMSCs were measured by qRT-PCR. 
   <bold>b</bold> ALP, RUNX2, and OPN protein levels in human BMSCs treated with MEL. Western blot analysis was used to detect protein levels using GAPDH as the internal standard. 
   <bold>c</bold> Elevated ALP expression in human BMSCs caused by MEL treatment. ALP expression in BMSCs was measured by the ALP staining method. Left are gross scanning images (scale bar: 1 mm), the middle are enlarged images (magnification: × 250, scale bar: 160 μm), and the right is quantification of the left gross scanning images. 
   <bold>d</bold> MEL promotes osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs. The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was evaluated by Alizarin Red staining. Left are gross scanning images (scale bar: 1 mm), the middle are enlarged images (magnification: × 250, scale bar: 160 μm), and the right is quantification of the left gross scanning images. CON: control; MEL: melatonin; ALP: alkaline phosphatase; RUNX2: runt-related transcription factor 2; OPN: osteopontin; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BMSCs: bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; *

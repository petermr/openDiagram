<p>Total RNA yields, pooled from 4 tapes per skin site, for 30 tape RNA samples averaged 42.58 ng (SD, 142.50 ng). No tape samples were removed from analysis based on low RNA yield. Gene expression was measured by qPCR amplification of 102 candidate genes. Eight genes were excluded from statistical analysis because the results did not meet quality control cut-off criteria (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S6</xref> for a list of genes removed), resulting in expression analysis of 94 genes. Additional details are available in the supplementary materials.

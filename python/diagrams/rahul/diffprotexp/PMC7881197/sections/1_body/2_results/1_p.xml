 </sup>, preliminary clinical data suggested that it might have few and mild side effects in humans (CA Patent #: CA2298093C). These findings suggest that the compound affects normal and cancer cells differentially, inducing potentially more serious cytotoxicity in the cancer cells. Therefore, we first tested whether the cytotoxicity of AS6 differs between the normal and cancerous mammary epithelial cells, HUMEC and MCF7 cells. Cells were treated with AS6 at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 μM and were monitored for viability at 24 h and 48 h with the WST assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The results clearly showed that AS6 was toxic to both cell types within 24 h at concentrations over 10 μM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>A). Both types of cells, when treated with 10 μM AS6, had survival rates less than 10% at 48 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>B), which indicates the significant cytotoxicity of AS6 to human mammary cells at this concentration. Interestingly however, the treatment with 0.5 μM AS6 resulted in differential responses between HUMEC and MCF7 cells: HUMEC increased in population, whereas MCF7 cell numbers decreased at 48 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>B). Microscopic observation suggested that HUMEC grew normally, whereas the growth of MCF7 cells was markedly compromised with 0.5 μM AS6 at 48 h (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>B).

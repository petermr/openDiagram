<p>The major adhesins of 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> include P140 (known as MgPa and MgpB) and P110 (MgpC). P140 and P110 are reciprocally stabilized and beneficial to cell adhesion, gliding motility, and terminal organelle formation and development [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, P140 and P110 are prone to antigen variation, which is correlated to optimization of adhesion, access to nutrients, survival in the host and escape from the host defense mechanisms [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The loss of either P140 or P110 protein also results in non-cytadherence and a hemadsorption-negative phenotype with the concomitant inability to develop the terminal organelle [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> GAPDH has been shown to bind to mucin [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This is the first report to demonstrate that mucin is involved in adherence and motility, and this GAPDH-mucin recognition event can help to better understand the mechanism of adherence, colonization and pathogenicity.

<p>The study on solid-state ionic conductors have aroused much interest due to the merits of high stability and good safety. It is well-accepted that the migration of ion species is quite difficult in a solid, highly affected by the valence states of the ion species. Therefore, while there are many kinds of monovalent ionic conductors with high conductivity, few choices are available for multivalent ions such as Mg

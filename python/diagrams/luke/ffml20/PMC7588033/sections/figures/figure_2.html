 <caption> Typical snapshots obtained from simulation at different times as indicated during the pulling of mannitol with velocity v = 0.5 nm/ns in the case of the GROMOS54a7 force-field and DOPC membrane model. Phosphate atoms are restrained in order to prevent the displacement of the whole membrane as the compound penetrates the bilayer. </caption>

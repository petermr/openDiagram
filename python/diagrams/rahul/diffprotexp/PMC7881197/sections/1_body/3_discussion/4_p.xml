<p id="Par47">The differential sensitivity to AS6 between HUMEC and MCF7 cells is note-worthy. At 0.5 μM AS6, HUMEC did not show malfunctions in DNA repair or cell cycle arrest while MCF7 cells did. AS6 is commonly poisonous to both cells at concentrations over 2 μM (Figs.

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). We suggest that this critical difference in response at certain concentrations might be advantageous for treating breast cancers without affecting the normal cells and tissues. Arsenic trioxide is a successful anti-leukemia drug without serious side effects

<p>Firstly, all the antibiotics included in the polymer matrix have a “spacer” effect, leading to the increase in the mesh size of the polymer network (mesh sizes ξ for PC12-A, PC12-T, and PC12-G are all higher than the corresponding value registered for PC12). This determines higher equilibrium swelling values for all drug-loaded hydrogels compared to the reference (

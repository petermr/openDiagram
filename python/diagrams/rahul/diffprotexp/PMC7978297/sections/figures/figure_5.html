 <caption> DEHP impacted transcriptome characteristics of two groups of PGs during follicular assembly. (A) Clustering of pre-granulosa cells based on UMAP colored by the sample groups. (B) Two groups of PGs. Seven clusters with high Amhr2 expression (common marker gene of granulosa cell) are identified as PGs in the left panel; two groups of PGs are separated by the expression of Foxl2 (cyan) and Lgr5 (maroon). The color intensity represents gene expression level; grey refers to the double-negative cells with color threshold of gene expression at 0.5. (C) UMAP plot of bipotential PGs (BPGs) colored by sample groups (left) and cell clusters (right). (D) UMAP plot of epithelial PGs (EPGs) colored by sample groups (left) and cell clusters (right). (E) Volcano plots of gene differential expression at BPGs between pairs of PD0-DEHP vs. PD0 and PD3-DEHP vs. PD3. (F) Volcano plots of gene differential expression of EPGs between PD0-DEHP vs. PD0 and PD3-DEHP vs. PD3. (G) The GO term enrichment of key DEGs in BPGs. (H) The GO term enrichment of key DEGs in EPGs. </caption>

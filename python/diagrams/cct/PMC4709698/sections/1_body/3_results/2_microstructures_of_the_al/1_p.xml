<p>The microstructures of the as-cast rods of the alloy BT48 (Ti
 <sub>45.7</sub>Zr
 <sub>33.0</sub>Cu
 <sub>5.8</sub>Co
 <sub>3.0</sub>Be
 <sub>12.5</sub>) with diameters of 2 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, as well as of a 100 g ingot are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a–e</xref>, respectively. All five samples show a similar two-phase microstructure containing dendrites and a featureless matrix. The bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the rod with a diameter of 6 mm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>) depicts the dendritic phase and the matrix at a much higher magnification. Very sharp interfaces are visible and the selected area electron diffraction image can be indexed according to β-Ti. A halo is superimposed on the diffractions spots, which indicates the presence of an amorphous phase. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces of all samples are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>. A glass transition (marked with arrows) precedes the exothermic crystallization events and it can be concluded that the matrix is indeed glassy. At high temperatures (above 850 K) the endothermic transformation from α-Ti to β-Ti is detectable.

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The third case is turtles (<italic>Chrysemys picta</italic>, <italic>Chelonia mydas</italic>, and <italic>Pelodiscus sinensis</italic>), which have been suggested as a potential
intermediate host by
Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> They argued that turtles have
two important residues (Y41 and K353) in their ACE2 that are identical
with those in hACE2 and that turtles in the markets were more common
than pangolins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> Although it may be true
that Y41 and K353 play an important role in binding S-RBD, it is,
however, not a unique feature in the ACE2 of turtles and humans. As
shown, many mammals have Y41 and K353 in their ACE2 proteins (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S7</ext-link>). Besides, the first reported
case of infection was suggested not to be associated with the market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Therefore, their rules for screening intermediate
hosts were not persuasive. The ACE2 protein of these turtles has ten
amino acid substitutions compared with hACE2 (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref>). <italic>C.&#160;picta</italic> and <italic>C.&#160;mydas</italic> have identical interface residues in their
ACE2 proteins. <italic>P.&#160;sinensis</italic> has two different
interface residues (E31 and Q35) compared with <italic>C.&#160;picta</italic> and <italic>C.&#160;mydas</italic> (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref>). In <italic>C.&#160;picta</italic>, only
E24 could form a hydrogen bond with N487 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c, right), while the other mutations resulted
in a substantial loss of favorable hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
compared with those in the hACE2/S-RBD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c, left). Expectedly, the three turtles (i.e., <italic>C.&#160;picta</italic>, <italic>C.&#160;mydas</italic>, and <italic>P.&#160;sinensis</italic>) achieved a poor binding score of &#8722;43.61,
&#8722;42.23, and &#8722;40.68 EEU, respectively. Therefore, structure
modeling did not support turtles as intermediate hosts.</p>

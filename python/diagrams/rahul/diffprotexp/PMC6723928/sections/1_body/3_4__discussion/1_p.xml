<p>Pulp tissue is mainly composed of connective tissue and also contains several other tissue types, including blood vessels and nerve fibers [

 <xref rid="B13-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Necrosis is a passive process that occurs due to the loss of protein functions or plasma membrane integrity [
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Consequently, the intensity and number of protein spots decreases as pulp inflammation progresses. However, it is reasonable to assume that a protein that plays an important role in pulp healing would be upregulated in the injured tissue. Hence, the spots with increased expression in the inflamed and traumatic pulp groups were selected and analyzed in this study.

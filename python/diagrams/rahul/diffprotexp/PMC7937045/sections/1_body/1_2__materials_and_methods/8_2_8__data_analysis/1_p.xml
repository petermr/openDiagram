<p>The MS/MS spectra were searched using the Proteome Discoverer 2.2 against a nonredundant Sequest database (released in January 2010; Homo sapiens, 20,367 entries). For protein identification, we set thresholds of 10 ppm for intact peptide tolerance masses and 0.02 Da for fragment ions. The analysis allowed for two missed cleavages from the trypsin digest, and iTRAQ (N-terminal, 144 Da), iTRAQ (Lys, 144 Da), oxidized methionine (16 Da), and carbamidomethyl (C, 57 Da) were set as potential variable modifications. Each peptide integrated intensity was normalized to the sum of its channel intensities. The normalized channels were averaged over all peptides of a protein, and the standard deviation of the mean was determined for each normalized channel of a peptide. The results of the SEQUEST database search for each reversed-phase elution were further analyzed (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S1</xref>, serum; Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S2</xref>, urine). A difference multiple greater than 1.3 or less than 0.77 in serum and that greater than 1.5 or less than 0.67 in urine were considered statistically significant. The clinical characteristics were compared using Student's 
 <italic>t</italic> test, Fisher's exact test, or Wilcoxon rank test, whichever was appropriate. The concentrations of transmembrane protein 143, cadherin 5, fibronectin 1, and collectin-11 in the different stages of lung cancer were compared to those of the control group using Student's 
 <italic>t</italic> test. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Results were analyzed using SPSS 8.0 software and Origin 8.5 statistics. The analysis of variance was performed to determine any significant differences (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05).

0: Transcriptome studies using microarray technology have identified several genes that are overexpressed during dehydration and rehydration [ 10 13].
1: However, several studies have shown that changes in mRNA transcript levels do not automatically imply corresponding changes in protein amount or activity [ 14, 15].
2: A proteomic approach complements the genomic and transcriptomic data by looking at the actual protein population of a specific tissue, cell or cellular compartment.
3: Proteomic approaches aim at analyzing the complex reactions of plants and are aided by sensitive and rapid protein identification that relies on mass spectrometry [ 16].
4: Proteomic studies of plant response to dehydration stress include analyses of the effects of water deficit, salt excess, low and high temperatures, high light and the presence of toxic chemicals, such as herbicides or heavy metals in the environment [ 17].
5: Several studies have shown that a combination of proteomic exploration with metabolomic and genetic approaches allows a better integrated understanding of plant responses to dehydration [ 18, 19].
6: Several proteome studies have mainly been executed on tuber tissue [ 20 22] and in connection with phytopathogens [ 23 25].
7: Other studies on protein changes related to abiotic stress tolerance in potato have also been implemented until now [ 15, 26].

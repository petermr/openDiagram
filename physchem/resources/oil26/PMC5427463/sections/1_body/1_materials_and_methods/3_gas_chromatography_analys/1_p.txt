0: The relative amounts of the SoEO individual constituents were estimated using a Hewlett Packard 5890 II GC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and HP-5 MS capillary column (5 % phenyl/95 % dimethylpolysiloxane: 30 m  0.25 mm,  i.d., 0.25 m film thickness).
1: Injector and detector temperature were set at 250 C and 280 C, respectively.
2: The oven temperature was kept at 50 C for 1 min, then gradually raised to 230 C at 10 C/min and subsequently, held isothermal for 5 min.
3: Nitrogen was the carrier gas at a constant linear velocity of 38.5 cm/ sec and a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min.
4: The sample was diluted in hexane and 1 L was injected manually into the system.
5: Quantitative data acquisition of the individual components was electronically obtained from FID area percent data.

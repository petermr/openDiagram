<p>In the trial, we also included mice that were sacrificed after 60 days of treatment to determine if raloxifene reached its target. Since ultimately the pathogenesis in this ALS model involves the formation of large insoluble aggregates of SOD1-G93A protein ranging from 70 to 100 kDa in size, we monitored the level of SOD1-G93A in the insoluble fraction. We found that raloxifene significantly decreased the aggregates in the females (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), an observation that may contribute to explain the finding that the grip/body weight ratio was lower in raloxifene-treated males than in the placebo group (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. As a control, we monitored the level of SOD1 in the soluble fraction for each of the samples and found that raloxifene did not affect the total level of soluble SOD1 in females; however, the soluble fraction was reduced in males (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>).

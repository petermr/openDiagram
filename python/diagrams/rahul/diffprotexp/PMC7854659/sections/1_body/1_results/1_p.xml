<p id="Par6">We applied tissue-to-tissue and tissue condition-specific co-expression network approaches to infer the regulatory relationships between genes and to shed light on the putative mechanisms underlying the effects of early maternal nutrient restriction on bovine developmental programming (Fig.

 </sup> reported 373 differentially expressed genes (DEG) from fetal liver (
 <italic>n</italic> = 201), muscle (
 <italic>n</italic> = 144), and cerebrum (
 <italic>n</italic> = 28) by contrasting control (CON, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) and nutrient restricted (RES, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) groups. Herein, we report significant differentially connected and differentially co-expressed genes in 50-day fetuses. Likewise, we identified putative regulators driving the differential gene expression between the groups and the over-represented biological pathways.

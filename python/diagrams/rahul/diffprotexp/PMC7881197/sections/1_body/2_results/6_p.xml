<p id="Par40">The RNA-seq and GO analyses suggested that modest concentrations of AS6 induced more deleterious cellular stresses in MCF7 cells than HUMEC (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). In addition, the analyses indicated that AS6 treatment resulted in the impairment of DNA repair function, the arrest of cell cycle progression, and the activation of apoptosis, uniquely in MCF7 cells, but not in HUMEC (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D–G, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–D). We interpret this to mean that MCF7 cells and HUMEC have profoundly different sensitivity to AS6 at concentrations below 1 μM. It is plausible that MCF7 cells undergo apoptosis because increased genomic instability halts cell cycle progression. We conjecture that this genomic instability may be attributed to impaired DNA repair function in AS6-treated MCF7 cells.

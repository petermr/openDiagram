<p id="Par32">Analysis of common miRNAs between SR-159 and SR-157 was done by studying the fold change of the miRNAs detected in SR-157 in each stage versus their fold change in SR-159 in the respective stages (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). A total of 122 common miRNAs including their isoforms were detected to have differential regulation in the 3 different stages of grain development. Out of the total number of 122, expression of 74 miRNAs differed between SR-157 verses SR-159 at anthesis (0Â day), 89 on day 5 and 95 on day10 post-anthesis. Highest down- and up-regulation in fold change was found in miRNA529b of the apical and basal spikelets respectively, on day 5 post-anthesis of cultivar SR-157 over SR-159.

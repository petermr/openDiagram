<p>Therefore, we carried out a series of transcriptome analysis using bioinformatics methods, trying to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TNBC and non-TNBC samples by analyzing several transcriptome microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and investigate their potential biological functions by performing Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Furthermore, proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and six hub genes, which play key roles in TNBC, were screened out. Our study provides a new insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of TNBC, and the identified hub genes may serve as prognostic predictors.</p>

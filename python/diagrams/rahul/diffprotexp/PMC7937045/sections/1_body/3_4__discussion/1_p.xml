<p>Using iTRAQ8-plex labeling combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as a quantitative proteomics analysis method of analyzing the serum and urine samples of healthy controls and stage I, II, III, and IV non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma patients, we identified a total of 441 proteins in serum samples and 1,161 proteins in urine. In the serum samples, elongation factor 1-alpha 2, proteasome subunit alpha type, and the spermatogenesis-associated protein increased significantly in all stages of lung adenocarcinoma compared with healthy controls. In stage III and IV patients, the expression levels of transmembrane protein 143, cadherin 5, fibronectin 1, and collectin-11 decreased significantly compared with those in stages I and II. In urine samples, the prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase levels were significantly decreased, whereas neutrophil defensin 1 was significantly elevated in stage III and IV lung adenocarcinoma patients. These results are consistent with previous reports verifying that the method is reliable. Moreover, these differentiated proteins may serve as potential diagnostic markers for the early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, combining the markers in serum and urine may distinguish different stages of lung adenocarcinoma.</p>

<p>In this study we aimed to identify diagnostic markers, which can be applied additionally to FNAB, for discrimination between cPTC and benign thyroid cystic lesions through the investigation of the fluid accumulated by these lesions. Although the FNAB plays a major role in the differential diagnosis of thyroid lesions with an overall sensitivity level above 90%, this diagnostic tool is not always informative for cystic thyroid lesions [

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The investigation of the liquid component of FNAB in such cases can potentially be performed for diagnostic purposes as suggested in studies of biochemical profiling of thyroid cyst fluid [

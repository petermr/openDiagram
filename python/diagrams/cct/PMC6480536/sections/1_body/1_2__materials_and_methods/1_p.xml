<p>Experimental low carbon steel was melted in a 50 kg vacuum induction melting furnace and cast into ingots. The basic chemical composition was 0.07C–0.06Si–1.5Mn–0.2Cr–0.001B–0.01Ti–0.001Ca–0.0025N–0.004O (wt.%). The test steel was deoxidized with Ti–Ca compound deoxidant. The deoxidization process was deliberately controlled to avoid the detrimental effect of coarse inclusions and to get a uniform distribution of fine inclusions. Boron was added to improve the inclusion-induced nucleation of intragranular acicular ferrite.</p>

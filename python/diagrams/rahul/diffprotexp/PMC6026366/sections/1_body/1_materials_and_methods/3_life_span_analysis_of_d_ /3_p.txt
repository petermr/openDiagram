0: To examine the effects of RGE on the life span of flies, survival was observed and documented at 8:00  p.m. when transferring to fresh basal food or basal food supplemented with RGE every 23 d. Survivorships were scored regularly and eliminated the unnatural death flies, and death flies were removed out of the cage when possible.
1: Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for data analysis, and statistical significance was tested with log-rank statistical methods.

 <caption>
  <p>Western blot analysis of XIAP. 1 represents the pENTRâ„¢/U6 group, 2, 3 and 4 represent three cell lines of the shRNA-pENTR/U6-XIAP group, and 5 represents the original XIAP overexpression cells. By means of gray scale measurement, the relative content of XIAP expression was expressed as XIAP/GAPDH. The relative XIAP protein quantities of the pENTR/U6 group and the original XIAP-overexpression Caki-1 group were 23.6 and 64.5%, respectively. XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.</p>

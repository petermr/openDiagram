0: It has been suggested that epigenetic marks may have a connection with signaling reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox metabolism, due to it has been observed that the enzymes responsible for histone methylation are sensitive to the production of ROS [ 46, 47].
1: However, no studies have been conducted on the effect of H 2O 2 on epigenetic mechanisms in plants.
2: Therefore, the present study aimed to determine changes in the 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation status of the transgenic tobacco H 2O 2 overproducing line (L8), which has resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in comparison with the azygous stress-susceptible control (L1).
3: This knowledge could be a fundamental insight into the role of the epigenetic plant strategies used in the adaptation to stress conditions, and the role of the H 2O 2 in the physiological adaptation, with the expectation of being applied to enhance the plant tolerance to changing environments.

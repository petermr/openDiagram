 <caption> KM-plot for survival assay of COL11A1 and other associated genes. (A–C) Effect of COL11A1 expression on (A) overall survival, (B) Disease-free, (C) Disease-specific survival. (D–G) Overall survival concerning gene expression of (D) THBS2, (E) COL10A1, (F) COL5A2, (G) COL1A2. (H–K) Disease-specific survival for the gene expression of (H) THBS2, (I) COL10A1, (J) COL5A2, (K) COL1A2. (Red and blue indicate the higher and lower expression of the gene, respectively). </caption>

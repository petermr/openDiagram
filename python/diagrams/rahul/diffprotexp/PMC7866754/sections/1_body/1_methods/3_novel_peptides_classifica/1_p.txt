0: Since the known genes have been analysed thoroughly by Lindner et al.
1: when they reported the transcriptomes and proteomes [ 37], only potentially novel transcripts with MSTRG prefix were considered in discovering nORFs that have been overlooked previously.
2: Peptides that identify these MSTRG transcripts were subsequently classified (Fig.
3: 1b) into different categories as defined above based on the position of matched peptides relative to the reference genes.
4: Each category was classified independently as described below.

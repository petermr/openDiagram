<p>In addition to 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, certain accessory proteins, such as MG218 and MG317, were also found in 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic>, and are needed for adherence of P140 and P110 [
 <xref rid="cit0100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Beyond that, there were few reports on other mycoplasma accessory proteins have been published [
 <xref rid="cit0102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In general, if a gene mutation results in the loss of the adhesive feature, the encoded protein is likely to be preferentially considered as an adhesin. From this point of view, the boundary between adhesins and accessory proteins is becoming increasingly blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to define the explicit function of the putative adhesin prior to classifying it as an accessory protein.

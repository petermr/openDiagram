0: The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine cytokine expressions.
1: The human astrocytes (4  10 5) were seeded in 6-well multidishes and were treated with 100  g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils and LPS (1  g/mL), only LPS (1  g/mL), or only 100  g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils for 24 h, at 37C, 5% CO 2.
2: The control cells were incubated in the culture medium for 24 h. RNA was isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Blirt, Poland) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
3: The Reverse Transcription System (A&A Biotechnology, Poland) was used for cDNA synthesis according to the instruction of the manufacturer.
4: PCR was carried out using the gene-specific primers for human ( -actin, IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF- ).
5: The products lengths were 509 bp, 93 bp, 296 bp, 425 bp, 476 bp, 292 bp, and 406 bp for  -actin, IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF- , respectively.
6: The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95C for 3 min, denaturation at 94C for 1 min, annealing at 5565C for 1 min, and extension at 72C for 2 min.
7: PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.
8: Further procedures are described in a previous study by Sitarek et al.
9: [ 20].
10: The experiments were repeated three times.

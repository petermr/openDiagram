0: We have explored PathwayMapper in the cBioPortal server shows the alteration frequencies of selected genes (COL11A1, THBS2, COL10A1, COL5A2, and COL1A1) along with the various pathways overlaid on a TCGA pathway using a white to a red color scale.
1: Furthermore, the top 25 correlated genes belonging to the COL11A1 gene cluster were used to reveal the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways in Colorectal cancer using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) available at  https://david.ncifcrf.gov/.

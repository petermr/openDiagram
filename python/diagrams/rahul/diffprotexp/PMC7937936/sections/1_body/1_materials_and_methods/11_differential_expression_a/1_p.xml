<p>The Wilcox rank-sum test was used to compare the differences in the expression of target genes between tumor and normal tissues. The R package “beeswarm” was used to generate the corresponding expression figures. Besides, we then performed paired differentiation analyses of target gene expression in tumor and normal samples from the same patient using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Statistical thresholds were set at 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05. The figures were generated using the “ggpaired” command of the R package “ggpubr.”

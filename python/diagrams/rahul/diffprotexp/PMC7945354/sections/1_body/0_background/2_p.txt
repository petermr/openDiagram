0: Cancer is gradually becoming the first cause of mortality worldwide with growing numbers of estimated new cases and deaths each year [ 6].
1: Increasing evidence supports a direct association between T2DM and cancer with higher risks of cancer morbidity and mortality, especially for some of the most common malignancies [ 7].
2: To date, several mechanisms underlying the cancer-T2DM association have been explored, uncovering dysregulations of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system as the most important paradigm [ 7,  8].
3: However, despite the higher risk of cancer morbidity in the T2DM population, reliable biomarkers for screening and early diagnosis of specific types of cancer in T2DM patients have not yet been discovered.

<p>To compare the CT complex with the HHTP and HAT-CN monomers, we conducted a comparative battery performance experiment using cathodes containing only HHTP or HAT-CN molecules. At 500 mA g
 <sup>–1</sup>, the discharge capacities in the second cycle for 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, HHTP, and HAT-CN were 288, 45, and 98 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref> and S18.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref> The capacity of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> was significantly higher than those of the monomers, suggesting that the stable one-dimensional mixed columnar structure enhances the stability and the efficient diffusion of lithium ions. The CV profile of the HHTP monomer showed broad redox peaks and the battery performance was rather low, although the high capacity and CV peak at 2.67 V (

 <bold>PCT-1</bold> suggested the existence of an HHTP redox reaction in the CT complex, which could account for the large capacity of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>. The high redox activity of HHTP in 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> is most likely due to the porous structure and the efficient diffusion of Li

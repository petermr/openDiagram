0: The  M. avium (MAH 104) strain was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco), supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, ADC, and 0.05% Tween 80 (MP Biomedical, LLC (Solon, OH, USA).
1: When  M. avium grows to OD 600 = 0.5, this is considered as the exponential phase and when it grows to OD 600 = 2.8, this is considered to be the stationary phase.
2: Each measurement was detected from three biological and three technical replicates.

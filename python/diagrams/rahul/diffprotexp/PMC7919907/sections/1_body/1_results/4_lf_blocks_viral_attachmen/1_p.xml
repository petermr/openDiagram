<p>SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the host cells through the interactions between viral spike protein and host cell ACE2 receptor and HSPGs attachment factor [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To determine whether LF interferes with viral attachment through interacting with the host cell or the virus, we used the HCoV-OC43 virus or the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles as SARS-CoV-2 surrogates and performed cell pretreatment and virucidal experiments. The results demonstrated that pretreatment of RD cells with 1000 µg/ml BLF prior to viral infection reduced intracellular viral protein expression level by about 80% compared to the H
 <sub>2</sub>O-treated control sample (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(A,B)</xref>), and the viral titer in the supernatant was decreased by about 1 log
 <sub>10</sub> unit in the presence of 1000 µg/ml BLF (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(C)</xref>). Similarly, pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with 1000 µg/ml BLF decreased the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus luciferase activity to about 50% of the H
 <sub>2</sub>O-treated control (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(D)</xref>). To assess the direct effect of LF on HCoV-OC43 viral particles, HCoV-OC43 viruses were pre-treated with 1000 µg/ml BLF or same volume of sterile H
 <sub>2</sub>O (untreated control) at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by viral titer quantification by plaque assay in RD cells. It was found that BLF-treated virus showed the same number of plaques as the H
 <sub>2</sub>O-treated control at 10
 <sup>−6</sup>-fold dilution (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(E)</xref>). The final concentration of BLF in the plaque assay was 0.001 µg/ml, far below its minimum inhibitory concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 37.9 ± 2.5 µg/ml) and thus had no effect on plaque formation. Taken together, these results suggested that BLF inhibits viral attachment through binding to host cells instead of the virus.

<p>The scaffolding protein, FLNA, is linked to steroid-induced cell motility [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Although we observed this protein to be overexpressed and underexpressed in two different spots, which could suggest posttranslational modifications (PTMâ€™s) and isoform regulation, FLNA has been associated to the formation of complexes with androgen receptors in response to steroids. This type of regulation has been documented in processes of neurogenesis, cell migration and invasiveness [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Additionally, FLNA facilitates nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor to modulate gene expression [

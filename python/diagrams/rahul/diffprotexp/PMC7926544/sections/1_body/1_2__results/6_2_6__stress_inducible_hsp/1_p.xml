<p>The potential significance of our findings is that the interaction of STCH, a constitutively expressed member of the Hsp70 family, with NKCC2 at the ER and/or cis-Golgi could be very important for the ER quality control and the ERAD of the co-transporter. These findings are of particular interest, because previous reports showed that the cytoplasmic, stress-inducible, and the most studied members of the Hsp70 family Hsp-70-1, commonly called Hsp70, is also involved in the ER quality control of several proteins [

 <xref rid="B48-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This prompted us to study also the effect of this stress-inducible Hsp70 on NKCC2 biogenesis. Consequently, we first checked whether NKCC2 might also interact with Hsp70. To this end, cells were transiently transfected with Myc-NKCC2 construct either singly or in combination with Hsp70 which is also tagged with Myc. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Hsp70 antibodies, and the resultant immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-Myc. Interestingly, similar to the data obtained with STCH, these CO-IP experiments revealed Hsp70 interacts also with NKCC2 and that the interaction implicates mainly the immature form of the co-transporter (

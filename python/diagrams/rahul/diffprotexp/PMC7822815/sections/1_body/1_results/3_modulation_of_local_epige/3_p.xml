<p id="Par20">All of the above findings indicate a close association between chromatin state and differential splicing following

 </sup>, we integrated epigenetic data with multivariate sequence data and calculated the partial dependence for each epigenetic mark using a random forest approach (see Supplementary Methods for further details). This analysis demonstrates that differential splicing is promoted by proximity to RUNX1/RUNX1T1, RNA pol II, and H3K9Ac sites, as well as DNase I hypersensitivity sites (Fig.

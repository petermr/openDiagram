<p>In this work, a Ti

 <sub>33.0</sub>Cu
 <sub>5.8</sub>Co
 <sub>3.0</sub>Be
 <sub>12.5</sub> (at.%) alloy was developed consisting of β-Ti dendrites embedded in a glassy matrix. The Be-rich matrix (Ti
 <sub>32.02</sub>Zr
 <sub>30.13</sub>Cu
 <sub>9.01</sub>Co
 <sub>4.84</sub>Be
 <sub>24.00</sub>) can congeal into glassy ingots with a weight of up to 150 g. A two-phase quasi-equilibrium between two metastable phases, i.e. the supercooled liquid and β-Ti dictates the compositions of both phases as well as the according volume fractions. Based on the lever rule, a series of BMGCs with precisely controllable fractions of β-Ti was successfully produced for alloys with crystalline volume fractions above 30%. The influence of the cooling rates on the microstructures of these BMGCs is also elucidated. The two-phase quasi-equilibrium has strong implications on designing and understanding the evolution of typical microstructures found in cast BMGCs containing the β-phase.

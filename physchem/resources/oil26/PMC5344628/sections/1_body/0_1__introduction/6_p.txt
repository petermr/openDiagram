0: In this study, four essential oils, namely, thyme ( Thymus vulgaris L.), clove ( Eugenia caryophyllus from dried floral buds of  Syzygium aromaticum), rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis L.), and tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia aetheroleum) obtained from Romanian production (Fares Co., Orastie, Romania) are intent to be used as components in bioactive food packaging.
1: Therefore, as a first step, it should be worthwhile to comparatively evaluate the composition and antimicrobial/antioxidant activity of these four EOs.
2: Antifungal and antibacterial activity against three target food spoilage fungi ( Aspergillus brasiliensis,  Fusarium graminearum, and  Penicillium corylophilum) and three potential pathogenic food bacteria ( S. aureus,  E. coli, and  L. monocytogenes) have been evaluated.
3: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) concentration was established in each case.
4: The antioxidant activity was determined, and the most efficient oil for each type of activity was established.
5: Preliminary tests on the EO encapsulation into chitosan films and their antimicrobial activity against the spoilage of beef meat showed promising results, a detailed presentation for which will be provided in a future paper.

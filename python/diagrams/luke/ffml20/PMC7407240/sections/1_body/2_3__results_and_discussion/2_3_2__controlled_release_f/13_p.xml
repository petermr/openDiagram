<p>The amino and methyl-substituted amino groups of gentamicin become protonated at pH &gt; 7.5 (except for the amino group linked to the third carbon atom from the central streptidinic moiety) [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], so for this drug, the strong hydrogen bonding with PVA and ι-carrageenan (especially since the mesh size of the hydrogels is close to this antibiotic’s hydrodynamic radius) could be responsible for its lower release rates and lower diffusion coefficients, in comparison with the other two antibiotics. The combined diffusional-relaxation mechanisms owe for an anomalous type of release of the antibiotics from the hydrogels (

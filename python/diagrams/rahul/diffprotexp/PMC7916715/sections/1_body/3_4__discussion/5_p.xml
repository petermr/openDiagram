<p>Among four genes (
 <italic>TMEM45B</italic>, 
 <italic>NANS</italic>, 
 <italic>GPR110</italic>, and 
 <italic>SRD5A3</italic>) with known associations with PC (
 <xref rid="genes-12-00257-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), their contributions to PC, except SRD5A3, remain largely unclear. PubMed listed 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 articles under “TMEM45B and Prostate Cancer” and “NANS and Prostate Cancer” respectively. There were also two publications on the topic of “GPR110 and Prostate Cancer” in PubMed. We provide a comprehensive set of evidence revealing upregulation of TMEM45B and NANS in PC initiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), progression to mPCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), their association with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f004">Figure 4</xref>), progression to CRPC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f006">Figure 6</xref>), and their biomarker value in predicting PC recurrence in two-independent datasets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Collectively, our research significantly strengthens the involvement of both TMEM45B and NANS in PC development. Their contributions to PC initiation and progression should be investigated in future.

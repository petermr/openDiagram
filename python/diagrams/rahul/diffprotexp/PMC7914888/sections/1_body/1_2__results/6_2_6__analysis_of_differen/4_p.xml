<p>We founded the decrease in proliferation induced by L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU correlated with an increase in 
 <italic>p21</italic> (rER 2.7 ± 0.4) (2.7 X) for cells exposed to L-Tyr and an rER of 0.67 ± 0.1 (1.5 X) in cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f005">Figure 5</xref>j). This increase in 
 <italic>p21</italic> would explain, at least in part, the decrease in the S phase for cells exposed to L-Tyr and 
 <italic>CdK2</italic> reduction with the arrest in G2/M (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>e). The p21 expression increased after 7 days, maintaining the exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f005">Figure 5</xref>m). In this case, the early regulation of the cell cycle by sets of miRNAs presents differential expression. They regulate other targets, such as p27 (increased in western for exposure to 5-Brd-2′-dU, data not shown).

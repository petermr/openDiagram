<p>Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Determination of antimicrobial activities against yeast was achieved by microdilution method using serial dilutions of the essential oils (0.008–64.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL), which were prepared in 96-well microtiter plates by microdilution method using RPMI-1640 media (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) buffered with MOPS (Sigma). The antibacterial activities were determined by serial dilutions of the essential oils (0.03–128.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL, DMSO) in Mueller–Hinton broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Test yeasts or bacteria strains were suspended in media and the cell densities were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards at 530 nm wavelength using a spectrophotometeric method. Inoculums (0.1 mL) were added to the microtiter plates, which were incubated in a humid atmosphere at 30 °C for 24–48 h (yeast) or at 37 °C for 24 h (bacteria). In addition, positive (medium with inoculums but without essential oil) and negative (Uninoculated medium, 200 μL) growth controls were prepared. The growth in each well was compared with the growth in the control well. MICs were visually determined and defined as the lowest concentration of the essential oil produced ≥ 50% growth inhibition for fungi and ≥95% growth reduction for bacteria compared with the growth in the control well. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Gentamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and nystatin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in concentration range (0.001- 64.00 µg/mL, sterile distilled water) were used as standard antibacterial and antifungal drugs, respectively.

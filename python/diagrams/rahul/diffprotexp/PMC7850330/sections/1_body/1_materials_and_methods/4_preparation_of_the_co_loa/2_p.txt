0: Combined loratadine and sulpiride nanoemulsions (o/w) was developed adopting ultra-sonication technique.
1: Different compositions of the developed formulations are shown in  Table 1.
2: Specified amounts of Tween-80 and soybean lecithin were mixed at 25 C using a magnetic stirrer (400  rpm for 30  minutes) to form the oil phase.
3: The specified amounts of olive oil (3.5  g), loratadine (0.25  g) and sulpiride (0.05  g) were added and stirred till obtaining a uniform mixture.
4: The calculated amounts of deionized water, sodium cholate and glycerol (co-surfactants)were mixed to form the aqueous phase.
5: The oil phase was then added gradually to the aqueous phase using a suitable syringe under stirring for 10  minutes.
6: The resultant mixture was further sonicated for 30  minutes adopting ultrasonic processor at 20  kHz (FB-110Q, Shanghai Litu Machinery and Equipment Engineering Co., LRD, Shanghai, China).

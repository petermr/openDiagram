<p id="Par21">The majority of splicing events are co-transcriptional. However, in some cases of regulated alternative splicing, intron removal can be delayed until the release of pre-mRNA from the site of transcription

 </sup>. With this in mind, we analyzed nascent RNA in Kasumi-1 cells for EEJs that were shared between nascent and total, i.e., mature RNA (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). These EEJs were grouped into two classes. The first class (non-diffEEJs) included the nascent EEJs which did not become differential EEJs at the level of total RNA. In contrast, the second class (diffEEJs) collected events that were identified as diffEEJs at the level of total RNA.

<p id="Par14">Protein extraction and digestion were conducted following the above iTRAQ experiment. The tryptic peptides were placed in the mass spectrometer. Peptide fragmentation was performed with a normalized collision energy of 28. The fragments were identified at a 35,000 resolution in the Orbitrap. The acquired raw data were then analyzed with the Proteome Discoverer. The resulting MS data were processed with Skyline software (v19.1).</p>

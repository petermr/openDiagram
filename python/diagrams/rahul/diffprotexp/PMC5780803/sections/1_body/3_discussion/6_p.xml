<p>The results of the present study demonstrated the likely association between LDHA or TKT and XIAP. Therefore, XIAP also influenced glucose metabolism in RCC cells. A series of complex factors, including the microenvironment and gene mutations, may cause metabolic changes in tumor cells. The expression of the enzyme inducing the glycolytic pathway is increased and the inhibition of mitochondrial aerobic oxidation, including the reduction of pyruvate utilization or damage to the electron transfer chain, further increases the activity of the glycolytic pathway (

<p>Interaction through inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds could be deducted from the shifting of the PVA crystallinity band (1129 cm

 <sub>H</sub>), which is calculated according to our previous work [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Increased value of hydrogen bond energy for PC5, compared to the values for PVA or CAR implies a stronger interaction between these components, higher water stability, and a decrease in the diffusion coefficients of active species from the hydrogel matrix when in swelling relaxation regime.

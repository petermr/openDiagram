<p id="Par38">DESeq2 analysis revealed that a total of 127 genes were differentially expressed (DEG) between WT and MT; 25 and 102 DEGs showed decreased and increased expression in MT as compared to WT, respectively. These results imply that very few genes are involved in pseudostem height in banana. The gene expression cluster analysis based heatmap of each differential group is presented in Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Of the DEGs, only five genes were exclusively expressed in WT. The NR annotation showed that these genes were predicted as BIG GRAIN 1-like E isoform X1 (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb04t03190</italic>), protein SRG1-Like (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb11t04180</italic>), S-norcoclaurine synthase 1-like (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb11t04200</italic>), an uncharacterized protein (
 <italic>Ma02_g04590</italic>), and a stellacyanin isoform X1 (
 <italic>Ma05_g16810</italic>) (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Only one gene (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb07t24780</italic>) was exclusively expressed in MT banana with a log2fold value of 7.082. This gene was predicted as an integral part of the membrane. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that the top-five key biological pathways that were significantly enriched in WT vs MT banana were metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ribosomes, tyrosine metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (Fig.

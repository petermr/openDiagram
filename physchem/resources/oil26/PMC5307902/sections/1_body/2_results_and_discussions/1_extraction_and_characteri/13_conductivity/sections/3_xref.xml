<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] attributed the continuous increase of conductivity values to the process of coalescence of the internal phase. This was followed by a reduction, which may be attributed to phase separation. Nevertheless, F1 and F2 presented an increase in conductivity during all the experiment, and they were the only formulations that did not have a decrease in conductivity during the period of 180 days [

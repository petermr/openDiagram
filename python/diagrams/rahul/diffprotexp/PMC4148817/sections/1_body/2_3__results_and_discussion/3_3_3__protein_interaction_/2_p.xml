<p>Furthermore, it was found that some hub proteins appeared in several networks. A frequency distribution of all the proteins in all the functions is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="proteomes-01-00219-s001">Table S6</xref>. JUP appeared in 8 of the total 11 functions, while IL18 and integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) were involved in 7 functions. Exportin-1 (XPO1), thioredoxin (TXN), spectrin beta chain non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1), PYCARD, gelsolin (GSN), and cadherin 1 (CDH1) took part in half of the main cellular functions that were altered in response to CNT exposure.

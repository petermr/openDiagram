0: The selected pieces of nutrient medium from the zones of microorganism growth absence were transferred to the nutrient medium corresponding to each microorganism and then they were incubated for 23 days at appropriate temperature to determine the bacteriostatic or bactericidal action of the oils.
1: The action of oils is evaluated as bacteriostatic in case of renewed growth of test-microorganisms after the re-cultivation.

<p id="Par34">The sample size for this study is small, hence we cannot confidently generalize the data to other neonatal populations. Additionally, our cohort consistent of predominantly male patients. The effect of sex on transcriptome profile in congenital heart disease is not known. However, we developed this study as feasibility experiment. The data show that transcriptome analysis is consistent with published literature related to altered inflammatory homeostasis in children with CHD undergoing surgery with CPB. Future studies including larger numbers of patients would be needed to further validate the results of this study. The metabolic transcriptome dysregulation data was not completely validated with proteomic analysis. However, this will serve as target for our future studies exploring metabolic alteration in patients with congenital heart disease, specifically related to protein and fatty acid metabolism along with altered mitochondrial function. Finally, a potential source of the increased variability in transcriptomic response of the LCOS samples induced by surgery could be epigenomic differences between LCOS and No-LCOS groups, which is outside the scope of our current study.</p>

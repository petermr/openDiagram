<p>As described in the manuscript, we applied a pairwise DE testing strategy, examining RNA-seq each time-point independently and including technical batch and sex as covariates in the GLM. We also tested a full model, including all samples with time-point as a covariate, but feel this model inflated significance values for some genes that were DE across the time course and missed stage-specific changes. We also performed DE analysis on sex-stratified samples, i.e. independently on males and females, as reported in the manuscript. This DE analysis, gene ontology enrichment analysis, and modeling of the developmental timing are reported in the Results and figures (Figure 1D-F, Figure 4C).</p>

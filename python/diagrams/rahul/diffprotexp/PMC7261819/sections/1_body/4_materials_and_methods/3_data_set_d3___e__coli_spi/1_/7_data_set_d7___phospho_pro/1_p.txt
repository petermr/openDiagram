0: Search results of HeLa cells untreated (four biological replicates), treated with pervanadate or arrested in mitosis (three biological replicates each) were downloaded from ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005410 ( 26).
1: Same as data set D1, median sweeping method was used to summarize PSM level intensities to peptide log2 ratio.
2: PSMs and peptides were filtered at 1% PSMs and peptide level FDR.
3: The number of quantified PSMs per phosphorylated peptides was used in DEqMS.

<p>Aside from the determination of the critical cooling rates, a further aspect can only be understood if almost the full range of cooling rates is considered. As discussed later, it has been shown that for any age-hardening alloy, quench-induced precipitation during slow cooling predominantly occurs at alloy-specific high temperatures (compare e.g., [

 <xref rid="B121-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="B133-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]). At faster rates, the high-temperature reactions will be suppressed to a certain extent, and maybe even suppressed completely, and quench-induced precipitation will then probably take place via a medium- or low-temperature reaction [

 <xref rid="B133-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. An example is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f009">Figure 9</xref> for the pure binary alloy Al0.72Si. At a “high” cooling rate of 0.1 K/s (which may be a relatively slow cooling rate for higher concentrated alloys), quench-induced precipitation only occurs in a “low-temperature reaction” (≈400–300 °C). In contrast, during slow cooling at 0.001 K/s, the vast majority of quench-induced precipitation occurs at high temperatures (≈470–350 °C). At medium rates, both types of reactions overlap.

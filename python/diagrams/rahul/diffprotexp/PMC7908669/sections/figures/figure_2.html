 <caption> Differential circRNA profiles in MEL-treated human BMSCs. a The length distribution of circRNAs identified in human BMSCs treated with MEL. Expression of circRNA profiles in BMSCs was analyzed by deep RNA sequencing. b The genomic distribution of circRNAs identified in human BMSCs treated with MEL based on gene exon, intron, and intergenic regions. c The numbers of circRNAs encoded by each human chromosome in BMSCs. Upregulated and downregulated circRNAs by MEL treatment are shown in red and green, respectively. d Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed circRNAs in human BMSCs induced by MEL treatment. Differentially expressed circRNAs were defined by a fold change of &gt; 1.5 and a P value of &lt; 0.05. The increase and decrease of circRNAs are indicated by red and green colors, respectively. e A volcano plot showing the differential expression of circRNAs in BMSCs treated with MEL. Upregulated and downregulated circRNAs are indicated by red and green spots, respectively. Black spots represent CircRNAs with no significant alterations. f Relative expressional levels of nine representative differential circRNAs detected by RNA sequencing. The expression of circRNAs was evaluated by qRT-PCR. CON: control; MEL: melatonin; BMSCs: bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; * P &lt; 0.05 </caption>

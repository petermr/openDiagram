The most representative KEGG Orthology identifiers (KOs) both in conserved and differential proteins were those involved in signal transduction. This is not surprising, the process of secretion and transport of molecules is known to depend on second messengers that interact with a molecule on the cell surface, starting a physicochemical process to remodel the extracellular matrix, allowing protein secretion [

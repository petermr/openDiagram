<p id="Par28">A fairly low percentage of common plants were non-randomly distributed between microsites. This is probably due to the seeds of plants colonising the burrows chiefly coming from the undisturbed control areas (i.e. due to all microsites sharing the same potential species pool)

 <italic>Pellaea calomelanos</italic>, occurring exclusively at burrow entrances in the mesic grassland. Burrows could have facilitated the survival of these ferns as both species are weak competitors

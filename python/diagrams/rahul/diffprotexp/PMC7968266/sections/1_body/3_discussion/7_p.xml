 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Recently, Tong Lia et al. has found that KIF23 was mainly related to cell cycle, and indicated a poor prognosis in EOC patients. Meanwhile, they also found that both miR-503-5p and miR-424-5p could directly targeted KIF23 to inhibit OC development in vitro [

Additionally, Hu Y et al. has reported that KIF23 could not only be used as a prognostic indicator for EOC, but also had a positive correlation with immune checkpoint protein, suggesting that it can be performed as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy, which is consistent with the results of our study [

 <caption> Analysis of metabolic pathways in SASCs, EASCs, and PASCs. (A) Analysis of metabolic pathways of differential metabolites between SASCs and PASCs. The color depends on the P-value, and the size of the circle represents the degree of correlation. (B) Top 25 enrichment of differential metabolites between SASCs and PASCs, and the P-value represents the enrichment level, the darker the orange, the greater the P-value; the length of the bar represents the amounts of metabolites. (C) Analysis of metabolic pathways of differential metabolites between SASCs and EASCs. (D) Top twenty-five enrichment of differential metabolites between SASCs and EASCs. </caption>

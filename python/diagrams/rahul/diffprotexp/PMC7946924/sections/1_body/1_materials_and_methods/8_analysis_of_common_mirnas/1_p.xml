<p id="Par15">For identifying the common miRNAs, DGE related to grain ripening in SR 159 vs. SR 157, each sample of SR-159 (i.e. 0 DFA—Days From Anthesis, apical) was compared with its respective SR-157 (i.e. 0 DFA apical). Likewise, the ratio of fold change (FC) of each miRNA in SR-157 was calculated over that in SR-159 in respective growth stages (Supplementary Table

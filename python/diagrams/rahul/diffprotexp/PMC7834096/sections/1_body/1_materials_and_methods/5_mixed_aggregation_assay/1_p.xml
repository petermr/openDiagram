 <sup>−</sup> cells containing either pBAD24 or the plasmids encoding the different AAF gene clusters, as well as pPS1 or pPS2 (encoding 
 <italic>cfp</italic> and 
 <italic>yfp</italic>, respectively) were inoculated in 2 ml LB medium with glucose (0.4% w/v) from a previously plated glycerol stock and grown overnight at 37°C and 180 rpm. For this culture, we used LB medium with glucose in order to avoid premature aggregation of bacteria encoding the same fimbriae. The following day 5 ml of fresh LB medium were inoculated with 12.5 µl of two different overnight cultures (overall dilution factor of 1:200). The OD
 <sub>600</sub> was determined in regular time intervals until an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.4–0.6 had been reached, 150 µl of a 10% arabinose solution was added, incubation continued for another 60 min and afterward samples were kept static at room temperature to allow the cells to sediment before microscopic inspection. Samples for microscopy using the inverted microscope Leica DMi8 were taken from the bottom of the tubes. The Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) was used to take and pre-process the images. For further processing, we used ImageJ 1.51 n.

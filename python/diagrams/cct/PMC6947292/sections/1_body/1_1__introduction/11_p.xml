<p>The major progress that has been made relates to an extension of the dynamic range that is accessible for quantitative DSC analysis of solid-solid phase transformations under non-isothermal conditions. That is, conventional in situ DSC on heating and cooling is now possible over a dynamic range of ≈ 3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 3 K/s. When complemented by indirect DSC and indirect DFSC, a total range of 10
 <sup>−5</sup> to 10
 <sup>5</sup> K/s can be covered. The metrological methods required to achieve this dynamic range have been developed, and currently allow for quantitative evaluation covering the whole range of heating and cooling rates of technological and physical relevance. The consideration of this very broad dynamic width is associated with a large range of associated micro- and nano-structural features, i.e., the dimensions of quench-induced precipitates can range from several tens of µm to just a few nm. Several microstructure observation techniques including optical-, scanning-electron- and transmission-electron-microscopy (as well as other techniques) therefore need to be applied to comprehensively analyse quench-induced precipitates. To complete the analysis, the obtained quantitative DSC enthalpy data are assessed using physically-based models. The models consider the alloy composition and formation of the phases that are most relevant for quench-induced precipitates, as revealed by experiment.

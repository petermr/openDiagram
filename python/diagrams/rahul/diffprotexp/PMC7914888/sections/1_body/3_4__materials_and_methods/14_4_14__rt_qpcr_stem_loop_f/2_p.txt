0: For the RT-qPCR of the mRNAs, we synthesized cDNA from 2 ng of total RNA and 500 g/mL of OligodT (Invitrogen) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen); the samples were run in a thermal cycler (BIO-RAD) for 50 min at 42 C and 15 min at 70 C. For real-time PCR (qPCR), 600 ng of cDNA, the sense and antisense primers corresponding to each evaluated mRNA ( Table S4.
1: Primers list), and DyNAmo HS SYBR Green Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used, following the manufacturers recommendations.
2: The amplification in a BIO-RAD Chromo4TM under the following conditions: 95 C 15 min to activate the polymerase and 36 cycles that included 10 s at 96 C to denature, 30 s annealing temperature according to each set of primers, and 30 s at 72 C extension.
3: We identified the respective melting curve of 5595 C with data obtained from the Opticon Monitor 3 (BIO-RAD) program for both qPCRs of miRNAs and mRNAs.
4: To quantify mRNA and miRNA Differential expression analysis with qPCR, we use the relative expression ratio (rER) model to establish the mRNAs miRNAs differential expression [ 122].
5: This method adjusts the expression level according to the efficiency of each PCR run.
6: As references, we used GAPDH for mRNAs or U6 snRNA for miRNAs.

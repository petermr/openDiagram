 <caption> Variations in the expression of genes and their protein products, associated with controlling the cell cycle and senescence in B16F1 cells, induced differential pigmentation and decreased proliferation. Relative expression radius (rER) by RT-qPCR, ( n = 4), representative photographs of the location and distribution by immunofluorescence (red) in nuclear counterstain with DAPI (blue), quantification of expression by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and western blot for CCnd1 ( a– c), Cdk4 ( d– f), Cdk2 ( g– i) and p21 ( j– m). The level of significance (*) using two-tailed multiple t-tests. The differences were considered statistically significant for a p-value &lt; 0.05, ns: not significant. Significant (*) with p &lt; 0.05, very significant (**) with p &lt; 0.01, highly significant (***) with p &lt; 0.001. </caption>

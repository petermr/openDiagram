<p>Instead of pressed pellets, Luo, Tsung and Wang synthesized a Mg-MOF-74 thin film as the Mg ion conductor to eliminate interparticle gaps that were inevitable for pressed pellets and enabled studies on the inherent ionic conductivity of MOFs (Luo et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It showed the ionic conductivity of 3.17 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at the room temperature, which was in consistent with the previous report by Aubrey.

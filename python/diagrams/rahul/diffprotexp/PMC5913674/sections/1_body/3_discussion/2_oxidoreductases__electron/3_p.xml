<p>Some isotype-specific passive resistance mechanisms were also observed at the functional level. WB-MtzR downregulated 29 structural ribosomal proteins, which was similarly observed in transcript data [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and suggests significant reduction in ribosomal levels, protein production, and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> generation times. While 106-MtzR downregulated only 5 structural ribosomal constituents, 2 of the 4 genomically encoded FtsJ domain-containing rRNA methyltransferases (6055, 16Â 993) were upregulated. Null mutations in FtsJ are linked to altered ribosomal structures and impaired growth rates [

 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and indicate potential links between post-translational methylation, growth rate, and ribosome function in MtzR lines.

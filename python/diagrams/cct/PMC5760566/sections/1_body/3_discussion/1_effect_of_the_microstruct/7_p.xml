<p id="Par28">For both the QC and QC-S.C states, the fraction of HAGBs in the martensitic microstructures is âˆ¼10% higher than that in the bainitic microstructures. The block width and the fraction of HAGBs can be refined and increased, respectively, by increasing the QCR. Therefore, the fraction of HAGBs increases with decreasing block width and the total impact toughness of the SA508Gr.4N steel is thereby maximized.</p>

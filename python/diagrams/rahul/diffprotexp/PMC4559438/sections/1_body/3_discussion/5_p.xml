<p>Another distinctive finding of our study was expression of titin in congenital cholesteatoma. Titin is exclusively expressed in muscle [

 <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We found that titin matched the major spots found in proteomic analysis on congenital cholesteatoma samples and was also strongly expressed in cholesteatoma matrices, as shown with immunostaining. The role of these proteins remain unclear in pathophysiology of congenital cholesteatoma, but we suggest it may be involved in congenital cholesteatoma cell proliferation.

<p id="Par23">There were few genes that were statistically significant when pre-operative patients that do not develop LCOS were compared to patients that develop LCOS. A similar trend was observed in post-operative comparison between LCOS and No-LCOS groups (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In the pre-operative samples (LCOS vs. No-LCOS), 1 gene was up-regulated and 13 were down regulated (
 <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). In the post-operative samples (LCOS vs No-LCOS), 4 genes were up-regulated, and 4 genes were down regulated (
 <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). The surgical intervention had a greater effect on gene expression (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In the No-LCOS group, 1484 genes were up-regulated, and 1388 genes were down regulated (
 <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05), while patients that developed LCOS had 2423 up-regulated genes, and 2414 down regulated genes (

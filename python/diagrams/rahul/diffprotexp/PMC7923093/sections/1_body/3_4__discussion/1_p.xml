<p>Rodent mammary tissue development begins at puberty, while the catheter system expands rapidly and forms immature acini [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The mammary gland grows rapidly in pregnancy, especially late pregnancy, and is accompanied with increased functional acini as well as volume of lobules. After a period of lactation, the size of the acini begins to shrink leading to mammary gland involution prior to a decrease in milk synthesis and cessation of lactogenesis. Pregnancy is a key period determining the amount of secretory cells and milk yield during lactation, and the performance of mature acini determines lactation capacity. In this study, we observed larger and more regular acini in the arginine group compared with the control group suggesting that this amino acid contributed to lactation by means of either stimulating acinus growth or maintenance of acinus morphology.

<p>We have therefore compared the reproducibility of two homogenization methods: method M1, in which tissue was thinly sliced (60 μm, ~ 250 mg) prior to homogenization with a rotor homogenizer (Brinkmann blender), and method M2, in which blocks (~250 mg) of brain tissue were cut and homogenized with a mechanical homogenizer (Teflon® pestle). To conduct the analysis, pooled mouse brain tissue (n=6) was fractionated into enriched nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions. Three trials were conducted for each homogenization method.</p>

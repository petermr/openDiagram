0: The fresh leaves of  P. amboinicus were extracted by steam distillation using the Linax extractor (model D2 Mini, Sao Paulo, Brazil).
1: The leaves were transferred to the reservoir, which features a continuous water cycle coming directly from the water system.
2: This water was not in contact with the sample, the water vapor was passed through the reservoir, which contains the leaves, and drags down the volatile constituents.
3: The samples were stored in glass vials under refrigeration to prevent possible losses of volatile constituents.
4: Different extraction times [1 to 6 h] were used to optimize the estimate of the best yield.

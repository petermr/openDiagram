<p>We have demonstrated in the infertile group an increase in the concentration of a protein with a molecular weight of 11002.7 Da which may be identical with the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin A. Cystatins are endogenous inhibitors of cysteine proteinases. They inhibit cysteine proteinases such as the mammalian cathepsins B, H, L, and S. Previously, it has been shown that cystatin A is expressed in the basal epithelial cells of normal prostate and that this expression disappears in prostatic carcinoma.[

<p>Through the single-cell RNA sequencing of the RPE cells, it was found that the cells were exposed to hypoxia during the development of myopia and that hypoxia might lead to functional limitations in the RPE cells [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The GO items with statistical significance, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis through fructose 6-phosphate, were found in the RPE cells of the mice in the myopic model group. Glycolysis (specifically the process of anaerobic oxidation) may have occurred in the RPE cells of these mice [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, it can be inferred that RPE cells are exposed to hypoxia during myopia; as RPE cells are oxygen-consuming cells, this hypoxia may activate glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the cells [

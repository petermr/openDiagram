<p>The results of the release of cell constituents when 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> was treated with MPE at three different concentrations (control, MIC, and MFC) for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. A significant increase in the release of cell constituents was observed immediately after the treatment with the MPE at different concentrations compared to control.

<p id="Par20">Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed in G1p and the G1d cells. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, with the threshold of q-value &lt; 0.05, the differentially expressed genes observed in G1p and G1d cells from F1 follicles concentrate in the three pathways, including 15 genes associated with cell cycle (gga04110), 7 genes associated with DNA replication (gga03030) and 7 genes associated with steroid biosynthesis (gga00100) (Fig.

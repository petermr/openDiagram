0: Cells were harvested for RNA isolation using an RNeasy kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen).
1: Synthesis of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) was done using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific).
2: Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect the presence of 8 alternative exons were developed using gene- and exon-specific PCR primers.
3: Sequences, location of hybridization, and anticipated sizes of tested AS events are shown in  Table 1.
4: After quantitation by SYBR Green, PCR products were size-fractionated in 2% agarose gel.
5: The gel contained GelRed dye (10,000 dilution) from Biotium (41003).
6: The ladder was a 1 kb plus DNA ladder from Invitrogen (10787018).
7: After photography, DNA bands were extracted using a Qiagen kit (28706).
8: Purified DNA was subjected to Sanger sequencing for splice site validation.

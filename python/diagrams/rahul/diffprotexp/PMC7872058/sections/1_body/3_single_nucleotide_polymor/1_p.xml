<p>The rs2234237 and rs2234246 SNPs in TREM1 were studied. Genomic DNA was isolated from BAL samples using QIAcube automated system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping was performed using KASPar assays (LGC Genomics, Hertfordshire, UK) in an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Mean call rate for the SNPs was &gt;98%. Quality control for the genotyping results was achieved with negative controls and randomly selected samples with known genotypes.</p>

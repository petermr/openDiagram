<p>Lysosomes and cathepsins play a pivotal role in cancer cell death 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. The lysosomal permeabilization facilitates cathepsin release, causing cell death via mitochondria-dependent apoptosis 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Among the lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin B is a cysteine protease mainly involved in the degradation or processing of lysosomal proteins 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, vesicle trafficking 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, cell death 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. Our findings revealed that level of cathepsin B was significantly reduced in response to TNFα, suggesting that inhibition of lysosomal cell death may involve in the prosurvival signals evoked by TNFα in HepG2 cells.

For each rat, we randomly made three HE-staining images. Mammary acinar areas were measured using digital imaging system software MC30 (Mingmei, Guangzhou, China) and all acinar areas were recorded from each rat (1200 acinar areas in total). One-way ANOVA in SPSS 16.0 was conducted to determine differences from the control group. Significant difference was declared at

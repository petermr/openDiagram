<p>To further clarify the role of ETHE1 in MT protection from DU, cells transfected with or without ETHE1-specific siRNA or control siRNA were pretreated with or without exogenous MT (Sigma-Aldrich, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (100 nM) for 24 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. Cell viability was also determined by a CCK-8 assay.</p>

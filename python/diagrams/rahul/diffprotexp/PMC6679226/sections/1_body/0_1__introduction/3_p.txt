0: The goal of the current study is to examine the BALF proteome following direct and indirect lung injury using the murine lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin model.
1: LPS is the major biologically active component and primary recognition structure of gram-negative bacteria [ 13, 14].
2: The murine LPS model has been widely used to study pneumonia and sepsis through pulmonary and systemic administration, respectively, and has provided important insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that play comparable roles in human patients [ 15, 16, 17].
3: Results from this quantitative discovery-based proteomic study revealed commonalities as well as significant differences in BALF protein expression profiles following LPS-induced direct and indirect lung injury, and importantly, this study showed that LPS-induced indirect lung injury resulted in suppression of select components of lung innate immunity, which could contribute to the so-called immunoparalysis in sepsis patients.

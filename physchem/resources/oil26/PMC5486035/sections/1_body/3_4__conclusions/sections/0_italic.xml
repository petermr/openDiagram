GC-MS analysis shed some light on its composition, allowing for the identification of 40 derivatives, characterized by the abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes, both of which are some of the most studied and promising forms of secondary metabolites due to their remarkable and different biological properties. In fact, in the obtained results, the essential oil showed remarkable antioxidant and cytoprotective activities, which can also be attributed to its richness in monoterpene derivatives, which is dominated by the presence of 4-Carene, &#945;-Pinene,

<p id="Par28">Food habits domestication can reduce production cost in animals. Mandarin fish, as an economic species, has very unique food preference. In the wild, as soon as they start to feed, they feed exclusively on live fry of other fish species [

Our previous study showed transcriptome determining of food preference (dead prey fish), and indicated that retinal photosensitivity, appetite control, circadian rhythm, learning and memory outputs might be involved in the food habit domestication of dead prey fish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Compared to dead prey fish, the domestication of mandarin fish to accept artificial diets can provide more profitability. However, little studies investigate the molecular regulatory mechanisms of the domestication to accept artificial diets in mandarin fish.

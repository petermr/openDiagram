<p>We next evaluated the effects of SLEV infection on hematological parameters of WT (SV129) and ABR-/- mice. Blood samples were collected from mock-infected mice and SLEV-infected mice at day 3 p.i. and evaluated for the number and types of circulating leukocytes. We observed that mock-infected WT (SV129) and ABR-/- mice had normal leukocyte counts and comparable proportions of monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4a,b</xref>). SLEV infection led to a reduction in total leukocyte counts in both WT and ABR-/- mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4a</xref>). SLEV-induced leukopenia was largely due to lymphopenia, as infection led to reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes in both groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4b</xref>). We also assessed the recruitment of macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils to the brain of infected mice through assessment of indirect enzymatic activity of NAG, EPO and MPO, respectively, in tissue homogenates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4c,d,e</xref>). We observed that NAG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4c</xref>) and MPO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4e</xref>) activities were similar between infected and mock control mice in both WT (SV129) and ABR-/- backgrounds. EPO activity in tissue homogenates was increased in SLEV-infected mice in comparison to mock controls, but no difference was observed between WT (SV129) and ABR-/- mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4d</xref>). Finally, we performed a histological analysis of mock- and SLEV-infected brains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4f-i</xref>). H&amp;E stained tissue sections showed that mock control brains were healthy and presented with normal brain morphology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4f,g</xref>). Infected WT (SV129) and ABR-/- mouse brains presented discrete meningitis and ventriculitis at day 3 p.i., characterized by the presence of mononuclear cells. SLEV-induced meningitis was similar between WT (SV129) and ABR-/- mice. Overall, we found no significant differences between WT and ABR-/- mice in terms of leukocyte recruitment to the brain during SLEV infection.

<p id="Par14">Oil-seed rape (
 <italic>Brassica napus L.</italic>) is the fourth-largest oil-producing crop worldwide. The cytoplasmic male sterility of 
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic> has also been extensively studied as a rich source of cytoplasmic male sterility promoting hybrid seed production for the desirable traits. Previous studies found that there are at least nine types of CMS in rapeseed: ogu CMS [

 <italic>inap</italic> CMS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. CMS is classified into sporophytic and gametophytic sterility according to the period of anther abortion. In rapeseed, the currently reported type of sterile cytoplasm is sporophytic sterility. According to the cytoplasm source, CMS is branched into two types: homogeneous cytoplasm and heterogeneous cytoplasmic sterility [

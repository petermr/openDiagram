<p>To further explore the major biological functions that differential lncRNAs might impact, we estimated the associations between 50 biological hallmarks and individual lncRNAs. Overall, differential lncRNAs tend to be more positively associated with biological hallmarks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), wherein the distribution of correlation index is relatively balanced associated in the immune hallmarks and less than one fifth exhibited significant correlations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). We next performed enrichment analysis to examine lncRNAs that were exclusively correlated with some hallmarks than others (see section “Materials and Methods”). In total, 24,096 significant lncRNA-hallmark pairs were identified. Immune-related hallmarks showed relatively balanced distribution of highly associated lncRNA numbers among individual hallmarks, whereas other types exhibited larger number of associated lncRNAs in specific biological hallmarks (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The most significantly enriched lncRNA-hallmark pair is between CTD-3247F14.2 and “TNFA signaling via NFKB.” The observation showed that CTD-3247F14.2 was prone to correlate with genes involved in “TNFA signaling via NFKB” than those in other hallmarks, indicated potential regulatory roles of CTD-3247F14.2 for “TNFA signaling via NFKB” in prostate cancer. Among the top 10 lncRNA-hallmark pairs, six are immune-related biological hallmarks, such as “allograft rejection” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, LINC00664 was exclusively significantly enriched in “E2F targets,” which is a proliferation-related hallmark. Among significant lncRNA-hallmark pairs, a subset of lncRNAs showed exclusively enrichment in most immune hallmarks. The majority of these lncRNAs were also enriched in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicating potential lncRNA-mediated metastasis via immune processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although cancer-related signaling and proliferative hallmarks showed the most associated lncRNAs, immune-related hallmarks hold almost half of the top significant enriched lncRNA-hallmark pairs (

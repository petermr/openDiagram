<p id="Par16">Emerging high-throughput technologies open new avenues to identify the genetic defects and pathobiology of diseases at genome scale. Using microarray, the differential gene expression analysis of AVM nidus has revealed that Ephrin A1 is a candidate gene for AVM pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The transcriptome analysis of AVM nidus structures is likely to reveal deregulated molecular pathways. The RNA sequencing technology permits the study of differentially expressed genes in AVM nidus. In an attempt to identify the differentially expressed genes in cerebral AVM tissues, we have performed RNA sequencing analyses with cerebral AVM nidus structures. Since AVM nidus is heterogeneous structure, RNA sequencing was done with three independent AVM nidus samples to identify the potential changes in the pathways linked with cerebral AVM development. We identified 38 differentially expressed genes in all the three cerebral AVM samples analyzed. Among them, 35 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were downregulated. A subset of commonly differentially expressed genes belongs to retinoic acid-responsive genes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of abnormal astrocytes in and around cerebral AVM structures. Further, we observed upregulation of CYR61, a retinoic acid-responsive gene in the abnormal astrocytes in the neighboring tissues of cerebral AVM nidus. Taken together, our study provides the results of a first in-depth transcriptome analysis of cerebral AVM nidus. We have identified that retinoic signaling pathway-associated genes are dysregulated in the vascular structures of cerebral AVM nidus.

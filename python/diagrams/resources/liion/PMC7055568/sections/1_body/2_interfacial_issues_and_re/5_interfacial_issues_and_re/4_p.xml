<p>Although the polymer provides tight contact with Li metal anode, direct contact between ceramics particles of SCE and Li metal anode could not be completely evicted, which would lead to potential side reaction of ceramics particles with Li metal and inhomogeneous charge deposition. Meanwhile, voids or pores may be formed between polymer chains and the surface of cathode and anode, resulting in some empty contact points and thus high impedance. Pan et al.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> developed a flexible SCE membrane consisting of LATP, PEO, and boronized polyethylene glycol (BPEG) (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1507-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>f). They adopted small‐sized BPEG to fill those voids, which creates soft contact with Li metal with large contact area for high‐efficient lithium ion transfer. The composite membrane shows admirable capability on suppressing the formation of lithium dendrites owing to the compact and rigid LATP barrier and stable soft contacting interface induced by PEO and BPEG. Due to the enhanced ion conductivity and improved SCE/LiFePO

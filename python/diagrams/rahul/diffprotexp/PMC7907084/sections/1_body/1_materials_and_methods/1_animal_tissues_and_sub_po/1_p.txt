0: Egg-laying hens with normal follicular hierarchies (Lohmann Layer strain) were kindly provided by MUXING company in Sichuan, China.
1: In this study, a total of 15 hens in the same peak laying period were subjected for sample collection.
2: Five were sampled for the transcriptome analyses, the remaining 10 birds were sampled for real-time PCR.
3: The F5 follicle and F1 follicle were collected from each bird.
4: In general, a chicken ovary in peak laying period contains 30100 small yolky follicles and 47 follicles recruited in the hierarchy.
5: F5 and F1 follicles selected in this study belonged to the third growth phase with fast growth in size and rapid yellow yolk incorporation 6.
6: The F5 follicle and F1 follicle were collected from each bird.
7: Granulosa cells were then separated from neighboring cells.
8: Following our previously established method 5,  15, ~ 8 mm sections of granulosa cells proximal and distal to the GD (visually identified as a white plaque) were isolated for RNA extraction.
9: A schematic illustration of the cell localization in the follicle is shown in Fig.
10: 1.

<p>Overall, the XANES features contain very rich information about the atomic and electronic structure of a material. XANES analysis is also well suited for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> investigations due to the high signal-to-noise ratio in this portion of the X-ray absorption spectrum, its relative insensitivity to thermal disorder (which affects EXAFS data interpretation), and the short acquisition times required. These factors allow one to collect good quality XANES data with good time resolution and under harsh experimental conditions.

 </sup> The quantitative analysis, however, has been limited by the lack of analytical models that would allow linking the XANES features to a particular structure motif. The interpretation of XANES spectra has thus remained in many cases qualitative, by adhering to a comparison of the obtained spectra with those for reference materials with known structure, or semiquantitative, when methods such as linear combination analysis were employed to fit the concentrations of different species contributing to the averaged spectrum of a mixture.

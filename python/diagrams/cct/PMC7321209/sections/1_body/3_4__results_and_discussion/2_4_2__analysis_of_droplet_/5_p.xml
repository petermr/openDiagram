<p>Apparently, the short circuit frequency decreased with increasing CTWD. In the initial state of CTWD = 12 mm the short circuits occurred with a mean frequency of 42 Hz. This frequency was reduced to 11 Hz with increased distance between contact tube and substrate of 52 mm. This corresponded to 74% of the initial value. At the same time, droplet diameter increased throughout the previously described effects. The mean droplet size was determined to be 1.9 mm at 12 mm CTWD. The increase of the distance from contact tube to substrate up to 52 mm resulted in increased droplet sizes with a mean value of 3.1 mm. Thus, the average droplet size had increased by approximately 64%. During the experimental investigations, a maximum CTWD of 52 mm led to an inhomogeneous process behavior with arc deflections and excessive spatter formation. Further experimental trials were carried out with a maximum value of CTWD = 44 mm.</p>

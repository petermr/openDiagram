<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] to obtain emulsions there is a need to introduce energy in the emulsified systems, presenting very agitated droplets in the first days. This is because the emulsified system has free energy in the first days of storage which can lead to altered results. Thus, the study was conducted using the micro-emultocrit technique on three different days, where it was observed that the day D1 showed instability in relation to D30 and D90, possibly because free energy still existed in the system. The formulations on D30 and D90 had greater stability, because free energy had already dissipated promoting a kinetic stabilization. It was noted that F2 is the most stable formulation due to lower IC, based on the static data.

Although several studies have been reported, the evolutionary mechanisms of tooth/enamel loss are still unclear. Most previous studies have found that some tooth-related genes have been inactivated in toothless and/or enamel-less mammals, such as <i>ENAM</i>, <i>ODAM</i>, <i>C4orf26</i>, <i>AMBN</i>, <i>AMTN</i>, <i>DSPP</i>, etc. Here, we conducted evolutionary analyses on <i>ACPT</i> playing a key role in amelogenesis, to interrogate the mechanisms. We obtained the <i>ACPT</i> sequences from 116 species, including edentulous and enamel-less mammals. The results shows that variant ORF-disrupting mutations were detected in <i>ACPT</i> coding region among nine edentulous baleen whales and three enamel-less taxa (pygmy sperm whale, aardvark, nine-banded armadillo). Furtherly, selective pressure uncovered that the selective constraints have been relaxed among all toothless and enamel-less lineages. Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that mineralized teeth were lost or degenerated in the common ancestor of crown Mysticeti through two shared single-base sites deletion in exon 4 and 5 of <i>ACPT</i> among all living baleen whales. <i>D</i> <sub>N</sub>/<i>d</i> <sub>S</sub> values on transitional branches were used to estimate <i>ACPT</i> inactivation records. In the case of aardvark, inactivation of <i>ACPT</i> was estimated at ~23.60-28.32 Ma, which is earlier than oldest aardvark fossil record (<i>Orycteropus minutus</i>, ~19 Ma), suggesting that <i>ACPT</i> inactivation may result in degeneration or loss of enamel. Conversely, the inactivation time of <i>ACPT</i> estimated in armadillo (~10.18-11.30 Ma) is later than oldest fossil record, suggesting that inactivation of <i>ACPT</i> may result from degeneration or loss of enamel in these mammals.

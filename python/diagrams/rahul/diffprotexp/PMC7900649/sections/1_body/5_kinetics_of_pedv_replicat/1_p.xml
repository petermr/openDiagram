<p id="Par38">Confluent IPEC-J2 cells were washed three times with PBS. After infection with GDS01 at 0.1 MOI for 1 h, the supernatant was replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 medium with 2.5 μg/mL EDTA-free trypsin. At 1, 7, 13, 25 and 37 hpi, the virus was released by freezing and thawing of the cells for three times. The viral titer at each time point was determined by plaque assay. Each experiment was repeated three times independently.</p>

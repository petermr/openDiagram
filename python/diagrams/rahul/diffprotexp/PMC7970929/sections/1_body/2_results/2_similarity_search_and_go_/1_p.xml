<p id="Par14">The clustered high-quality reads were blasted against the 
 <italic>viridiplantae</italic> database in NCBI. Of the 120,231 clustered transcripts, 78,775 transcripts (65.52%) were annotated against uniport database and remaining 41,456 (34.48%) transcripts could not be annotated due to lack of information for 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic> in the database. The E-value distribution of the transcripts showed that 58.03% of the aligned transcripts had similarity with an E-value range of 1e−05 to 1e−60, whereas the remaining homologous sequences ranged from 1e − 5 to 0. As evident from the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, most of the transcripts had a significant level of sequence similarity to

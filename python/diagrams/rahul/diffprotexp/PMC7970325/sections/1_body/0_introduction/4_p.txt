0: DNA damage is one of the major causes that trigger the development of tumors [ 14,  15].
1: However, it also is an important focus in chemo and radiation therapy [ 16,  17,  18].
2: DNA repair mechanisms restore damaged DNA and may have a dual effect on the tumor: they prevent new somatic mutations and may restrict tumor development, but they also restore tumor cells with damaged DNA after chemo and radiation therapy [ 19].
3: Thus, when planning the chemo and/or radiation therapy, the possibility of DNA repair must be taken into account [ 20].
4: Low activities of DNA repair genes can make tumor cells more sensitive to the therapy, but at the same time not-repaired damaged tumor cells can form more new clones of treatment resistant cells [ 21,  22].
5: High activities of certain DNA repair genes, however, can counteract therapy of tumors [ 22,  23].
6: Therefore, the selection of relevant therapy should ideally be based on the state of DNA repair in an individual tumor.
7: Recently, defects in DNA repair were shown to play an important role in the clonal evolution of thyroid cancer [ 24].
8: Currently, the thyroid cancer subtypes need more detailed characterization in terms of molecular aspects of DNA repair.
9: This is probably due to the apparent shortage of publicly available gene expression data associated with histological diagnoses of thyroid tumors [ 25,  26,  27].

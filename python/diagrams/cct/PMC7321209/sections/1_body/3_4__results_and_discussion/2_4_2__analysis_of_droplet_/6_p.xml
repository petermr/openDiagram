<p>A side effect of decreasing short circuit frequency and respectively material transfer with large volume droplets affected the wetting behavior during GMAW. Herein, the formation of large volume droplets with low transition frequency led to a punctual wetting of the substrate. In context of WAAM, the wetting behavior was coupled to the welding velocity and was significantly relevant for the near net shape quality of the built structures. A homogeneous material transfer resulted in the formation of layers with equal geometrical properties such as width and height. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows the influence of CTWD adjustment and differing welding velocities on the geometrical formation of layers during WAAM. Thereby, a CTWD of 12 mm, respectively 44 mm was adjusted with differing welding velocities of 0.2–0.6 m/min. Wall structures of 100 mm length and 10 layers were manufactured. The temperature controlled WAAM process was executed with alternating welding direction in each layer and constantly set interlayer temperature of 100 °C before the next layer was applied.

0: The aim of this study was to compare the profiles of microRNA (miRNA) expression in corticotroph tumors stratified according to  USP8 mutational status and to determine the potential role of differential miRNA expression.
1: Moreover, mutations of another deubiquitinase-encoding gene ( USP48) contribute to pathogenesis of some  USP8wt tumors [ 17, 18].
2: Mutations of both genes were determined and taken into account in data analysis.

<p>The verification of microstructural phases was carried out by hardness measurements on the wall structures described in Chapter 4.3. Therefore, Vickers hardness testing was conducted from the substrate to the top layer in build-up direction of the work pieces. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f015">Figure 15</xref> shows the resulting mean values of three parallel measuring rows per structure for Vickers hardness testing with a distance of 1 mm between the measuring points.

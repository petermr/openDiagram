 <xref rid="B27-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Gaines et al. provided the detailed cell composition of the major types of LIBs [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The composition of spent LIBs is slightly different than that of fresh ones. The spent cathode material is usually not fully lithiated and could have undergone some structural changes during cycling. In addition, the electrolyte partially decomposes and/or evaporates during aging, and thus, it promotes the corrosion of both current collectors. To design appropriate recycling processes, particularly direct recycling processes, it is important to fully understand the aging mechanisms of LIBs, and Birkl et al. provided a great comprehensive paper on aging mechanisms [

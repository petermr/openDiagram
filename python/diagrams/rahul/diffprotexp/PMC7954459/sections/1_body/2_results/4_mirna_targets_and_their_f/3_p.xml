<p>To analyze the influence of miRNAs on target gene expression, we determined the correlation between the expression of miRNAs with their target genes in both chickpea cultivars. Majority (&gt;55%) of miRNA‐mRNA pairs showed a negative correlation in both the cultivars (Figure

 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>), suggesting that miRNAs negatively regulate target gene expression. We selected the pairs of miRNAs and their target genes that exhibited a negative correlation (≤−0.25). This set of miRNAs and their target gene pairs represented about 35% of the total miRNAs and their target genes. The target genes in these pairs that showed differential expression between the two cultivars revealed a significant enrichment of GO terms, such as anatomical structure development, post‐embryonic development, seed development along with cell division related processes (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), while target genes involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell maturation were enriched in a cultivar‐specific manner. These results suggest miRNA‐mediated differential regulation of target genes involved in seed development‐related biological processes in the two chickpea cultivars.

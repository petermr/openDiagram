<p id="Par39">There were 16 DEGs in the HYPO that also had mCG DMRs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b; Supplementary Table S7, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). No enriched GO terms were found among these genes; however, ADCY2 and prohormone convertase 2 (PCSK2) were identified as members of the PPI subnetwork (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and DS cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) and NRXN1 were highlighted in aggression-related GO terms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Eleven of the 16 genes showed inverse expression and methylation patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). There were 4 DEGs in the male HYPO that also had mCH (Supplementary Table S7, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The TnA had no overlap between DEGs and DMRs.

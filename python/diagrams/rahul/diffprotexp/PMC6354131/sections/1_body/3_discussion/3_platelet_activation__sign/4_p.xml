<p id="p0095">F2 (prothrombin) coagulation factor II is proteolytically cleaved to form thrombin in the first step of the coagulation cascade, which ultimately results in blood loss. F2 also plays a role in maintaining vascular integrity during development and postnatal life. It was suggested that prothrombin gene-variant associated with sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, and perinatal asphyxia, as well as other thrombophilic disorders, could be a risk factor for the development of neonatal thrombus.

  <p>Validation of IRF7 alternative mRNA processing. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Predicted exons of IRF7. Annotated exons are numbered. For each AS event, primer sets #4-#8 were designed to validate differential exon inclusion/exclusion. The expected size of the PCR product is indicated in red (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantitative PCR for each primer set. Shown is agarose gel electrophoresis, with MW (in nt) indicated at the left (
   <bold>C</bold>) Quantitation of IRF7 transcripts from qRT-PCR. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Validation of AS in primary hSAECs. Agarose gel electrophoresis as in panel (
   <bold>C</bold>). (
   <bold>E</bold>) Quantitation of IRF7 transcripts from qRT-PCR findings indicate that RSV-induced mRNA processing of the IIR is a general response of the small-airway epithelium.

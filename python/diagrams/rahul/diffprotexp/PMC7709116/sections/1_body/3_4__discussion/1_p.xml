<p>To gain a better understanding of the functions and roles of D1 and D2 MSNs in a wide range of neurological disorders and diseases, we have optimized a FANS protocol for isolating nuclei from these individual cell types [
 <xref rid="B18-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and coupled it with a low input TMT 10-plex approach that uses on-column labeling for proteomic profiling of the relatively limiting amounts of protein that can be obtained from FANS-purified nuclei [
 <xref rid="B25-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The genetically labeled nuclei from D1R- or D2R-expressing neurons were FANS-purified based on their having DyeCycle Ruby fluorescence expected for singlet nuclei and GFP fluorescence above a threshold background value that was based on nuclei isolated from wild-type mice. Western Blot analyses confirmed that both GFP and DARPP-32, the latter being found in both the nucleus and cytosol, were in the sorted nuclei from both D1 and D2 MSNs.

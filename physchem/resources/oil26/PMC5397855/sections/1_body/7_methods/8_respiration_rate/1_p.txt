0: Respirometry bioassays were conducted 3 h after the beetles were exposed or not exposed to garlic essential oil and their constituents, as previously detailed.
1: The doses used corresponded to the recorded LC 50 of each toxic compound and control consisted of insect treated with distilled water.
2: Carbon dioxide (CO 2) (L of CO 2 h 1/insect) production was measured with a respirometer of the type CO 2 Analyzer TR 3C (Sable System International, Las Vegas, USA), using methodology adapted from previous studies 49.
3: Respirometers (25 mL) were used, each one holding 3 adults of  T. molitor with mixed sex and connected to a closed system.
4: CO 2 production was measured after the insects were acclimated in the chambers for a period of 12 h at a temperature of 27  2 C. To quantify the CO 2 produced inside each chamber, compressed oxygen gas (99.99% pure) was passed through the chamber at a flow of 100 mL min 1 for a period of 2 min.
5: This airflow forces all produced CO 2 molecules to pass through an infrared reader coupled to the system, which makes a continuous measurement of the CO 2 produced by the insects and held inside each chamber.
6: After CO 2 measurement, the insects were removed from the chambers and then weighed using an analytical balance (Sartorius BP 210D, Gottingen, Germany).
7: Respiration rate values were not normalized by body mass because this method masks the individual effects of the variables 58.
8: Six replicates were used for each treatment.

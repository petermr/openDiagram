<p id="Par31">All the differentially expressed genes and proteins were analysed for the heat map analysis involving heat mapper portal (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.heatmapper.ca" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.heatmapper.ca</ext-link>) towards elucidating the hierarchical cluster analysis of the genes/proteins and the time points. This analysis helps in visually distinguish the upregulated and downregulated expression of genes involved in all selected timeÂ points of regeneration mechanism.The association of these genes / proteins were also analysed for the association in network pathways based on Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). This will give an insight on genes association or cross talk within a specific biological processes and its functional roles.

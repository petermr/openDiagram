<p>The unique ability of Cu-based catalysts to dimerize two adjacently adsorbed CO intermediates and, thus, convert CO
 <sub>2</sub> into more complex chemicals puts them into the focus of CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR investigations. Cu yields a variety of products,

 </sup> with the selectivity often changing depending on subtle structure details. For example, the exploited strategies for the optimization of Cu-based catalyst properties include the synthesis of molecular catalysts/single atom catalysts, taking advantage of nanoscale effects, interparticle distance/loading effects, alloying Cu with other metals, exploiting particle shape (facet) effects, changing the catalyst surface roughness or concentration of defects, tuning particle–support interactions, exploiting electrolyte effects on the catalyst structure and activity, and controlling the electrode oxidation state.

0: Carrot ( Daucus carota subsp.
1: carota L.; 2n = 2x = 18) is a globally important root crop with yellow and purple as the first documented colors for domesticated carrot in Central Asia approximately 1100 years ago 8.
2: Orange carrots were not reliably reported until the sixteenth century in Europe 9,  10, where its popularity was fortuitous for modern consumers because the orange pigmentation results from high quantities of - and -carotene, making carrots the richest source of provitamin A in the US diet 11.
3: Additionally, with its great nutrition and economic value, carrot has been well known as a nice model plant for genetic and molecular studies 11.
4: Carrot is one of the crops that can accumulate large quantities of anthocyanins in its storage roots (up to 1718 mg/100 g fresh weight) 12.
5: Purple carrots accumulate almost exclusively derivatives of cyanidin glycosides with five cyanidin pigments reported in most studies 13,  14.
6: The root content of these five anthocyanin pigments vary across carrot genetic backgrounds 12,  15.
7: In addition, anthocyanin pigmentation also varies between root tissues, ranging from fully pigmented roots (i.e., purple color in the root phloem and xylem) to pigmentation only in the outer-most layer of the phloem 16,  17.

 <caption> Screening of key methylation markers for sepsis in GSE138074. ( A) Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between sepsis and controls. Of all DMPs, 49.58% were hypermethylated and 50.42% were hypomethylated. The 10 sites with the highest methylation levels are labeled. Each feature color represents a different methylation site. ( B) The methylation levels and the expression levels of methylation marks. Key genes are labeled. ( C) Differences in key gene methylation levels between sepsis and controls. P for CD247 was 0.039; MAPK14, 0.047; FGR, 0.047. </caption>

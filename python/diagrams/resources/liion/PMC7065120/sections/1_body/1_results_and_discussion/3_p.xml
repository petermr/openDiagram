<p>During the discharge process in a Li‐ion half‐battery with Li metal as the anode, the cathode (FeNCN) accommodates both Li
 <sup>+</sup> cations (through the electrolyte) and electrons (through an external loop) to form Li–Fe–NCN ternaries. Note that an oxidation reaction in the positive FeNCN electrode forming Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> cations is prevented during lithiation (cathodic conditions), which rather leads to the reduction of the material producing the deposition of elemental Fe
 <sup>0</sup>. To maintain electrical neutrality in a Li–Fe–NCN ternary, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/Fe
 <sup>0</sup> reduction and Li
 <sup>0</sup>/Li
 <sup>+</sup> oxidation must proceed in a 1:2 proportion since one Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> acts as two Li
 <sup>+</sup> in the charge compensation. In other words, a cathode host accommodates two Li and precipitates one Fe simultaneously. That is, the intermediate compounds, whatever they may be, share the generic chemical formula Li

 <caption> Structural properties and EOS of liquid H 2 at different densities. a Equation of state (EOS) for liquid and solid H 2 at selected temperatures. The green and blue solid line is the EOS of Phase I at 300 K and T m (melting point), respectively. The pink and red dash line is the EOS of liquid at T m and 1500 K, respectively. b Normalised radial distribution function of molecular centres at selected pressures and T = 1000 K, indicating no liquid–liquid phase transition below 140 GPa. </caption>

<p>AcidBir was prepared by the dropwise addition of 166 mL of 12 M HCl to a vigorously stirred 2.5 L solution of 0.4 M KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> kept in a water bath at 90 °C.

 </sup> The resulting solution was reacted for an additional 10 min after completion of the titration. The precipitate was then washed with ultrapure water by repeated cycles of centrifugation/decantation until the conductivity was close to 0 μS/cm. δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> was, in contrast, prepared by adding an 80 mL solution of 0.1 M KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> and a 160 mL solution of 0.1 M KOH to 1640 mL of ultrapure water at 25 °C. An aliquot of 120 mL of a 0.1 M MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution was thereafter added dropwise to this solution under vigorous stirring. All synthesis procedures were carried out in polypropylene bottles, and all washed precipitates were stored as aqueous suspensions in polyethylene bottles at 4 °C for a 2 month period prior the onset of this work.

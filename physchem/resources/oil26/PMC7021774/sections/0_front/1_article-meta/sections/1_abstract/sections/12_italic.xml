<italic>Tsc2</italic> region gene space in the ToxB-sensitive line &#8216;Synthetic W7984&#8217; identified candidate genes for future investigation. Additionally, a minor ToxB sensitivity QTL was identified on chromosome 2A. The resources presented here will be of immediate use for marker-assisted selection for ToxB insensitivity and the development of germplasm with additional genetic recombination within the

<p>The gels were captured at 300â€‰dpi with an Image Scanner (Amershan pharmacia biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The spot intensities were determined by Image Master 2D platinum 7.0 (GE). All the experiments were done in triplicates to ensure reproducibility. Statistical analysis of protein variations was carried out in 2D gels prepared from three replicates in each group. In each group, matched spots with coefficient variation less than 50% on vol. % were included for further between group analyses. Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test analysis on vol. % of matched spots between groups was done to find out significant expressional changes (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Proteins determined to be differentially expressed were selected for MS identification.

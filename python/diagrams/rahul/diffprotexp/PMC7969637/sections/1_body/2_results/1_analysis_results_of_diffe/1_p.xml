<p>We first standardized the microarray data of 3 sets of GEOs to remove batch effects. Using GSE26440 normalized data for differential gene analysis, we obtained a total of 708 differentially expressed genes in the pediatric sepsis group relative to the control group, including 507 up-regulated genes and 201 down-regulated genes (

Wistar rats weighting 200-300&#160;g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (0.1&#160;ml/100&#160;g body weight). The thoracic aorta was quickly and gently removed, cleaned of adherent connective tissue and cut into rings (3-4&#160;mm in length). Rings were gently introduced between two stainless-steel hooks and placed in organ chamber (emka technologies, Paris) containing 11&#160;ml of Krebs solution gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained at 37&#160;&#176;C and pH&#160;7.4. One hook was connected to an isometric force transducer (emka technologies, Paris) and a tension of 1&#160;g was applied to the vessels then they were allowed to stabilize for 30&#160;min. The composition of Krebs solution was as follows (mmol/L): NaCl 119, KCl 4.7, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.6, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, and Glucose 11. Endothelial integrity was monitored by the percentage of relaxation evoked by carbachol (10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> M) after a steady contraction was reached with phenylephrine (10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> M). Rings with carbachol-induced relaxation less than 50% were discarded. AcEO was dissolved in final concentration of 0.5% DMSO. Control experiments showed that DMSO at 0.5% had no significant effect on the vascular tone.</p>

<p id="p0195">To benchmark the accuracy of the methods for our calculations, the initial tests were carried out on the MOF crystals. The obtained lattice constants were 
 <italic>a</italic> = 31.511 Å, 
 <italic>b</italic> = 30.854 Å, 
 <italic>c</italic> = 31.512 Å, which were in good agreement with the experimental values 
 <italic>a</italic> =

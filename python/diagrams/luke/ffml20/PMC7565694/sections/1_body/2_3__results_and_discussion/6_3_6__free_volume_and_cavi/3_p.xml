<p>In order to understand the available free volume for various penetrants, the 
 <italic>FFV</italic> was analyzed using spherical probes with different radii. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f008">Figure 8</xref>b illustrates the 
 <italic>FFV</italic> as a function of probe radius for Kapton, 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI. The total fractional free volume (
 <italic>FFV</italic>
 <sup>0</sup>) for the three PIs was obtained when the probe radius was set as 0 Ã…. As expected, the 
 <italic>FFV</italic> decreased with an increase in the probe radius. It is observed that 2,7-CPI showed the lowest 
 <italic>FFV</italic> among the three PIs in all the related probe radius range. For reference, the kinetic radii of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O considered in this study are indicated on the figure. The 2,7-CPI presented the lowest 
 <italic>FFV</italic>
 <sup>0</sup>, H
 <sub>2</sub>O accessible 
 <italic>FFV</italic> and O
 <sub>2</sub> accessible 
 <italic>FFV</italic>, as shown in 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. This was consistent with the 
 <italic>FFV</italic> results of PALS. Furthermore, the morphological representation of the O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O accessible volumes in Kapton, 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f009">Figure 9</xref>. The voids in 2,7-CPI were smaller and discontinuous compared with those of Kapton and 2,7-CPPI. This was due to the close chain packing caused by the better coplanar structures and strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding of 2,7-CPI. The less connected and low accessible free volume of 2,7-CPI resulted in low gas permeability and thereby high gas barrier. The Kapton showed larger and well-connected voids resulting from the nonplanar structure and low interchain cohesion, which led to high gas permeability.

<p id="p0155">We explored previously published thyroid tumor gene expression dataset PRJEB11591 [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] to validate the activation trend revealed for the activities of DNA repair pathways in three types of thyroid tumors. The literature dataset contained RNA sequencing data for 25 FAs, 30 minimally invasive FCs, 48 follicular variants of PC (FVs), 77 classical papillary thyroid carcinomas (PCs) and 81 adjacent pathologically normal thyroid tissues. The adjacent normal samples corresponded to 18 FAs, 19 FCs, 11 FVs and 33 PCs. As before, we performed differential pathway analyses (for 38 DNA repair pathways) and obtained the statistically significant q-value in at least one comparison for 36 out of 38 DNA repair pathways investigated (Supplementary file 7). We used 81 adjacent normal samples as the controls to calculate PAL of DNA repair pathways.

<p>Related to the above mechanisms leading to localised differential expression of IFN genes, we observed increased gene expression of both IFN-associated and CLE-associated gene clusters in affected skin compared with unaffected skin. In unaffected skin, IFN-associated and CLE-associated gene expression was not at the same level as HV, rather the expression level was intermediate between affected skin and HV skin, similar to what has been reported in AD
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 63</xref> and psoriasis.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The finding of an intermediate level of IFN-associated and CLE-associated gene expression in unaffected CLE skin may indicate that there is a low level of inflammation not discernible by gross morphological change.

0: In  Figure 4B, the corresponding heat flow signal is plotted; however, the accordance between the time axis in  Figure 4A and  Figure 4 is only schematic ( Figure 4A: linear time scale;  Figure 4: logarithmic time scale).
1: As a consequence of the transient response of the heat flow, at the moment when the process changes from cooling to soaking, a big heat flow peak artefact results at the beginning of the soaking step: the so-called overshoot peak.
2: This overshoot should not be involved in the evaluation.
3: The critical dead time,  tdead, is defined by the time when the scanning rate is stabilized to zero.
4: The exothermic effect following the overshoot-peak is caused by the precipitation reaction under study.
5: To prove this fact, six measurements with the same parameters were performed.
6: At any of these measurements, nearly identical heat flow curves were observed ( Figure 5), showing that the reproducibility of the precipitation reactions in the heat flow curves is appropriate.
7: In some cases, the heat flow drifts for long soaking durations, even though the reaction is expected to be finished.
8: Because of that, these data ranges were excluded too (an example is shown in the right part of the heat flow curve in  Figure 4C).

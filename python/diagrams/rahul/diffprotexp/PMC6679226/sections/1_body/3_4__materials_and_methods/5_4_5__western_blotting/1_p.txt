0: Total lung proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) and quantified using the BCA Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Waltham, MA, USA).
1: Equal amounts of proteins from BALF or total lung protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting as described [ 36].
2: Two Antibodies against Cxcl15 were used (goat anti-mouse Cxcl15, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; monoclonal rabbit anti-mouse Cxcl15, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) with similar results.
3: Densitometry measurements were performed using NIH ImageJ.

Yet, the stress-induced specific and common molecular dysregulations of these disorders have not been fully understood. Previously, we constructed a chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model to separate and obtain depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups. In this study, the prefrontal cortical proteomes of the three stressed groups were comparatively profiled utilizing isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled tandem mass spectrometry approach. A total of 212 protein dysregulations were identified, potentially correlating to susceptibility or resilience to CMS-induced depression or anxiety, and thus might serve as potential protein targets for further investigation. In addition, independent analysis by parallel reaction monitoring identified changes in Gfap, Rhog, Gnai2, Ppp1r1b, and Uqcrh; Tubb6, Urod, Cul1, Spred1, and Gpcpd1; Acadl, Ppp1r1a, Grm2, Mtor, Lsm8, Cplx2, and Tsta3 that were distinctly correlated to depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, or insusceptible groups, respectively. This suggested that identical CMS had different effects on the protein regulation system of the rat prefrontal cortex. Collectively, the present proteomics study of the prefrontal cortex established a significant molecular basis and offered new insights into the specificity and commonality of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resiliency to stress-induced depression or anxiety.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Molecular neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31770890 and 31570826)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Health and Family Planning Commission of Chongqing Nanan District (No. 2018-03).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Depression and anxiety, as two chronic and common psychiatric disorders, have a negative influence on socio-occupational factors and well-being of patients, families, and society<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Mounting evidence indicates that chronic stressful life events provide the adverse environmental factors underlying the depression and anxiety etiologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

To illustrate the potential biological etiology and pathophysiology of depression and anxiety, it is meaningful to focus on the neural substrates underlying susceptibility and resiliency to these stress-induced disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In general, depression and anxiety clinically display distinct fundamental symptoms, but are often diagnosed simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Because of this considerable overlapping in comorbidity and pathophysiology, the data in most clinical and basic studies are often mixed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, potentially obscuring our understanding of the factors modulating the two diseases.

Both depression and anxiety are heterogeneous diseases controlled through various brain structures, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Several studies have suggested that depression and anxiety result in a reduced volume and dendritic spine density of the prefrontal cortical regions in humans and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The prefrontal cortex, as a sensitive brain region to stress, participates in executive, cognitive, and socio-emotional functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Chronic stress-induced morphological and functional changes that take place in the prefrontal cortex can result in both the cognitive and emotional dysfunctions leading to depression or anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Despite the abnormal prefrontal cortical plasticity observed in depressive, as well as anxious individuals, the corresponding inherent patterns might be markedly distinct and remain unknown.

The proteomes of the prefrontal cortex from the depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, insusceptible, and control groups were comparatively profiled, providing the molecular basis correlated to adaptive and maladaptive phenotypes of depression or anxiety.

Given the rat prefrontal cortical sample used was from the same batch as the CMS model used in our previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, it was briefly illustrated that the sucrose inclination of the depression-susceptible group was diminished, whereas the immobility time was increased when compared to the other groups. Despite this, some stressed rats did not show depression-like behavior, yet their anxiety-like behavior was found by the EMT. Accordingly, these stressed rats were classified as the anxiety-susceptible group. Also, there were no significant differences in the SPT, FST, or EMT between the insusceptible and control groups. This suggests the insusceptible group did not include any anxiety-like or depression-like phenotypes. By these evaluations, we finally obtained a subset of the depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, insusceptible, and control groups.

In the two CMS-susceptible groups, just 13 proteins were observed to be regulated in the same way, which might represent some shared aberrant elements between depression and anxiety disorders. Also, 25 similarly regulated proteins were found among the two susceptible and the insusceptible groups as a CMS-exposed result (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Intriguingly, up to 87% of these proteins were distinctly associated with the three phenotypes. This suggested that these stressed rats had distinct molecular patterns as responsive to CMS.

Details of these drugs, including drug name, DrugBank ID, and target proteins, are shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>. A total of 113 primary target proteins were obtained from 38 antidepression drugs, and a total of 70 primary target proteins were obtained from 13 antianxiety drugs. After species type was converted from human to rat, the target proteins together with the differential proteins were introduced into the STRING database to obtain their interactions. The direct interactions with medium confidence were then mapped to the corresponding drugs in Cytoscape for the construction of the phenotype-target-drug networks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In the networks, the primary target proteins acted as a link between the differential proteins and the drugs. The results showed that 14 differential proteins from the depression-susceptible group were correlated with 37 antidepression drugs. Meanwhile, 9 differential proteins from the anxiety-susceptible group were found to be correlated with 11 antianxiety drugs, and 30 differential proteins from the insusceptible group were correlated with 42 antidepression and/or antianxiety drugs.

Accordingly, researchers utilized the CMS protocol to generate depressive and anxious behaviors in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In our previously established CMS model, the three different phenotypes (depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible) of the stressed rats have been identified based on behavioral testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This model offered a valuable way for the identification of unique and common molecular features of vulnerability and resiliency to depression or anxiety, thereby contributing to translational biomedical research. Investigating the protein expression profiles linked to the three different behavioral phenotypes can offer new insights into our knowledge of clinical anxiety and depression disorders.</p><p id="Par26">To reveal the phenotype-associated protein dysregulations, herein the prefrontal cortical proteomes of the stressed rats were comparatively profiled using an iTRAQ-based quantitative approach. Compared with the unstressed controls, 212 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the prefrontal cortex of depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible rats. The overlapping protein expression changes between the two susceptible groups potentially represented the shared molecular patterns of depression and anxiety disorders. Those similar dysregulations between the insusceptible and anxiety/depression-susceptible groups were considered as general CMS-responsive protein alterations. Interestingly, the distinctly dysregulated proteins in the three stressed groups might represent the differences between the CMS-induced behavioral phenotypes. The clustering analysis also demonstrated that the three CMS-exposed cohorts exhibited distinctive protein dysfunctional profiles. These proteomics data would facilitate studies to uncover protein systems, and pathways related to susceptibility and resilience to stress-induced anxiety or depression.</p><p id="Par27">Our proteomics and bioinformatics analyses suggested affected pathways in the prefrontal cortex specifically correlated to CMS-induced behavioral phenotypes of resilience, depression, and anxiety. The pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were significantly enriched for signaling, secretion, and synapse dysfunctions in the depression-susceptible group, metabolism and neuropsychiatric disease-associated dysregulations in the anxiety-susceptible group, and metabolism, synapse, and signaling repercussions in the insusceptible group. Subsequently, the network analysis unraveled the protein dysregulation systems corresponding to these significantly enriched pathways and potentially provided some valuable information for the pathophysiological basis of the three stress-induced behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, we further explore the drug relevance of these differential proteins through the use of phenotype-target-drug network analysis. As a result, the 52 phenotype-associated proteins were identified to be correlated with the antidepression/anxiety drugs. It can be assumed that the drugs may act on the potential primary targets to affect expressions of the correlated differential proteins, thereby ameliorating depression and anxiety symptoms in stress-susceptible subjects or enabling them to resist stress. Accordingly, these 52 differential proteins may represent new important secondary targets that are worthy of further study for the drug development in depression and anxiety disorders.</p><p id="Par28">In the present study, the 20 differentially expressed proteins involved in the significant KEGG pathways were further independently validated using the PRM-based approach. The results showed that Gfap, Rhog, Gnai2, Ppp1r1b, and Uqcrh were specifically dysregulated in the prefrontal cortex of the depression-susceptible group, while Tubb6, Urod, Cul1, Spred1, and Gpcpd1 were specifically dysregulated in the anxiety-susceptible group. The molecular response specificity in the prefrontal cortex suggested that identical CMS could differently impact the MF, thereby potentially pushing forward various BP and correlated rat behavioral phenotypes. Interestingly, we found that Acadl, Ppp1r1a, Grm2, Mtor, Lsm8, Cplx2, and Tsta3 were specifically dysregulated in the insusceptible group. This suggests a potential pathway to coping with the CMS-induced protein dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex. It could be speculated that these distinct changes might be involved in positive molecular mechanisms of stress protection in the rat prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we also noted the opposite change of Thy1 in depression-susceptible and insusceptible groups, which might be an important clue for resilience to depression.</p><p id="Par29">These PRM-detected phenotype-specific dysregulated proteins were primarily involved in the synapse, signaling, and metabolic pathways. Cplx2, Gnai2, and Grm2 were involved in synaptic plasticity-associated pathways, such as synaptic vesicle cycle and glutamatergic synapse. Gfap, Spred1, and Mtor participated in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and Urod, Gpcpd1, and Tsta3 were involved in various metabolic processes, such as porphyrin and chlorophyll, choline, and sugar metabolisms. Previously, these important pathways have been preliminarily implicated in stress-related disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the present study, the found protein expression perturbations distinctly associated with the three behavioral phenotypes could provide clearer information for future research.</p><p id="Par30">However, there are several notable limitations of this study. First, although protein dysregulations in the prefrontal cortex of the stressed rats were identified, the precise functions and roles of these proteins behind such aberrations need to be further explored to obtain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of stress resiliency and stress-induced depression/anxiety. Second, it is important to further investigate the expressions of these phenotype-associated differential proteins in the prefrontal cortex tissues of patients with depression and anxiety for translational research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">In summary, we utilized the iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics method to outline the consequences of CMS on the rat prefrontal cortex proteome.

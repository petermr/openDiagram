<p>A four-fold downregulation of MCT1 mRNA and protein expression, observed in the present study in the cortex of 
 <italic>Prnp
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice vs. WT mice, suggests the inadequate intercellular transport of lactate and/or pyruvate, which may be a consequence of a lack of PrP
 <sup>c</sup>. This finding is in concordance with the above-mentioned reduced MCT1 cortical mRNA and protein expression shown in sCJD patients [

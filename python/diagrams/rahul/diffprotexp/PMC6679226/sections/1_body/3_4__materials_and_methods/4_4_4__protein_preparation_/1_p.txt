0: Equal amount of proteins (60 g per BALF sample) were prepared for trypsin digestion by reducing the cysteines with dithiothreitol followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide.
1: After chloroform-methanol precipitation, each protein pellet was digested with trypsin overnight at 37 C. The digested product was labeled using a TMT 10-plex Reagent set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturers protocol and stored at 80 C until further use.
2: The 10 samples analyzed included control (I.T.
3: saline,  n = 3), I.T.
4: LPS ( n = 4) and I.P.
5: LPS ( n = 3).

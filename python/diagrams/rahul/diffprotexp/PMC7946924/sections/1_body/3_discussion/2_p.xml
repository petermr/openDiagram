<p id="Par38">In the present dispensation scrutiny of miRNA expression involving the two extreme types of spikelets not only in one cultivar but also in cultivars showing sharp contrast in grain filling phenotype were tested and confirmed. In the novelty of our study, two recombinant inbred lines (RIL), namely SR159 and SR157 were used to enable comparison of epigenetic regulation in a narrow genetic window and thereby to preclude interference of genetic factors. Panicle grain yield was not similar between the two RILs primarily because of difference in number of filled grains per panicle (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). But there was no difference in panicle length and average grain weight. The high sterile line SR-159 had more number of spikelets compared to SR-157, but poor grain filling in them (Table
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) under-rated filled grain numbers much below its counterpart SR-157. Among the kind of spikelets, inferior spikelets of SR-159 were found most vulnerable for starch synthesis and grain filling. Poor grain sink for starch synthesis owing to sub-optimal activities of regulatory enzymes of the metabolic pathway

 </sup> resulted in accumulation of soluble carbohydrates in these spikelets. It might have accrued on account of attendant hormonal perceptions, specific to the disadvantaged spikelet.

<p>In addition to cell proliferation, cell migration also plays an important role during 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> wound repair of the respiratory epithelium [
 <xref rid="B37-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Decreased expression of proteins known to be important for cell movement may lead to inhibition of epithelial wound repair. Actin filaments, usually in association with myosin, are responsible for many types of cellular movements and the breakdown of these processes may impair the motility of cells.

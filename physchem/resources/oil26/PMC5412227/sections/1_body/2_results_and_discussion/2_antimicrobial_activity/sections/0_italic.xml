<italic>D. kotschy</italic> essential oils were stronger against Gram-positive bacteria which is in accordance with a general observation derived from studies with essential oils from many other plant species (Ballester-Costa et al., 2013; Orlanda and Nascimento, 2015; Shakeri et al., 2014). This generally higher resistance of Gram-negative bacteria could be associated to their outer phospholipidic membrane, which is almost impermeable toward lipophilic compounds (Nikaido and Vaara, 1985). Lack of this barrier in Gram-positive bacteria makes the direct contact of the hydrophobic components of the essential oils with the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane possible, such direct contact results in either an increase of ion permeability and leakage of vital intracellular constituents or failure of bacterial enzyme systems (Wendakoon and Sakaguchi, 1993).

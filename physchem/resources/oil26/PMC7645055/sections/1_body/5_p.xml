<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Collectively, this Research Topic summarizes new and important insights into understanding how ecological and physiological adaptation allows animals to thrive when environments fluctuate seasonally or annually. It also reveals potential implications in terms of life histories of these efficient, sometimes limited, adaptive responses of animal species. We hope that this Research Topic will provide a solid platform from which to embark on multidisciplinary research endeavors that will be required to understand the challenges and capacities for adaptation to climate change in the twenty-first century and beyond.</p>

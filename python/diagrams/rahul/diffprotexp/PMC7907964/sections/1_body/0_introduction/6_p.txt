0: Primary skin fibroblasts reflect genetic changes in patients, and are useful models to study PD ( 20).
1: Previously, skin fibroblasts from patients with PD with heterozygous  GBA and  PARK2 variants, as well as from healthy controls were analysed, and it was observed that the GBA-PD group showed slightly lower activities of the complexes II, IV and V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain than the PARK2-PD group ( 21).
2: The present study investigated the GCase activity in primary skin fibroblasts of 4 patients with PD, including two heterozygous  GBA variants and two heterozygous  PARK2 variants, and this was compared with 4 heathy controls.
3: MS and label-free quantitative proteomic analysis were performed to identify potential target proteins associated with the disease.

0: For a schematic representation of the sample preparation process, please see Additional file  1: Figure S1 .
1: The dissected tissue was frozen ( 80 C) and pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a ball grinder, after which the pulverized tissue was weighed.
2: The proteins were extracted from the pulverized tissue using 15 volumes of chaotropic buffer (4 M GdnHCl, 50 mM NaAc, 100 mM 6-aminocaproic acid, 5 mM benzamidine, 5 mM  N-ethylmaleimide, pH 5.8) for 24 h on an orbital shaker at + 4 C. Extracts were collected after centrifugation at 13200 x g at + 4 C for 30 min.
3: The pellet was frozen and saved.
4: Fifty L of the extracts were reduced, using 4 mM DTT for 30 min shaking at + 56 C. The extracts were alkylated using 16 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.
5: In order to remove residual salts the extracts were precipitated with nine volumes of ethanol for 4 h at  20 C, after which the precipitate was dried in a SpeedVac and suspended in 100 L of 0.1 M AMBIC, pH 8.5.
6: The samples were then digested using 2 g trypsin gold on a shaker at + 37 C for approximately 16 h. The peptide concentrations of the digests were determined using Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
7: Samples (50 g) were diluted to 200 L with a final concentration of 50 mM AMBIC and 0.5 M sodium chloride (to minimize ionic interactions).
8: In order to remove peptides with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains from the samples, they were centrifuged through Nanosep 30 K Omega Centrifugal Devices (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, USA.
9: The samples were subsequently desalted and fractionated into two fractions (eluted with 10 and 50% acetonitrile respectively) using Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.

<p>Previous studies have indicated that HP, AMBP, and AZGP1 were the candidate biomarkers for DM [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We also observed the changed levels of RBP4 and EIF4G1 in DM. In conclusion, those results support the hypothesis that those proteins may associate in the metabolism of DM. These proteins may not be sensitive diagnosis biomarkers for DM; however, they may be indicators of alteration in glycemic control.

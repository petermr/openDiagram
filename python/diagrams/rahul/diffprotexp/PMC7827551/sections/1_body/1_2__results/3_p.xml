<p>Progenesis SameSpot software revealed eight proteins were up-regulated in the stationary phase, while the other four proteins were down-regulated. The software analysis revealed that the intensities of the targeted spots were differentially expressed between the two growth phases, as appeared in the gel image (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). This was confirmed by the logarithmic normalized volume between the two phases that blotted for each spot by SameSpots (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). For instance, the upper line is for spot number 63 (Glucose methanol choline) that is up regulated in the stationary phase and the lower one is for spot number 17 (Universal stress protein), which is down regulated in the stationary phase (

 <xref rid="molecules-26-00305-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The standard expression profiles of all the 12 dys-regulated spots differentially expressed between the two phases of growth of MAH were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>. The 12 spots were then identified by LC-MS/MS and 12 hits were detected with high confidence (Mascot score â‰¥ 30; FDR &lt; 1%) and with protein scores ranging from 323 to 2605. Physiochemical properties of the significantly different proteins like the distribution and ratios of sequence charge, GRAVY index, and hydrophobicity are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00305-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Further annotation of these proteins with regard to their molecular function and biological process were searched. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and biological pathways identification are done to reveal the biological process and pathways for the differentially expressed proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00305-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The identified up-regulated protein hits were involved in different processes like the aminopeptidase, choline dehydrogenase, oxidoreductase, and ATP binding. Mass spectrometric identification of the down-regulated proteins revealed acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, universal stress protein, catalase peroxidase, and elongation factor (Tu). Their functions were involved in transferase activity, responses to the stress, the process of hydrogen peroxide catabolic with responses to the oxidative stress, and the activity of GTPase with the translation elongation factor activity, respectively (

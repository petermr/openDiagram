  <p>IC
   <sub>50</sub> profiles and post-translational modifications upon discontinuation of Mtz selection. (A) Dose–response curves for MtzR lines of 106 and 713 upon discontinuation of drug selection at 4 (P8), 8 (P16), and 12 (P24) weeks compared to MtzS lines. MtzS lines were used and are designated 106_WT and 713_WT. Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation; experiments were performed in triplicate. The table records the calculated IC
   <sub>50</sub> for each time point, with resistance factors calculated against the IC
   <sub>50</sub> of the MtzS parent isolate. (B) Western blots against lysate from trophozoites (15 μg) from 713 and 106-MtzR (P0) and 4 (P8), 8 (P16) after discontinued drug selection was probed with antibodies against acetylated lysine (KAc), mono-methylated lysine (K-Mme), and phosphorylated tyrosine (pY). Altered features within 713 and 106 lines are designated on the right of the blot using a solid red arrow. Exposure times have been reduced by 20% to prevent overexposure of major bands (e.g., histone variants).

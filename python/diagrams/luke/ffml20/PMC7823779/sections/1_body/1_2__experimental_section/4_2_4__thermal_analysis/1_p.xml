<p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) were used to investigate the thermal decomposition of energetic materials. Combined with the measurements of infrared spectroscopy (IR) and gas chromatography (GC) or mass spectrum (MS) for analyzing the gaseous products, the process of decomposition can be initially explored. Multi-apparatus combination as DSC-TG-MS-FTIR attracts increasing interest due to its synchronous analysis of gaseous products for improving accuracy compared to an individual combination [

In this paper, DSC-TG-MS-FTIR synchronous measurement is an assembly of NETZSCH (Bayern, Germany) STA449C, NETZSCH QMS403C and BRUKER (Karlsruhe, Germany) VERTEX 70, and two pipelines are connected with DSC/TG measurements to MS apparatus and FTIR apparatus separately. The details about the connection could be taken in Ref. [

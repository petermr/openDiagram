<p id="p0035">The production process of high-quality mould steel was started from the pretreatment of hot metal, followed with BOF (deoxygenation by aluminum), LF (desulfurization), RH refining (degasification and inclusions removal), calcium treatment (morphology control of inclusions), soft blow, and continuous casting. During the production of high-alloy steels, especially the ones with carbon content above 0.3 mass pct, the high content of carbon and alloy would raise segregation resulting in cracking by an external force. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mechanism of the cracking and find ways to control it.</p>

 <caption> miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs showed significant negative correlation (R ≥ 0.5, P &lt; 0.05) of expression during Tartary buckwheat seed development. Left: Heat map of DEMs. Right: Heat map of the differentially expressed target mRNAs of DEMs. The different colors represent the expression abundance of the miRNAs and their corresponding target mRNAs </caption>

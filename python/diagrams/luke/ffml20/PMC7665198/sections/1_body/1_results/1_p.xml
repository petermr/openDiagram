<p id="Par4">We examined self-healing properties of self-healable poly(methyl methacrylate/n-butyl acrylate) [p(MMA/nBA)] copolymers composed of 50/50 MMA/nBA monomer molar ratio forming “key-and-lock” interactions in the presence and absence of water. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates optical images of air-cut/air-healed (A1–D1) and air-cut/water-healed (A2–D2) copolymers as a function of time. It turns out that the presence of aqueous environments during autonomous self-healing results in significantly faster (~3×) self-healing (A2–D2). Tensile analysis before damage and after self-repair under the same conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1, A3 to D3</xref>) revealed that water-healed copolymers also exhibit faster tensile recoveries. After 30 min (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1, B3</xref>) air-cut/water-healed copolymers recover ~80% of stress at break (δ
 <sub>break</sub>) and maximum elongation (ε
 <sub>max</sub>), whereas during the same time, air-healed copolymers recover 70 and 46% of their respective values. After 150 min, air-cut/water-healed copolymers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1, D2 to D3</xref>) recover ~100% of δ
 <sub>break</sub> and ε
 <sub>max</sub> values, whereas air-healed counterparts recover 87 and 83% (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), respectively. A summary of copolymer properties is provided in Supplementary Table

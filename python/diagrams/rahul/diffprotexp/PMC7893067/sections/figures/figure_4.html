 <caption> Cytosol and nucleus as a proxy for gene expression analysis. (A) Comparison of differential expression analysis between full and subsampled data. DEGs in Fetal-cyto vs. Adult-cyto and Fetal-nuc vs. Adult-nuc from the two datasets are shown.  (B) Barplot showing DEGs in fetal and adult (cyto–cyto) and DEGs in fetal and adult (nuc–nuc). Overlap of total cytosolic and total nuclear DEGs is shown in the Venn diagram.  (C) Barplot showing the distribution of differentially expressed protein-coding and lncRNA genes in cyto–cyto and nuc–nuc analysis. (D) Expression fold changes for transcripts in fetal and adult cortex cyto–cyto against nuc–nuc after subsampling. DEGs (red) overlap between cytosolic and nuclear fractions in adult, cytosolic and nuclear in fetal (blue). Genes significantly abundant in the fetal cortex using cytosolic samples but abundant in the adult cortex with nuclear samples, and those abundant in adult (cytosol) but not fetal (nuclear) are highlighted in black. Genes not reaching significance in either of the groups are shown in light blue. </caption>

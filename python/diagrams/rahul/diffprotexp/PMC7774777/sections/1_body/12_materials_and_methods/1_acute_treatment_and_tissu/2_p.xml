<p>Spinal cords were isolated by hydraulic extraction, minced with forceps, and flash frozen for later analysis. Tissue was lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors) on ice with roughly a 1:3 volume to volume ratio of tissue powder to lysis buffer. All samples were subjected to probe sonication (Fisher Scientific FB505) with 2 to 3 rounds of 1-second intervals at 20% amplitude on ice. Protein was then cleared by spinning at 20 800
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 20 minutes. The soluble fraction was then moved to a new tube and frozen at –20°C for later analysis.

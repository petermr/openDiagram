The GC was equipped with CP-Wax 52 CB capillary column (50 m x 0.32 mm; film thickness = 0.25 &#956;m) and helium was used carrier gas with flow rate of 1 mL/min. The GC oven was heated from 60&#176;C to 230&#176;C at a rate of 3&#176;C/min, the final temperature was then maintained during 20 min. The injector was maintained at a temperature of 250&#176;C. Injection volume 0.1 mL of 1% solution prepared in n-hexane; split ratio 20:1. The mass spectrometer was operating in EI mode at 70 eV with mass scan range of 40- 450 amu. Identification of constituents was done on the basis of RI (determined with reference to homologous series of n-alkanes C8-C25, under identical experimental condition), MS library search (NIST 08MS Library (Version 2.0 f) and Wiley MS 9th edition), and by comparison with MS literature data (Adams, 2007). The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on GC peak area (FID response) without using correction factor.</p>

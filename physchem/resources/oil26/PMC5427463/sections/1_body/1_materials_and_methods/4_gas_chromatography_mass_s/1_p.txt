0: The identification of SoEO compounds was performed using a Hewlett Packard 5890 II GC, equipped with a HP 5972 mass selective detector and a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm,  i.d., 0.25 m film thickness).
1: For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system, with a scan time of 1.5 s, a mass range 40-300 amu (atomic mass unit) and ionization energy of 70 eV, was applied.
2: As a carrier gas, helium was used at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min.
3: Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 C and 280 C, respectively.
4: The same oven program temperature of GC analysis was used.
5: One micro-liter of diluted samples in hexane was injected manually in the splitless mode.
6: The identification of the compounds was performed by computer matching of mass spectra using library search system HP-5890 (Hewlett-Packard) and consulting data bases of Wiley 275 and NBS 75K libraries (McLafferty, 1989[ 35]) and NIST 05 (Stein, 1990[ 51]).
7: Some of the compounds from essential oil were confirmed by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standard substances and with data as reported by Adams (2001[ 2]).

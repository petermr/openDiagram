 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f001">Figure 1</xref> we used transgenic mice carrying bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that express an EGFP-L10a fusion protein under the control of a cell-type-specific regulatory promoter; D1R (drd1a-EGFP mice) or D2R (drd2-EGFP mice). L10a is one of the proteins in the large subunit of the ribosome. Accumulation of EGFPL10a during ribosome assembly in the nucleolus imparts a bright green fluorescence that enables fluorescence-activated sorting of the corresponding nuclei (FANS) from the D1R or D2R-containing striatal MSNs. A similar isolation approach was used previously to study differential effects of cocaine on histone post-translational modifications in D1R versus D2R-containing MSNs [

 <xref rid="B18-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] where isolated nuclei were briefly fixed with PFA, but more similar to another previous study [
 <xref rid="B7-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], minced striata were exposed to a short fixation with 4% PFA (see Materials and Methods). After homogenization and sub-cellular fractionation, the resulting nuclei were subjected to FANS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) with DyeCycle Ruby (DCR) being used to label the nuclei. DCR is a DNA-intercalating dye that quantitatively binds to DNA [

 <xref rid="B30-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Dot plots were then used to identify different types of nuclei based on their EGFP and DCR fluorescence intensity. Most nuclei displayed DNA fluorescence that was characteristic of single nuclei (singlets). The EGFP-fluorescent singlets were considered for further analysis while debris and aggregates were excluded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). A total of ~40,000 GFP-positive nuclei were isolated from each Drd1a:EGFP-L10a or Drd2:EGFP-L10a mouse brain with 2 mice (i.e., about 80,000 nuclei) being used for each of the four D1 and four D2 biological replicates. Finally, fluorescence microscopy was used to verify the integrity, purity, and identity of the FANS-purified nuclei. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f002">Figure 2</xref>B, 358-nm and 488-nm excitation lasers were used for detection of the DAPI (blue) signal for DNA and GFP signals (green), which is detectable after enlarging the figure, respectively. Anti-GFP or anti-DARPP-32 antibodies were used to detect GFP and DARPP-32, the latter being a striatal MSN-enriched protein present in both the nucleus and cytosol. Both proteins were present in sorted nuclei from either D1 or D2 MSNs (

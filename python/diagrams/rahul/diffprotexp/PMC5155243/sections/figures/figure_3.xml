  <title>After DU exposure, the expressions of ETHE1 and ACY-3 in MT−/− and MT+/+ mice and the effects of exogenous ETHE1 and ACY-3 on HEK293 cell survival rates.</title>
  <p>MT−/− and MT+/+ mice were administrated with a single dose of DU (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or equal volume of saline (control). After 4 days, ETHE1 and ACY-3 proteins in kidney were analysed by western blotting (
   <bold>a</bold>). Quantitative analyses of western blots of ETHE1 (
   <bold>b</bold>) and ACY-3 (
   <bold>c</bold>). In addition, HEK293 cells were pretreated with or without ETHE1 (100 ng/ml) or ACY-3 (100 ng/ml) for 0.5 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. The cell viability was measured by a CCK-8 assay (
   <bold>d</bold>), and Calcein-AM/PI staining (
   <bold>e</bold>) was used for analysis of the living cell (yellow-green fluorescence) and dead cell levels (red fluorescence) as described in Materials and Methods. Results represent means ± SD of five separate experiments. The indicators were evaluated by a two-way ANOVA for two independent variables and by a one-way ANOVA for one variable. *

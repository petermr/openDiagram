 <caption> DCVC effects on global protein synthesis. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0 (control) or DCVC (10 or 20 μM) for 6 or 12 h. Protein synthesis was measured with O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) and 5 FAM-azide fluorescent staining quantified by plate reader. Bars represent means ± SEM. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (interaction between time and treatment, P = 0.019) with posthoc Tukey multiple comparisons. Plus sign indicates significant difference compared to control and 10 μM DCVC within same time point: + P &lt; 0.05. N = 3 independent experiments for each time point, with 4 replicates per treatment in each experiment </caption>

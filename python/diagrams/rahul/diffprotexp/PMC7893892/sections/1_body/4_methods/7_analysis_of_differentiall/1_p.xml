<p id="Par45">The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped (FPKM) value was used to estimate the expression levels of transcripts (lncRNAs and mRNAs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For experiments with three biological replicates, the R package DEseq2 was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts after a negative binomial distribution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. LncRNAs and mRNAs with 
 <italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.05 and a fold change (FC) &gt; 2.0 were considered as differentially expression between two groups of data.

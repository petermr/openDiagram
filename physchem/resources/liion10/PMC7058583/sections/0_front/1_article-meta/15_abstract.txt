0: Graphene-based MoS  2 nanocomposites are expected to be promising anode materials for lithium ion batteries because of their large specific capacity and high conductivity.
1: However, the aggregation of graphene and the weak interaction between the two components hinder their practical application.
2: Inspired by the sandwich structure, novel three-dimensional flower-like MoS  2-PrGO sandwich composites were proposed as an advanced anode material for lithium-ion batteries.
3: The separated 2D ultrathin rGO nano-sheets were connected by PEO chains and assembled into a well-organized 3D layered spatial structure, which not only avoids the aggregation of graphene but also accommodates a high mass loading of the micro-scale MoS  2 nano-flowers.
4: MoS  2 nano-flowers with open architecture deliver large specific area.
5: The rGO interlayers act as a conductive framework, making all flower-like MoS  2 nano-stuffing electrochemically active.
6: The ultra-thin 2D nano-sheets provide excellent cycle stability due to their neglectable volume changes during cycling.
7: The 3D flower-like MoS  2-PrGO sandwich composites deliver high energy density, excellent conductivity and stable cyclic performance during charge-discharge process.
8: With a nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, their reversible capacity is retained at 1,036 mA h g  1 even after 500 cycles at current densities of 100 mA g  1.
9: This novel design strategy provides a broad prospect for the development of advanced anode materials for superior lithium storage.

0: Laser surface transformation hardening (LSTH) of AISI 4130 was investigated by a Nd:YAG pulsed laser.
1: Laser focal height (LFH), pulse width (LPW), scanning speed (LSS), and power (LP) varied during the experiments.
2: The microstructure of the treated zone was characterized by optical (OM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).
3: Micro-hardness was measured in the width and depth directions.
4: Results showed that the hardness and depth of hardened layer increased by decreasing the LSS and the laser focal position (LFP), and by increasing the LPW.
5: The results were compared with those obtained by furnace heat treatment of the same steel.
6: Eventually, a finite element model was employed for the simulation of the LSTH of AISI 4130 steel and calculation of the heat-treated zone.
7: The results showed that the model can predict with accuracy the temperature profile and the size and the shape of the laser hardened region.

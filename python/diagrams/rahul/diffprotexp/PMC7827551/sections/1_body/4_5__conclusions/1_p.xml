<p>Ultimately, our proteomic analysis revealed that the differences between exponential and stationary phases are accompanied by variations in the gene expression. The different proteins were implicated in metabolism, virulence, adaptation, and surviving of bacteria pointing to the functional adaptation of the cells to the environment. For most of our identified proteins, differences in protein expression levels between the two growth phases underlie functional adaptations of the cells such as raising in cell synthesis and metabolism during the exponential phase, while elevating in the virulence and increasing adaptation as well as survival in the stationary phase. Studying 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> pathogen at the proteomic level in different growth phases could participate in understanding the course of infection, the mechanisms of virulence, the means of survival, and the possible targets for treatment.

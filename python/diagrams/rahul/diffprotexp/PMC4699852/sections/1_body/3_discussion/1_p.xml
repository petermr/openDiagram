<p>MSCs modified with targeting DNA hypermethylation of genes in the SWH pathway (
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs) had better proliferation and differentiation ability than unmodified MSCs. After induction in NIM, both non-treated and 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs showed a neural-like morphology and were TH positive. Their neural differentiation patterns were very similar to each other. However, 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs differentiated faster than non-treated MSCs. After induction, the 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs also secreted more BDNF (

 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs have demonstrated enhanced proliferation and differentiation and were not found to be tumorigenic in a nude mice assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs are an ideal model for the study of stem cell differentiation.

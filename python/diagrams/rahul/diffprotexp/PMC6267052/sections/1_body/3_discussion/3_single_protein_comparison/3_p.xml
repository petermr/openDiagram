<p id="Par28">Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) is a group of highly abundant ECM proteins in cartilage. They bind to several collagens and have been reported to have effect on various cellular functions, e.g. due to their ability to bind numerous cell surface receptors and growth factors, and in later years they have also been associated with OA pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The group of SLRPs includes 18 members [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], of which 8 were included in this analysis. Asporin, at the protein level, was first described by Lorenzo et al. in 2001 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and has been reported to be able to inhibit TGFÃŸ-mediated chondrogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this study, asporin was found to be more abundant in meniscus than in articular cartilage, both in the DDA and DIA analysis with meniscus to articular cartilage ratios of 10.79 and 9.40 respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A previous study also reported an enrichment of asporin in the meniscus compared to articular cartilage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Two other members of the SLRP family that exhibited similar trends as asporin in this study was decorin and biglycan, of which both were among the top 10 proteins in both articular cartilage and meniscus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Both proteins had a higher intensity in meniscus, however this was not statistically significant.

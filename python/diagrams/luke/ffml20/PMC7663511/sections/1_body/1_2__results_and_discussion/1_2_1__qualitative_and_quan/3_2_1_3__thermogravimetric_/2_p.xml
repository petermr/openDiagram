<p>The shape of TGA curves for pristine MWCNs and modified MWCNTs is typical. The minor weight loss (less than 0.5%) observed for all measured samples below 150 °C is interpreted as a result of the evaporation of the physisorbed water or gases. The descending tendency of the TGA thermal curve observed in the temperature range 120–500 °C is probably due to the decomposition of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the mass loss within this temperature range is observed for acid-treated MWCNTs with groups generated during functionalization (

 <xref rid="ijms-21-08230-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) indicated the presence of functional groups on the pristine CNTs. That is why it can be assumed that the number of −COOH and −OH groups in the unmodified CNTs is marginal as the mass loss is almost undetectable. The rapid mass loss in the range of 700–800 °C reflects mainly the thermooxidation of MWCNs. As follows from the curves, the onset of significant mass change is initiated at different temperatures for the modified and pristine MWCNTs. The shift of mass loss toward lower temperatures for acid-treated MWCNTs confirms that the chemical modification weakened the thermal stability of MWCNTs, probably from the oxidative effects of nitric acid used. The TGA curves obtained for pure DOX under oxidizing and non-oxidizing atmosphere showed a mass loss within temperature range 240–680 °C and 240–800 °C, respectively. The first well visible mass loss (27.5%), which starts in both cases at ~224 °C, can be attributed to defragmentation and melting, which were confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) calorimetry (

 </sup>, we proved the transcriptomic integration of hetero-cellular tissues by which each cell phenotype adjusts its transcriptome to optimize the intercellular communication and tissue physiology. However, in this study, we were particularly interested in genes expressed exclusively by the cardiomyocytes such as those encoding subunits of cardiac-specific voltage-dependent ICTs. Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> lists the expression ratios between right and left ventricle (RV/LV) and between right and left atria (RA/LA) for 12 genes encoding subunits of cardiac-specific ICTs.

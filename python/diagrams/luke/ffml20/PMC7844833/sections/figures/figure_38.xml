  <p>(a) Effective thicknesses of the oxide layers on Ir (blue) and Ru (red) thin films, estimated from a linear combination fitting of 
   <italic>operando</italic> Ir L
   <sub>3</sub>-edge and Ru K-edge XANES data. Representative spectra are shown in the insets. The data are reproduced with permission from ref (

   <italic>operando</italic> EXAFS data at the Ir L
   <sub>3</sub>-edge for bulk-like IrO
   <sub>

   </sub> catalyst (IrO
   <sub>2</sub>-30) NPs and for dispersed catalysts with NP size ∼1.7 nm (IrO
   <sub>2</sub>-150). The number in the sample names refers to an approximate surface area of the catalyst (30 m
   <sup>2</sup>/g and 150 m
   <sup>2</sup>/g). Reproduced with permission from ref (

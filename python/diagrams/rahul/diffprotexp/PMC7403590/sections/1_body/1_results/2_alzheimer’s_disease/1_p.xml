<p id="Par28">In AD cellular model studies we previously showed that dysfunctional mitochondria leading to alteration in PTMs modification, impacts microtubules assembly with a concomitant compromise of mitophagy and lysosomal activation,which increases Aβ production leading to hippocampal and cortical degeneration

 </sup>. In human AD brain samples, Braak stage III–IV, analysed in this study, we observed a decrease in acetylated-tubulin and acetylated-tau levels, in accordance to an increase in phospho-Tau levels in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Indeed, the expected alteration of microtubule assembly in AD-relevant brain areas may be responsible for the alteration observed in autophagic-lysosomal pathway. We observed an increase in LC3II and p62 levels in the cortex and hippocampus, a decrease in Beclin1 and CatD levels in the cortex and a decrease in Lamp1 levels in both areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). As expected, we found Aβ buildup in AD cortical and hippocampal samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Remarkably, we also observed SNCA oligomerization in SNpc. ER stress has also been reported in AD

 </sup>. However, we did not detect significant differences in the ER markers. Nonetheless, we observe a tendency to ATF4 and GRP78 increase in the cortex and in the hippocampus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). No differences were found for synaptic markers in AD samples (Fig.

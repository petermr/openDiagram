<p id="Par13">Packets with different extension directions occur within the prior austenite grains, and the blocks within the same packets were approximately parallel (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). A quenching rate of 4.4 °C/min yields a granular bainite structure composed of a bainitie ferrite matrix and islands of martensite and austenite (M-A island; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d,f</xref>). This microstructure consists of two types of M-A islands (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), namely: elongated islands distributed in the bainitic ferrite matrix, and blocky islands located primarily at the interface between the matrix and the prior austenite grain boundaries. The martensite within the M-A islands consists of extremely fine twins

 </sup>. Moreover, the island is harder than the ferrite matrix, and facilitating debonding, cracking, and crack initiation, can lead to a decrease in the toughness of the steel

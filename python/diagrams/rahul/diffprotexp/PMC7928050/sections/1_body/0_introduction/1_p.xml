<p>Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SWAT) has been shown to be an important player in the development of the metabolic syndrome, as it is a highly active metabolic tissue and is involved in inflammatory processes [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its different cell components such as adipocytes, preadipocytes, macrophages, and other cells summarized as the stromal vascular fraction [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], act together as an endocrine organ with a huge inflammatory capacity [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Adipocytes and preadipocytes express themselves mRNA of many cytokines and chemokines and are therefore not only able to interfere in inflammation, via interaction and activation of the adipose tissue macrophages [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but can also directly act as inflammatory tissue[

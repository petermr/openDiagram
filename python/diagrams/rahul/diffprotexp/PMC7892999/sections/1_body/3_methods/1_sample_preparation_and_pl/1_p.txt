0: Total RNA was obtained independently from three biological replicates of phloem and xylem root samples of two  Daucus carota L genotypes: Nightbird, a purple root hybrid (purple phloem and xylem) and Musica, a non-anthocyanin pigmentated root hybrid.
1: Plants were germinated from seeds and roots were collected after 12 weeks.
2: Frozen samples were grinded using liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and purified using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega).
3: RNA samples were quantified, and purity measured using a spectrophotometer (AmpliQuant AQ-07).
4: RNA integrity and potential genomic DNA contaminations were checked through agarose gel electrophoresis.

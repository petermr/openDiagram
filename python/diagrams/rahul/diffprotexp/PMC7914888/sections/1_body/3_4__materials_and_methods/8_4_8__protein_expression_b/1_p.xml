<p>B16F1 cells were washed with sterile PBS and mechanically lysed in the presence of RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1mM phenyl-methyl sulfonyl-fluoride (PMFS) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a protease inhibitor. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000×

The supernatant and the protein concentration were quantified using a calibration curve constructed with bovine serum albumin and bicinchoninic acid (Pierce ™ BCA Protein Assay Kitt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. A total of 30 µg of protein quantified per sample was removed by 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The obtained gels were electro-transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore-Merck) using the Novex
 <sup>®</sup> semi-dry system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. For immuno-detection, the non-specific sites of the PVDF membrane were blocked with a 1% (

Subsequently, the incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody marked with horseradish peroxidase-HRP (VECTOR, Burlingame, CA, USA): anti-goat made in a horse (PI-9500) and anti-rabbit made in goat (P1-1000). As load control, we used the detection of the nuclear protein Lamina B1 (sc-6216) (Santa Cruz). Finally, the detection was completed by chemiluminescence using ECL-western blotting system (Amersham, Boston, MA, USA) and densitometric analysis in Fiji-ImageJ (

  <p>Probing the p53β interactome by the GFP-TRAP system and p53 BioID. Left: Validation of hits from the GFP-TRAP system performed in SY5Y-inducible cell lines (left panels) and from p53 BioID system in MCF7 cells (right panels). Right: Bar graph shows a summary of the number of proteins identified in the GFP-TRAP and BioID systems. Blue: the number of proteins that bind ≥2 fold more to p53β than to FLp53; green: the number of proteins that bind ≥2 fold less to p53β than to FLp53; and grey: the number of proteins in between.</p>

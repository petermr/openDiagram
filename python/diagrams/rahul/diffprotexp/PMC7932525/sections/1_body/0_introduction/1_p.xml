<p>Cyanobacteria evolved approximately 3.5 billion years ago. As the first photosynthetic prokaryotes on earth, cyanobacteria can efficiently fix atmospheric nitrogen via a process catalyzed by nitrogenase [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nitrogenase-catalyzed substrate reduction requires the association of an iron (Fe) protein and molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein, with electron transfer occurring from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. However, nitrogenase responsible for the reduction of N
 <sub>2</sub> is extremely sensitive to O
 <sub>2</sub> [

 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. How to avoid oxygen released during photosynthesis by nitrogenase has attracted much attention. Cyanobacteria need to segregate the timing of nitrogen fixation from oxygenic photosynthesis by restricting nitrogen fixation to the dark period of diel cycles or spatially separate these processes by restricting nitrogen fixation to heterocysts [

 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Under nitrogen-deprivation conditions, heterocysts differentiate from vegetative cells only in the filaments of cyanobacteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is well-known that vegetative cells perform photosynthetic functions, whereas heterocysts perform nitrogen fixation functions in cyanobacteria. However, whether both cell types perform photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation simultaneously remains unclear.

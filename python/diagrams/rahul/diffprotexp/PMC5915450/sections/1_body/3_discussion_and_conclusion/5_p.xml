<p id="Par30">Other molecular mechanisms have been identified or suggested to be the cause of ERYâ€™s differential impact, such as the perturbed conformation of A76 in the P-site, which can lead to a decrease in translation rate

 </sup>. However, the mechanism we have identified is not mutually exclusive with these other mechanisms. The delay of nascent peptide movement past ERY, which our results suggest occurs, could change the PTC configuration due to a pile up of residues near the PTC.

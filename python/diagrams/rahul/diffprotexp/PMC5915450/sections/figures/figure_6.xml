  <p>Average interaction force experienced by nascent chain atoms with ERY and the ribosome when we turned on non-bonded parameters one by one residue. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Average non-bonded interaction force, per nascent chain atom, between the nascent chain and Erythromycin. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Average non-bonded interaction force, per nascent chain atom, between the nascent chains and the ribosome. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Line is to guide the eye and does not represent a model. Note well, the individual trajectory force traces were first aligned such that 
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>max</sub> occurs at time equal to zero, and then the average across trajectories was calculated.

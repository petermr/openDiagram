<p>The test microbes were taken from the broth culture with an inoculating loop and transferred to the test tubes containing 5.0 mL sterile distilled water. The microbial suspension turbidity was adjusted to McFarland standard number 0.5, in Mueller Hinton Broth (Himedia, India). A cotton swab was then used to inoculate the test tube suspension onto the surface of the Mueller Hinton agar plates and the plates were allowed to dry. The agar was allowed to set and harden. Holes were made by using a sterile cork borer from each petri-plate to ensure proper distribution of holes (cups) in the periphery and one in the centre. Agar plugs were removed. Different cork borers were used for different test organisms. Two standard discs (6 mm in diameter) were transferred onto the agar surface by using sterile forceps. Each hole was impregnated with 40 μL of a sample solution containing 400, 600 and 800 μg sample. This was done also for methanol (negative control) as a blank. These plates were kept for half an hour at a low temperature so that the test materials were diffused to the surrounding medium by this time. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. The diameter of the inhibition zone against each microorganism was measured by slide calipers and compared the results with standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin (5 μg/disc) and tetracycline (30 μg/disc) (positive control).</p>

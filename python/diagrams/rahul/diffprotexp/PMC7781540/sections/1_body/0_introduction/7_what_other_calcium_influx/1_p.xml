<p>While K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockade clearly reduced ATP-induced calcium influx through P2X4 receptors [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and thus constitutes an important regulator of this calcium influx pathway in microglia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>), this clearly is not the only K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 or ATP dependent calcium signaling process in microglia. In addition to P2X receptor channels microglia also express metabotropic P2Y purinergic receptors which following activation by ATP or UTP can induce calcium release from internal stores [
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and activate store-operated Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) following depletion of the relatively small intracellular calcium stores in microglia [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It therefore is certainly possible that additional SOCE contributed to the ATP induced Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> signals we had imaged and that some of the K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blocker effects were mediated by additionally reducing SOCE. This is a very likely hypothesis, since the “classical” molecular mechanism for K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers in T cells is reduction of SOCE through CRAC channels following T cell receptor activation and subsequently reduced transcription factor activation and cytokine production and release [

 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Rat and mouse microglia have been repeatedly reported to exhibit currents with biophysical properties typical for CRAC currents [
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and to express the molecular components of CRAC channels, Orai and STIM [
 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. There further is evidence that genetic deletion of Orai1, STIM1, and STIM2 reduces CRAC current and/or SOCE and inhibits migration and phagocytosis in cultured mouse microglia [
 <xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], while the small molecule CRAC channel blocker CM-EX-137 has recently been reported to decrease microglia activation and lesion size in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury [
 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

 <sub>3</sub>H or COOH groups corresponding to a 0.01 equivalent compared to carbon is then added to the mixture. The mixture is vigorously stirred until the amine is completely dissolved. Thereafter, a 0.03 equivalent of sodium nitrite compared to carbon is added to the mixture to generate the corresponding aryl diazonium ions (N

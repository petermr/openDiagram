<p>Alloying of Pt with another metal (e.g., Sn or Rh) is a common route to enhance the activity of catalysts for alcohol electrooxidation, especially for ethanol oxidation, which requires breaking a strong C–C bond. The actual local composition of these bimetallic catalysts, the oxidation state of each of the constituent metals, and their respective roles in the catalytic processes, however, remain controversial, and insight from XAS is instrumental to gain fundamental understanding. For example, XAS studies have been employed to address the controversial role of SnO

 </sup> Alloying of Pt with another metal can help also to reduce Pt poisoning by CO species. Pt–Mo and Pt–Ru catalysts have been actively investigated for this purpose.

 </sup> XAS investigations revealed important difference between these catalysts: while the formation of a Pt–Ru alloy is often observed,

 </sup> In addition to composition and oxidation effects, strain effects in these catalysts due to lattice mismatch can also be important to explain the electronic properties and activity of these catalysts, and can be probed by EXAFS analysis.

   </sup>. The hippocampus is broadly segmented into three subfields: CA1 (purple), CA3 (green), and DG (orange, unlabeled). Computational methods were applied to generate multi-dimensional profiles of each transcriptome, including gene expression (GE), exon sequence alternative splicing (AS), intron retention (IR), and alternative polyadenylation (APA).

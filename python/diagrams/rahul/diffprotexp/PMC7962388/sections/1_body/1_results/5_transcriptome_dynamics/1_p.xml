 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref> (S1 and S2 for sense and antisense transcripts, respectively). The advantage of counting with samples representing different developmental stages allowed us to perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of transcripts with similar expression patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Normalized counts were used to execute a hierarchical clustering using a simple euclidean distance metric and a complete linkage method, to find some structure in our transcript expression trends and consequently partition our transcripts into different groups. To enable the analysis, subsets of transcripts were used, corresponding to: 1) all DETs and DEATs; 2) transcripts that were differentially expressed at all the developmental stages (common DETs and DEATs). 3) stage-specific DETs and DEATs (premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis and anthesis). The number of transcripts within each cluster is displayed in Table

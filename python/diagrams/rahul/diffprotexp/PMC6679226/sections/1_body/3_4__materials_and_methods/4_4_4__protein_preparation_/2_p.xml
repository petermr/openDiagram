<p>An equal amount of each TMT-labelled sample was pooled together in a single tube and SepPak purified (Waters Chromatography, Dublin, Ireland) using acidic reverse phase conditions. After drying to completion, an off-line fractionation step was employed to reduce the complexity of the sample. The sample was brought up in 260 μL of 10 mM ammonium hydroxide, pH 10. This mixture was subjected to basic pH reverse phase chromatography (Dionex U3000, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Briefly, UV monitored at 215 nm for an injection of 100 μL at 0.1 mL/min with a gradient developed from 10 mM ammonium hydroxide, pH 10 to 100% acetonitrile (ACN, pH 10) over 90 min. A total of 48 fractions (200 μL each) were collected in a 96-well microplate and recombined in a checkerboard fashion to create 12 “super fractions” (original fractions 1, 13, 25, and 37 became new super fraction #1, original fractions 2, 14, 26, and 38 became new super fraction # 2, and so on.).</p>

<p>Progenesis SameSpot software (Totallab) initially identified 518 dys-regulated spots in the gel images of the extracted protein from the stationary phase compared to that of the exponential growth phase. Initial analysis of these spots was carried out, as appeared in the chart in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Filtering was done to eliminate biased false positives spots produced from staining artifacts. Filter 1 (F1) was based on the spot volume intensity to keep spots significantly different by ≥2 fold. Filter 2 (F2) was according to the ANOVA to select the spots significantly different between the two-phase gels (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Filter 3 (F3) was a manual one to remove all the din spots. The overlapping differentiation using the former filtering criteria among the gels of the two phases resulted in the final identification of 12 differentially significant spots with over two-fold difference between the two phases of growth (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). As the results, the 12 selected spots are shown and marked by circles in a representative gel image for the proteins of the stationary growth phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00305-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These significantly different spots were then selected and excised from the gel for mass spectrometric identification.

<p>The procedures in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of New Mexico. All animals were housed in a well-ventilated rodent housing room (maintained at 20–22°C) with a reversed 10/14 h dark/light cycle so that testing could be performed in their active period. All animals were housed for 1 week before the experiments. All animals had access to food and water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> throughout the duration of the experiment. Low soybean content normal chow diet was provided. All surgeries were completed in a sterile environment under a surgical microscope in mice anesthetized with isoflurane (2–5%). The FRICT-ION model was induced as previously described [

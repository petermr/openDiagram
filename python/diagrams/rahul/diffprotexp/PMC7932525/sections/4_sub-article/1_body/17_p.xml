<p>� The sentences you mentioned haven been changed. “Cyanobacteria evolved approximately 3.5 billion years ago. As the first photosynthetic prokaryotes on earth, cyanobacteria can efficiently fix atmospheric nitrogen via a process catalyzed by nitrogenase [1]. Nitrogenase-catalyzed substrate reduction requires the association of an iron (Fe) protein and molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein, with electron transfer occurring from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. However, nitrogenase responsible for the reduction of N2 is extremely sensitive to O2 [2-5].” See line 39-44</p>

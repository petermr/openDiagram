<p>In order to determine whether Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 protein levels were increased in TG of FRICT-ION mice compared to control naïve mice, we performed a Western blot analysis of Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 protein levels from whole TG lysates (n = 3 mice per group; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2a</xref>). We found that signal intensity for Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 was almost absent in naïve mice and was strongly present in FRICT-ION mice treated with the TAT-C3D control peptide at the time of peak effect (4 hr). We also noticed that Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 signal intensity in TG of TAT-C3P-injected mice appeared lower than in control TAT-C3D-injected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2a</xref>). Finally, to again compare males and females, we calculated the fold change of normalized intensity (compared to actin) of Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 signal intensity for TAT-C3P-injected mice to TAT-C3D-injected mice between male and female FRICT-ION mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b</xref>). We found a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05, t-test) between the fold-changes with female mice versus a smaller fold-change in male mice indicating that TAT-C3P is more effective in reducing Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 expression in female than in male mice.

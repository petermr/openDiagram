<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Results (inhibition %) were expressed as mean &#177; standard deviation (S.D.) of three independent experiments in triplicate (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and as concentration inhibiting 50% of the initial activity (IC<sub>50</sub>). Data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance of the difference from the respective controls for each experimental test condition was assayed by using Tukey&#8217;s test for each paired experiment. Statistical significance was considered at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated by Graphpad Prism software (version 5.0, GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).</p>

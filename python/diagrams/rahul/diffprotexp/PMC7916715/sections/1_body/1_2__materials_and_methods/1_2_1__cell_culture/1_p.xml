<p>LNCaP cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI1640 with supplementation of 10% FBS (Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Burlington, ON, Canada). The cell line was authenticated (Cell Line Authentication Service, ATCC), and routinely checked for Mycoplasma contamination (a PCR kit from Abm, Cat#: G238). LNCaP empty vector (EV) and CNTN1 stable lines were constructed using retrovirus following our established conditions [

 <xref rid="B36-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,

 <xref rid="B38-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Briefly, a gag-pol, an envelope (VSV-G; Stratagene), and a designed retroviral vector (EV or CNTN1) were transiently co-transfected into HEK293T cells at the ratio 1:1:1. At 48 h post transfection, the virus-containing medium was filtered (0.45 µm filter) and centrifuged (50,000×

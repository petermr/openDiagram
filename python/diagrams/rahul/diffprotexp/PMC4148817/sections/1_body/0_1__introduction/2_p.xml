<p>One family of widely used nanomaterials is carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs are hollow carbon tubes made of a single or several concentrically arranged cylindrical graphite layers capped by fullerenic hemispheres, which are referred to as single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT, MWCNT). In addition to many industrial applications, they can be used as scaffolds for cell culture [

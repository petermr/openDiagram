0: About 100  mg of Sino-nasal tissue was homogenized for extraction of total RNA by ultrasonic homogenizer (Sonics-Vibracell, Sonics & Materials Inc., Newtown, USA) in 1  ml TRIzol reagent (Amresco, Solon, USA).
1: The entire RNA concentration was determined at A260 nm and the purity was calculated according to the ratio A260/A280.
2: Samples have a purity  1.7 was used for qRT-PCR using GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as a reference housekeeping gene for determination of the relative expression of IL-1, TGF-, and TNF-.

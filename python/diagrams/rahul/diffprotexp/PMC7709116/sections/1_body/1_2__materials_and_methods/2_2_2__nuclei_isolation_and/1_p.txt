0: Nuclear fractionation was carried out as described [ 18] with some modifications.
1: Briefly, individual striata from each mouse were minced 100 times vertically and horizontally on a glass plate and briefly fixed with 4% (wt./vol) paraformaldehyde for 5 min on ice.
2: The cross-linked tissues from two mice were pooled together and then homogenized in 500 L of cold homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM tricine pH 8, 100 mM NH 4Cl, 1 M DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (cOmpleteTM, Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA), phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PhosSTOP; MilliporeSigma)) by using 10 strokes with a loose pestle followed by 10 strokes with a tight pestle in a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer.
3: The homogenate was centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at 2000  g for 5 min at 4 C and the supernatant was discarded.
4: After the pellet was resuspended with 1 mL of density medium (25% iodixanol (OptiPrep; Axis-Shield), 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM tricine-KOH pH 8), it was then overlaid on top of 200 L of a 29% ( v/ v) iodixanol cushion.
5: The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 13,500  g for 30 min at 4 C in a swinging bucket rotor (Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge; TLS55 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
6: After ultracentrifugation, the top lipid layer was removed with a pipette tip and then approximately 800 L of the gradient medium was also removed and discarded.
7: The nuclear pellet was washed three times with 1 mL of resuspension buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 20 mM tricine-KOH pH 7.8) in a siliconized Eppendorf tube by using tabletop centrifugation at 2000  g for 5 min at 4 C.

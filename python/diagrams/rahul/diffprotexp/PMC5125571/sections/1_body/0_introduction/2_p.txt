0: The immune system of a snail consists of both humoral and cellular arms.
1: The hemolymph, composed of plasma and hemocytes, not only serves as a source of metabolites and nutrients for parasite development, but also plays a key role in the snails response to infections [ 12 15].
2: While plasma contains numerous proteins, which may act to directly eliminate pathogens, the hemocytes represent the main immune effectors, playing a major role in the recognition and killing of invading pathogens by different methods such as phagocytosis, encapsulation, and cytotoxic reactions [ 16 18].
3: The processes involved in the snail defense mechanisms have been extensively studied in  Biomphalaria spp.
4: snails [ 19 22].
5: For instance, infections with the trematode  Schistosoma mansoni have been shown to alter the protein levels in both the hemolymph and body of the snail [ 23 25].
6: Several proteins whose concentrations change in hemolymph have been identified [ 26 29].
7: Different lectins such as selectin, galectin, C-type lectin, and fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) were over-expressed after infection and are considered to play an important role in pathogen recognition mechanisms capable of agglutination and binding to intruders [ 26,  30 34].
8: In addition, aldolase and myosin have been identified as proteins that regulate hemocyte migration and can be implicated in pathogen killing by a cytotoxic reaction and phagocytosis [ 28,  29].
9: Recent studies on  B.  siamensis goniomphalos have used different omics approaches to study the alterations that occur within defined snail tissues after  O.  viverrini infection, such as body and head-foot [ 29,  35 37], including high-throughput sequencing technologies and protein expression analysis, however molecular changes of the immune effectors of  B.  siamensis goniomphalos have yet to be analysed.

0: In banana ( Musa spp.)
1: production, plant architecture offers unique horticultural practices including, flower removal, bunch management, controlling pests and diseases, etc.
2: High banana pseudostem is easily broken in a typhoon and needs additional input cost for propping.
3: Productivity optimization could be achieved by manipulating banana plant height.
4: Semi-dwarf banana cultivars show good resistance to damages caused by heavy wind and rain [ 1].
5: Furthermore, the yield gain associated with shorter stems is also linked to an increased harvest index [ 2].
6: In spite of the basic and strategic importance of semi-dwarf stem, the progress on genetic manipulation of banana plant height has been comparatively limited, partially because the ontogenesis of the pseudostem is not as easily characterized as for other organs, and its external morphological complexity is not so attractive as compared to leaves, roots, and flowers [ 3].

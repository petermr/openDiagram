0: The B16F1 tumor cell line: (ATCC  CRL-6322TM, Manassas, VA, USA), with epithelial morphology and adherent growth, from C57BL/6J mouse skin, was cultivated at 37 C with 5% CO 2 and 98% humidity (Precision Scientific NAPCO 5410-120 Water Jacketed CO 2 Incubator, Buffalo, NY, USA) in DMEM advance (Dulbeccos modification of Eagles medium) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MS, USA) supplemented with 10% ( v/ v) fetal bovine serum (SFB) (Gibco), pH 7.27.4 condition, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL).
1: The cells, at 70% confluence, treated with trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 0.25% ( m/ v), resuspended and counted in automatic TaliTM Image-based Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturers specifications and their viability evaluated in Newbauers Chamber in dilution 1:1 with Trypan Blue (Sigma-Aldrich).

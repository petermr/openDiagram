<p>Appearance, pH and viscosity of different nanoemulsion formulations are displayed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The resulting nanoemulsions were homogenous in appearance and did not display any indications for drug precipitation or phase separation. F1, F2 and F3 showed less cloudy appearance while F4, F5, F6 and F7 were cloudy. Viscosity of different nanoemulsion formulations ranged from 73.3
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>3.7 (F2) to 203
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>3.1 (F7). F6 and F7 had viscosity values that were significantly greater than those of the other formulations with no significant differences between their values (

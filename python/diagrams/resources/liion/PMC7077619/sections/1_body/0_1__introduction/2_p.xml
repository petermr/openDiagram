<p>Herein, an attempt has been made to synthesize high ionic conducting composite membrane using organic/inorganic components. PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membrane has been prepared via the phase inversion method with various ratios. The major objective of this work is to systematically study the performance of PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membranes with Na-ion kinetics. The ionic conductivity of prepared membranes has been optimized, and then the optimized membrane has been compared with the commercially available separator membranes, and all other studies were carried out successfully with appropriate interpretation.

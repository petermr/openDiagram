<p id="Par26">In this study, we identified 104 genes differentially expressed in Gp and Gd cells from F5 follicles (designated as “G5p” and “G5d” cells), and 249 genes differentially expressed in Gp and Gd cells in the largest F1 preovulatory follicle (designated as “G1p” and “G1d” cells). This finding suggests a potential tendency of a higher differential expression in genes in Gp and Gd cells in follicles at a later developmental stage. This hypothesis was further supported by the GO analyses. In F5 follicles, G5p and G5d showed no statistical difference among the GO terms identified, whereas in F1 follicles, G1p and G1d subpopulations differ in each GO term with statistical significance. KEGG analysis further revealed that the genes with relatively higher expression levels in G1p cells are enriched in cell cycle and DNA replication, while the genes with higher mRNA levels in G1d cells are enriched in steroid biosynthesis.</p>

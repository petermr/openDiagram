 <caption> MKK3/P38 signaling axis is epigenetically reinforced through methylation events in critical regulatory regions. a p38 expression (WB) shown between CNFs and PNFs. P38 expression strongly correlates with b promoter methylation in MAPK14 (beta-values shown; p = 0.038; = − 0.6). c, d Phospho-p38 expression and phospho-ERK expression are demonstrated by western blot ( c) and were significantly correlated ( d) ( p = 0.006; = 0.70) </caption>

<p id="Par42">Although only two unique antisense peptides were identified in this study, antisense transcripts have previously been shown to be incorporated into chromatin and consequently activate the virulence factor in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the 
 <italic>var</italic> gene family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is, therefore, worth investigating further the regulatory roles of the antisense transcripts on their parent transcripts. The corresponding reference genes of the 41 antisense transcripts were first extracted and the transcript abundances in TPM (Transcripts Per Million) of both sense and antisense transcripts were calculated, and finally compared the TPM values using Pearson correlation. As a result, five antisense transcripts were shown to have significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05) with the sense reference transcripts (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), where three of them have positive correlation that suggests an activation mechanism. Interestingly, regardless of the transcript correlation, all reference genes with associated antisense transcripts are significantly downregulated at transcript level in salivary gland sporozoites. Especially for the two antisense transcripts that showed anticorrelated expression, one of the parent gene has both downregulated mRNA and protein expression, while the other is downregulated at mRNA level but upregulated at protein level. Notably, the MSTRG.401.1 transcript also has translational evidence, suggesting that the regulation by antisense transcripts could be mediated by their translational product. Overall, the actions of antisense transcripts observed are not uniform where they could potentially regulate the expression of their target genes not just by activation but also by repression, which has been well-established in mammalian genomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. However, since the transcript level of the parent reference genes do not correlate well with protein expression, further experimental evidence is required to confirm the roles of these antisense transcripts.

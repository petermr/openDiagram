<p>Cyclic voltammetry was performed to investigate the electrochemical kinetics of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C cathode materials. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows the CV spectra of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites. In the first scan, there is a pair of redox peaks corresponding to the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> couple (Ding et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The shapes of redox peaks are low and asymmetrical; this is because, in the first charging and discharging cycle, active materials are not completely saturated by electrolyte, and the pathways of lithium ion insertion and extraction were not completely formed. In the second scan, the current intensity increases, and the shape of the redox peaks becomes more symmetrical and sharper. For LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene, the potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks decreases from 0.27 to 0.26 V, which means that the phase is stabilized in subsequent cycles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the CV spectra of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites. During the second scan, the potential difference increases from 0.31 to 0.33 V, which proves that detrimental polarization becomes more and more serious. The results show that LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites have very high reversibility and better electrochemical activity.

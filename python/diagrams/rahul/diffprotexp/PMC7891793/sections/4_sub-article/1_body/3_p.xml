<p>Thank you for this comment. We have reduced the redundancy in the discussion section and have retained only those comments required to facilitate the discussion. We have also altered the discussion and included some comparisons with the only other published paper examining the transcriptome of the lung in BRSV infected cattle. This comparison highlights some of the most important findings and helps to demonstrate the effects of treatments. These new additions are presented in lines 559-571 and 752-755.</p>

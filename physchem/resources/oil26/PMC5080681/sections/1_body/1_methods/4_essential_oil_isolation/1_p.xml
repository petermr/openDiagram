In this method, the volatile oil was extracted using a microwave oven with ultra-sonication. However, during the extraction process, the powder suspension being extracted was exposed to ultrasonic waves to improve the extraction process. In this study, the apparatus consisting of a microwave oven combined with an ultrasonic extractor was used (Ultrasonic-microwave Cooperative Extractor/Reactor (CW-2000, China)). A one L round bottom flask containing about 100&#160;g of the plant was placed in this apparatus. In this flask, the plant was suspended in about 500&#160;ml deionized water. Then, the flask was connected with Clevenger apparatus, which was placed in the same apparatus. While carrying out the extraction process, the power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000&#160;W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was adjusted at its maximum power as well (50&#160;W and at a frequency of 40&#160;kHz). The extraction process using this apparatus was conducted for 10&#160;min at 100&#160;&#176;C. This process was repeated three times. The obtained volatile oil was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried and stored in well closed dark amber colored bottles in the refrigerator at &#8722;4&#160;&#176;C. The yield of this extraction method was 1.4&#160;% w/w based on the fresh weight.</p>

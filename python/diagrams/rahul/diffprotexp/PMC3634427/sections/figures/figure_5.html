 <caption> Distribution of identified proteins differentially expressed under the different stress conditions studied. The numbers represent the number of identified proteins that significantly change in abundance in S. commersonii ( left) and S. tuberosum cv. Désirée ( right); between brackets are represented the number of proteins that are significantly increased (↑) or decreased (↓) in abundance. Classification of proteins was done based on the GO annotation from Goanna [ 33]. </caption>

  <p>Western blot analysis of proteins predicted as exclusively expressed on P3. Equal amounts of protein lysate from P3 and P30 were loaded onto a gel. All proteins showed expression on P3 and not on P30, except Parvin, which was expressed as a faint peptide species of ~ 50 kDa on P30. The panels show exclusive expression of Dbn1 (100 &amp; 120 kDa), Parvin (42 kDa), Tmed10 (21 kDa), and SPARC (43 kDa) on P3. β-actin was used as a loading control</p>

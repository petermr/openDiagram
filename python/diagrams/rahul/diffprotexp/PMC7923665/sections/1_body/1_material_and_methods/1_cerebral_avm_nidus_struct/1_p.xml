<p id="Par17">The cerebral AVM nidus structures were collected from the patients who underwent resection of AVM at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) between 2015 and 2017. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committees of both SCTIMST and Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB). The control tissues consisted of vascular brain tissue from epileptic patients who had corrective surgery. Both AVM tissues and control tissues were stored immediately after resection in RNA later solution (Invitrogen, Cat No: AM7021). The transcriptome sequencing analysis was done in three independent cerebral AVM nidus and three control tissue samples, and validation studies were done using 10 AVM and 10 control tissue samples. For immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses, tissues were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).</p>

0: PD is one modality of the renal replacement therapy and is adopted increasingly all over the world due to more stable hemodynamic and biochemistry level and less cost than hemodialysis.
1: End-stage renal disease due to DM is not contraindicated for peritoneal dialysis.
2: DM and chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) are the most common etiologies of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis [ 1].
3: In this proteomic study, we assembled a list of proteins observed in peritoneal dialysates from DM and CGN patients.
4: To enhance our understanding of the DM proteome, the peritoneal dialysate proteins were identified by 2DE and nano-ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) followed by peptide fragmentation patterning.
5: This study is designed to establish an optimal technique for a proteomic map of DM proteins.
6: The database provides not only analysis of PD proteins from DM patients but also suggests potential diagnostic protein biomarkers for further investigation.

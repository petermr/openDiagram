<p id="Par40">We then analyzed the pathways in which the differential genes or metabolites were involved, the common pathways which showed the most enriched differential genes and metabolites, were retinol metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. For retinol metabolism, retinol, 9-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinol metabolites were higher in the Group X, consistently the

 <italic>retinoldehydrogenase</italic>) gene expression was higher in the Group X, suggesting a better visual acuity in the mandarin fish which could be easy to accept artificial diets. Animals make food choices on the basis of the nutritional, physiological, environmental, and sociocultural factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], sensory system is of significance to food choices. It is critical for mandarin fish to catch prey fish though the perception of shape and motion with well-developed scotopic vision [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Because of the low visual acuity and feeding only by stalking, mandarin fish can not recognize the prey before the time when food pellet fall to the bottom of tank, thus makes it difficult to feed mandarin fish with artificial diets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The retinol metabolism dysfunction might be contributed to the lower visual ability in the mandarin fish which refused artificial diets.

<p>Material from an industrial extruded profile of EN AW-6005A was investigated. This alloy was chosen, because it possesses a critical cooling rate of about 6.3 K/s [

 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which can be achieved within the DSC device that was used. Pure aluminum (99.9995% Al) was used as the reference. The chemical composition is given in 
 <xref rid="t1-materials-07-02631" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The main alloying elements possess an atomic fraction of approximately 0.63% Mg and 0.65% Si. With respect to the quasi-binary composition of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si, the alloy 6005A therefore has an excess of Si.

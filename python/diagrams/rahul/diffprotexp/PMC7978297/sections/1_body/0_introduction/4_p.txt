0: The development of single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized the dissection of cellular heterogeneity and cell fate transition  36- 38.
1: From such studies, many novel insights have been proposed regarding reproductive system development, derived from single cell datasets in both males  39- 42 and females  43- 46.
2: Recently, the credo of a limited ovarian reserve has been reinforced by single-cell analysis of human ovarian cortical tissue, where no oogonial stem cells were detected  47.
3: In addition, the transcriptomic landscapes of germ cells during early murine oogenesis have been delineated, which concentrates on two vital germline events, meiotic initiation  43,  48 and PF assembly  49.
4: Furthermore, the respective waves of PF formation in the ovarian cortex and medulla disclose two distinct pathways for pre-granulosa cell differentiation  50.
5: To date, the effect of DEHP on PF assembly has not been thoroughly examined and deciphered.

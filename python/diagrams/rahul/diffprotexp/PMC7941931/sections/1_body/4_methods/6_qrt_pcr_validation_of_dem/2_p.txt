0: For differently expressed target genes, reverse transcription and qRT-PCR reactions were carried out by using PrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa, Beijing, China) and TB Green Premix Ex TaqTM (Tli RNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa, Beijing, China), respectively.
1: FtActin was used as the reference gene.
2: All samples were performed three independent biological replicates.
3: The relative expression level of each gene was calculated by using the 2 Ct method.
4: The primers used in this experiment are listed in Additional file  1: Table S12.

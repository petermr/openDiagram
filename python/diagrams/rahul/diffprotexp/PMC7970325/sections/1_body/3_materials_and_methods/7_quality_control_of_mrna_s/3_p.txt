0: Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering based on Euclidian distance in normalized counts (lg(RPM)) space did not reveal any outliers ( Figure 19 C, D).
1: In comparison with other FC and PC samples, three FC samples formed a distant cluster (TC2, TC4, TC124;  Figure 19C, circled).
2: These three cluster members had 150 differentially expressed genes with q-value<0.05 by Wilcoxon test (Supplementary File 9).
3: The gene contribution coefficients for the first two principal components are given in Supplementary File 9.

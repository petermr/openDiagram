<p id="Par13">Comparisons were made with previous studies where the same genes had been analyzed using semiquantitative RT-PCR, RT-qPCR or in situ hybridization (see supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref> online). These transcripts correspond to annotated genes Myc, Serum amyloid A, Mtf, WNT9, BMP, β-catenin and survivin, and all of them shared the fact that their expression in the early intestinal rudiment (1–3 dpe) had been compared to that of the normal mesentery

 </sup>. Our RNA-seq expression analysis for all these genes showed a similar expression pattern to their expression in prior studies. Thus, Myc, Serum amyloid A, Mtf, WNT9, BMP, were over-expressed while β-catenin and survivin showed no considerable difference between regenerating intestine and normal mesentery. To further validate our data, we selected 7 additional genes that were differentially expressed in our RNAseq and probed their expression using RT-qPCR. The analyzed upregulated genes were VBP, Wnt6, Sox4, TAP26 and Mortalin. On the other hand, downregulated genes included FoxA and Tenascin. The expression values were compared between the RNA-seq and RT-qPCR expression data. In all cases the data from both day 1 and 3 were used, with the exemption of Tenascin and Mortalin with only the day 3 values. The comparison showed a high correlation between both results with a square of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.91 (Fig.

<p>Molecular simulations were used to study the characteristics of free volumes including size distribution, three-dimensional arrangement, and connectivity. The distributions of void size in Kapton, 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f008">Figure 8</xref>a. Compared to Kapton, the 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI had fewer voids with radius bigger than 1.2 Å. The kinetic radii of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O are 1.73 Å and 1.325 Å, respectively, which are larger than 1.2 Å. This suggested that 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI had fewer voids available for the diffusion of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub>. In addition, 2,7-CPI possessed fewer voids with radius bigger than 0.8 Å in comparison with 2,7-CPPI, indicating the fewer number of large-size free volumes in 2,7-CPI.

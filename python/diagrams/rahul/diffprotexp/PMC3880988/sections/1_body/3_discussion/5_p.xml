<p>It needs to be reminded that although the present study has demonstrated some interesting results, certain limitations needs to be understood in order not to overstate the findings of the present study. In a study using animal as a reference of protein differences, it is worth noting that several protein differences may exist in other species, especially in human. It has been previously demonstrated that cartilage gene expressions and characteristics are species specific, and therefore may vary among the different species

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>. This is important when having to translate the findings clinically. Nevertheless, healthy human donor matched MSCs and ACs samples under a well-controlled environment are not usually available and therefore not feasible to be used in any laboratory study. However, in comparison to what is available today, the present study has its positive points as most studies of similar nature are limited to immortalized cell line such as C3H10T1/2, which many will agree by itself express aberrant proteins

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>. While the present study has suggested that any disruption in the cytoskeletal, metabolic enzymes, and biosynthesis proteins functions may be the cause for the ineffectiveness of cMSCs, this still needs to be proven in more specifically experimental designs.

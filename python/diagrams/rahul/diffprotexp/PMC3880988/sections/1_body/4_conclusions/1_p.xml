<p>In this study, distinct differences in the global protein expressions were identified between ACs, MSCs and cMSCs. Of these differentially expressed proteins, MYL6B, ALDOA, TAGLN2 and EF1-ALPHA were not as highly modulated during MSC chondrogenesis as compared to ACs. These differences may have been the contributing factors to the ineffectiveness of cMSCs in the cartilage repair. However, this needs to be demonstrated and supported by data obtained from more rigorously designed studies.</p>

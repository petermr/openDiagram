<p>These analyses indicated 400 putative target genes that were identified as regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs. For the evaluation of potential functional significance of these genes, a subsequent gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied with the use of three gene ontology catalogs: KEGG Pathways, Gene Ontology (GO) Molecular Function and GO Biological Processes. Four KEGG pathways were found as significantly enriched for the putative target genes, including “Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis” as the most significantly enriched (according to 
 <italic>p</italic>-value). The analysis with GO Molecular Function showed three protein ubiquitination related pathways as being in the top nine significantly enriched functions: Ubiquitin-like protein ligase activity (GO:0061659), Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630), and ubiquitin-protein transferase activity (GO:0004842). GO Biological process database indicates two processes related to the regulation of transcriptional activity and protein ubiquitination (GO:0016567) as the three most significantly enriched process (

 <xref rid="B24-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], GSE analyses were also performed separately for putative gene targets, the expression of which is positively or negatively correlated with DEMs. This showed no significant overrepresentation for genes with positive miRNA–mRNA correlation, while we observed a clear enrichment of protein ubiquitination-related pathways and processes for genes characterized by negative miRNA–mRNA correlation. The analysis with GO Biological process indicated a proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161), protein polyubiquitination (GO:0000209), and protein ubiquitination (GO:0016567), while GO Molecular Function showed ubiquitin-like protein ligase activity (GO:0061659), ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630), ubiquitin-protein transferase activity (GO:0004842), RNA binding (GO:0003723), and glucocorticoid receptor binding (GO:0035259) as significantly enriched (presented in

<p>To assess further the effect of the membrane composition, we have altered the membrane composition by including cholesterol (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>) with a DOPC/cholesterol ratio of 2:1. Here, results of the maximum force and the nonequilibrium work in the case of pulling velocity 
 <italic>v</italic> = 5 nm/ns and the CHARMM36 force-field as a function of the logBB and logPS experimental values are shown in

  <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>
 </xref>. The estimated 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values for the correlation are in very good agreement with the membrane cases without the cholesterol. Indeed, the addition of cholesterol does not affect the correlation. The results of

 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>neq</sub>, with the logBB and logPS experimental values is not affected by the membrane model, the absolute values of

 <sub>max</sub> (as a result also those of

 <sub>neq</sub>) have increased by a factor of two (an example of a forceâ€“time profile is shown in Figure S12 in the

Hence, we conclude that the presence of cholesterol induces a larger resistance to the compound. In other words, the permittivity of the membrane is significantly reduced in a proportional way without affecting the correlation between the experimental and the simulation predictions.

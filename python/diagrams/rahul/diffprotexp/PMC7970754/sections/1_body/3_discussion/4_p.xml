<p>Further animal experiments showed that compared to the control group, the final tumor volume and wet weight of the RSV and RSV + POLD1-OE groups were smaller. HE staining illustrated that the distribution of cancer cells was sparse, and the proportion of fiber components was observed to be significantly higher. Immunohistochemistry of the animal models showed that RSV could reduce the expression of PCNA and Ki-67 while increasing the expression of Cleaved-Caspase3. However, the POLD1 overexpression group antagonized these inhibitory or promoting effects. Ki-67 is a human nuclear antigen and forms an integral part of cell division in both normal and malignant tissue (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and the obtained results demonstrated that RSV can inhibit the growth of TNBC cells and promote necrosis in cancer cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> but was limited in the overexpression of POLD1. This suggested that the overexpression of POLD1 can antagonize the inhibitory effect of RSV on TNBC 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and serves as an important regulatory target of RSV in the treatment of TNBC.

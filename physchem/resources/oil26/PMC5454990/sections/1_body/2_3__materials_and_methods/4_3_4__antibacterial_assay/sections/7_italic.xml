<italic>v</italic> solution of the samples in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was placed in the top well of 96-well microtiter plates and 50 &#956;L of cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB) was added. The sample solutions were then serially diluted (1:1) by transferring 50 &#956;L of sample-CAMHB mixture to the next lane and adding 50 &#956;L fresh CAMHB to obtain a concentration range from 2500 to 12.5 &#956;g&#183;mL

Essential oils are complex mixture of natural compounds, mostly of plant origin, extremely volatile and with an intense odour. Even if they represent only a small fraction of the plant from which they are derived, they give the whole plant the characteristic of aromatic smell for which these plants are employed by drug, food and perfume industries (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The species that show the largest content of essential oils belong to many families as Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, Rutaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Magnoliaceae, Pinaceae and Cupressaceae (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>

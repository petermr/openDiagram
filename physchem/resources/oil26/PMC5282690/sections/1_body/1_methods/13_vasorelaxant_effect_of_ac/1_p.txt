0: The endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant pathway was studied as described by Monteiro et al.
1: [ 53].
2: Endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10 4 M;  n = 6), the NO scavenger, hydroxocobalamin (3.10 5 M;  n = 6), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10 5M;  n = 6), and the competitive cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (3.10 6 M;  n = 6) for 20 min prior the contraction with Phen (1 M), then, the cumulative concentrationresponse curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.

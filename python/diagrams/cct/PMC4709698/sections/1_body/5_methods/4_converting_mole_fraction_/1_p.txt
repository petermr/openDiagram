0: For convenience we accept that there is one mole atoms of BMGCs and the mole fraction of -Ti phase is  x.
1: The volume of -Ti and glassy matrix (BT0) are given by   and  , respectively, where   and   are the molar weight of BT100 and BT0 (listed in  Table 1), respectively.
2: and   are densities of single-crystal -Ti and BT0, respectively.
3: was obtained by the Archimedes method, and   was calculated using   and XRD measured volume size   of the unit cell of -Ti by  .
4: The relationship between  x and   is given by  , and then equation  (6) was obtained by substituting corresponding values.

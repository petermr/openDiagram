<p>RNA samples from 12 rats for miRNA-seq were further used to validate differential miRNAs identified by miRNA-seq. Unlike the polled RNA samples used in miRNA-seq, RT-qPCR was performed for 12 rats separately. The miRNAs expression was validated by poly (A)-tailed qPCR. Firstly, reverse transcription was carried out from 0.5 μg of the total RNA samples using miScript II RT Kit (Cat. # 218160, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with miScript HiFlex buffer, and then the synthesized cDNA was used as a template for qPCR reactions. qPCR reactions were performed using a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using an miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Cat. # 218073, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This system was reported as showing relatively high accuracy and high sensitivity among several quantification methods [

The following real-time PCR protocol was used: initial activation of HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (from miScript kit; 95 °C, 15 min); 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s) and extension (70 °C, 34 s); and melting curve analysis. The primers used for the target miRNA are designed by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation (China) and listed in

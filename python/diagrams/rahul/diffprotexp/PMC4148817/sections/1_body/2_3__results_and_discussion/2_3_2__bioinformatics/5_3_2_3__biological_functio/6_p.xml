<p>In the function of cell-to-cell signaling and interactions, intercellular junction impairment is suggested by the decreased expression of five proteins, agrin(AGRN), capping protein muscle Z-line beta (CAPZB), E-cadherin (CDH1), desmoplakin (DSP), and junction plakoglobin (JUP). These proteins are components of tight junctions or adhesion junctions and barrier function. The change in junctional integrity is consistent with our previous results that exposure to 100 ng/mL of either CNT decreased the barrier function of the epithelial monolayer [

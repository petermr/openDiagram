  <p>Kawasaki disease (KD) sera increased E-selectin level in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). 
   <bold>(A–C)</bold> HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from healthy controls (HCs; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6), KD without coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL–; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6), and KD with coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL+; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) for 4 h. The E-selectin mRNA levels were measured by qPCR (
   <bold>A</bold>, HC = 6, KD-CAL– = 6, KD-CAL+ = 6), and protein levels were measured by Western blot (
   <bold>B</bold>, HC = 6, KD-CAL– = 6, KD-CAL+ = 6). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Statistical analysis of immunoblots. 
   <bold>(D,E)</bold> HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from HCs (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6), KD-CAL– (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6), and KD-CAL+ (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) for 4 h; localization and expression of E-selectin (green) in HCAECs were measured by immunofluorescence. 
   <bold>(D,E)</bold> Statistical analysis of immunofluorescence. The bar graphs are mean ± SEM.

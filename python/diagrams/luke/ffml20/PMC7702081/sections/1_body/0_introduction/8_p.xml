<p>In this work, we present a novel approach to determine the hydration number of an aqueous electrolyte solution by means of 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations of water reorientation dynamics around ions (Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We report 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD simulations of aqueous magnesium chloride solutions, MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>(aq), with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.8 mol kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (solubility of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> in water is 54.3 g 100 mL
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20 °C).

 </xref> These simulations have been used to characterize the structure and low‐frequency dynamics of water and to estimate the hydration number of this electrolyte as a function of concentration. We chose Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> because these ions appear in the composition of seawater and they are also found in biological fluids. The values of 
 <italic>h</italic> for MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> obtained from the proposed computational methodology are in good agreement with experimental hydration numbers from THz‐DR measurements of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solutions, which have also been conducted in this study.

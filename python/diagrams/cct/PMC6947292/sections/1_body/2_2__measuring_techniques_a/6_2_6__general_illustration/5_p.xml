<p>CCP diagrams can only be read along the continuous cooling curves, and isothermal readings are not possible from these diagrams. Moreover, CCP diagrams are only valid for the particular alloy composition investigated and the specific solution treatment applied, which both have a great impact on the quench sensitivity of the alloy. The solution treatment and the mass fractions of alloying elements are therefore given at the top of each diagram. This also holds for the initial microstructure, i.e., the grain size or secondary dendrite arm or cell spacing. The reader should be aware that different batches with similar chemical composition may therefore still behave differently.</p>

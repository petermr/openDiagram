<p id="Par29">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the whole blood transcriptome profile in neonates with HLHS undergoing the Norwood procedure. Prior studies exploring gene profile in patients with HLHS have used atrial myocardium and do not capture the evolving and dynamic clinical condition of this high risk group

 </sup>. Whole blood transcriptomic data is potentially more relevant and useful for understanding genetic regulation of evolving clinical condition and finding likely therapeutic targets. Our data suggests that neonates with HLHS who develop post-operative LCOS have differentially regulated genes compared to those neonates who did not develop LCOS. We observed that some genes that were differentially regulated controlled the inflammatory pathway, consistent with known pathophysiological changes contributing to development of LCOS. We observed that genes controlling metabolic pathways were also differentially regulated in patients who developed LCOS compared to those without the LCOS.

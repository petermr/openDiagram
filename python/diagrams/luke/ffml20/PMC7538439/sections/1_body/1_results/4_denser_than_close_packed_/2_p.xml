 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> compares the solid and liquid at the melting point. They are remarkably similar: close to the phase boundary the liquid shows five discernible neighbour peaks indicating short-ranged structure to 10 Å. The molecular bond length is longer in the liquid than the solid (shown more clearly in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), but the separation between molecules is noticeably smaller in the liquid as evidenced by the first peak in the molecule–molecule RDF. This means that the molecules get closer together in the liquid, despite being longer.

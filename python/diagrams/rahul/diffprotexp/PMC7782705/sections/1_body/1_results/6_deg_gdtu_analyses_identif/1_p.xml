 </sup> and 3 causal AD genes—PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP—in individual cell types of the adult human brain. We found that 116 out of the 179 AD risk/causal genes were expressed by at least one of the major cell types identified in the brain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8A</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Subsets of these genes were exclusively expressed either in microglial cells (14 out of 116), neurons (12), astrocytes (2), oligodendrocytes (6), or endothelial cells (6), suggesting cell-type specific roles for these AD risk/causal genes.

0: The required wide range of cooling rates is accompanied by another metrological challenge, in that the dimensions of the quench-induced precipitates vary substantially within the cooling rate range.
1: This aspect is illustrated in  Figure 12.
2: It can be seen that the dimensions of quench-induced precipitates vary between several tens of m down to thicknesses of a few atomic layers (nm), i.e., the dimensions vary by a factor of >10,000.
3: Comprehensive imaging of quench-induced precipitates over the entire relevant dynamic range (of cooling rates and duration) requires the application of three different types of microscopy: optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
4: Of course, the application of additional analytical methods can provide further detailed information on quench-induced precipitation, and these will be briefly introduced in  Section 2.4.

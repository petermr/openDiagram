0: Previously, our group showed that the exposure of pregnant cows to a nutritional insult in early pregnancy changed fetal liver, cerebrum, and muscle gene expression profiles, suggesting a possible compensatory growth in response to reduced nutrient availability 17.
1: Likewise, candidate genes involved with myogenesis, muscle differentiation, and hepatic metabolism were reported as differentially expressed as a consequence of maternal nutrition 1,  15,  18.
2: Despite the knowledge provided by differential expression analysis, this approach does not consider the multiple interactions involved with gene expression regulation 19 that are central to phenotype determination.
3: To overcome this limitation, gene networks can be used successfully as a complementary framework to untangle the mechanisms and unravel the effects of maternal nutrition on fetal programming 8.
4: By measuring gene co-expression similarity, we can capture the relationship among genes across experimental conditions or tissue types and decipher the biologically-related gene functions 19  21.
5: Furthermore, we can assess the network rewiring and the differences in genegene interactions driving changes in gene expression in response to external stimuli 20,  22.

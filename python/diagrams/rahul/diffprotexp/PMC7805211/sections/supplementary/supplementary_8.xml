    <bold> Figure S5</bold>. Singular value decomposition analysis of technical and biological sources of variation. Detection of sources of technical variation that need to be accounted for in the differential methylation models and adjusted for prior to visualization was accomplished using the champ.SVD function implemented in ChAMP. Technical factors such as slide and scan date were found to contribute significant sources of variation in the data in addition to biological factors, such as sex, that needed to be added as covariates in the differential methylation models to test for sample group differences (CNF and PNF).

<p>Hemolysin also exists in animal mycoplasmas. 
 <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> contains a bovine serum albumin-dependent, membrane-associated hemolysin, which recognizes cholesterol in the opposing membrane once attached, causing erythrocyte lysis [
 <xref rid="cit0227" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. Chambaud et al. had found that the 
 <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> hemolysin gene 
 <italic>MYPU_1701</italic> is homologous to certain genes in 
 <italic>U. urealyticum</italic>, but no homolog was found in 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>U. diversum</italic> encodes a putative hemolysin protein gudiv_91, which is 63.1% identical to the hemolysin found in human ureaplasmas [
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Moreover, a similar membrane-associated hlyA gene (
 <italic>MCAP_0055</italic>) has been reported in 
 <italic>M. capricolum</italic>, which may account for the hemolytic activity of the spent culture medium of 
 <italic>M. capricolum</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0228" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>].

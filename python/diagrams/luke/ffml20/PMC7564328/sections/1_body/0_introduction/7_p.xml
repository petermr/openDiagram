<p id="p0055">In this study, cubic CD-MOF particles with uniform size ranging from 1 to 5 μm were prepared based on our previous work. A natural product flavonoid glycoside, scutellarin (SCU) was successfully incorporated in the CD-MOF to be used as DPIs. It was discovered that SCU can enhance the laryngeal deposition of CD-MOF, opening avenues for their use as a new carrier for laryngeal delivery. Dexamethasone (DEX), an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, has therapeutic effects on pharyngolaryngitis by reduction of the contractile response of smooth muscles and edema of the laryngeal mucosa. DEX was assessed as proof-of-concept test for SCU-improved laryngeal deposition when co-delivered in CD-MOF.</p>

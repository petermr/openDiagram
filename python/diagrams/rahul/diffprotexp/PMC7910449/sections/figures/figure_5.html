 <caption> CircRAB11FIP1 mediated the expression of ATG7 and ATG14 through sponging miR-129. A SKOV3 cells were subjected to 24-h Torin 1 treatment. Afterward, the mRNA expression of ATG7 and ATG14 was determined using qPCR. B LV2-1, LV2-2, or LV2-NC was transfected into SKOV3 cells. Then, the expression of ATG7 or ATG14 was examined. C LV6 or LV6-NC was transfected into A2780 cells. Later, the expression of ATG7 or ATG14 was examined. D TargetScan was employed to predict the possible binding sites among miR-129, ATG7, and ATG14. E SKOV3 cells were infected with miR-129 mimic or negative control (NC) RNA along with the mutant (pMIR-ATG7 3′-UTRm and pMIR-ATG14 3′-UTRm) or wild-type (pMIR-ATG7 3′-UTR and pMIR-ATG14 3′-UTR) luciferase reporter plasmid. The luciferase activity was detected after 24 h. F SKOV3 cells were infected with LV2-1, LV2-NC, or LV2-1+miR-129 inhibitor. A2780 cells were infected with LV6, LV6-NC, or LV6 + miR-129 mimics. Later, the expression of ATG7 or ATG14 was examined by Western blot analysis. Error bar stands for standard error. * P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.01. </caption>

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Many studies have reported the chemical composition of essential oil of <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. growing in different countries. However, this study represents the first report about the essential oil of <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. (AcEO) existing in Morocco. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, GC/MS analysis of essential oil of <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. resulted on the determination of spathulenol (10.19%) as the most prominent compound, followed by &#223;-eudesmol (4.05%), p-cymene (3.83%), &#948;-cadinene (3.67%), and &#223;-pinene (2.82%). These findings are consistent with our new published paper, which confirmed the similar chemical profile of <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. essential oil collected in the flowering stage of the year 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. By comparison to the literature data, our findings are partially in accordance with a study conducted in Iran by Kazemi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], in which the predominated components of essential oil obtained from the flowers, leaves and stems of <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. were <italic>&#945;</italic>-pinene (23&#8211;29.2%) and spathulenol (15.8&#8211;29.2%). Another work revealed the existence of the major volatiles spathulenol and <italic>&#946;</italic>-pinene in essential oil of <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. from Serbia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Previous studies reported the existence of two chemotypes of <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. essential oil occurring in different localities; the most relevant chemotype consists mainly in <italic>&#946;</italic>-pinene alone or together with <italic>&#945;</italic>-pinene occurring mainly in Tunisia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], Algeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and Southern Ural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], while the other chemotype was characterized by the volatiles: tremetone and capillen, detected in essential oil of <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. growing in Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, it is known that the species <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. presents great variability in its essential oil composition due to the existence of different subspecies from different localities. In France, <italic>A.campestris</italic> subsp. glutinosa has the main terpenes: &#947;-terpinene and capillene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], while, the same subspecies from Italy presented the major compounds: <italic>&#946;-</italic>pinene, germacrene D and bicyclogermacrene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Other studies reported that <italic>A.campestris</italic> subsp. campestris essential oil from Lithuania and Poland possesses the main components: caryophyllene oxide, Z-falcarinol, germacrene D, &#946;-pinene, &#947;-curcumene, &#947;-humulene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The oils of other subspecies, maritima from Portugal and borealis from Italy were rich in <italic>&#946;-</italic>pinene, cadin-4-en-7-ol, caryophyllene oxide and <italic>&#945;</italic>-pinene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Taking into account all these data, the species <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. can be segregated into many chemotypes based on the variation of the essential oil composition, which may lead to consider the species growing in the arid region of Eastern Morocco as a new chemotype characterized by the spathulenol as the major compound.</p>

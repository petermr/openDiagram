<p>Salinity stress can cause osmotic imbalance and toxicity to ions. The major impact of osmotic stress on plants is on growth reduction due to reduced water potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The salt stress also increases sodium ion (Na
 <sup>+</sup>) concentration that directly hinders the absorption of potassium ions (K
 <sup>+</sup>) in plants. However, in higher plants, low Na
 <sup>+</sup> levels, and a normal range of K
 <sup>+</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup> ratios enhance salt tolerance in the cell cytoplasm [

 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The exact mechanism of tolerance to salt and osmotic stress in potato is not well studied, especially how 
 <italic>bZIPs</italic> can regulate this response. In the present study, initial evidence of expression of 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> during abiotic stress conditions sets out a new hypothesis to understand the regulatory process as validated in prior reports, which showed that expression of 
 <italic>bZIP17</italic> increased salt tolerance in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similarly, the 
 <italic>AREB1</italic> and 
 <italic>ABF2</italic> are 
 <italic>bZIP</italic> family genes, and their overexpression and silencing in tomato and cotton resulted in enhanced salt- and drought-stress tolerance, respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The 
 <italic>AREB1</italic> gene also regulates other genes related to abiotic and biotic stress [

<p>A schematic diagram of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene electrode dynamics is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. Transportation of electrons and ions (e
 <sup>−</sup> and Li
 <sup>+</sup>) from their “reservoirs” toward the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> particles (Gaberscek et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Gaberscek, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) is shown as step A. A charge incorporation reaction that involves the transfer of e
 <sup>−</sup> and Li
 <sup>+</sup> from the outside into the interior of active particles is shown as step B, and the transport of the lithium component inside the solid active particles (solid-state diffusion) is shown as step C. It can be seen that graphene can provide a high-speed channel for the rapid diffusion of electrons and cause the electrons to reach the reactive site quickly, thus increasing the electronic conductivity of the materials. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles can shorten the transport path of Li
 <sup>+</sup> from the surface to the interior of solid active particles and improve the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions. Moreover, the nanoparticles are surrounded by the micron graphene sheets, and the micron structure guards the stability of the material. Therefore, LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites are expected to have excellent electrochemical performance.

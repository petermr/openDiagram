0: The essential oils were analysed by Electron Impact Ionization (EI) method on GC-2010 Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph, coupled to a GC-MS QP 2010 plus Shimadzu Mass Spectrometer fitted with RTX-5 MS fused silica capillary column (Supelco Inc.) (30 m  2.5 mm; 0.25 m film thickness).
1: The column temperature was 40 C (hold 2 min) to 220 C (hold 5 min) at the rate of 10 C/min, maintained with carrier gas helium at a constant pressure of 90 kPa (Acquisition parameters full scan; scan range 40550 amu).
2: The split ratio was 10.
3: Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV.

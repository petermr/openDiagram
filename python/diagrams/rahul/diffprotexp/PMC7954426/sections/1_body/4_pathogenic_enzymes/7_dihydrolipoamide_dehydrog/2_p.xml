<p>Lipoate protein ligase A (lplA) plays a role in the ligation of lipoic acid from host cells to the E2 subunit of the PDH complex to generate E2-lipoamide, which ultimately plays a crucial role in pyruvate metabolism [
 <xref rid="cit0255" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>]. lplA has been shown to be upregulated in the pathogenic 168 strain of 
 <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0256" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>]. Similarly, the 
 <italic>lplA</italic> gene has also been identified in the genomes of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and Mccp [
 <xref rid="cit0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Nevertheless, further research on the pathogenic function of lplA in mycoplasmas is warranted.

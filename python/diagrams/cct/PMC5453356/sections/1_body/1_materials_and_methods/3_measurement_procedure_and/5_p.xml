<p>At the beginning of the soaking step, the precipitation reaction may start immediately. Therefore, it may barely be possible to evaluate the precipitation onset directly. Besides, during quenching from the solution treatment to soaking temperature, a temporal delay between the sample temperature and the program temperature occurs. This fact influences the definition of the onset-point of the precipitation reaction. Furthermore, the duration of the quenching step is longer when the soaking temperature is lower. All these effects have been taken into account in the evaluation (

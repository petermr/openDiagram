<p>GSEA demonstrated that 30 different pathways related to 299 differentially expressed PCGs were downregulated or upregulated according to the recurrence rate. Several enriched terms are presented in 
 <xref rid="f2-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD2-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table SI</xref>, such as ‘regulation of cell death’, ‘regulation of cell adhesion’, ‘positive regulation of biosynthetic process’, ‘positive regulation of gene expression’, ‘small molecule metabolic process’ and ‘response to extracellular stimulus’. The results indicated that changes in these pathways lead to the recurrence and progression of NFPAs.

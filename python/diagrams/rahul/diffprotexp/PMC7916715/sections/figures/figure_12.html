 <caption> Prediction of poor OS of pRCC and bladder cancer using the LE multigene panel. Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves of pRCC ( A) and bladder cancer ( B). The TCGA pRCC ( n = 278) and bladder cancer ( n = 390) datasets were organized by SurvExpress. Risk scores of LE panel were calculated using multivariate Cox fitting; cutoff points were optimized to stratify low-risk and high-risk populations. </caption>

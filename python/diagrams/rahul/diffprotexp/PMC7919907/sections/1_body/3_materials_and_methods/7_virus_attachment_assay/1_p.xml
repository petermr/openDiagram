<p>Viral attachment assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. RD cells or Vero E6 cells at 80–90% confluency were precooled at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by infection with HCoV-OC43 (MOI of 40) or HCoV-NL63 (MOI of 30). After 2 h incubation at 4 °C, unbound viruses were removed by washing the cells two times with ice-cold PBS. The infected cells with viruses attached on cell surface were harvested for quantification by real-time qPCR or fixed for visualization by immunofluorescence staining.

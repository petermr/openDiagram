<p id="p0215">In the trans-omic network in the liver, the activating regulation by DEMEs and the inhibiting allosteric regulation by the DEMs counteract each other, implying that the liver may adapt to obesity-induced changes in metabolites with compensatory increases in metabolic enzymes induced by increased gene expression. Expression of many of the increased DEMEs were also regulated at the gene expression level by 
 <italic>Pparg</italic>, 
 <italic>Srebf1</italic>, 
 <italic>Klf4</italic>, and 
 <italic>Esr1</italic>. Both Pparg and Srebp1 are key regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism, and those TFs are highly expressed in liver of obese individuals (

 <italic>ob</italic> mice and increased activation of lipid metabolic pathways regulated by their target genes. 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> and 
 <italic>Srebf1</italic> also activated genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including those in the glycogen, TCA cycle, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, in the 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, suggesting that these DRTFs coordinate altered lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in obesity. These results provide a potential transcriptional mechanism for the increased expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism that is associated with insulin resistance in obesity (

<p>We performed this analysis and found the actual number of differential APA genes that are differentially expressed in protein and not mRNA is not significantly higher than what would be expected by change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The protein data comes from Khan et al. who measured 3,390 proteins with high resolution mass spec, thus analysis is fairly low powered. We are only able to sample 661 genes from 2632 genes that we have all of the data for. In addition, we do not expect APA differences to explain all or even a majority of the genes differentially expressed in protein but not mRNA. We expect a number of additional mechanisms to lead to protein differences.

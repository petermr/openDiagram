<p>In conclusion, our study facilitated the understanding of lncRNA-immune interactions and provided a valuable resource of immune-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer. These lncRNAs could be potential biomarkers for immune cells or immune-related activities in prostate cancer. Because tumor immunity has major impacts on cancer progression, many immune-related lncRNAs can predict prognosis and immunotherapy of cancers (

<p>Most knowledge of AT is based on in vitro studies of committed murine cell lines, notably 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and human cell lines, particularly mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, some studies have demonstrated the adipogenic potential of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref>]. MEFs, isolated from 14-day-old mouse embryos (C57/BL6 52 strain), are classically used as ‘feeder layers’ for human and mouse embryonic stem cells, for DNA transfection assays, recombinant protein expression, and utilization for epigenome and transcriptome analysis (i.e. chromatin remodelling) [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although MEFs can differentiate into multiple cell types, yet little is known in regard to specific mechanisms underlying their adipogenic potential.

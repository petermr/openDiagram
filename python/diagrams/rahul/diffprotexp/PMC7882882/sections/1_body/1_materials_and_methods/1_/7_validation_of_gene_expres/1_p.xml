<p>RT-qPCR was performed using another set of NFPA samples to verify the credibility of the bioinformatics analyses. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, five cases of NFPAs with recurrence within 1 year and four cases of NFPAs with recurrence after 5 years were randomly selected from the patients who underwent surgical resection in Beijing Tiantan Hospital between August 2009 and November 2014 as the validation set. The total RNA of validated samples was extracted and purified as aforementioned. Reverse transcription into cDNA was performed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (cat. no. 0049472; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Next, a Power SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (cat. no. 4367659; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used for qPCR with a total reaction volume of 20 µl. Amplification was performed as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 60 sec, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. GAPDH was used as an internal control gene. All primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. The level of mRNAs was determined using QuantStudio 3 and 5 systems (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). For relative quantitation, expression levels were calculated expression levels were calculated using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCq</sup> method (
 <xref rid="b41-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The sequences of the primers are as follows: GAPDH forward, 5′-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCA-3′; NOL6 forward, 5′-ATTCGGGAAGCTGTGGTCTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATGTCAGCATGGAGTGCCAA-3′; and LL21NC02-21A1.1 forward, 5′-CTGCCCGATCTCACCTCTTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCAGGGAAGGACTCCAGGTT-3′.

<p>Biological systems are complex in nature, their behaviour being governed by the interactions of many molecular components (e.g., coding and non-coding RNAs, proteins), through several regulatory layers [

Cancer is no exception, being the result of multiple perturbations within a single cell that also affect cell–cell and cell–microenvironment communication. Each perturbation does not act in isolation but is influenced and in turn influences the whole system, with reciprocal relationships occurring between most components [

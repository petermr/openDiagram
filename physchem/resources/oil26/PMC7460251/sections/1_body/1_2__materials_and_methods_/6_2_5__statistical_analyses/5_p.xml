<p>To assess the extent to which enrichment items achieved the overall goals, we modeled total time foraging, total time investigating, or locomotion as target variables. For these models, we used data aggregated by night in GLMM with negative binomial distributions and log link functions. We used two-week period of the study (four total periods) as a continuous predictor and enrichment (specific or stated goal) as fixed factors, but we were unable to fit models with terms for interactions between time and enrichment. These models used the same random slopes previously described. Models for foraging and investigating included a variance components covariance structure, while the model for locomotion used an AR1 covariance structure. </p>

<p>To evaluate the contribution of rare SNVs to the severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection on a single gene level, we tested which genes associated with severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Two kinds of tests were conducted using the all rare functional SNVs or only rare LOF SNVs. The rare functional SNVs test identified a total of 125 genes as significant candidate loci (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) being presented in Table S2. Among them, FtsJ RNA 2’-O-methyltransferase 3 (
 <italic>FTSJ3</italic>) gene appeared to be the most significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.61 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) risk gene of the severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. On the other hand, the rare LOF SNVs test discovered 12 genes that were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) associated with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease as shown in Table S2. Carboxypeptidase vitellogenic like (
 <italic>CPVL</italic>) and chimerin 2 (
 <italic>CHN2</italic>) gene seemed to be the most significant risk gene (
 <italic>P</italic> = 7.62 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) in this test. It was noted that 6 genes were found to be significant in both two tests as mentioned above, including 
 <italic>CPVL</italic>.

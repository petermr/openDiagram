<p id="Par7">For the preparation of a water solution containing cellulose fibers, 400 mg of raw pulp is typically dispersed in 200 mL of deionized water and intensely mixed with an ULTRA-TURRAX disperser for 15 min. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature, and an additional 200 mL of deionized water is added to obtain a 1-g FB/L solution. This aqueous solution is utilized to disperse carbons and active materials.</p>

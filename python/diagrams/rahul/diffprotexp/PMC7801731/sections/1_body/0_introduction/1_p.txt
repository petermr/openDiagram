0: Regeneration is fundamental for renewal of cells and tissues in multicellular organisms, nevertheless the process of regenerating complex components, such as organs, is only possible in a few animal groups 1.
1: Understanding the limitations of this capability has become an important goal in improving health conditions related to tissue and organ functional maintenance 2.
2: However, discerning this process requires a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the cellular functions responsible for regeneration.

0: Aqueous MgCl 2 solutions were prepared by dissolving MgCl 2 powder in deionized water.
1: MgCl 2 was purchased from SigmaAldrich with a purity of over 98 % and used without further purification process.
2: High purity deionized water with electrical resistance of 18.2 M cm was prepared by MilliQ systems.
3: Solutions were prepared by measuring the weight of MgCl 2 powder using a balance with a precision of 0.1 mg and dissolving the powder in deionized water by measuring concentration volumetrically (mol kg 1).
4: The dielectric constant   of liquid sample was determined from measured reflection coefficient  s by applying the bilinear model (Eq.
5: 1), which is recommended for openended coaxial probe experiments.
6: [ 48,  49] (1)s=As+C1+Bs

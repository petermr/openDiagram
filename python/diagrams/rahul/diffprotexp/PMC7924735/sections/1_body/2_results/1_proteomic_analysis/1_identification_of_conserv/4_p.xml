<p>A protein interaction map was designed to establish the segregation of spots in 2D PAGE gels and determine the number of conserved and differential spots for each culture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009104.g003">Fig 3</xref>). As shown, 7 matching spots were conserved in all cultures, while 6 matching spots were found in C1, C2, C3, and C4; 6 matching spots were found in C1, C2, and C3. On the other hand, 4 matching spots were found in C1, C2, C4, and C5. Four matching spots were found in C1, C3, C4, and C5 (

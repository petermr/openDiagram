 </sub>, where M denotes a transition‐metal cation and the NCN
 <sup>2−</sup> carbodiimide is the “divalent nitride” anion, mimicking the O
 <sup>2−</sup> anion by a nitrogen functionality. Its members, including Cr

 <xref rid="anie201914760-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> have been successfully fabricated by “soft chemistry” (metathesis) routes and furthermore, they turned out to be excellent anode candidates possessing a high reversible capacity upon charge/discharge cycling in Li‐ and Na‐ion batteries.

 <xref rid="anie201914760-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Nevertheless, the detailed reaction pathway and unsolved structural transformations that occur upon charge/discharge cycling are difficult to detect experimentally because of the often amorphous nature of these materials. Hence, the main focus of this contribution is to carry out an in‐depth density functional theory (DFT) study of the conversion‐reaction mechanism of typical FeNCN as a LIB (NIB) electrode material by employing advanced DFT calculations combined with operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).

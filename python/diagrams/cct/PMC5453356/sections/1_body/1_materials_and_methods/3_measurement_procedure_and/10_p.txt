0: At the end of the quenching step, the intersection point between the actual applied scanning rate and the critical cooling rate (the red line in  Figure 4) was defined as the zero time for the evaluation of isothermal precipitation kinetics in this work.
1: According to this defined zero point, a time interval,  t, results, according to  Figure 4.
2: In order to enable reliable curve evaluation, the isothermal heat flow curves must be shifted horizontally to the newly-defined starting point by  t.

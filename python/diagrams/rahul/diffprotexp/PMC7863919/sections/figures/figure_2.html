 <caption> Gene Set Enrichment analysis of genes that were identified as regulated by miRNAs differentially expressed in USP8mut and USP8wt corticotroph tumors. ( a) Results of the analysis of all putative target genes ( n = 400). ( b) Results for putative target genes with negative miRNAâ€“mRNA correlation of expression levels ( n = 239). Top 10 enriched pathways/processes are presented. Dark gray bars indicate significantly enriched pathways/processes (adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Vertical dashed line indicates the significance threshold. </caption>

0: We seeded an average of 1.5  10 5 B16F1 cells in complete DMEM in a sterile Petri dish (Falcon 3003).
1: Between 10 to 12 h after sowing, we changed by fresh medium supplemented with 5-Brd-2-dU (Sigma-Aldrich) or L-Tyr (Biomedical Inc, Clinton Township, MI, USA) at a final concentration of 2.5 g/mL and 5 mM, respectively, and incubate for 72 h without medium change.
2: Furthermore, we followed every 48 h for cell monitoring assay until 240 h, where 5.0  10 2 cells were seeded to determine population doubling times.
3: The photomicrographs were captured under a 20x inverted light microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Kobe, Japan) using the NIS-Elements-Nikon program.
4: The cells treated with 5-Brd-2-dU, protected from light, were resuspended in complete medium, and the exclusion of Trypan Blue assessed the viability.
5: Additionally, the cells from the culture supernatants recovered by centrifugation, and their viability was determined using propidium iodide (I.P.)
6: incorporation assay in TaliTM Image-based Cytometer following the manufacturers specifications.

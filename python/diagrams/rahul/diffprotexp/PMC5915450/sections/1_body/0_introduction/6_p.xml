<p id="Par7">Here, we examine the molecular interactions that allow H-NS to bypass erythromycin and prevent ErmCL from progressing through the exit tunnel using steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. In SMD simulations, segments from these two proteins are pulled along the ribosome exit tunnel using an artificially imposed force at a constant velocity in the presence and absence of ERY. We find that while ERY makes it harder to pull either peptide through the tunnel exit, a much larger force and work is required to move ErmCL compared to H-NS. Decomposing the energetic components, we find the interaction energy of ErmCL with ERY is more favorable than that of H-NS. These results indicate that the differential impact of ERY on these two protein’s arises from stronger intermolecular interactions between ERY and C-terminal residues of ErmCL than H-NS.</p>

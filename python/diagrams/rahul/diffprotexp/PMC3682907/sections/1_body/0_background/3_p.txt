0: SELDI-MS was originally developed for rapid, high throughput biomarker discovery in biological fluids (plasma, serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid) but has been employed to examine the proteomes of cell lysates and tissues [ 43, 45].
1: The approach combines time-of-flight mass spectrometry with protein capture using a variety of chromatographic protein chip surfaces (anion and cation exchange, normal phase, reverse phase, and immobilized metal ion) as well as chemistries for covalent attachment of proteins for affinity capture.
2: It is most sensitive for monitoring low molecular weight (< 20kDa) proteins and peptides.
3: Complex protein samples may also be fractionated (i.e.
4: fractionation on anion exchange beads) prior to spotting protein chips in order to reduce the complexity of SELDI mass spectra.
5: SELDI-MS Expression Difference Mapping allows rapid analysis of multiple samples over multiple conditions to identify differentially expressed proteins.
6: Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering can also be employed to identify the mass spectral peaks that distinguish disease from controls [ 46- 51].
7: Reproducibility in various proteome profiling technologies, including SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry, has been a major challenge.
8: Sources of variability intrinsic to the SELDI-MS technique include variation in the ionization and desorption processes and in time-of-flight measurement and ion detection.
9: Errors also can be introduced in mass spectral preprocessing steps such as baseline correction, normalization, and mass spectra alignment.
10: Attempts to reduce proteome complexity and enhance protein identification by the use of sample fractionation steps, including sub-cellular and anion exchange fractionation, can also introduce variability from sample to sample.

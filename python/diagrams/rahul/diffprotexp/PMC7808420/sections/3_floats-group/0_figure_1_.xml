   <bold>Type I and type II IFNs play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of SLEV infection in mice</bold>. (a) WT and ABR
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice in the SV129 background were inoculated intracranially with 10
   <sup>2</sup> PFU of SLEV and observed for 14 days. (b) WT and IFNγ
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice in the C57BL/6 background were inoculated intracranially with 10 PFU of SLEV and observed for 14 days. Results are expressed as percentage of survival and are representative of three independent experiments (n = 10–18). *P &lt; 0.05, ***P &lt; 0.001 relative to the infected WT group. Mock – uninfected mice inoculated with saline

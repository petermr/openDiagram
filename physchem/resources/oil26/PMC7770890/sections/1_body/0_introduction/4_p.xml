<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Early studies assumed that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was associated
with the Huanan Seafood and Wildlife Market, where one or more animals
sold there may be the direct zoonotic source.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> However, this point of view was challenged
by the report that the first case of infection was suggested not to
be related to the market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Therefore, strategies
to trace back the origin of SARS-CoV-2 should not be limited to the
animals sold in the market, but should also include a wide range of
wild animals outside the market. Theoretically, all kinds of animals
that may have close contact with humans should be investigated, but
this would be extremely laborious as well as time- and money-consuming.</p>

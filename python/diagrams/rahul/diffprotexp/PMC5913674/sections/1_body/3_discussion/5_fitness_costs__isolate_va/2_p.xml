<p>Our results add to evidence that demonstrates that MtzR exacts significant metabolic costs to 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> and also highlights variability in the magnitude and reversibility of MtzR changes between and within genotypes. Indeed, the impaired growth rate and lower confluence of WB-MtzR relative to other MtzR lines [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>) meant it was not possible to compare passage and time from cessation of drug selection equivalently as for 713- and 106-MtzR lines. Further, 106-MtzR recovered from slower growth and lower confluency more quickly than 713-MtzR upon discontinuation of drug exposure (

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in as little as 4 months. Transcriptomic analyses of WB, 713, and 106 isogenic lines indicated qualitative differences between 106-MtzR and WB- and 713-MtzR lines [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Correlations with previous studies revealed the 106-MtzR transcriptome to be most similar to the “wild-type” WB-MtzS after exposure to sub-lethal Mtz [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The 106-MtzR molecular phenotype is also potentially the most clinically relevant, in that it grows relatively quickly and remains cytoadherent and infective in suckling mice, while also showing a relatively stable MtzR phenotype after discontinuation of Mtz selection [

<p id="Par54">Biological processes and signaling pathways involved in embryonic tissue development comprised the most common category among the downregulated pathways enriched by DCVC treatment. This was a consistent finding across DCVC concentrations and exposure durations in HTR-8/SVneo cells, but was not evident in tissues. Lending further evidence, PAX6 and SMAD3, two key transcription factors that regulate gene expression patterns in developing embryonic tissues (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2004</xref>; Manuel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2015</xref>), were enriched with the group of genes with no expression changes at 6 h but downregulation after 12 h of 20 µM DCVC treatment. Furthermore, the histone modification tri-methylation site H3K27me3, which also regulates genes expression during embryonic development, was enriched with the same group of genes. Interestingly, H3K27me3 has been shown to regulate a pattern of gene expression in the placenta that protects tissues from environmental insults (Nugent et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2018</xref>). These results indicate that the pattern of downregulated genes induced by DCVC treatment may be a response similar to the ISR that is intended to protect the cells and promote adaption.

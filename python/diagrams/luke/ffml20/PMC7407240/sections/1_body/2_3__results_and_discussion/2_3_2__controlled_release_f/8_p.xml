 <xref rid="polymers-12-01544-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which explains the lowest release rate and diffusion coefficient of this drug for the PVA hydrogel, in comparison with the PVA/CAR blends. Due to the macromolecular architecture flexibilization and restructuration promoted by the increase in the release fluid’s temperature, higher cumulative release ratios are registered for the drug-loaded hydrogels at equilibrium (

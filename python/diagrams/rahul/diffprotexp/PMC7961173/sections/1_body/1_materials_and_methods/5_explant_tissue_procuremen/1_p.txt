0: First-trimester placental tissues ( N = 5; 4 male and 1 female) ranging in gestational age from 8.4 to 11 weeks (mean = 9.68  0.98 weeks) were acquired as discarded tissues at the time of termination at a Michigan family planning clinic with Institutional Review Board approval (Wayne State University IRB# 013515MP4E) and written informed consent obtained by collaborating Wayne State University physicians.
1: Tissues were transported to the laboratory in ice-cold PBS.
2: Chorionic villi were dissected under a microscope into approximately 20 mg (wet) segments and cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Anti-Anti.
3: The villous segments were floated one per well in clear 24-well cell culture plates and allowed to acclimate in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator for 24 h, as previously described (Bolnick et al.
4: 2017).
5: For gene expression experiments, the culture medium was removed and explants were treated with fresh DMEM/F12 complete medium alone (control) or complete medium plus DCVC diluted to a final concentration of 20 M, and then cultured for an additional 12 h. Five independent biological replicate experiments were performed using placentae from 5 different donors on different days.
6: Each experiment was conducted with a placenta from a different donor, and villous explants from the same placenta were assigned randomly to the non-treated control and DCVC-exposed groups.

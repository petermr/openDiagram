<p>Despite the genomic and gene expression changes observed in the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse, mice hemizygous for the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene did not have a significant difference in weight gain trajectory or glucose homoeostasis after 12Â weeks of HFD feeding. These results suggest that the presence of the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene has no or only a limited effect when the outcome is weight gain or carbohydrate metabolism. Nevertheless, our results do not exclude the possibility of gene interaction effects that may have metabolic consequences between the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene and the conditional deletion gene of interest. It is important to note that such interaction effects are difficult to test in any breeding strategy using 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mice and a conditional deletion gene of interest.

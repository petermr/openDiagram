0: The system [P 44414]Cl + CH 3COOH (73.0 wt.% IL, 27.0 wt.% CH 3COOH) was subsequently used to leach and separate the metals contained in the real waste NiMH battery black mass.
1: NiMH battery black mass was kindly provided by an industrial recycler (Recupyl, Grenoble, France) and washed with deionized water prior to use to remove residual KOH electrolyte.
2: To 1.8 g of the IL + acid mixture was added 0.18 g of waste NiMH black mass and left under stirring at 500 rpm for 24 h at 323 K. Following leaching, the saturated [P 44414]Cl + CH 3COOH mixture was diluted with 0.5 g of H 2O or a 2.0 wt.% aqueous NaCl solution until a biphasic system was obtained.
3: The systems were centrifugated to speed up the phase separation.
4: The phases were subsequently diluted using deionized water prior to metal concentration analysis by UVvis and TXRF.
5: The same leaching conditions, namely 500 rpm for 24 h at 323 K and a solid-to-liquid ratio of 0.1, were employed to evaluate the leaching of metals from 0.18 g of the black mass using an aqueous solution of 27.0 wt.% CH 3COOH.

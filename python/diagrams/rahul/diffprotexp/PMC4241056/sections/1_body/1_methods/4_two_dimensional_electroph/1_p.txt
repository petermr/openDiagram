0: Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on each ReadyStrip IPG strip (17 cm, pH 4 to 7, linear, Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with IPGphor IEF system (Bio-Rad, USA).
1: Samples containing 100 g protein were made up to 300 l with rehydrating buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.33% carrier ampholyte (pH 4 to 6 and pH 5 to 7, respectively)).
2: After the active rehydration for 12 h, IEF was conducted at 250 V for 1 h, 500 V for 1 h, 1,000 V for 1.5 h, 5,000 V for 2 h, 8,000 V for 0.5 h, and 8,000 V to reach a total of approximately 70kVh.
3: After IEF, the strips were equilibrated first, in equilibration buffer I (1% DL-DTT, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) for 15 min and second, in equilibration buffer II (2.5% iodoacetamide instead of 1% dithiothreitol in equilibration buffer I) for another 15 min.
4: Finally, the second dimension was performed using 12% acrylamide gels, and the 2D-PAGE gels were stained with silver stain method as described by Shevchenko et al.

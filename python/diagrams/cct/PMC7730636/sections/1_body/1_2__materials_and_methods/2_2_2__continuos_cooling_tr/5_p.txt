0: Samples were made in form of cylinder with diameter of 4 mm and length of 10 mm.
1: Each experiment was repeated 4 times, and averages were calculated to obtain relevant values.
2: The CCT diagram also shows the resulting hardness values, which were measured using Instron Wolpert (Instron, Norwood, MA, USA) hardness tester.
3: Vickers method HV5 was used with load 50 N. Hardness was measured 5 times on each sample.

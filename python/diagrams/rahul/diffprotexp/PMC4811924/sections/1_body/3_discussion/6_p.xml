 <italic>S. suis</italic> virulence proteins related to infection, persistence and competitive fitness were mostly down regulated when sub-MIC tylosin was used to inhibit biofilm formation. There was a &gt;1.5-fold decrease in the level of NADH oxidase. NADH oxidase regulates competence, virulence, and pneumococcal persistence by its actions as an oxygen sensor, in detoxifying oxygen, and in increasing the efficiency of glucose breakdown (Auzat et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and plays an important role in 
 <italic>pneumococcal</italic> infection in animal models of pneumonia (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). NADH oxidase is encoded by 
 <italic>nox</italic>. The virulence and persistence in mice of a blood isolate was attenuated by a 
 <italic>nox</italic> insertion mutation (Auzat et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Thus, this protein appears to be of major importance in the growth of biofilms.

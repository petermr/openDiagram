<p>� In the process of calculation, relative mRNA levels of target genes were normalized by rnpB (46) using the ΔCT method [ΔCT = av CT(target gene) – av CT (rnpB)]. To determine the fold-change, the gene expression in NVs was used as control, results were calculated using the ΔΔCT (comparative threshold cycle) method, ΔΔCT = (av CT(target gene) – av CT(rnpB))sample – (av CT(target gene) – av CT(rnpB))control. In three paired comparisons, X vs. Y refers to Y/X. Y was used as target gene and the X was used as control. The process of calculation has added in revised manuscript (See line 349-354)</p>

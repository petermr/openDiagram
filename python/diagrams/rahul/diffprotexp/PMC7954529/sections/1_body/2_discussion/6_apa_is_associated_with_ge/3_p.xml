<p>In past studies, we and others have estimated the proportion of variation in gene expression explained by different regulatory mechanism. For example, we have previously tested for differences in expression before and after accounting for another regulatory mechanism or used formal mediation analyses (

We would have liked to perform similar analysis in the current study, regarding the role that APA plays inÂ the overall regulatory divergence between the species. However, APA was measured using ratios of alternative mRNA isoforms and thus, effect sizes for APA and differential expression are on different scales and we cannot use a standard mediation approach to formally calculate the proportion of expression variation explained by APA. That said, we are generally convinced that APA contributes to differences in mRNA expression overall because 764 of 3796 (20.1%) differentially expressed genes also have significant differences in APA.

<p>In this study, we have investigated the impact of mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> on the transcriptome, observing a significant impact of hotspot mutations of 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> in codons K666/700 resulting in abnormal splicing patterns, as well as the introduction of novel transcripts. We were able to show that not all mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> result in abnormal splicing, and that the key hotspots are the drivers of this aberrant phenomenon. We identified a number of alternatively spliced genes in common with other cancers with hotspot mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1, TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNLL1, UQCC</italic>, and 
 <italic>CRNDE</italic>, indicating a commonality in biology between them. Comparison of all of our alternatively spliced genes with those in uveal melanoma
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> identified a similar number of alternatively spliced genes (935 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 1019), but only 165 (9%) genes overlapped. This low percentage overlap may indicate that hotspot mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> affect a large set of genes that are specific to MM.

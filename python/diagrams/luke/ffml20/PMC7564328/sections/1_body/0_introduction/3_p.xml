Conventional throat sprays deliver the drug by applying pressure with a manual pump, for which the dosages were hard to control due to the lack of coordination between drug release and patient inhalation. However, DPIs have overcome this problem by actively inhaling the powder. Only by passing through the larynx into the respiratory tract, can drug gain access to the pulmonary site of action or absorption. This indicates that the inhalation administration and the larynx are naturally related. Laryngeal administration in powder form is an ancient treatment in traditional Chinese medicine, which requires the patient to open the mouth and sprinkle the powder directly to the larynx. For example, Zhuhuang Chuihou Powder and Qingdai Powder, the ancient herbal medicinal formulas, exert therapeutic effects on sore throat. The fine powders are easy to disperse and quick on-set for the effects. Thus, it is of great interest to optimize the properties of a conventional DPI so as to be transformed for specific laryngeal drug delivery, which would pave the way to the treatment of a variety of local diseases in the larynx.

0: A portion of the precipitates was oven-dried at 60 C for particle characterization, a detailed account of which is in the  Supplementary Section.
1: Crystalline MnO 2 phase purity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; PANalytical XPert Pro X-ray diffractometer;  Figure S1).
2: B.E.T.
3: 25 specific surface areas of 59.2 m 2/g for AcidBir and 204 m 2/g for -MnO 2 were obtained from 90-point adsorption/desorption N 2(g) isotherms (Micromeritics).
4: The surface Mn:O:K compositions of 1.00:1.49:0.20 for AcidBir, MnO 2 (0.20 K), and 1.00:1.38:0.17 for -MnO 2, MnO 2 (0.17 K), were resolved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Kratos Axis Ultra DLD electron spectrometer; see the text in the  Supporting Information and Figures S2S4).
5: The O/Mn ratios were lower than the stoichiometrically expected value of 2, and could result from (i) the near surface composition of birnessite surfaces probed by XPS ( i.e., within the first 10 nm of the topmost region), and (ii) the loss of chemisorbed water to vacuum.

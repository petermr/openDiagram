<p>In addition to small molecules and various endogenous and exogenous mediators, it has also been demonstrated that other proteins present in the plasma membrane can modulate ASIC3 function, the most well studied being stomatin and stomatin-like proteins. In vitro co-expression of stomatin with mASIC3 leads to reduced transient current amplitude without altering the sustained phase or expression level, compared to cells only expressing mASIC3 [

 <sup>−/-</sup> mice showing an exacerbated reduction in mechanosensitivity of certain sensory neurones compared to ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice [

 <xref rid="cit0234" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. Investigation of how stomatin might interact with ASIC3 demonstrated that the C terminus of ASIC3 is important, in particular Leu488+ Leu489, mutation of which causes larger ASIC3-mediated currents and diminished inhibition by stomatin at pH 4.0 [

Further analysis has shown that the C terminus of ASIC3 is important for ASIC3-stomatin to physically interact and that transmembrane domain 1 of ASIC3 is critical for the modulation of ASIC3 function by stomatin, as demonstrated by chimera experiments with ASIC1a, which is not inhibited by stomatin [

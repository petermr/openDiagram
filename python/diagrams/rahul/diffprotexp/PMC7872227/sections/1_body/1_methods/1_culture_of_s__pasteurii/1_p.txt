0: The  S.  pasteurii strain (BNCC 337394) used in this study was purchased from Bnbio (Beina Chuanglian Biotechnology Institute, Beijing).
1: The whole genome sequencing results of this strain were uploaded to NCBI (NZ_CP038012.1) in March 2019 [ 21].
2: The received bacterial lyophilized powder was first activated with premade activation medium (tryptone 5g/L, yeast extract 3g/L, urea 20g/L, pH = 7.3) and incubated at 30C for 24 hours.
3: Then, the obtained small amount of bacterial culture was streaked onto Christensens Urea Agar [ 22] plate and grow at 30C for 24 hours.
4: A single colony with good growth potential was selected for expansion and subsequent studies.
5: The medium was the NH 4-YE medium recommended by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

0: Time-series sampling of patients can capture the dynamic nature of disease over time and highlight the biological changes that occur as disease progresses.
1: Previous longitudinal studies of COVID-19 have primarily focused on the immune response against pathogens [ 4,  5].
2: At present, sequencing-based multiscale changes among critical COVID-19 patients and their potential correlation with clinical trajectory remain unknown.
3: Exploration of these molecular changes could contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 and help uncover potential therapeutic targets.
4: Many studies have shown that comorbidities impact the COVID-19 prognosis [ 6,  7].
5: Therefore, we studied patients without selected comorbidities (see Methods).

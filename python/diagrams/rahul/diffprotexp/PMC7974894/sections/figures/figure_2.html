 <caption> Identification of differential co-expression RBPs (DceRBPs) in TCGA-retrieved tongue cancer patients. (A) Heat map of the RBPs in tongue patients. Normal, n=15; Tumor, T=147. (B) Volcano plot of DeRBPs in tongue patients. Down-regulated: Down-regulated RBPs in TCGA-retrieved tongue cancer patients v.s. normal patients; Up-regulated: Up-regulated RBPs in TCGA-retrieved tongue cancer patients v.s. normal patients; Unchanged: RBPs which shows no expression levels changes in TCGA-retrieved tongue cancer patients v.s. normal patients. (C) The Cluster dendrogram of co-expression network modules was ordered by a hierarchical clustering of genes based on the 1-TOM matrix. Each module assigned with different color. (D) Module-trait relationships. Each row corresponds to a color module and column corresponds to a clinical trait (cancer or normal). Each cell contains the corresponding correlation and P-value. (E) Venn diagram of DeRBPs and genes enriched in the highest normal or tumor-trait related modules (Black and Tan). </caption>

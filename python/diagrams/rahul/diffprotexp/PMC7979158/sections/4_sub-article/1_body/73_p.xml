<p>We respectfully note that we report results of a bulk RNA-seq experiment and use the PCA solely to capture major components of variation. uMAP and tSNE are more sophisticated dimensionality reduction techniques used primarily to deal with visualization of complex, and most commonly single cell, relationships. With our simpler data, we are unclear what the benefit would be of using these methods for further exploration of sample relationships. Perhaps incorporating PCA plots into Figure 1, as requested, should clarify how the PCA results were used and interpreted and address this point.</p>

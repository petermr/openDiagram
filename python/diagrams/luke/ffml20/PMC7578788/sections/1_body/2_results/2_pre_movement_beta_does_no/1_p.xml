 </sup> . As we had access to the endpoint errors in the human task (but not in the cats), we were able to assess whether pre-movement beta signals also carry information regarding reach accuracy. Regression of the trial-by-trial pre-movement beta power and the subsequent endpoint error magnitude found no significant effect in either contralateral: F(1,593) = 2.55, p = 0.111; or ipsilateral: F(1,602) = 1.95, p = 0.163; signals. Therefore, changes to the pre-movement beta power do not scale with the experienced behavioural errors.

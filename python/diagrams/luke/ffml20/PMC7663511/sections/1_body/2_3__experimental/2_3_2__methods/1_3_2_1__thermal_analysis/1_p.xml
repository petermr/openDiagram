<p>The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of pure DOX was recorded using Netzsch DSC 204 F1 Phoenix in the temperature range 20–600 °C and heating rate of 5 deg/min. The thermogravimetric analysis experiments were carried out in non-oxidizing (100% nitrogen) or oxidizing (5% oxygen, 95% nitrogen) atmosphere at the heating rate of 10 deg/min using TA Instruments Q50. The temperature range of the experiments was 25–800°C for the nitrogen atmosphere and 25–900 °C for the oxidizing atmosphere.</p>

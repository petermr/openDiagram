<p>Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation, unless otherwise shown. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The differentially expressed PCGs and lncRNAs were identified using an unpaired t-test. The difference in mRNA and lncRNA expression level between the two groups was assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test with GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software). Kaplan-Meier analysis of PFS was conducted using the log-rank or the Renyi test (when there was survival curve crossover between the observed groups) using the R packages ‘survival’ and ‘survMisc’ in R (3.5.1). P&lt;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.</p>

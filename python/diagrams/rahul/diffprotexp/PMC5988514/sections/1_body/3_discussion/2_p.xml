<p id="par0110">The mass spectrometric assessment of protein changes in benign, CV-PTC and FV-PTC samples correlated with histological and pathological features of thyroid tumors. More than 2500 protein identifications in 18 samples form detailed proteomic analysis of thyroid tumors. Ongoing discussions about FV-PTC and reclassification of noninvasive FV-PTC as “NIFTP” attracted much attention in thyroid pathology. Our mass spectrometric analysis on this subject provides the most comprehensive understanding of FV-PTC cases to date. Additionally, all the CV-PTC samples included in our study were free of lymph node metastasis. This is important as our results can help to explain the less aggressive characteristics of CV-PTC when compared with the FV-PTC and benign tissues.</p>

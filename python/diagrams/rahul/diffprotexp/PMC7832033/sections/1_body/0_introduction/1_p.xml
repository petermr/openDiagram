<p>Melioidosis is a severe infectious disease caused by 
 <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, a Gram-negative bacterium and biothreat agent [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease is highly endemic in the tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia and northern Australia but reported cases are increasing globally. Melioidosis carries a mortality rate of 40% or higher in many endemic regions where resources are limited. This poor outcome from melioidosis has remained unchanged for many years [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Melioidosis is associated with several host factors, but diabetes is the major risk [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pneumonia and bacteremia are the most common manifestations of disease; infections of these systems are frequently associated with septic shock and contribute to high mortality [

 <caption> Tissue proteome analysis identifies CeD patients with strong mucosal response to gluten. A) Schematic presentation of the study. B) Principle component analysis (PCA) plot of total tissue samples based on expression of 4301 proteins. Each point represents one biopsy ( n = 35). Number shows Marsh score for biopsy. C) Differential expression of total tissue proteins after versus before challenge. D) Principle component analysis plot of epithelial cell layer samples based on expression of 2404 proteins from two independent experiments. Each point represents one laser capture microdissected sample ( n = 49 from 23 biopsies). Number indicates patient biopsy. Color indicates responder classification from (B). E) Differential expression of epithelial proteins after versus before challenge. C,E) Two‐sample Student t‐test, FDR = 0.05, Benjamini Hochberg adjusted. Significant proteins ( P &lt; 0.01) for “Responders” are indicated in blue (up) and red (down). </caption>

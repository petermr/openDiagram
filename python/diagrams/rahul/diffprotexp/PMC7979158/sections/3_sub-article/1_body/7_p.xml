<p>Your manuscript provides a comprehensive study of the effects of maternal immune activation (MIA) using a rigorous and carefully validated MIA model. A major strength of the manuscript is the investigation of changes across time. The results are of broad interest to the fields of developmental neuroscience and neurodevelopmental disorders, where MIA is a risk factor for schizophrenia and autism. Despite these strengths, there are significant problems that limit the potential impact of the results. There are areas in which additional support is needed for the conclusions and the authors should be careful to state conclusions that are supported by specific experimental results.</p>

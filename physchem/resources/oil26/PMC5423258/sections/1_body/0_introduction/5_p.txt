1: Heartwood essential oil of  C. decurrens was studied, it was found that  p-cymene and  p-menthane derivatives were the main components ( 20).
2: Von Rudloff ( 21) reported that leaf oil of  C. decurrens from the pacific northwest, USA, was dominated by limonene (31.31%), -3-carene (21%) and -pinene (9.2%) while Robert & Sanko ( 22) proved that the oils of  C. decurrens from two populations in Oregon and one disjunct population in southern California were high in -3 carene (15.20%- 20.00%), limonene (18.21-23.62%), -pinene (8.7-15.8%), terpinolene (5.72- 8.01%), -fenchyl acetate (3,5- 9.71%) and cedrol (0.8- 1.2%) ( 21, 22).

0: The test process consists of the following steps: aPrecycle: cycle at 20 C, 0.03 C rate, voltage range 3.54.95 V for 10 cycles, and read battery capacity information after battery charging and discharging cycle curve is stable.bFull charging: charge to 4.95 V at a constant current of 0.1 C, set as 100% state of charge, that is, 0% SOD.cOCV test: first, balance the battery at 20 C for 20 h and record the open-circuit voltage.
1: Then, repeat the process at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 20 C for 2 h at each step.dAdjusting SOD: charge the cell fully and then discharge at 0.1 C to the target SOD in one step.

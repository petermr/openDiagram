<p id="Par50">Here, we report evidence of conflicting ISR pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling in HTR-8/SVneo cells after 12 h of 20 µM DCVC treatment, highlighting both compensatory and pathological processes at play. The differential gene expression analysis revealed many upregulated ATF4 transcriptional gene targets involved in compensatory responses including metabolism, redox balance, amino acid transport, general stress response and autophagy (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). Additionally, we observed no change in cell cycle progression or proliferation, suggesting that, overall, the cells were compensating for DCVC-induced stress after 12 h of exposure. These results are consistent with several of our previous studies that demonstrated simultaneous DCVC-induced pathogenic signaling and functional compensation in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Specifically, prior work demonstrated DCVC-induced altered macronutrient and metabolic pathway utilization despite no overall change in ATP levels (Elkin et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that treatment with 20 µM DCVC for 12 h encompasses a critical molecular signaling transition in which, cell death signaling increases despite ongoing compensation, but without concomitant functional consequences.

<p id="Par25">In depression and anxiety disorders, chronic stress is generally believed to be an adverse risk factor. Accordingly, researchers utilized the CMS protocol to generate depressive and anxious behaviors in rats

 </sup>. In our previously established CMS model, the three different phenotypes (depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible) of the stressed rats have been identified based on behavioral testing

This model offered a valuable way for the identification of unique and common molecular features of vulnerability and resiliency to depression or anxiety, thereby contributing to translational biomedical research. Investigating the protein expression profiles linked to the three different behavioral phenotypes can offer new insights into our knowledge of clinical anxiety and depression disorders.

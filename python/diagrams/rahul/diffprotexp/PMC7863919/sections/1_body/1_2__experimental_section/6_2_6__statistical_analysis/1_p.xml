<p>Datasets of quantitative variables were tested for the normal distribution with Shapiro-Wilk test. Variables with normal distribution were analyzed with two-sided unpaired t-test, while a two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test was used when normal distribution was not verified. Exact Fisher’s test was used for the analysis of proportions. Significance threshold of α = 0.05 was adopted. For the identification of differentially expressed miRNAs and genes, 
 <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The Spearman correlation method was used for correlation analysis. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.07 (GraphPad Software). Hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted with Cluster 3.0, and the results were visualized using TreeView 1.6 software (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA).

<p>During the experiment, animals treated with AcEO at 2 g/kg, showed several signs of intoxication like: hyperactivity succeeded by asthenia, tremors, convulsion and irregular breathing, yet, all these signs disappeared after the first 24 h. The same dose provoked minimal lethality (one animal dead), marked by an intense ulceration of gastric mucosa. However, no significant changes have been observed in organs and body weights monitored during 2 weeks succeeding AcEO injection.</p>

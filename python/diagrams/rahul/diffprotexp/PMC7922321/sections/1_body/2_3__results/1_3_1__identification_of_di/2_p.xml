<p>Analysis of the transcriptome profiles of these glioma samples yielded a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the performance of the differential expression levels in discriminating the tumor cells from non-tumor cells was verified through principal component analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>). According to the PCA analysis, it was found that, while non-tumor and glioma samples were readily separated, discrimination of glioma stages was less pronounced; grade 2 and grade 4 gliomas were relatively separate, however, grade 3 tumor samples were not clearly separated from the other tumor groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Therefore, any outlier data were eliminated for differential gene expression analysis. According to differential gene expression analysis, 8402 of 19,225 genes were found to be significantly changed (with adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change &gt; 0.6 thresholds) in the tumor samples (grades 2–4) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Up- and downregulated genes in all three grades of gliomas were obtained by differential gene expression analysis, and the volcano plot was used to visualize the DEGs, which shows that the distribution of differentially expressed genes was compatible (

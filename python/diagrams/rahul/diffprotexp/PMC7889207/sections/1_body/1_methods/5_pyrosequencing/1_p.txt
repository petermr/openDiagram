0: The PyroMark Q96 ID Pyrosequencing System (Qiagen, Seoul, South Korea) was used to determine the methylation status of six CpG sites within  Slc27a3 which was differentially expressed in VAT.
1: Slc27a3 pyrosequencing primers (Rn_Slc27a3_01_PM PyroMark CpG assay) were pre-designed and purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany).
2: Prior to pyrosequencing, quantity and quality of amplicons were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
3: Visceral (100 g) adipose samples were bisulphite converted using the EpiTect DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per the manufacturers recommendations.
4: A thermal cycler was used to convert the DNA with two cycles of denaturation at 95C for 5 minutes and incubation at 60C for 10 minutes, followed by column-based DNA clean-up.
5: PCR of 25 ng bisulphite converted DNA was carried out using the PyroMark PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) under the following PCR conditions: 95C for 15 minutes; 45 x (95C for 30 seconds; 56C for 30 seconds; 72C for 30 seconds) and 72C for 5 minutes.
6: PCR reactions were carried out in a Veriti 96-well Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and the quality and size of amplicons were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
7: Pyrosequencing was carried out using the PyroMark Gold Q96 Reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, USA) on a PyroMark ID pyrosequencer (Qiagen, Seoul, South Korea), and the methylation level was calculated using the PyroMark Q96 software (Version 1.0.10; Qiagen) program.
8: All pyrosequencing assays were validated using different ratios of methylated:unmethylated bisulphite converted DNA (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90 and 100%) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), from which standard curves were constructed to determine primer sensitivity (Figure S1).
9: Each pyrosequencing run contained no template negative controls and bisulphite conversion controls were incorporated within each assay sequence to assess conversion efficiency.

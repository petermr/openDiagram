<p id="Par20">Total RNA was obtained independently from three biological replicates of phloem and xylem root samples of two 
 <italic>Daucus carota</italic> L genotypes: ‘Nightbird’, a purple root hybrid (purple phloem and xylem) and ‘Musica’, a non-anthocyanin pigmentated root hybrid. Plants were germinated from seeds and roots were collected after 12 weeks. Frozen samples were grinded using liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent® (Sigma-Aldrich) and purified using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). RNA samples were quantified, and purity measured using a spectrophotometer (AmpliQuant AQ-07). RNA integrity and potential genomic DNA contaminations were checked through agarose gel electrophoresis.

<p>Compared with other organs, arginine is not only a substrate for milk protein synthesis, but also is involved in the formation of mammary glands in cells. As a functional amino acid, arginine can promote cell proliferation in two ways: as a semi-essential amino acid for cell growth; or through promoting the synthesis of nitric oxide [

 <xref rid="B10-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that arginine could promote the proliferation of bovine mammary epithelial cells in vitro. The study shows that enhanced supply of arginine can activate mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways to improve milk protein synthesis [

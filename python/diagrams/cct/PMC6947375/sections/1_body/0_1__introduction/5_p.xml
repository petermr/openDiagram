<p>Since the combination of plastic deformation and phase transformation shows great potential to improve mechanical properties of bulk steels, in this study, spheroidization annealing, cold rolling, recrystallization annealing, cold drawing, and stress-relief annealing were conducted on 1.0C-1.5Cr bearing steel. We aimed to establish the relationship between mechanical properties and microstructures of the 1.0C-1.5Cr bearing steel and then drew an improvement map of the steel for industrial applications. In addition, a simulation based on Deform software was performed to investigate the evolution of stress and strain during the cold rolling process of the Cr-containing high carbon steel.</p>

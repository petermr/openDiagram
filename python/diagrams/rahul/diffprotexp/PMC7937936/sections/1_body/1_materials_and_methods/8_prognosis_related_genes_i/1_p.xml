<p>First, Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify the genes associated with prognosis. A forest plot was constructed based on the Cox analysis. 
 <italic>P &lt;</italic>0.05 indicated a significant association with prognosis. Hazard Ratio (HR) &gt;1 indicated a high-risk gene. Kaplanâ€“Meier test was also used. Patients were divided into two groups with high and low expression according to the median value of gene expression to compare whether there was a difference in survival between them. The genes that were significant by both methods were used as the final prognosis-related genes.

<p id="Par56">From the 199,074 total contigs, 188,823 passed the filters established for the GDEA (see Materials and Methods) and revealed 19,352 DETs with highly significant differential expression (False Discovery Rate: FDR &lt; 0.001, Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; |3|) between apomictic and sexual samples (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Most of the them (13,205; 68%) resulted upregulated in apomictic libraries (positive Log
 <sub>2</sub>FCs), while only 6147 (32%) were upregulated in sexual ones (negative Log
 <sub>2</sub>FCs) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). A heat map based on transcripts per million (TPM) values shows the general picture of sense transcripts expression patterns in both apomictic and sexual libraries (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, A). Similar analyses involving antisense reads showed they targeted only 11,417 transcripts (6.04%) and, in most cases, covered only part of the sequences. The GDEA performed with these sequences (based on the number of reads mapped onto the GTA) showed only 100 differentially expressed antisense transcripts (DEATs) (FDR &lt; 0.05, Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; |3|). Fifty-five of them (55%) were upregulated in the apomictic libraries and 45 (45%) in the sexual one (Additional files

 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). A heat map showing the number of counts mapped onto the differentially represented transcripts revealed the general antisense expression patterns based on TPM values for both apomictic and sexual libraries (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, B). A comparison among DETs and DEATs revealed 18 transcripts common to both differential expression analyses.

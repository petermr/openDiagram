<p>Although significant advancements on both battery architectures have been achieved during the past few years, still major challenges remain unsolved. In this report, we review the recent progresses for the development and advancement in the area of sodium metal‐based air battery systems and attempt to summarize and answer critical questions. First, the concept and operation principle of sodium metal‐based air batteries that include nonaqueous Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> battery and hybrid Na–air battery will be discussed. We will clarify the difference in their cell design and their electrochemical redox processes followed by a brief discussion on Na‐ion conducting membrane and anode. Second, the relevant published reports will be briefly explained which mainly involves different explored air electrodes for hybrid Na–air battery. Finally, a brief discussion will be provided whether hybrid Na–air cell can outperform the nonaqueous Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> cell and the challenges associated with it.

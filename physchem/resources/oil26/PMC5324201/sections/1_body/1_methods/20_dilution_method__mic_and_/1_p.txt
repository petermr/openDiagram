0: Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) assays were carried out on the essential oil by the macro-dilution method [ 21,  22].
1: The essential oil was dissolved in 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain 10% (w/v) solution.
2: For MIC test of the selected bacteria, the essential oil was first diluted in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth in screw capped tubes containing broth medium in the concentration of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.25 g/mL.
3: Bacterial suspensions of the test organism were prepared in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth.
4: 1 mL of the dilution was added to each sterilized screw capped tube containing 1 mL of sample suitably diluted in the sterilized broth medium to give a final volume of 2 mL.
5: A culture medium without sample (solvent DMSO) was used as a negative control.
6: Ciprofloxacin (1000.191 g/mL.)
7: was used as positive control.
8: Tubes were incubated aerobically at 37 C for 18 h and the growth was indicated by turbidity.
9: The lowest concentration (preventing visible growth indicated by no turbidity) was identified as the MIC and expressed in g/mL.
10: The complete absence of growth was considered as the MBC [ 23].
11: To confirm the results of MBC, 10 L of the experimental suspensions (withdrawn from the tubes with no growth) were subcultured on TSA (Tryptone Soy Agar) plates.
12: The Plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h. It showed no bacterial growth, which was taken as the MBC.
13: Values were recorded as g/mL.

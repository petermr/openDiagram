<p>The microstructural and physico-chemical properties of silicon microparticles were studied as a promising and non-expensive lithium ion battery anode material. The commercial silicon powder was used as a starting material. The ball-milling silicon powder resulted in the negligible enhancement of average pore and silicon domain size. The metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) of starting Si material resulted in the significant increase of average pore size (from 0.56 to 3.44 nm), which is large enough for the solvated lithium ions to pass easily through the pores. The large pore size makes the MACE sample very promising for use as a lithium ion battery anode material, which is confirmed by the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling measurements. The MACE treated sample BatS3 possessed the highest charge value and good efficiency over 700 cycles.</p>

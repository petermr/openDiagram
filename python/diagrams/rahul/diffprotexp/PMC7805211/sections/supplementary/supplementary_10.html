  <caption> Additional file5: Figure S7. Arbitrary set of five patient sample copy number variation from CNF and PNFs demonstrate focal amplifications and deletions. A set of five patient samples from the CNF and PNF lesion groups are plotted to show focal amplifications and deletions in both sample groups. Each dot corresponds to a 50kb bin and blue lines are segments across multiple bins to indicate larger scale amplifications and deletions. Scale is log2 relative to normal tissue types: CNF relative to normal skin; PNF relative to normal nerve. All data were analyzed using SeSAMe. </caption>

0: The intact  ACPT sequences (human, cow, tenrec) were used for identifying inactivating mutations (including mutation of initiation codons, frame-shift insertions and deletions, premature stop codons, splice sites mutation of intron/exon boundary (GT/AG), etc.).
1: The inactivating mutation was identified based on BLAST searches against whole genomes of the relevant taxon from NCBI.
2: The information on gene function, related key amino acid sites/domains was searched from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ( http://www.uniprot.org/) and some references.

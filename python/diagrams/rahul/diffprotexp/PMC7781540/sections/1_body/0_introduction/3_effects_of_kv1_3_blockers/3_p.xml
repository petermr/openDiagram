<p>Various studies by other groups confirmed that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers reduce pro-inflammatory microglia functions when using similar stimuli or stimuli associated with other inflammatory pathologies. For example, in cultured rat microglia activated with the HIV Tat protein or with glycoprotein 120 (gp120) to simulate HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder, K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition or knockdown with siRNA was found to reduce IL-1β, TNF-α and NO production and suppressed neurotoxicity [

 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition shifted the microglial phenotype from a pro-inflammatory M1-like to an M2-like response and reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation [

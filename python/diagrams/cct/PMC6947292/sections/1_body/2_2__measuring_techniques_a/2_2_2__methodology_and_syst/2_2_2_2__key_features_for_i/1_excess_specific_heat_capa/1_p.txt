0: To allow for quantitative analysis of solid-solid phase transitions, very sensitive measurement setups are required.
1: To obtain the best possible DSC sensitivity for this particular purpose, and to allow a purposeful comparison of different heating rates and sample masses, the experimental setup needs to allow for conversion of the measured signals to the specific excess heat capacity of the sample.
2: When studying precipitation reactions, the contribution of the heat capacity can be subtracted during the measurement by using inert reference samples [ 121].
3: In the following, the apparent heat capacity due to precipitation (latent heat) in addition to the heat capacity of the matrix is called excess heat capacity.
4: Figure 6 clarifies the difference between a conventional measurement of sample heat capacity ( Figure 6A) and a measurement of the specific excess heat capacity ( Figure 6B).
5: The heat capacity (measurement setup sample versus an empty reference sensor) can be considered as the sum of the heat capacity that increases with temperature and the apparent heat capacity caused by the latent heat effects due to precipitation.
6: In the case of an alloy that shows any kind of phase transformation, the measured apparent heat capacity is a sum of the heat capacity and the effects due to heat or enthalpy release/consumption by the occurring phase transition.
7: The latter, of course, has a dependence on temperature and time.

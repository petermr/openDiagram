<p id="Par47">To further verify the reliability of these identified miRNA-mRNA pairs related to Tartary buckwheat seed development, we carried out qRT-PCR and 5â€²-RLM-RACE analyses for among 6 miRNA-mRNA pairs that are involved in seed size, cell differentiation and proliferation, and auxin response. These results showed that the expression of these miRNAs and their corresponding target genes were obviously negatively related and could cleave their corresponding target genes. The above results indicated that these identified miRNA-mRNA pairs could be considered as the candidate miRNA-mRNA pairs for regulating the development of Tartary buckwheat seed, and also suggested that combining small RNA and transcriptome analysis is an effective method for identifying key miRNAs that are involved in plant seed development.</p>

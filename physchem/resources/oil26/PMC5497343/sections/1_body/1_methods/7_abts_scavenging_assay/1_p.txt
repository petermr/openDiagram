0: ABTS test was determined following the modified method of Kannan et al., [ 26].
1: Briefly, stock solutions was prepared by mixing two stock solutions (1:1  v/v) ratio of potassium persulfate (2.45 mM) and ABTS (7.0 mM), incubated in a dark cupboard for 720 min at ambient temperature.
2: One microliter of ABTS+ solution was diluted by adding methanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.708  0.002 unites when measured at 734 nm with spectrophotometer.
3: Briefly, 100 L of the essential oil or standards prepared in methanol of various concentration ranging from 0.030.5 mg/mL was added into all the wells of microtiter plate starting from (C-H) in triplicates except for A (A1-A12) and B (B1-B12).
4: Thereafter, 100 L of ABTS+ solution was then added to all the wells starting from C-H and the solution was incubated for 7 min and absorbance was taken at 734 nm using spectrophotometer.
5: The percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula stated above.

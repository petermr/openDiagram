(2) Nine branch categories to terminal branches with unique inactivating mutations (baleen whales), which lacks teeth. (3) Three branch categories to terminal branches with unique inactivating mutations (pygmy sperm whale, nine-banded armadillo and aardvark), whose enamel has been vestigial. (4) One branch categories were assigned for stem Mysticeti where mineralized teeth were degraded. (5) One branch categories were assigned for crown Mysticeti.</p>

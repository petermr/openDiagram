<p>In the results, we present b estimates (or exp(b) for count variables) along with the 95% CI for continuous predictors. For categorical predictors, we made pairwise comparisons using estimated marginal means and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the least significant difference. Standard errors are based on 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4 aardvarks unless otherwise indicated. We considered 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 to indicate statistically significant results. Due to the large number of pairwise comparisons, we only present values for statistically significant results for comparisons that we thought answered the project questions. Please see the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01433">supplemental materials</xref> for all other pairwise comparisons.

<p>In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, a total of 962 DeRBPs were found to be dysregulated in tumor tissues. To further unearth RBPs highly correlated with tongue cancer, we searched genes in both DeRBPs list and the black/tan modules. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E, 171 overlapped differential co-expression RBP (DceRBP) genes were identified as tumor or normal highly correlated dysregulated RBPs. As suggested in functional annotation analysis using the R clusterProfiler package, these RBPs were mainly enriched in terms of various metabolic process (BP), focal adhesion and cell-substrate junction (CC), and multiple cell adhesion molecule binding (MF) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>A). In addition, KEGG analysis dramatically enriched these RBPs into terms of various metabolism related processes (Carbon metabolism, Glycolysis, HIF-1 signaling pathway, Biosynthesis of amino acids, and Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton, Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, Focal adhesion, and Tight junction (

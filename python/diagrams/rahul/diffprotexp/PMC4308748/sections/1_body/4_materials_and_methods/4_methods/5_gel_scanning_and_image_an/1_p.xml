<p>Cy2, Cy3, Cy5 dye-labeled images were scanned using a Typhoon 9410 scanner (Amersham Pharmacia, Cambridge, England) at a wavelength of 488/520 nm, 532/580 nm, and 633/670 nm respectively. All gel images were analyzed using DeCyder software v5.02 (Amersham Pharmacia, NJ, USA). Changes in each protein spot were observed at each time point after ischemia/reperfusion. Differentially expressed protein spots were compared and screened.</p>

<p>We have previously shown that EAEC strain 55989 expressing AAF/III fimbriae forms smaller aggregates on cultured cells than a Stx2 phage-cured 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O104:H4 strain expressing AAF/I [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This raised the question whether the different types of fimbriae confer phenotypically distinguishable traits that may have added to the exceptionally high virulence of EHEC O104:H4. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref> shows a schematic representation of the genetic organization of the AAF-encoding gene clusters I, III, IV, and V (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(a</xref>)) and a comparison of the amino acid sequence identities of the subunits of AAF/I, IV, and V in respect to the subunits of AAF/III (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(b</xref>)). The amino acid sequences of the chaperones, ushers, and minor subunits showed medium to high amino acid sequence similarity, whereas the major fimbrial subunits were apparently highly variable and showed low to very low similarities. The subunits of the AAF/II fimbriae of prototypic EAEC strain 042 were like the AAF/I subunits of EHEC O104:H4 isolate LB226692 less similar to AAF/III than AAF/V and more similar to AAF/III than AAF/IV with respect to amino acid sequence. They were, however, not encoded in a single operon (data not shown). We therefore decided to focus on AAF variants /I, /III, /IV, and/V and investigated whether AAF/I fimbriae expressed by the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain possess different adhesive properties than closely and more distantly related AAF fimbriae of EAEC isolates.

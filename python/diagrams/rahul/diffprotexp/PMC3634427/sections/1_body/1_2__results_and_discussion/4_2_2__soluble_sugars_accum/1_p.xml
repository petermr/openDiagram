<p>The measured levels of the main carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, sucrose) are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-14-04912">Figure 2</xref>. The concentration of fructose, glucose and sucrose is higher in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> compared to Désirée. These three metabolites increase significantly in concentration under cold treatment in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> as compared to their control. Fructose content is stable in plants exposed to osmotic stress. Sucrose concentration is significantly higher in plants of 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> treated with sucrose. Glucose content increased in Désirée plants when treated with sucrose and sorbitol.

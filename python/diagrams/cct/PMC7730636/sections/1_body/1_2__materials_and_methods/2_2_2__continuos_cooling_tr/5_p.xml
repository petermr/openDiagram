<p>Samples were made in form of cylinder with diameter of 4 mm and length of 10 mm. Each experiment was repeated 4 times, and averages were calculated to obtain relevant values. The CCT diagram also shows the resulting hardness values, which were measured using Instron Wolpert (Instron, Norwood, MA, USA) hardness tester. Vickers method HV5 was used with load 50 N. Hardness was measured 5 times on each sample.</p>

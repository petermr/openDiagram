<p id="Par6">The modern theory of the structure of these phases is based around electronic structure calculations. The early work involved calculating the ground state, assuming classical nuclei, then adding quantum-nuclear effects via the quasiharmonic approximation. This methodology, whether based on DFT or QMC, predicts hcp-like ground states for Phases I–III in agreement with X-ray data. However the spectroscopic signature of the Phase II—the appearance of many sharp, low-frequency, and peaks

 </sup>—is not well reproduced by the quasiharmonic calculations. As explained in the previous paragraph, the likely cause is a failure of the harmonic mode assumption for excited states, rather than the DFT itself.

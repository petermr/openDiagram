<p>To further explore the different functions among the ASCs derived from three adipose deposits, we performed multilevel analyses including pathway maps, GO processes, and process networks with downregulated DEGs. First, common downregulated DEGs were enriched in the classical complement pathway about pathway maps, response to organic substance about GO processes, and complement system about process networks. Second, the unique downregulated DEGs of PASCs were involved in SCAP/SREBP transcriptional control of cholesterol and FA biosynthesis about pathway maps, response to oxygen-containing compound about GO processes, and feeding and neurohormone signaling about process networks. Third, the unique downregulated DEGs of EASCs were most relevant to oncostatin M signaling

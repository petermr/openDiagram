<p id="Par47">We assayed aggression in 24 males (8 control and 16 T) once they reached sexual maturity, which occurs ~ 60 days post-hatch [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] (mean age = 138 days ±14 SE; mean mass = 15.02 g ± 0.35 SE). Aggression scores were assigned in individual conspecific intrusion trials. Subjects were isolated in a cage for 2 days to establish residency, after which a novel same-sex individual of similar mass (± 1.0 g) was placed in the subject’s cage for 15 min between 0700 and 1200 h. Observations to score aggression were carried out blindly with respect to treatment. The aggression score is the number of aggressive actions performed by the subject toward the intruder during the 15 min period. Aggressive actions included bill fencing (jab with bill), displacement (driving intruder off a perch), and chasing (following displaced bird) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. There were no instances in which the intruder aggressively attacked the resident. We performed two trials for each individual on separate days (~ 48 days apart ±5 SE) with novel intruders to determine repeatability of aggressive behaviors (proportion of variance accounted for by individual differences). We calculated repeatability using a poisson model for count data [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] in R (version 3.5.2). The model was run for 1000 bootstrap repeats. We used a LMM with natal nest ID as the random effect to determine if average aggression score was affected by treatment or laying order.

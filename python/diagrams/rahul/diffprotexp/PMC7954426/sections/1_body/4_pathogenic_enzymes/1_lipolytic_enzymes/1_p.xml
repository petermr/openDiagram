<p>Several mycoplasmas express multiple lipolytic enzymes, including lipase, phospholipase, and other forms, which are necessary for mycoplasma metabolism, and are also involved in a variety of pathogenic processes. 
 <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> P65 surface lipoprotein is a lipolytic enzyme with lipase and esterase activities that can hydrolyze short-chain fatty acids on the host cell membrane as its own energy source, but its pathogenic role remains unknown [
 <xref rid="cit0235" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> surface-localized heparin-binding hypothetical adhesin MilA is an immunoreactive, multifunctional enzyme that comprises lipase, ATPase, lipid-binding, and glycosaminoglycan-binding activities, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. 
 <italic>milA</italic> homologues have been found in the genomes of numerous mycoplasmas, including 
 <italic>M. agalactiae, M. fermentans, M. hyopneumoniae, M. arginini</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic>. The presence of the Lipase_GDSL_2 motif is a common characteristic of these 
 <italic>milA</italic> homologous genes [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, comparative genome sequencing manifested that some lipase homologous genes have also been found in 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic>, but their functions in pathogenesis remain to be fully understood.

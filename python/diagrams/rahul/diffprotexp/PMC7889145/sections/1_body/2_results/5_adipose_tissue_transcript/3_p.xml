<p>The transgene passenger gene 
 <italic>Kng2</italic> did not have altered gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>) and the neighbouring gene 
 <italic>Kng1</italic> only had gene expression changes in BAT, with an approximately 15-fold higher expression in BAT, though total expression was low (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>). The remaining passenger genes 
 <italic>Eif4a2</italic> and 
 <italic>Rfc4</italic> had gene expression that was consistently and significantly elevated in BAT, iWAT and pgWAT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(c-d)</xref>), and these changes may potentiate the differential gene expression changes identified in the adipose tissues. 
 <italic>Adipoq</italic> gene expression was not altered in any of the adipose tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3e</xref>) which is consistent with insertion of the 
 <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase coding sequence into the start codon of 
 <italic>Adipoq</italic> within the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene. 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> gene expression was reduced 30â€“40%, providing additional evidence for the disruption of one copy of the 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> gene on chromosome 9 by the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">figure 3f</xref>). As the expression of 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> is important in development [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], gene expression changes were determined for 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> and BAC passenger genes in heart, kidney, liver, and brain. Additionally, heart and liver weight were assessed. No differences were found in organ weight or gene expression except 
 <italic>Kng2</italic> was significantly increased in the kidney (Supplemental Figure 2A-E).

  <title>Enrichment and purification heterocysts in 
   <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120.
  </title>
  <p>(A1 and A2) Filaments only consisting of vegetative cells under nitrogen-replete condition. A2 is an enlarged view of black square in A1. (B1 and B2) Filaments consisting of vegetative cells and heterocysts under nitrogen deprivation condition. B2 is an enlarged view of black square in B1. (C1 and C2) The filaments were treated with lysozyme followed by centrifuge. The picture shows the mixture of heterocysts and residual vegetative cells in the sediment. The supernatant was used to extract mRNA from vegetative cells. C2 is an enlarged view of black square in C1. (D1 and D2) Pure heterocysts for RNA extraction. D2 is an enlarged view of black square in D1. Black and blue arrows show vegetative cells and heterocysts respectively.</p>

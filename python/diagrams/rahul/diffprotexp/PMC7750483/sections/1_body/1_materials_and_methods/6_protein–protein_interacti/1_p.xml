<p>We analyzed the network of interactions between proteins by using the STRING and Cytoscape software. The STRING database is a meta resource, including both physical and functional interactions (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>). STRING can be reached at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://string-db.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://string-db.org/</ext-link>. The minimum required interaction score is set to medium confidence and select all active interaction sources. Cytoscape is a public software that can integrate models of biomolecular interaction networks (

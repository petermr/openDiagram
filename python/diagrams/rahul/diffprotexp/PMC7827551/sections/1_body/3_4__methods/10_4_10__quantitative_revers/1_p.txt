0: ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) were used, following the manufacturers recommendations for the synthesis of the cDNA.
1: The reaction was carried out using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo) following the manufacturers instructions.
2: The same primers used in the traditional PCR were used together with these primers as internal standards; 5-CGTTCCTCGACCTCATCCA-3 and 5-GCCCTTGGTGTAGTCGAACTTC-3 (for  sigA); 5-ATTGCGTATGACGAAGAGGCCCG-3 and 5-TTCTTCTCCAGGACGACGTTGCG-3 (for  groL) [ 42, 43].
3: The reactions were done with the CFX Connect Real-Time System (Bio-Rad).
4: Relative gene expression was detected from a calculated threshold cycle (CT) and then normalized versus  sigA and  groL as internal standards.
5: Our reaction was performed for three biological and three technical replicates.

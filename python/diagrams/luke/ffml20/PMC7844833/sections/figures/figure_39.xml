   </sub> catalysts. Potential-dependent changes in the Co K-edge position and corresponding estimated Co oxidation state are shown. (b) Evolution of the Co–O interatomic distance under applied potential as obtained from the fitting of Co K-edge EXAFS data collected with the freeze-quench approach at pH = 7.

(d, e) Evolution of the O K-edge XAS spectra for four model catalysts. The spectra collected before and after OER conditioning are shown in panels d and e, respectively. Shaded regions in panel e highlight the XANES features at 530.5 and 531.5 eV. Corresponding structure models of the as-prepared catalysts are shown in panel f.

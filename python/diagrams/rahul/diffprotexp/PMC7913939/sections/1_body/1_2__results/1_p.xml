 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Young animals (e.g., after 3 months) exhibited no significant behavioral differences. Therefore, we expected the potential changes between both groups at a later time point. Animals older than 12–14 months generally showed age-related deficits (also in WT mice). That is why we considered 9 months of age as an optimal time point for our study.

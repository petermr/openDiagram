The oldest ToxB-sensitive accession identified was the spring variety &#8216;Thatcher&#8217; (released in the USA in 1934), followed by &#8216;Aronde&#8217; (France, 1962) and &#8216;Maris Dove&#8217; (UK, 1971). Analysis of the pedigree found three varieties to act as &#8216;hubs&#8217; for frequent transmission of ToxB sensitivity: (1) &#8216;Xi19&#8217; (UK, year of release&#8201;=&#8201;2000, sensitivity&#8201;=&#8201;2.9) had six sensitive descendants (&#8216;Cocoon&#8217;, &#8216;Cubanita&#8217;, &#8216;Curlew&#8217;, &#8216;Gallant&#8217;, &#8216;KWS Curlew&#8217; and &#8216;Panorama&#8217;), collectively representing 15% of the sensitive European varieties identified. (2) &#8216;Cordiale&#8217; (UK, 2001, sensitivity&#8201;=&#8201;1.2) had 12 sensitive descendants, representing around a quarter of ToxB-sensitive accessions. (3) The winter wheat variety &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; (UK, 1997), parent or grandparent of 12 sensitive varieties, representing 27% of all ToxB-sensitive lines identified. Despite its prominence in the pedigree of ToxB-sensitive varieties, &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; was found to be insensitive. All three &#8216;hub&#8217; varieties shared features in common: all were formally found to have ToxB-insensitive parents, and all had &#8216;Cadenza&#8217; or a sib of &#8216;Cadenza&#8217; listed as one of their parents (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It should be noted that &#8216;Maris Dove&#8217; and its progeny &#8216;Axona&#8217; are sensitive, and &#8216;Axona&#8217; is a parent of &#8216;Cadenza&#8217;. Together, this indicated the most plausible transmission route of ToxB sensitivity to the hub varieties &#8216;Xi19&#8217; and &#8216;Cordiale&#8217; is via &#8216;Cadenza&#8217; breeding lines/sibs still segregating at the <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus<italic>.</italic> As the remaining hub variety &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; has &#8216;Cadenza sib&#8217; as one of its parents, and where data were available, none of the remaining parents for the 12 ToxB-sensitive &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; descendants were found to possess sensitivity, we speculate that &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; germplasm used for breeding was also segregating at <italic>Tsc2</italic>. The assumption of segregation at <italic>Tsc2</italic> in &#8216;Cadenza&#8217; and &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; germplasm used during their early use in breeding results in all but eight of the 46 ToxB-sensitive varieties being linked in a single pedigree, within which ToxB sensitivity arose from &#8216;Maris Dove&#8217;.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>ToxB sensitivity in the context of wheat pedigree information. ToxB-sensitive (score&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1) and insensitive (score&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1) lines are highlighted in red and green, respectively. Lines or steps in the parentage for which no ToxB phenotype data were available are indicated in grey. The varieties &#8216;Cadenza&#8217; (node 6) (and its sibs) and &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; (node 21) are highlighted in orange and are hypothesised here to have segregated for allelic status at the <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus during the early period they were used for breeding, with insensitive alleles having subsequently been fixed in commercially released germplasm for both lines.

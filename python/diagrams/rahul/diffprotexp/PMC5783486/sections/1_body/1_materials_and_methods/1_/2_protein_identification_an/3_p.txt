0: Peptides were separated with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid), and 540% mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile) for 99 min (0.3 ml/min flow rate).
1: MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with the following parameters: MS spectra were acquired across the scan range of 3501,800 m/z in high resolution mode (>35,000) and 100 msec was accumulated per spectrum.
2: A maximum of 20 precursors per cycle were chosen for fragmentation, with 120 msec set as the minimum accumulation time for each precursor and dynamic exclusion for 10 sec.

0: Following euthanasia by rapid decapitation, trunk blood was collected and kept on ice until whole blood could be centrifuged to collect plasma which was stored at -20 C for hormone analysis.
1: Immediately after trunk blood was collected, brains were rapidly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C for later dissection.
2: Euthanasia was performed without the use of anesthesia because decapitation is a very quick method of euthanasia for small animals [ 55] and anesthetic agents can alter brain activity [ 56].
3: To isolate tissues of interest in the brain, we followed the sample preparation guideline in the Songbird Neurogenomics (SoNG) Initiative [ 57].
4: Briefly, optimal cutting temperature compound was used to embed brains, 50 m coronal sections were cut with a cryostat (Leica CM 3050S), and a sterile, disposable 1 mm biopsy punch (Integra, York, PA, USA) was used to make vertical punches to obtain the HYPO and TnA according to the songbird brain atlas [ 58] and ZEBrA database (Zebra Finch Expression Brain Atlas;  http://www.zebrafinchatlas.org) (Supplementary Fig.
5: S3, Additional file  2).
6: The HYPO was identified using the third ventricle, optic chiasm, and ventral supraoptic decussation as landmarks.
7: TnA was identified by following the robust nucleus of the arcopallium in towards the medial surface of the telencephalic lobe adjacent to the cerebellum.
8: Tissue punches were immediately placed on dry ice and stored at -80 C until further processing.

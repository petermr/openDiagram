<p>In the present experiment, ~20% of the animals died due to hemorrhage and arrhythmia caused by ligation of coronary artery at the early stage of reperfusion. When ventricular fibrillation and bleeding were uncontrollable, euthanasia was performed on animals as humane endpoints. Time points of 30 min for ischemia and 2 h for reperfusion were selected for this animal model is sufficient to result in significant histopathological and functional myocardial injury, which can be confirmed using the results of ECG, cTnI, TTC, H&amp;E and Masson staining (

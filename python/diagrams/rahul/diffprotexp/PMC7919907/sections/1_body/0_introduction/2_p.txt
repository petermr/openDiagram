0: Lactoferrin (LF), a naturally occurring, non-toxic iron-binding glycoprotein present in several mucosal secretions, plays an important role in the first line of defence against microbial infections [ 5].
1: It is known that LF has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a wide range of human and animal viruses including both DNA and RNA viruses [ 6, 7].
2: Moreover, the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of LF may have additional benefits in severe infections [ 8].
3: Furthermore, the presence of an intestinal receptor for the uptake of LF following oral administration [ 9], resistance to proteolytic degradation by trypsin and trypsin-like enzymes [ 10], and several established oral delivery systems for LF [ 11], ensures its oral bioavailability.

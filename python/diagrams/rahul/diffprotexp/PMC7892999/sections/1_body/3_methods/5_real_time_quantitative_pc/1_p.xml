<p id="Par24">One microgram of total RNA from each of the 12 carrot samples described above was used for RT-qPCR. Protocols for cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR were performed according to Lijavetzky et al. (2008) using a StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Non-template controls were included for each primer pair, and each RT-qPCR reaction was completed in triplicate. Expression data were normalized against the carrot 
 <italic>actin-7</italic> gene (LOC108202619). Relative quantification was performed by means of the ΔΔCt method using the ‘pcr’ R package

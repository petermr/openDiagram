<italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>), differ across three environments, and whether these effects are mediated by burrow age. To determine this, we examined the impact of burrowing on physical soil properties (soil temperature, moisture and compaction) and vegetation properties (vegetation cover, species richness and vegetation composition) for three different burrow ages (fresh, abandoned and collapsed) at three sites differing considerably in annual precipitation (170&#8211;720&#8201;mm p.a.) and vegetation type (arid scrubland, semi-arid savannah and mesic grassland).

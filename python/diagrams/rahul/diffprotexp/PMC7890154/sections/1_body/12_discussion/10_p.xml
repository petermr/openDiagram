<p id="par0280">According to recent report of FAO, climate change has depleted the essential nutrients from the grains. The integrity of most of the primary metabolites is compromised due to heat stress. We also observed sudden increase in the activity of macromolecule degrading enzymes especially amylases in wheat grains. The elevation in environmental temperature increases the activity of amylases in grains which has adverse effect on grain-quality. MAPK and amylases showed positive correlation in developing grains under HS. The intensity of the stress enhances the expression and activities of MAPK and amylases in crop plants [

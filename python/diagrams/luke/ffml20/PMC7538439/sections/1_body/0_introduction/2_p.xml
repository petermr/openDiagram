 </sup>. The negative slope means that even though the solid is hexagonal “close-packed”, the liquid must be even denser. The turnover also means the liquid has higher compressibility, but how this comes about remains unexplained. X-ray studies at low temperature traversing Phase I–II–III do not show any convincing structural changes, in part because it has proven impossible to get sufficient resolution to determine the molecular orientation

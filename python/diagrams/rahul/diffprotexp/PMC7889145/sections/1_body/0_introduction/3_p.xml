<p>In the process of developing a new mouse model utilizing the publicly available 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse we discovered strong genetic linkage between our gene of interest, 
 <italic>Adam10</italic>, and the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene. This prompted our investigations to identify the location of the transgenic insertion site and any possible functional consequences of the genetic change. We identified the genomic insertion site of the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene, characterized passenger transgene insertion genes, studied adipose tissue transcriptome changes, and the response of 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mice to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding.

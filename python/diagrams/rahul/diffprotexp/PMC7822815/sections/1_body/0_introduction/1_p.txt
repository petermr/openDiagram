0: Alternative splicing increases the transcriptomic and proteomic complexity by generating distinct RNA isoforms with different roles and functions from a single gene 1.
1: When dysregulated, alternative splicing can contribute to tumorigenesis 2,  3.
2: Dysregulation can take place on the level of alternative promoter choice leading the transcripts with altered 5-termini, choice of alternative polyadenylation, and within transcript bodies by changes in splice site selection affecting exon composition or intron retention.
3: Mis-splicing of genes has been found in multiple malignancies including carcinomas, neuroblastoma, chronic lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 4.
4: Mutations in spliceosome factor genes such as  SF3B1, SRSF2, or  U2AF are frequently found in myelodysplastic syndrome and are currently intensively examined for their therapeutic relevance 5  7.

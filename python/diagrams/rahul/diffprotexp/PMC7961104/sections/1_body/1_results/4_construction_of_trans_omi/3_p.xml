In contrast to the liver trans-omic network, there was no phosphorylation-mediated regulation from the Insulin Signal layer to the TF layer in skeletal muscle. The number of increased DEMEs was larger than that of decreased DEMEs in the Enzyme Protein layer, whereas the number of the increased DEMs was smaller than that of the decreased DEMs in the Metabolite layer. For all three types of regulation of enzyme activity—enzyme expression, allosteric regulation, and regulation by substrate or product—the number of activating regulations was larger than that of the inhibiting regulations in skeletal muscle of

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, lower). In contrast to liver with ∼54% of reactions having controversial opposing regulation, skeletal muscle metabolic reactions were more consistently regulated with only 9 of 88 (∼10%) reactions regulated in an opposing manner by changes in the Enzyme Protein and Metabolite layers in skeletal muscle.

0: In order to provide constant gas shielding conditions on the weld bead, a constructional adaptation of the shielding gas nozzles was applied for the experimental trials with increased CTWD.
1: Herein, the increased distance between substrate and contact tube requires a focused gas flow to the weld bead equally to the initial setup.
2: Figure 3b shows the adjustment of the lengths of the shielding gas nozzles for increased CTWD.

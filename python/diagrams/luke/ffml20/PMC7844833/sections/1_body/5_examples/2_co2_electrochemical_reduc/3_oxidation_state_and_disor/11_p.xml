 <italic>operando</italic> studies are thus essential to understand the structure of the catalyst under working conditions. Using

 </sup> EXAFS data analysis suggested that the structure of oxidized Zn is more disordered than that in bulk references due to the lack of a contribution of distant coordination shells.

 </sup> Remarkably, an order of magnitude higher catalytic activity was observed for this nanostructured sample than for bulk Zn.

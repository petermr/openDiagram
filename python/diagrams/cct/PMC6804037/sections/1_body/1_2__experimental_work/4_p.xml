<p>OM and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were applied for investigating the hardened layer microstructure. The percentage of the ferrite phase in the average of the structure of the hardened zone was measured by Celemex software (manufacturer, city, state, country). A micro hardness V-test-analog tester was used for 30 s dwell time with 100 gr maximum load. Vickers tests were repeated three times for each treatment condition. The micro-hardness profiles through the line from the center of the hardened zone to the untreated zone in depth and width directions of the hardened area were plotted for each sample.

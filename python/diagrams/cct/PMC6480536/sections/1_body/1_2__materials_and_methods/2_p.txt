0: The effect of austenitizing temperature on continuous cooling transformed microstructures at different cooling rates was investigated adopting the scheme shown in  Figure 1a.
1: The experiment was carried out on Formastor-FII full-automatic transformation equipment using cylinder samples of dimensions 3 mm  10 mm.
2: Vickers hardness of treated samples was tested by a KB hardness testing machine (KB Pruftechnik, Hochdorf-Assenheim, Germany).
3: In order to clarify the transformation behaviors in detail, in situ observation by high-temperature laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was carried out, referring to the thermal cycle process in  Figure 1b.
4: The samples were machined into disks with a diameter of 7 mm and thickness 3.5 mm, mirror polished, and set into an alumina crucible on a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
5: The austenite coarsening and ferrite formation behaviors were directly observed.
6: The effect of austenitization holding time was also evaluated through experiment as indicated in  Figure 1c.
7: Steel samples were heated at 1250 C and held for different times between 1 and 60 min and then continuously cooled at 2 C/s.

<p>Leading-edge genes associated with the enrichment are likely important with respect to CNTN1-affected PC pathogenesis. The 10 leading-edge (LE) genes include

 <italic>NANS</italic> [

 <xref rid="B51-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] which are related to PC and AR signaling (
 <xref rid="genes-12-00257-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SRD5A3 sustains androgen biosynthesis and contributes to CRPC [

 <xref rid="B51-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The inclusion of these four genes in LE genes supports the relevance of these LE genes in PC tumorigenesis and progression. Nonetheless, these LE genes are novel to PC, evident by 3 of 10 LE genes being unknown in PC (
 <xref rid="genes-12-00257-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). With respect to LY75 and RNF144A, althogh both proteins were detected in PC tissues based on information presented in “Human Protein Atlas” (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</uri> accessed on 19 December 2020), there are no articles listed in PubMed under the search term “LY75 and prostate cancer” and “RNF144A and prostate cancer” as of 23 January 2021; their involvement in PC thus remains unclear.

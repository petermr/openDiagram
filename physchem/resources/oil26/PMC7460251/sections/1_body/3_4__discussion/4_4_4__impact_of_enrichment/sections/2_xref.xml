Additionally, the relatively low rates of pacing behavior displayed by the aardvarks in the current study (coupled with the lack of a control condition) could also explain why we did not see effects of enrichment on this measure, similar to the potential &#8220;floor effect&#8221; observed in relation to glucocorticoids. Aardvarks showing higher rates of stereotypic behavior may be more affected by enrichment use, or perhaps, the foraging and exploring enrichment impacted pacing equally.

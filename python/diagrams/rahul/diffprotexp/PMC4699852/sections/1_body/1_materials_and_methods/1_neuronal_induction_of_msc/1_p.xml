<p>Human MSCs isolated from bone marrow [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were treated by the methylation of nine genes in the SWH signaling pathway to yield 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs retained markers of stemness, could be induced to differentiate, and were not shown to be tumorigenic in a nude mice assay. Both human MSCs and 
 <italic>me_</italic>SWH-treated MSCs were cultured in a culture medium (CM) composed of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). The medium was replaced with fresh CM every 3–4 days. When the cells reached 70–80% confluence, CM was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice. Fresh neural induction medium (NIM) was then added. The NIM consisted of neurobasal medium (Gibco), 0.5% B-27 supplement (Gibco), 250 ng/ml SHH (Peprotech), 100 ng/ml FGF-8 (Peprotech), and 50 ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech), as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The medium was not changed during the neural induction period. For the study of signaling pathways regulating neuronal differentiation, TrkB inhibitor (0.5 μM), Akt inhibitor (10 μM), ERK inhibitor (10 μM), or BDNF (100 ng/ml) was also added to the induction medium. TrkB inhibitor (K-252a), Akt inhibitor IV in solution, and ERK inhibitor (PD98059) were obtained from Calbiochem.

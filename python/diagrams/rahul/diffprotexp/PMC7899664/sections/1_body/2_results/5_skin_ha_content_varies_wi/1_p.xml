<p>As validation experiments in male mice were not congruent with the predicted model between sexes, we sought to establish whether sex- and age-specific differences in baselines for HA levels in murine skin exist that would explain our observed differences in predicted vs. observed HA reduction. Dorsal and ventral skin from untreated mice were harvested. We chose six time points (1, 4, 6, 8, 15, and 24 weeks) for sample harvest, as ∼8 weeks is an established time point of adulthood at which they are predominantly used in the murine wound healing, fibrosis and other dermal diseases literature, while 6/15 weeks and 8/24 weeks are well-described in murine hair cycling (anogen and catogen phases, respectively) (Plikus and Chuong

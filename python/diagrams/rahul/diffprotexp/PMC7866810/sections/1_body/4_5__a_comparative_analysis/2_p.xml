<p>We performed a side-by-side evaluation of the performance of DiscBIO and Granatum using the CTC dataset (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01399">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). With Granatum, we normalized the read counts based on the quantile. Genes were filtered based on the Log Mean Expression Threshold and Dispersion Fit Threshold. With DIscBIO the read counts were normalized using the median of the ratios. Genes were filtered based on the minimum expression in a certain number of cells. Cells were clustered in four clusters using k-means (Euclidean). About 43% of the cells were clustered similarly to Granatum and DIscBIO. We evaluated the stability and consistency of the clusters generated using Granatum by downloading the cluster IDs and a matrix of filtered expressions and inserting them into DIscBIO. The robustness assessment of the generated clusters shows a similar stability between the Granatum and DIscBIO clusters, but with a much higher consistency in the DIscBIO clusters. We also performed differential expression analysis using the two pipelines and observed similar panels of DEGs. The overall comparison results are available as a notebook at

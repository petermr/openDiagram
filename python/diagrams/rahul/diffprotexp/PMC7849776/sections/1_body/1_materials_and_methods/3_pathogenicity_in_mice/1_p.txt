0: Mice experiments were performed with approval from Teikyo University Animal Ethics Committee (18024).
1: Bacterial strains were cultured overnight in TSB with or without antibiotics.
2: Erythromycin (5 g/ml) alone or with chloramphenicol (12.5 g/ml) was added to the medium for transposon mutants or gene complemented strains, respectively.
3: The overnight cultures were 100-fold diluted with TSB and continued incubation for 16 h at 37C with shaking.
4: The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and suspended in PBS to adjust the turbidity (A 600) to 0.7 for microbial load and 4.0 for survival assay.
5: The prepared suspensions (200 l) of the strains were injected into the tail-vein of mice (ICR, female, eight weeks old, Charles River Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan).
6: The CFU of the injected suspensions was counted.
7: For measuring the microbial load, kidney and heart of the infected mice were isolated after 24 h of injection, suspended in PBS, homogenized, and CFU was counted.

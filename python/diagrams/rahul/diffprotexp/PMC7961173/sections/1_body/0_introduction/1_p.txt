0: Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a volatile organic compound that belongs to a class of chlorinated hydrocarbons with potent solvent properties.
1: Throughout the twentieth century, the chemical was widely used as a dry cleaning solvent and vapor metal degreaser with little attention paid to disposal methods (Chiu et al.
2: 2013; Waters et al.
3: 1977).
4: Despite substantial efforts in recent decades to clean up and prevent further TCE environmental contamination, legacy pollution of soil and groundwater remains, as evidenced by TCE detection in thousands of hazardous waste sites across the United States (U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)  2019a; U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)  2019b).
5: Due to ongoing usage and persistent environmental contamination, occupational and community-based TCE exposure in humans is widespread.

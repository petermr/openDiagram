0: HPLC analysis was established on Agilent 1260 (Agilent Technologies, Torrance, CA, USA) using Diamonsil C18 column (150 mm  4.6 mm, 5 m) at the column temperature of 40 C and the injection volume of 10 L. The mobile phase composed of methanol and 0.1% phosphoric acid (40:60,  v/ v) whereas the flow rate was at 1.0 mL/min.
1: Spectra was recorded at 335 nm wavelength by UV detector to determine the SCU content.

<p id="p0030">Obesity impairs metabolic regulation of multiple organs, including the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to the dysfunction of the inter-organ metabolic cycle and subsequently to metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (

Obesity perturbs metabolic regulation through changes in hormones, metabolites, and metabolic enzymes in the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to systemic metabolic dysfunction. Insulin resistance that is associated with obesity represents a well-characterized factor contributing to metabolic dysfunction (

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Roden and Shulman, 2019</xref>); however, the effect of obesity on inter-organ metabolic cycles—the glucose-alanine cycle, the glucose-lactate cycle, and ketone body metabolism—have yet to be explored.

<p>Histone H3.1 and H3.3 exhibited a common trend of change in the two groups at different time points, indicating that XIAP may participate in DNA repair and replication through influencing histone modification in RCC cells. Certain studies have proposed the concept of the ‘code histone’, in which there are various covalent modifications that may affect each other, change the chromatin structure, and affect gene transcription and replication (

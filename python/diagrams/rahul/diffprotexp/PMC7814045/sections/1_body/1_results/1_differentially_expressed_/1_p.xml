 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>) corresponding to 1118 genes at 45 min, 974 at 120 min, and 1061 after 200 min, respectively (Fig.

Up and downregulated genes are also indicated, highlighting that among the 435 DEGs in common with the three treatments, 156 resulted always upregulated and 278 were always downregulated in the three experimental time points, whereas one gene (RPL9B) resulted to be upregulated at 45 min, and downregulated at 120 and 200 min (Fig.

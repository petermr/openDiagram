0: All germplasm was sown into 96-well trays filled with M2 compost (Levington, Everiss).
1: The experimental plan for each germplasm set comprised five replicates of each variety or accession, arrayed in a randomised block design using R/blocksdesign (cran.r-project.org).
2: Seeds of the first germplasm set were grown in a growth chamber (Conviron) using a 16 h light (at 20 C) and 8 h dark (15 C) photoperiod.
3: The AM and MAGIC populations were grown in a heated glasshouse (16 h light at 20 C, 8 h dark at 17 C) for 14 days with supplementary lighting to maintain photoperiod.
4: ToxB infiltration was undertaken 14 days after sowing, following the method described by Moffat et al.
5: ( 2014).
6: Briefly, the first leaf of seedlings at growth stage 12 (GS12, Zadoks et al.
7: 1974) was infiltrated with 50 l of ToxB suspension at a concentration of 200 g/mL, and the extent of infiltration along the leaf marked using a non-toxic pen.
8: Phenotyping of ToxB sensitivity was carried out a week after infiltration and scored using a 05 scale, as described by See et al.
9: ( 2019).
10: A score of 0 = no visible symptoms; 1 = slight chlorosis; 2 = full chlorosis; 3 = extensive chlorosis with/without slight necrosis; 4 = chlorosis with necrosis; 5 = full necrosis.
11: A water control was also used to establish a symptom baseline for the evaluation of possible damage during the infiltration process.

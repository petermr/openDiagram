<p>VIM is an epithelial cytoskeletal protein associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and it is up-regulated in sarcoma [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We demonstrated down-regulation of VIM in cPTC by LC MS/MS, which is consistent with San Martin 
 <italic>et al</italic>., who showed over-expression of VIM in a thyroid tissue microarray [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, LC-MS/MS data was not confirmed by ELISA demonstrating similar concentration of VIM in cyst fluid from cPTC and benign samples. This finding is in agreement with Mato 
 <italic>et al</italic>. who showed down-regulation of VIM in PTC cell-line, but controversial with Viale and co-workers who demonstrated expression of VIM in both PTC and benign lesions [

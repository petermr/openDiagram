<p>To validate our genetic evaluation, we performed HE-stains and IHC for MS-2, Osteopontin, and Fatty Acid Synthase. We chose these proteins, as their encoding genes Adam8, Spp1, and Fasn showed significant changes of gene expression after transplantation according to our study and corresponding antibodies in mice were available.</p>

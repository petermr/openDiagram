<p id="Par30">It has been noted that epigenetic status might be modified by environment and diets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In mice, by feeding the diets with high levels of methyl donors (e.g. folic acid) to pregnant dams, it was possible to modify the expression of the agouti gene in the offspring with the high levels of DNA methylation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Histone modifications correlate with transcriptional activation and repression. The maternal undernutrition led to a decreased H3K27me3 level of the promotor region and increased expression of 
 <italic>pomc</italic> gene in offspring mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, whether epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the food habits domestication is unknown.

 <caption> Network of proteins modulated by AAS in GT1-7 cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a major protein network associated with drug metabolism, glutathione depletion, protein synthesis, immunological disease and endocrine function. Red and green symbols indicate overexpressed and underexpressed proteins, respectively. GSTM2 is represented as GSTM5 in the IPA knowledge base. Direct interactions are represented as solid lines, whereas indirect interactions appear as dotted lines. </caption>

<p>Mouse brain sections were also stained with an anti-IBA-1 antibody, to identify and analyze microglial cells in SLEV-infected brains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>). We observed that microglial cells in mock-infected brain sections had normal morphology, characterized by long ramifications in a small cell body (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6a,b</xref>). SLEV infection induced significant changes in microglial cell morphology, from day 3 to 7 p.i., characterized by shorter and thicker ramifications in a larger cell body, consistent with microglial activation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6c-f</xref>). In contrast, microglial cells in SLEV-infected ABR-/- brain sections presented no signs of activation, maintaining long ramifications and a small cell body, as observed in IBA-1 positive cells in mock-infected brains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6g-h</xref>). In summary, we observed that SLEV infection causes caspase-3 activation and the activation of microglial cells. Deficiency in type I interferon responses resulted in early caspase-3 activation and in no microglial cell activation after SLEV infection, from a morphological aspect.

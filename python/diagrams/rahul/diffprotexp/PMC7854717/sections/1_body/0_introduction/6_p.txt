0: The ionic channels and transporters (ICTs) play fundamental roles in the heart physiology and their deficient expression and/or configuration are responsible for a number of severe cardiac channelopathies 21 that dysregulate the rhythm, synchrony and strength of the heart contractions.
1: Channelopathy symptoms depend specifically on what ICT was altered and how and how much its function was affected.
2: Major ICT-related heart diseases include: Brugada syndrome 22, long 23 and short 24 QT syndromes, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 25.

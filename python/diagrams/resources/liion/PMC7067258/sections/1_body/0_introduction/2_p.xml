<p>Herein, we present a new design strategy for the preparation of redox-active molecular assemblies with crystalline porous structures. In recent years, a report into batteries employing organic charge-transfer (CT) complexes as active materials has attracted attention due to the unique redox properties.
 <xref rid="cit40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Our approach is therefore based on conventional mixed-stacked CT complexes with columnar structures. More specifically, it is known that various electron donor and acceptor aromatic molecule pairs form columnar structures with alternate stacks 
 <italic>via</italic> CT interactions, and that these columns assemble spontaneously to form (pseudo) hexagonal structures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>).
 <xref rid="cit41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> While redox-active organic molecules densely pack along the columnar direction due to strong CT interactions, we expect that the one-dimensional channels between the columns can be regarded as pores to adsorb various molecules and/or ions.
 <xref rid="cit45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Since a number of columnar donor–acceptor assemblies have been reported, the demonstration of the porous nature of this structural motif paves the way for a new class of redox-active porous material.

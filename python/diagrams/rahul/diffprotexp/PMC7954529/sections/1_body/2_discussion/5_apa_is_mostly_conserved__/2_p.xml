<p>In general, we found that both individual PAS usage and isoform diversity are highly conserved between human and chimpanzee. Consistent with comparative studies of APA in humans and rodents, which used genomic synteny to identify conserved PAS, we found higher conservation among genes with a single PAS (

 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>) and showed that sequence variation in PAS signal sites and the surrounding U-rich regions contributes to inter-species differences in APA (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). Because we characterized APA in closely related primates, our study provides additional insight into APA divergence at both the gene level and the species level, revealing functional changes that contribute to differences in downstream gene regulation. For example, we observed that when genes use one PAS markedly more often than others, said dominant PAS tends to be the same in both human and chimpanzee. It is likely that strong selection pressures have acted on these genes, resulting in continual usage of the same dominant isoform. This could imply that the dominant isoform is functionally important and alternative isoforms are potentially associated with reduced fitness. However, non-dominant isoforms also show evidence of conservation. Thus, it remains possible that there is a threshold at which the level of expression of the alternative isoforms begins to impede gene function.

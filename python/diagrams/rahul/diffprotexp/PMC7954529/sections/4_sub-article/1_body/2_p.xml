<p>We have now conducted a number of gene enrichment analyses using both fgsea and Gorilla (the details of which are found in the Materials and methods). We found that the differentially expressed genes within the dAPA genes are enriched for RNA processing pathways, such as RNA catabolic process and mRNA metabolic processes. We also found a 32X enrichment of translation initiation genes within the dAPA genes that are also differentially translated.</p>

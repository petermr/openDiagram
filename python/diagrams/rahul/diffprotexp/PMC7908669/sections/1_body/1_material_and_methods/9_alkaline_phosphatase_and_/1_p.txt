0: The expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in human BMSCs was detected using the BCIP/NBT Alkaline Phosphatase Color Development Kit (#C3206; Beyotime Biotech) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: Briefly, cell slides were washed three times with PBS solution, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed again three times with PBS solution.
2: The slides were then incubated with BCIP/NBT staining solution for 12 h at room temperature in darkness, washed twice with distilled water for 3 min.
3: Finally, ALP expression in human BMSCs was observed by gross scanning (Bio-Rad, GS-800, Hercules, CA, USA) and light microscopy (OPTEC, TP510, Chongqing, China).
4: At least three biological replicates were conducted for comparison.
5: To evaluate osteogenic differentiation, BMSCs were also stained with Alizarin Red S reagent (#ST1078-25g; Beyotime Biotech) for 15 min at room temperature, as outlined in the manufacturers instructions.
6: Quantification of ALP and Alizarin Red S were conducted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

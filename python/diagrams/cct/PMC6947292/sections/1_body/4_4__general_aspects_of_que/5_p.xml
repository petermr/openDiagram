<p>In general, it can be stated that at lower temperatures, in 6xxx AlMgSi alloys metastable precursor phases particles are precipitated [

 <xref rid="B128-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] while in 7xxx AlZnMg(Cu) alloys quench induced precipitation of the phase Î·-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub> occurs. These particles have much larger aspect ratios compared to high-temperature particles, but are still relatively coarse as compared to age hardening precipitates formed during typical artificial ageing treatments. Their dimensions can reach several hundreds of nm in length, and thus they contribute little to direct hardening [

 <xref rid="B128-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Nucleation of these quench-induced lower temperature phases takes place mostly on incoherent dispersoids (and on grain boundaries; see for instance

 <sup>−</sup> cells containing either pBAD24 or the plasmids encoding the different AAF subtypes were plated on LB agar containing the suitable antibiotics and incubated overnight at 37°C. Afterward, a single colony was inoculated in 2 ml LB medium containing the suitable antibiotics and grown overnight at 37°C and 180 rpm. The next day, 100 µl of these pre-cultures were used to inoculate 20 ml fresh LB medium and the cultures were grown at 37°C and 180 rpm. The OD
 <sub>600</sub> was determined using the Ultraspec 2100pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) in regular intervals until an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.4–0.6 had been reached. 600 µl of a 10% arabinose solution were added and incubation continued for another 60 min. Sterile glass tubes were filled with 5 ml bacterial culture and kept static at room temperature. For the measurements, 100 µl samples were taken approximately 1 cm below the liquid surface in duplicates and the OD
 <sub>600</sub> was determined. Samples were taken every 10 min in the first 60 min after the beginning of the experiment and afterward every 60 min for a total assay time of 3 h.

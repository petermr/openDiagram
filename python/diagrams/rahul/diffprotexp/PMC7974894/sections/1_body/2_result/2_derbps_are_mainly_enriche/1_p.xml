<p>To gain further biological insights into these identified DeRBPs, we uploaded and analyzed the divided up-regulated or down-regulated RBPs. GO analysis mainly enriched the up-regulated RBPs in the biological process (BP) related to cell cycle regulation, nuclear division, and chromosome segregation. (

In addition, KEGG analysis enriched the up-regulated RBPs in Regulation of actin cytoskeleton, Cell cycle, virus infection like human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), etc., and cancer metabolic processes including proteoglycans in cancer, HIF1 signaling pathway, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, Central carbon metabolism in cancer, etc. (

For the down-regulated RBPs, we found they were significantly enriched in biological process related to multiple catabolic processes including small molecule catabolic process, RNA catabolic process, etc., and translation initiation (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>C). KEGG dramatically enriched the down-regulated RBPs in Carbon metabolism, Ribosome, Amino acid (Aa) degradation, TCA cycle, and Fatty acid metabolism and degradation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>D). In summary, we found the up-regulated RBPs functioned in both cytosolic, nuclear and even extracellular membrane with multiple functions like regulation of cell cycle, cell division, and metabolic processes while the down-regulated RBPs mainly functioned in cytosolic and mitochondrial with the abilities to regulate metabolism.

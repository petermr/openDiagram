<p>In the present study, we downloaded the RNA-seq and clinical datasets from TCGA and GEO. By utilizing differential expression analysis and WGCNA, we constructed the link between the expression and tongue cancer patients' clinical features. GO and KEGG analyses were carried out to reveal the underlying functional mechanisms in metabolic processes of RBPs in tongue cancer. Moreover, by unveiling a number of tongue cancer prognosis-related hub RBPs, our results may shed new light on understanding RBPs-directed network underlying tongue cancer progression. These hub RBPs may provide potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.</p>

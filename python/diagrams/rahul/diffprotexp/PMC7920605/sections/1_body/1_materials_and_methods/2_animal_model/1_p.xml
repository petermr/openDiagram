<p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old, 180–200 g) were purchased from the Anhui Experimental Animal Center. All rats were housed in the animal facility of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine and provided adequate water and food. Animal experiments in this study had been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Ethical Approval Number: AHUCM-rats-004. The rats were adaptively fed for 1 week and then subcutaneous injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant into the left hindfoot toe to establish an adjuvant arthritis (AA) rat model. After induction of the immune response for 20 days, all rats were anesthetized by the intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) and sacrificed by exsanguination of the abdominal aorta. Then, the knee joints were removed, and the synovial tissues were separated. Experimental methods were performed according to the study of Hui Jiang et al.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The synovial tissues of AA rats were defined as a model group. Conversely, the synovial tissues of normal rats were defined as the control group.

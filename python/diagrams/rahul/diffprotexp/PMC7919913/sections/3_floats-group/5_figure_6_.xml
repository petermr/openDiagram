  <p>MiR-21 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy 
   <italic>via</italic> targeting SORBS2 and ENH. Cardiomyocytes were treated with normal medium, conditioned medium containing MVs, miR-21 inhibitor and MVs containing miR-21 inhibitor, respectively. RT-qPCR showed that the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH at the mRNA level in recipient cardiomyocytes (A and B). Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of SORBS2 and ENH at the protein level (C and D). The diameter of cell (E), protein concentration (F) and ANP content (G) of cardiomyocytes treated with normal medium, conditioned medium containing MVs, miR-21 inhibitor and MVs containing miR-21 inhibitor respectively. Results are presented as means ± SE of three independent experiments. *

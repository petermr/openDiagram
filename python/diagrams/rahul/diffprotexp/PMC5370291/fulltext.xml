However, the influence of TNF&#x003b1; on protein expression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is incompletely understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the differential protein expression of HCC in response to TNF&#x003b1; stimulus. We observed that HepG2 cell revealed a higher resistance to TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis as compared to the non-tumorigenic hepatocyte THLE-2. By using a label-free quantitative proteomic analysis, we found that 520 proteins were differentially expressed in the HepG2 cells exposed to TNF&#x003b1;, including 211 up-regulated and 309 down-regulated proteins. We further confirmed several proteins with significant expression change (TNF&#x003b1;/control ratio&#x0003e;2.0 or &#x0003c;0.5) by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. We also analyzed the differential expressed proteins using Gene ontology and KEGG annotations, and the results implicated that TNF&#x003b1; might regulate ribosome, spliceosome, antigen processing and presentation, and energy metabolism in HepG2 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that upregulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was involved in both the promoted migration and the inhibited apoptosis of HepG2 cells in response to TNF&#x003b1;. Collectively, these findings indicate that TNF&#x003b1; alters protein expression such as HSP70, which triggering specific molecular processes and signaling cascades that promote migration and inhibit apoptosis of HepG2 cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Label-free proteomic analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver tumors that causes over 600,000 deaths per year in the world <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Patients with HCC usually combine with cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, ascites and neutropenia, and the complicated combination often makes the therapies for the patients ineffectual <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In addition, the prognosis of HCC is poor due to the frequent resistance to current chemotherapies via the dysfunction of signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) possesses multipotent bioactivity that mediates various cellular responses, including proliferation, proinflammatory factor production, and cell death. Particularly, TNF&#x003b1; is known to involve in the pathophysiology of multiple liver disorders such viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The roles of TNF&#x003b1; in liver injury acts as not only a mediator of cell death but also an inducer of cell proliferation <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.

Cells were incubated with TNF&#x003b1; at 10 &#x003bc;g/mL for 24 h, and then the crude proteins were extracted, separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and observed by CBB staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). The resulting protein bands showed similar pattern among the three independent experimental replicates, suggesting that profiles of extracted proteins were nonsignificantly changed among the three replicates of control and TNF&#x003b1; treatment. The gels were then subjected to in-gel digestion for peptide extraction and following LC-MS/MS analysis for protein identification and MS/MS spectra collection. The number of proteins identified in each experiment was presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B. These data suggested that each experimental replicate was performed in a highly reproducible manner. In addition, of the 1142 and 1042 proteins identified in control and TNF&#x003b1;-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B), only minor unique proteins (9 - 14) were identified in single experiment among the three replicates, implying that the protein identification for each replicate was highly reproducible and the subsequent spectra counting for semi-quantitation basing on statistical analysis could be confident. These results were consistent with the negligible change of protein patterns on SDS-PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), showing that the protein expression profile among the experimental replicates was highly congenial. Combining the three experimental replicates, we observed that 852 proteins were identified in both control and TNF&#x003b1; treatment, with 290 and 190 exclusively identified in the control and the TNF&#x003b1; treatment group, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).

A complete list of GO annotations for all the proteins significantly altered with the associated <italic>P</italic> values for functional enrichment is provided in Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>. The biological processes associating with significantly altered proteins featured by GO annotations were shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A. We observed that the proteins associating with the cellular process, cellular component organization, catabolic process, DNA repair and cell cycle process were up-regulated in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment. Conversely, we found that the proteins associating with translation elongation, RNA processing, and metabolic process were down-regulated in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment. Similarly, we performed the molecular function analysis for the protein with significant changes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B) and observed that the proteins exhibiting ATP binding, ATPase activity, and hydrolase activity were up-regulated in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment. On the contrary, proteins exhibiting RNA binding, nucleic acid binding, binding and translation factor activity were down-regulated in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment. Taken together, we suggested that TNF&#x003b1; treatment suppressed specific gene transcription and the subsequent translation that promoted energy metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>KEGG Ontology analysis for characterization of altered proteins</title><p>We also conducted KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis using the KOBAS online search tool (v. 2.0) to further characterize the proteins with expression change in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, the KEGG analysis summarized the pathways in which the identified proteins with significant change involved. We observed that TNF&#x003b1; treatment significantly regulated the pathways (Fisher's Exact test, <italic>P</italic> &#x02264;0.1) involving in the ribosome, spliceosome, antigen processing and presentation, proteasome, glycoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and metabolism of amino acids. Accordingly, we suggested that TNF&#x003b1; treatment may enhance RNA processing, protein degradation, and fatty acid oxidation in HepG2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of protein expression level by immunoblotting</title><p>To confirm the expression changes of proteins in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment, we performed immunoblotting to determine the expression level of proteins which have been reported associating with cell survival, cell cycle, protein degradation, and energy metabolism. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, we noted that TNF&#x003b1; treatment altered the expression level of 14-3-3&#x003b5;, &#x003b1;-actinin-1, calnexin, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), cathepsin B, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), gelsolin, and sialidase-1/NEU1, and the changes of these proteins were consistent with the above spectral counting quantitation. Thus, we proposed that the quantitative analysis by MS/MS spectra counting highly correlated with that by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Upregulation of HSP70 involves in the promoted cell migration and apoptosis induced by TNF&#x003b1;</title><p>The identified proteins with significant changes in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment were highly linked to the cytoskeleton and cell cycle regulation.

Thus, we further investigated the role of upregulated HSP70 in promoted cell migration and inhibited apoptosis of HepG2 cell. We silenced the HSP70 expression by specific siRNA against HSP70 (siHSP70) and monitored the cell migration using wound healing assay. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, we observed that the protein level was significantly decreased by siHSP70, and the TNF&#x003b1;-promoted migration was inhibited by siHSP70 pretreatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). In addition, we also found that pretreatment of siHSP70 following TNF&#x003b1; treatment significantly increased sub-G1 phase as compared to TNF&#x003b1; treatment alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C).

To diminish the biological and experimental variation, we use consecutive passages of HepG2 cells and confirm the protein profiles of each extraction prior to the protein identification and quantitation using MS/MS analysis. By using GO and KEGG pathway analysis, we also explore the cellular network in which the identified proteins with significant expression change involve. We determine several protein expression levels by immunoblotting and find that the protein expression quantitation by MS/MS spectra counting and by immunoblotting is compatible. Furthermore, we demonstrate that upregulation of HSP70 expression plays an important role in the TNF&#x003b1;-enhanced migratory ability and TNF&#x003b1;-suppressed apoptosis of human HCC cell line HepG2. Collectively, we not only establish a quantitative proteomic approach that could be useful and helpful for the exploration of cellular protein expression but also provide a differential protein expression profile of and demonstrate the role of HSP70 in HepG2 cell in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment.</p><p>Although we first provide the differential protein expression profile of HepG2 cell in response to TNF&#x003b1;, proteomic analysis of HepG2 in response to other stimuli such as mushroom polysaccharide <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> or in comparison to human hepatocyte <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> has been reported. Among these proteomic analyses for HepG2, cytoskeletal components, HSPs/chaperones, 14-3-3 family, oxidoreduction-associating proteins, and energy metabolism-associating proteins have been widely identified and investigated. Similarly, we identify 8 cytoskeletal components, 10 HSPs/chaperones, 5 14-3-3 isoforms, 7 oxidoreduction-associating proteins, and 6 energy metabolism-associating proteins (Supplementary data), and their expression levels are significantly changed in response to TNF&#x003b1;.</p><p>14-3-3 proteins, indicating in cell cycle process by GO analysis, modulate cellular functions via binding intracellular proteins with Ser/Thr phosphorylation-dependent domains and consequently influence subcellular localization, conformation, activity, and protein complex stability <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Seven isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins have been identified and reported to play pivotal roles in regulating cell cycle progression, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell adhesion and motility <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Among the 14-3-3 isoforms, overexpression of 14-3-3&#x003b5; has been reported in breast cancer <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, lung cancer <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, and HCC <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.

Recently, 14-3-3&#x003b5; has been reported to mediate cell polarization and migration via changing Zeb-1/E-cadherin expression, which contributes to HCC tumor development, progression, and metastasis <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Our results revealed that 14-3-3&#x003b5; level was increased in response to TNF&#x003b1;, suggesting that 14-3-3&#x003b5; may play a role in the TNF-induced anti-apoptotic signals.</p><p>&#x003b1;-actinins are ubiquitously expressed cytoskeleton proteins that interact with various adaptor proteins such as vinculin <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and integrins <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, and then link actin filaments to focal adhesions <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.

Our analysis revealed that TNF&#x003b1; treatment significantly increased &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and other cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin, actin and actin-related protein 3, indicating that TNF&#x003b1; altered cytoskeletal protein network which may contribute to promoted cell survival.</p><p>Heat shock proteins (HSPs) and molecular chaperones play important roles in protein homeostasis, cell physiology, and protection against stressors <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. HSPs involve not only in protein folding/refolding, trafficking and degradation but also in the control of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and tissue repair <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Recently, roles of HSPs in promoting cancer cell survival and overexpression of HSPs in malignancies have been greatly noticed <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Elevated HSP70 levels protect cancer cells from apoptosis and cellular pressures attributed to enhanced growth and accumulation of mutant proteins <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Abnormal levels of HSP70 have been implicated in breast cancer cell growth <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and tumorigenesis of Rat-1 fibroblasts <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Similarly, we observe that TNF&#x003b1; upregulates HSP70 expression level, contributing to promoted cell migratory ability and suppressed apoptosis of HepG2 cell. Thus, we propose that silencing HSP70 may increase sensitivity to the antitumor drug for HCC cells as previously described for other malignancies <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>.

HSP90 may act as an oncogenic chaperone attributing to its protective function on mutant and oncogenic proteins from degradation. Molecular chaperone calnexin is a type-I integral membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which facilitates the processing of N-linked glycoprotein synthesis <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. Interestingly, HSP90 is not been identified in our proteomic analysis; therefore, the expression of HSP90 needs further investigation.</p><p>Calnexin forms heterodimeric complexes with the calnexin-associated protein disulfide isomerase ortholog ERp57 to exert its chaperone activity <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. A Recent study is reported that calnexin and another ER-associated chaperone GRP78 are overexpressed in keratocystic odontogenic tumors <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. Our results revealed that protein level of HSP70, HSP90 and calnexin were increased in response to TNF&#x003b1; treatment, suggesting that the promoted molecular chaperone expression may play an important role in the evoked prosurvival signals in HepG2 cell.</p><p>Lysosomes and cathepsins play a pivotal role in cancer cell death <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. The lysosomal permeabilization facilitates cathepsin release, causing cell death via mitochondria-dependent apoptosis <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Among the lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin B is a cysteine protease mainly involved in the degradation or processing of lysosomal proteins <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, vesicle trafficking <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, cell death <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. Our findings revealed that level of cathepsin B was significantly reduced in response to TNF&#x003b1;, suggesting that inhibition of lysosomal cell death may involve in the prosurvival signals evoked by TNF&#x003b1; in HepG2 cells.</p><p>Gelsolin is a calcium-binding protein that controls cytoskeletal actin dynamics and plays an important role in cell metabolism and survival <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. Gelsolin is known to involve in a variety of cellular signal cascades for motility, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, and carcinogenesis phenotypes <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. Interestingly, gelsolin plays roles as both effector and inhibitor of apoptosis, depending on its association with different cancer types. Our findings revealed that TNF&#x003b1; lowered level of gelsolin in HepG2 cells; however, whether gelsolin acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis in HCC in response to TNF&#x003b1; needs further validation.</p><p>HMGB1 is a widely expressed and highly abundant protein and plays multiple roles in physiological and pathological processes. Thus, HMGB1 is implicated in human health and diseases <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Loss of HMGB1 has been reported that leads to a serial of abnormalities in the nuclear structure and function, such as genomic instability <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, abnormal gene transcription <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, and impaired DNA damage response <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. Comparing to HMGB1, our analysis showed that level of HMGB1 was reduced in HepG2 cells with exposure to TNF&#x003b1;, suggesting that lowered HMGB1 may involve in carcinogenesis promoted by TNF&#x003b1;.</p><p>Several cancers show a tendency for decreased sialidase-1/NEU1 expression. Interestingly, sialidase-1/NEU1 expression and metastatic ability present a good inverse relationship. Cells transformed by oncogenic v-fos transfection show a severe decrease in sialidase activity and acquired higher lung metastatic potential <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. In addition, the introduction of sialidase-1/NEU1 into Bl6 melanoma cells resulted in suppression of experimental pulmonary metastasis and tumor progression, with a decreased anchorage-independent growth and increased sensitivity to apoptosis <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. Our findings showed that TNF&#x003b1; significantly reduced the level of sialidase-1/NEU1, suggesting that the decreased sialidase-1/NEU1 may induce enhanced anchorage-independent growth and anti-apoptotic signals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we establish a label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS approach provide a differential protein expression profile of HepG2 cell in response to TNF&#x003b1; stimulus.

GO and KO and KEGG pathway analysis categorize the identified proteins with significant expression changes into mainly cell cycle process, RNA process, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, and cell death process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inducible overexpression of HSP70 involves in the promotion of migratory ability and suppression of apoptosis in response to TNF&#x003b1;, suggesting that HSP70 could be a potential target to enhance sensitivity to anti-tumor drugs for HCC cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM0"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Supplemental table 1.</p></caption><media xlink:href="ijmsv14p0284s1.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grant MOST105-2632-B-040-002 from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

<p>The construction of the CCT diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f009">Figure 9</xref>) of the experimental steel AISI 4340 was created from all eight expansion curves. For its accurate compilation, it was necessary to analyze dilatation curves and evaluate the microstructure of the measured samples, which confirms the formation of the phases in the dilatation curves. The austenitization temperature was set at 850 °C, and the heating rate of all samples was 1 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. To achieve the transformation of the austenite in the whole sample volume, the holding time at the austenitizing temperature was 30 min. We determined the temperatures of

 <sub>1</sub> and

 <sub>3</sub> using expansion curves during heating. The CCT diagram of experimental high-strength steel AISI 4340 consists of three transformation phases. The first phase occurred in the first four dilatation curves up to a cooling rate of 1 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup> and consists only in martensite. We observed the formation of a second phase at a cooling rate of 0.5 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>, which was a bainite. This resulting bainitic region continues until the last dilatation curve, which has been cooled at a rate of 0.01 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>.

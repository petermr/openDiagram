0: Non-coding RNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of different cancers, including glioma.
1: Non-coding RNAs are almost involved in the proliferation, differentiation and metastasis of tumor cells.
2: In addition, non-coding RNAs are constantly being discovered as biomarkers, and these discovered non-coding RNAs may serve as targets for tumor therapy.
3: 6 In the study of the occurrence and prognosis of glioma, the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been recently considered to be associated with the occurrence and development of glioma.
4: 7, 8 As for the correlation between lncRNAs and cancer, numerous studies have confirmed that lncRNAs play a crucial role in complex biological processes of glioma cells.
5: LncRNAs can participate in gene regulation through various mechanisms, including competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms.
6: Besides, lncRNAs possess miRNA Responsible Elements (MRE), the binding sites with miRNAs by which they can potentially sponge miRNAs that lead to miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs.
7: 9, 10 Meng et al found that lncRNA SNHG5 acted as a ceRNA in glioma to regulate ZEB2 by competitively binding to miR-205-5p, thereby affecting biological function of glioma.
8: 11 Liu et al proved that lncRNA H19 could promote glioma angiogenesis through miR-138/HIF-1/VEGF axis.
9: 12 The discovery of these lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA signaling axes helps to the prognosis and diagnosis of glioma.
10: However, studies concerning the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA signaling axis remain scarce.

<p id="par0060">Desalted peptides were separated on a 5%–45% acetonitrile gradient (240 min) with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 200 nL/min using the EASY-nLC II system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on in-house manufactured 25 cm fritless silica micro-columns with an inner diameter of 75 μm. Columns were packed with the ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Entringen, Germany). A Q Exactive plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was operated in the data dependent mode with a full scan in the Orbitrap followed by top 10 MS/MS scans using higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD). The full scans were performed with a resolution of 70,000, a target value of 3 × 106 ions and a maximum injection time of 20 ms. The MS/MS scans were performed with a 17,500 resolution, a 1 × 106 target value and a 60 ms maximum injection time.</p>

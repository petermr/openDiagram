 <caption> A. Protein interaction network generated with String that contains 25 significantly and differentially expressed proteins in CV-PTC. Major cluster of interacting proteins belong to Arp 2/3 complex. B. Binding protein distribution in CV-PTC (n = 11, p &lt; 0.0005). Gene ontology analysis revealed that 45% of proteins that are significanty and differentially expressed in CV-PTC have binding properties. </caption>

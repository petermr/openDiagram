For the test, final inoculum concentrations of 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL were used. Fungal spore suspensions were collected from the surface of such fungal colonies by gently scraping with a loop and suspended in 3 mL Potato Dextrose broth (PDB). This suspension was mixed vigorously by vortexing for 15-20 min. The spore suspension stock was diluted to obtain a concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> spores/mL (measured by Malassez blade). </p>

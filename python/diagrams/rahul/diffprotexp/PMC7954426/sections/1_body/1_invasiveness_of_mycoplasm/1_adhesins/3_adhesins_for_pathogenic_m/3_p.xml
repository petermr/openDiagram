<p>The variable lipoprotein (Vlp) family in 
 <italic>M. hyorhinis</italic> consists of seven members: VlpAâ€“G, all of which consist of three regions, among which regions II and III are of utmost significance [
 <xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]; region II is a major cytadhesion site with the consensus sequence SQQPGSG; region III determines the adhesion capability of Vlp family members; for example, the adhesion efficiency of region III with 0 and 3 copies of repeat unit is stronger than that with 12 copies, which suggests that the function of region II may be influenced by a longer region III [

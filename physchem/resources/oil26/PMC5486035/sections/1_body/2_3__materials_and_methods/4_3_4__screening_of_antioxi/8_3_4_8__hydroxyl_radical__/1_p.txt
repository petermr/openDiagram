0: The hydroxyl radical scavenging assay was performed as described by Tellone et al.
1: [ 38].
2: This assay is based on quantification of the degradation product of 2-deoxyribose by condensation with thiobarbituric acid (TBA).
3: The reaction mixture contained the following in the final volume of 1.0 mL: 2.8 mM 2-deoxy-2-ribose, 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 25 M FeCl 3, 100 M EDTA, 2.8 mM H 2O 2, 100 M ascorbic acid and sample solution in order to obtain the final concentration range of 150.92 g/mL.
4: The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37  0.5 C in a water bath.
5: Then 1.0 mL of 1% ( w/ v) TBA was added to each mixture followed by the addition of 1 mL of 2.8% ( w/ v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA).
6: The solutions were heated in a water bath at 100 C for 15 min to develop the pink coloured malondialdehydethiobarbituric acid adduct.
7: After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm against an appropriate blank solution.
8: The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).

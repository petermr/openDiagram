0: The goal of this study was to identify the key proteins underlying the alleviated Al toxicity in  P. massoniana under ectomycorrhizal fungi inoculation.
1: We employed a comparative proteomics approach to probe the symbiotic relationship of  S. luteus and  P. massoniana seedlings in response to Al toxicity.
2: This study provides insight into the proteome variations induced by ectomycorrhizal fungi under Al toxicity in  P. massoniana.

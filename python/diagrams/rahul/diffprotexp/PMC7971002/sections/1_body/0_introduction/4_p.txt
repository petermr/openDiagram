0: Non-coding long-chain RNA (LncRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA) affect ovarian growth, cell proliferation, ageing and apoptosis 6.
1: LncRNA and miRNAs are co-integrated and regulate all aspects of ovarian tissue development.
2: Even though LncRNA does not encode proteins, it has been shown to have a transcriptional and post-transcriptional effect on gene functions as it is commonly involved in different physiological processes 21.
3: LncRNA and miRNAs play an important part in the regulation of ovary maturation, ovarian cells development, and hormone secretion 22.
4: Furthermore, the integration of LncRNA and miRNAs allows a thorough study of their regulatory mechanisms in ovarian growth at the molecular level 6.

<p id="Par45">Differently expressed RBPs were submitted to the STRING database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.string-db.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.string-db.org/</ext-link>) to detect PPIs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The PPI network was then constructed and visualized using Cytoscape 3.7.0. The Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug-in was used to screen the key modules from the PPI network with both MCODE scores and node counts &gt; 5 [

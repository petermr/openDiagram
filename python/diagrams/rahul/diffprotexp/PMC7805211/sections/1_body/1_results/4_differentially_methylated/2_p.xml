<p id="Par11">As p38 is the primary effector of MKK3 signaling in response to cellular stress and cytokine stimulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], as well as chromatin conformational changes such as those observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we hypothesized that DNA methylation also regulates p38 expression in CNFs and PNFs. Because methylation events can also impact protein kinase activation states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], we also assessed whether 
 <italic>MAP2K3</italic> methylation events affected downstream p38 protein expression and activation. We identified a significant DMR (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.66E−16) approximately 3.5 kb upstream of the 
 <italic>MAPK14</italic> gene, which encodes the p38α isoform. Although the DMR lies within the promotor region of 
 <italic>SLC26A8</italic> gene, p38 protein levels were negatively correlated with methylation at this site (ρ = − 0.56, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.038) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a,b). Methylation was higher in the PNF group than the CNF group leading to variable but overall decreased p38 protein expression (T180/T182) in PNFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). More specifically, CNFs expressed both MKK3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d) and p38 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) more abundantly than PNFs, as well as phospho-p38 indicating consistent p38 activation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). These results are consistent with canonical MKK3/P38 pathway activation. Whereas MKK3 maintains a high degree of specificity for p38, it is unclear whether p38 regulates ERK through direct crosstalk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. P38 activation was previously shown to inhibit RAS through a redundant negative feedback loop originating in downstream MAPK signaling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It is currently unclear how NF1 deficiency affects negative feedback mechanisms downstream of RAS. We demonstrate that p38 activation was strongly correlated with pERK expression regardless of tumor type (
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.70, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). These results point to discrete signaling differences between RAS/MEK/ERK and RAS/MKK3/ p38/ERK in the context of NF1 deficiency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d).

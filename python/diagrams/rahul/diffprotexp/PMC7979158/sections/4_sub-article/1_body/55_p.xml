<p>“Finally, bulk tissue RNA-seq is limited in cell type-specific resolution and signatures could additionally be in part driven by cortex-adjacent structures, such as primordial hippocampus, that may have also been captured at the youngest age. Future work using single cell approaches is needed to resolve the impacted cell types and compare transcriptional pathology following MIA.”</p>

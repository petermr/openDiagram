<p>A total of 63 (septic) children diagnosed by pathology and evaluated by SOFA score system in Tianjin People's Hospital from January 2018 to December 2020 were randomly selected and collected. Due to the limitation of sample size as well as in order to generate statistically convincing results, the patients were divided into three groups (control group: pSOFA = 0; mild pediatric sepsis group: pSOFA = 2–4; severe pediatric sepsis group: pSOFA score ≥ 5). There were 21 cases in each group. This study is in line with the medical ethics standards and approved by the hospital ethics committee. All treatment and testing were carried out after obtaining informed consent from patients or their families.</p>

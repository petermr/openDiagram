<p>The switch in the catalytic behavior of this system was explained in refs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref>) by the interplay of geometric and electronic effects. The expansion of the interatomic distances was found to result in a more favorable stabilization of the reaction intermediates, leading to the formation of products beyond *CO.

 </sup> Furthermore, changes in the electronic structure due to Cu and Zn alloying resulted in a shift of the

 </sup> during the gradual Cu and Zn reduction and alloying, leading to different catalytic selectivity and stability for Cu-rich and Cu-poor samples. In fact, it was suggested that the Cu-M interatomic distances might constitute a convenient descriptor of the catalyst properties in these bimetallic NPs, with NPs with shorter interatomic distances (similar to that in metallic Cu) favoring the production of CH
 <sub>4</sub>, while NPs with longer Cuâ€”M distances favor the production of CO.

<p>Despite reports of the relative stability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome within the human population, whole genome sequencing has revealed recurrent variants with variable mutation patterns over the course of the pandemic and within distinct geographic regions [

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28â€“31</xref>]. Here, we characterized large ORF6 deletion variants identified through surveillance of patients from the same hospital unit. Reports of similar patterns of genomic deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome since its emergence have already been described, including in the ORFs 6, 7, and 8 [

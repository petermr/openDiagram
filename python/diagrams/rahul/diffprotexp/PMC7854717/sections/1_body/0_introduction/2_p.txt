0: There are important leftright differences in the mean arterial pressure between systemic and pulmonary circulation measured invasively in mice.
1: The mean RV systolic pressure of 16.3 mm Hg 1 vs. mean LV systolic pressure of 96.2 mm Hg 1 leads to a five times greater LV workload compared to RV.
2: There are also LV-RV differences in intraparietal tension, oxygen consumption and metabolic stress, resulting in higher susceptibility to oxidative stress, reduced angiogenic response and higher likelihood of activation of cell death pathways 2.

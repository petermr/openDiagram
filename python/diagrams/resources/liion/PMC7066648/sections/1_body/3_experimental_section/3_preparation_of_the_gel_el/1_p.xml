<p>The dipping-drying method was also employed in the preparation process of the gel electrolyte. LiBF
 <sub>4</sub> (0.125 g) was dissolved in 12.5 mL of the acetone solvent by magnetically stirring the mixture at 48 °C for 2 h. Then, the plasticizer solution consisting of EC (0.47 mL) and PC (0.53 mL) (EC/PC), together with PVDF-HFP (0.708 g), was added into the previous solution by stirring the mixture for 12 h at 48 °C to form a uniformly dispersed electrolyte solution. Later, the electrolyte solution was transferred into a home-made mold to immerse the yarn-shaped cathode and anode materials for 1 min. Then, the electrodes were taken out and dried for 5 min. After repeating the immersion and drying processes 20 times, the SSY@LFP coated with the gel electrolyte is formed and named SSY@LFP@GE. The entire process is completed in a glovebox with an inert nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the electrolyte from reacting with water or oxygen.

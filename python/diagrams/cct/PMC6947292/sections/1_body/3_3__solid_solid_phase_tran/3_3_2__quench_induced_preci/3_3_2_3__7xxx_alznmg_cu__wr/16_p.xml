<p>Another set of CCP diagrams for two variants of 7075 is compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f064">Figure 64</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f065">Figure 65</xref>. The diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f064">Figure 64</xref> was recorded by DSC and hardness testing after natural ageing [
 <xref rid="B161-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>], while the second was established based on in situ electrical resistivity measurements in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B60-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Both variants of 7075 considered here have comparable chemical compositions, although the variant from Ref. [
 <xref rid="B161-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>] is slightly more highly concentrated. For 7075, both methods obtained similar results in terms of the temperature ranges evaluated for the start and end of precipitation. However, the UCCRs are significantly different. While a combination of DSC and hardness testing after controlled linear cooling gave a rate of 300 K/s, the in situ electrical resistivity measurements suggested a UCCR range of â‰ˆ10 to 40 K/s [
 <xref rid="B88-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. This difference may result from a significant batch sensitivity in terms of the quench sensitivity of precipitation hardening Al alloys or from the abovementioned difficulties in evaluating in situ electrical resistivity measurements.

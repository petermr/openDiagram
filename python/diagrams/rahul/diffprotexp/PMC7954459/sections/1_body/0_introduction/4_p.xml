<p>Chickpea being the second most cultivated legume crop world‐wide, understanding of seed development and seed size/weight traits is important to provide a foundation for its improvement. Recently, transcriptome analysis during seed development in two chickpea cultivars with contrasting seed size/weight suggested that extended period of cell division at late‐embryogenesis and high level of endoreduplication at mid‐maturation stages are the possible factors that determine large seed size/weight in chickpea (Garg et al.,

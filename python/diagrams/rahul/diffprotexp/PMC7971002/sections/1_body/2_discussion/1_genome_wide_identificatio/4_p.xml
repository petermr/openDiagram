 </sup>. In this study, EGFR, CDK2, JAK3, and VEGFC were differentially enriched in the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. The development and differentiation of ovarian follicles are characterized by significant changes in the expression of aromatase (CYP19A1). However, its down-regulation requires effective signal transduction through EGFR

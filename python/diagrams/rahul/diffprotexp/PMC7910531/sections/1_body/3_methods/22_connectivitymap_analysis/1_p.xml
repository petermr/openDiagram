 </sup> to identify compounds and perturbagen classes (PCLs) that could possibly reverse the differences identified between high-grade and low-grade cartilage. Using the online interface clue.io (accessed 3 March 2019), we submitted the 148 genes with significantly higher expression on both RNA and protein level to calculate a ‘tau’ connectivity score to gene expression signatures experimentally induced by various perturbations in nine cell lines. A positive tau score indicates similarity between the gene expression signature of a perturbation and the submitted query (i.e. upregulation of the genes with higher expression in high-grade compared to low-grade cartilage). A negative tau score indicates that gene expression signature of a perturbation opposes the submitted query (i.e. downregulation of the genes with higher expression in high-grade compared to low-grade cartilage). Recommended thresholds for further consideration of results are tau of at least 90, or below −90, respectively (

A total of 2837 compound and 171 PCL perturbations were evaluated in clue.io. We shortlisted perturbations where both the summary tau and the median tau across cell lines were higher than 90 or lower than −90 for PCLs, with more conservative thresholds of higher than 95 or lower than −95 for compounds. The clue.io platform also contained perturbation data from 3799 gene knock-down and 2160 over-expression experiments (with 2111 genes in both, i.e. 3848 genes total). These data were used to shortlist genes where both the summary and median tau were higher than 95 or lower than −95.

<p>The expression matrix of the study was Log2 normalized, used in principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the relationship between samples. Outlier samples were determined by using the PCA plot and eliminated from the expression matrix before the differential gene expression analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with the R package limma from Bioconductor with the contrast of each glioma grade versus non-tumor samples [

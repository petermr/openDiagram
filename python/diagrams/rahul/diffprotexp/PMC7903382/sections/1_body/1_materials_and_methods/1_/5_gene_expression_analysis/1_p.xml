<p>High-throughput lncRNA-seq was used to identify novel genes in the spinal cord that regulate cardiac function in the rat MIRI model. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from the T1-T4 of spinal cord tissues from the three MIRI- and sham-group rats, and the concentration, purity and integrity of the RNA were assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) and checked using RNase-free 1% agarose gel electrophoresis containing GelRed
 <sup>®</sup> (cat. no. 41003; Biotium, Inc.). Ribosomal RNA was then removed from the total RNA. The mRNA and ncRNA were mostly retained and the strand-specific library was then constructed using NEBNext
 <sup>®</sup> Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
 <sup>®</sup> (cat. no. E7530L; New England BioLabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, the mRNA was fragmented and used as a template to synthesize cDNA with random primers. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using the following progress: 25˚C for 10 min, 42˚C for 15 min, 70˚C for 15 min and final holding at 4˚C. A Second Strand Marking Master Mix was used to synthesize second strand cDNA at 16˚C for 60 min. After using a ligate adapter, uracil-N-glycosylase treatment and PCR amplification were used to construct a sequencing library. The loading concentration of DNA was 12.182 nM. The PCR thermocycling parameters were set as follows: Initial denaturation at 98˚C for 30 sec; followed by 15 cycles of 98˚C for 10 sec, 60˚C for 30 sec and 72˚C for 30 sec; 1 cycle at 72˚C for 5 min and final holding at 10˚C. The library was then sequenced by Illumina HiSeqÔ 4000 with pair ends reads of 150 bp. The data were analyzed by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. (

 <sub>2</sub> fold change (FC)| and P-values as calculated with a t-test. |log
 <sub>2</sub>FC| &gt;1 and P&lt;0.05 were set as the up- and downregulated gene thresholds. Hierarchical clustering and volcano plots determined the different expression patterns of mRNAs and lncRNAs among the samples.

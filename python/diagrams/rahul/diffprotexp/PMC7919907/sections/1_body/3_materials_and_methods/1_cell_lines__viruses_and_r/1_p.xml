<p>Human RD, Vero E6 cell, Huh-7 cell, HEK293T cell expressing ACE2 (293T-ACE2), and HCT-8 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM); Caco-2 cell, Calu-3 cell and MRC-5 cell lines were maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM). Both mediums were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotics. Cells were kept at 37 °C incubator in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The following reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Human Coronavirus, OC43, NR-52725 and was propagated on HCT-8 cell or RD cell; HCoV-229E was obtained from Dr. Bart Tarbet (Utah State University) and amplified on Huh-7 cell or MRC-5 cell; The following reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Human Coronavirus, NL63, NR-470 and propagated on Caco-2 cell or HEK293T cell expressing ACE2 cell (293T-ACE2).

 <caption> Volcano plot of the significantly differentially expressed proteins. Differentially expressed proteins in hemocytes (A) and plasma (B) of Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos following infection with Opisthorchis viverrini at different time points (24, 48 and 96 hpi) compared to controls. Volcano plots showing log 2-fold changes plotted against log 2 P-values. Blue dots represent proteins with significantly down-regulated expression, while red dots represent proteins with significantly up-regulated expression. Proteins of interest discussed in the text have been labelled. </caption>

0: A 100 mm high bar was cut from the ingot, homogenized in an air furnace at 1150 C for 1 h to remove the inhomogeneous microstructures, hot rolled at 950 C in 4 passes to a diameter of 40 mm (  = ~20%), and then cooled to room temperature in air.
1: The bar was heated to 790 C and kept for 8 h (spheroidized annealing) and cooled to 520 C with the furnace, subsequently air-cooled to room temperature.
2: The spheroidized annealed bar was cold rolled to a final thickness of 30 mm via 4 passes (  = ~25%) and then heated to 680 C for 8 to 10 h for recrystallization annealing treatment.
3: The experimental steel after cold rolling and recrystallization annealing was cold drawn, then heated to 680 C for 8~10 h for recrystallization annealing.
4: At last, the steel was heated to 510 C and kept for 6~8 h for stress-relief annealing ( Figure 1b).

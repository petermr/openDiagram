<p id="Par18">To confirm the reliability of RNA-Seq in identification of differentially expressed genes under salt stress, we performed the qPCR analysis of 10 randomly selected unigenes at salinity levels of ECe ~ 30 dS/m, ECe ~ 40 dS/m and ECe ~ 50 dS/m. A similar expression level was observed between qPCR results and RNA-Seq data but with some variations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The results confirmed the reliability of RNAseq analysis. The qPCR expression analysis was performed to identify if pathways of the selected genes were involved in providing high-salinity tolerance to

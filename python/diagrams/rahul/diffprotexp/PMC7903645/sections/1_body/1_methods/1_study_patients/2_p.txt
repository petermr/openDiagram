2: On the day of CI diagnosis, whole blood samples were obtained from the women; for controls, samples were obtained on the day of enrollment in the study.
3: To validate RNA-Seq analysis, qRT-PCR and immunoassay experiments were performed using separate sample-sets of the CI and control groups.
4: Blood samples for qRT-PCR were collected into PAXgeneTM RNA stabilization tubes (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), part of the blood samples was centrifuged to collect the serum, and both blood and serum samples were cryopreserved at  80 C. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital (No.

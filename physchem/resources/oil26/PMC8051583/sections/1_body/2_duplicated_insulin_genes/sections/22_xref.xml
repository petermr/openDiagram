<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Further study is needed to determine whether this retroposed Northern pike insulin gene is expressed and if its encoded protein has a physiological function. These observations also indicate that the vertebrate insulin gene is expressed in the germ cells of a number of species, thus allowing it to be retroprocessed and integrated into the genome allowing to be passed on to the next generation, raising questions about the possible function of insulin in germ line cells.

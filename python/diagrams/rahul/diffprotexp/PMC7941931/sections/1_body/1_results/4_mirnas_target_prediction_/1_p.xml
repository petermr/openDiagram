<p id="Par33">To understand the potential function of these identified miRNAs, the putative target genes of the 230 miRNAs were predicted using the TargetFinder software. A total of 3268 potential target genes were successfully predicted for among 213 miRNAs, including 2052 target genes from 101 known miRNAs and 1372 target genes from 112 novel miRNAs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). These predicted target genes mainly encoded transcription factors (TFs, 285), protein kinases (254), phosphatase, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, proteins in hormone signal transduction and other cellular processes, and enzymes in various metabolisms (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6). The main target TFs of these miRNAs are displayed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7, and the top three TFs were MYB (65), AP2/ERF (18), and NAC (18), respectively. Consistent with the results of previous studies, some conserved miRNAs targeted the known TFs. For instance, miR156, miR160, miR164, miR171, miR172, miR319, miR396, and miR858 targeted SPL, ARF, NAC, GRAS, AP2-ERF, TCP, GRF, and MYB TFs, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7). In addition, based on a homologous search of the putative target genes, the predicted target genes of 61 miRNAs, including 39 conserved and 22 novel miRNAs, were found to be the homologous genes of 47 known seed or organ size genes (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S8). Among these, the 39 conserved miRNAs were from 14 known miRNA families including MiR156/157 (10), MiR159 (1), MiR162 (1), MiR164 (1), MiR166 (2), MiR167 (1), MiR168 (4), MiR169 (1), MiR172 (5), MiR319 (2), MiR390 (2), MiR395 (2), MiR396 (4), and MiR530 (3). Notably, among these 61 miRNAs, most miRNAs were first found to target the known seed or organ size genes, except the members of the MiR156/157 and MiR396 families which are well known to target the seed size SPL and GRF TFs, respectively. Furthermore, based on a homologous search, 8 miRNAs (4 known and 4 novel) were identified to target the structural or regulatory genes of flavonoid biosynthesis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S9). Among these, fta_novel_miR26 targeted phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (
 <italic>PAL</italic>), fta_novel_miR74 targeted 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (
 <italic>4CL</italic>), fta-miR394a-5p targeted flavonol synthase (
 <italic>FLS</italic>), fta_novel_miR1 targeted the homologous genes of 
 <italic>AtMYB123</italic> that regulate anthocyanindins biosynthesis, fta_novel_miR58 targeted the homologous genes of 
 <italic>AtbHLH42</italic>/
 <italic>TT8</italic> that regulate anthocyanindins biosynthesis, and fta-miR828-5p targeted the homologous genes of 
 <italic>AtMYB75</italic>/
 <italic>90</italic>/
 <italic>113</italic>/
 <italic>114</italic> that regulate anthocyanindins biosynthesis. In addition, fta-miR858a-5p and fta-miR858b-3p targeted 13 and 14 MYB TFs involved in the regulation of flavonol biosynthesis and anthocyanindins biosynthesis, respectively.

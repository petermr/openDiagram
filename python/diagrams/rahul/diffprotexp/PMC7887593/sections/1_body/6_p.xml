<p>Proteins with a clearly altered expression after a 14‐day gluten challenge are already minutely altered in the “responders" at baseline. The protein changes are associated with the presence of gluten‐specific CD4+ T cells in the gut mucosa. This suggests ongoing gluten immunity in these patients even in absence of mucosal changes as detectable by routine histology. Our findings suggest that in some well‐treated celiac patients on a standard gluten‐free diet there is ongoing antigluten immunity.</p>

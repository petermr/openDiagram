0: Total RNA was isolated from cultured hTCEpi cells after 24 h treatment with AC EFs using the NucleoSpin  RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: Single-stranded cDNA was prepared with 1 g of total RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
2: Intronexon spanning primers were designed from the respective GenBank sequences using VectorNTI software (ThermoFisher Scientific) based on the minimal hairpin, duplex formation, and guanine cytosine composition.
3: A list of primers used in this study is given in  Table 1.

0: This paper reports the obtaining of poly (vinyl alcohol) and -carrageenan blend hydrogels by physical crosslinking (consecutive freezethaw cycles).
1: The two polymers were completely miscible in the weight ratio interval used in this study, as determined by solution viscometry data.
2: Strong interactions through hydrogen bonding and forming of mixed interpolymer crystalline domains were observed, which are responsible for the formation of stable drug release-tunable matrices.
3: The release profiles of three model antibiotic drugs (amoxicillin, tetracycline hydrochloride, and gentamicin sulfate) were assessed in a pH interval between 3 and 7.3.
4: They were found to be strongly dependent on the drug chemistry, mesh size of the hydrogels, swelling mechanism, and pH of the release medium.
5: A decrease of up to 40% in the release rates and up to 10% in the diffusion coefficients of the model drugs was registered with the increase in -carrageenan content.

<p id="Par46">To obtain high quality novel peptides, a quality filter of Mascot score &gt; 20 was applied on the proteomic datasets and subsequently performed differential expression analysis on the proteins of filtered peptides. Approximately half of the total peptides remained after applying the filter (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), whereas for novel peptides the proportions are much lower, ranging from 14% to 20%. This suggests that compared with peptides from canonical proteins, novel peptides tend to have lower probabilities of being a real positive match. A total of 138 and 131 unique novel peptides remained in the oocyst and salivary gland sporozoite dataset respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) after the filtering, with AltORF being the most common category followed by intergenic, which follows a similar trend before filtering. Unfortunately, no peptides from antisense strand or retained intron passed the filter, which were very rare before filtering too.

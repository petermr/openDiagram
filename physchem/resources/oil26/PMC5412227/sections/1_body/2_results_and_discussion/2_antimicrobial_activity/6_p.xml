<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils could be attributed to the presence of mostly active compounds, such as Geranial (Maksimovi&#263; et al. 2008; Seth et al., 2012), a-pinene (Dorman and Deans, 2000), Geraniol acetate, Geraniol (Duarte et al. 2007; Singh et al., 2012), Neral (Maksimovi&#263; et al. 2008; Sartoratto et al. 2004) and Limonene (Inouye et al., 2001). moreover, the components such as trans-Caryophyllene, Germacrene-D, &#948;-Cadinene, &#946;-Pinene, &#946;-Myrcene and Sabinene which were found in lower levels, could also contribute to the antimicrobial activity of the oils (Aguiar et al. 2013; Dorman and Deans 2000; Ozt&#252;rk et al. 2009). In fact, the synergistic effects of the diversity between the major and minor constituents present in the essential oils should be taken into consideration in accounting for their biological activity.</p>

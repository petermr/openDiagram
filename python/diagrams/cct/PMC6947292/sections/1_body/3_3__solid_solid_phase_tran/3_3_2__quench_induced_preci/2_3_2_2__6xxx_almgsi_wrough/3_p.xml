<p>HTRs are the dominating heat effects during slow cooling, and are increasingly suppressed at increasing cooling rates. At cooling rates where the HTRs are substantially suppressed, the LTRs of the eight commercial alloys studied become more dominant, and the peaks shift towards higher temperatures. These two effects can be explained by the higher concentration of alloying elements that is left in solution prior to the LTR. The high-purity alloys behave differently in this respect from the commercial alloys, and one major reason for this is the difference in the nucleation mechanism of the LTR (shown below in more detail). At even higher rates, the LTRs also experience increasing suppression. For 6005A, a complete suppression of precipitation during cooling was achieved at about 6 K/s. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f030">Figure 30</xref>B, it can be seen that the total specific precipitation enthalpy Î”h measured by DSC drops to zero at the UCCR. It can also be observed that at higher cooling rates, the hardness after ageing reached a saturation level.

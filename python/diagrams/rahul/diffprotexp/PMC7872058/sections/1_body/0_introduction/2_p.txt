0: IPA usually starts in the lungs via the inhalation of airborne conidia.
1: There, innate immunity is mediated by neutrophils, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages, which are the first line of defense against  A. fumigatus and responsible for local inflammatory responses against this pathogen [ 4, 5].
2: The recognition of  A. fumigatus by macrophages is performed by pattern recognition receptors, which include C-type lectin and toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize specific fungal components [ 68].
3: Over the last decade, an additional family of evolutionary conserved innate immune receptors has been identified: the triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) [ 9].
4: Among them, TREM1 is the best-characterized member of the TREM family of receptors.
5: TREM1, belonging to the Ig superfamily, is a cell-surface activating receptor with a single extracellular V-type Ig-like domain, a transmembrane region containing charged lysine residues, and a short cytoplasmic tail lacking signaling motifs.
6: Receptor domains of TREM1 include both activating and inhibitory isoforms whose ligands are unknown [ 10].

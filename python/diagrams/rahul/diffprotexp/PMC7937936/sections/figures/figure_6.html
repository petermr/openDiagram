 <caption> Differential expression analysis of hub genes in tumor and normal tissues in GEO data sets. (A) There was no significant difference in the expression of CCR4 in the GSE30784 data set. (B, C) Significant differences were observed in the expression of CCR8 and P2RY14 between tumor and normal tissues in the GSE30784 data set ( P&lt;0.001). (D) No significant difference in CCR4 was observed in the GSE37991 data set. (E, F) In the GSE37991 data set, CCR8 expression was increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, while P2RY14 expression was significantly decreased. </caption>

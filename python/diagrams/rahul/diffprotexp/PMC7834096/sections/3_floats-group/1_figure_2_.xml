  <p>Western blot analysis of EAEC strain 55989 
   <italic>agg</italic>3
   <sup>−</sup> heterologously expressing AAF/I, III, IV and V. Shown is a Western blot analysis of the pBAD24-based expression of the 
   <italic>aaf</italic>/I, III, IV and V determinants. Decreasing amounts of total protein (10 µg, 5 µg and 2.5 µg) of EAEC strain 55989 
   <italic>agg</italic>3
   <sup>−</sup> carrying plasmid pAAF/I (a), pAAF/III (b), pAAF/IV (c) or pAAF/V (d) were used for semi-quantitative Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against each major fimbrial subunit. EAEC strain 55989 
   <italic>agg</italic>3
   <sup>−</sup> carrying the empty vector pBAD24 was used as negative control (NC). Corresponding sizes of immunoreactive bands are given on the right (size marker; M)

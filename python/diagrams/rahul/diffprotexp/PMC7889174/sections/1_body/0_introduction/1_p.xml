<p>Eukaryotes are estimated to have arisen over one and a half billion years ago – an event considered to be one of the major evolutionary transitions [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>]. A consensus model is emerging [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with the first eukaryotes likely evolving from within the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota (TACK) superphylum [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Advances in environmental sampling and sequencing have superseded earlier rRNA-based models, which proposed three domains of eukaryotic life [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], to firmly place eukaryotes as emerging from within the Archaea and, hence, supporting a two domain paradigm [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At some point following the divergence from the archaeal lineage, the protoeukaryote began to acquire features typical of eukaryotic cells, including a tubulin-based flagellum, an endomembrane system, a cytoskeleton and the mitochondrion. Remarkably, this period of evolution produced a complex Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) that possessed a large diversity of compartments exceeding the complement of many extant unicellular organisms.

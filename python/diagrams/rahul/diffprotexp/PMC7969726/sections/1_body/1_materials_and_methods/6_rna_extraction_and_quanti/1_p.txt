0: Total RNA was isolated from fresh tissues and cell lines, and purified using TRIzol reagent (BIOO Scientific Co., Austin, TX, United States) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: The mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using standard procedures with a Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China).
2: SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Vazyme Biotech) was performed in 96-well plates.
3: The mRNA levels were normalized to the expression of 18S mRNA.
4: For APA validation, we used percentage of distal polyadenylation site usage index (PDUI) value by analyzing PDUI = long 3UTR transcript/total transcript.
5: For AS validation, we used percent spliced-in (PSI) value by analyzing PSI = skipping exon (SE) transcript/total transcript.
6: Sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for each transcript are listed in  Supplementary Table 1.

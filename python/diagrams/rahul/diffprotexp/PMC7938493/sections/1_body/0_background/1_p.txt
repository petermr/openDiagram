0: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is the most common malignancy in the urinary system, ranking 4th among men and 18th among women [ 1].
1: The 5-year survival rates have remained generally flat since the 1990s due to late diagnosis and limited therapeutics.
2: Patients with non-muscle-invasive tumours are easier to treat and have lower mortality rate compared to those in patients with tumours that have grown into the muscle wall or beyond [ 2].
3: Currently, BLCA screening heavily relies on cystoscopy, upper urography, urine cytology, and computed tomography (CT) [ 3].
4: Cystoscopy is an invasive examination method that is also expensive and uncomfortable for patients.
5: However, urine cytology is less sensitive.
6: The measurement of circulating biomarkers is a promising diagnostic method owing to their relative availability in serum and plasma [ 2].
7: Thus, there is an urgent need to identify early diagnostic biomarkers and prognostic indexes to improve the treatment effects and survival rate of BLCA.

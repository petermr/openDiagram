0: The enduring effects of perinatal experiences on gene expression can often be linked to epigenetic gene regulation [ 15].
1: DNA methylation, for example, acts by adding methyl groups to cytosines at CpG dinucleotides, which can suppress gene expression [ 16].
2: Methylation patterns are established in early development and may be one way for hormone-induced changes to last into adulthood .
3: Examples of this are evident in the methylation patterns produced by steroid-mediated sex differentiation in mammals [ 17] and fetal exposure to endocrine disrupters [ 18].
4: Thus far, candidate-gene analyses suggest that variation in the maternal environment can result in altered DNA methylation patterns in juvenile birds [ 19,  20].
5: However, the proposed mechanism, starting with prenatal T and leading to long-term phenotypic changes in adults, along with the potential intervening transcriptomic/epigenomic steps, has yet to be tested.

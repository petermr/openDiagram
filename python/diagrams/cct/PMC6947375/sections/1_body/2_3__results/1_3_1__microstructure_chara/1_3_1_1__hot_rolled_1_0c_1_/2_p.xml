<p>TEM observations were performed to characterize the microstructures of the hot rolled 1.0C-1.5Cr steel in detail, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref>câ€“f. The ferrite-cementite interface in pearlite was not completely straight, revealing a curvature difference in the local area. Partially adjacent ferrite lamellae were interrupted by fine cementite lamellae in localized regions, forming a cartridge-like structure (

 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] used computer-aided three-dimensional (3-D) tomography to observe the three-dimensional morphology of pearlite, showing that the pearlite lamellar structure was not perfect, with holes in the cementite sheet. These holes were high curvature layered fault regions with high chemical potentials in which cementite preferred to dissolve and nucleate, resulting in irregular surface of the cementite sheet [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref>d), which was related to the degeneration of pearlite because the pearlite was difficult to retain the way of collaborative growth at low transformation temperature [

 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cementite exhibited as spherical and rod-like when the diffusion rate of alloying elements was slow because of low temperature. Zhang et al. suggested that the presence of branches in a localized area of a single cementite sheet was caused by branching growth [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Provided larger thickness of cementite lamellae, more carbide forming elements were consumed during the process of co-grow in coordinate with the adjacent ferrite sheets. Thus, a branch appeared in the local area of a single thicker cementite sheet to maintain the synergistic growth of pearlite, leading to the formation of two thinner cementite sheets [

1: We further confirmed that no patient used glucocorticoid use (systemic or intra-articular) within the previous 6 months, or any other drug associated with immune modulation.
2: For cohort 1, cartilage samples were scored using the OARSI cartilage classification system 33,  34.
3: From each patient, we obtained one sample with high OARSI grade signifying high-grade degeneration ('high-grade sample'), and one cartilage sample with low OARSI grade signifying healthy tissue or low-grade degeneration ('low-grade sample').

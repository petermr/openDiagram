0: One of the ways to make salt stress tolerant crop plants is to genetically engineer them to sustain their growth and productivity in challenging environments.
1: This requires exploring gene pool of wild relatives of crop plants.
2: This can be achieved by analysing global gene expression of salt tolerant species to reveal the underlying regulatory and metabolic mechanisms.
3: Glenn et al.
4: (1999) 6 have suggested a number as high as 6000 species of halophytes and additionally, the eHALOPH 7, Halophyte Database currently identifies more than 1500 species as salt tolerant, without labelling them as halophyte.
5: The main halophytes explored for physiological and molecular studies for salt tolerance mechanism include  Sueda8,  9,  Spartina species10,  Salicornia brachiate11 and  Atriplex etc .
6: Still the salt tolerant grasses (STGs) that have not been explored for gene network analysis may be utilised to elucidate their mechanisms of survival at high salt concentrations.
7: Urochondra setulosa (Poaceae) is a rhizomatous perennial grass that grows in dune slacks, banks of salt-water creeks and saline flats.
8: It is distributed in Northern Africa through Arabia, southern coast of Pakistan (Sindh) and Northwest India 12.
9: It can survive up to 1000 mM NaCl but genomically, its mechanism of survival in high saline environment has not been explored.
10: Next-generation sequencing coupled with bioinformatics tools provides a platform for high-throughput analysis of key metabolic pathways involved in stress response and adaptation.
11: Here, we used RNA sequencing to identify the genes present in a highly salt tolerant non-model plant species,  Urochondra setulosa and identify the genes associated with salt tolerance.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f003">Figure 3</xref>a shows a SEM image of the HPC. It is clearly shown that the HPC exhibits a typically porous structure with rich macropores (a few hundred nanometers in diameter). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f003">Figure 3</xref>bâ€“e presents TEM images of the HPC. A large number of pores (tens to hundreds of nanometers in diameter) can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,c, forming the first class pores. Plenty of mesopores with a diameter of a few nanometers can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f003">Figure 3</xref>d, constituting the second-class pores. In this situation, a hierarchical porous structure containing the first-class pores (macropores) and the second-class pores (mesopores) is successfully obtained. This result is coincidence with the pore size distribution result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f002">Figure 2</xref>d). Furthermore, the lattice fringe spacing of 0.36 nm marked in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f003">Figure 3</xref>e is consistent with the (002) planes of the graphite (JCPDS No. 65-6212), corresponding well with the XRD result.

 </sup> against BSA as standard. iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics analysis was performed in duplicates between the control (0-dpa) and regenerating time points (1-dpa, 2-dpa and 5-dpa) by loading 50 μg of total proteins in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was stained, destained, documented and fractionated into four sequential groups. The gel fractions were washed; trypsin digested, labelled with isobaric tags iTRAQ 4-plex labelling and purified with the help of C-18 spin columns (Thermo Scientific). The purified/labelled peptides were vacuum dried and constituted in 5% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.2% formic acid to the peptides for the LCMS/MSMS (Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/Tandem mass spectrometry) analysis

 </sup>. The LCMS/MSMS run was performed in Orbitrap Velos Nano analyzer (Thermo) involving High Collision Dissociation (HCD) mode of acquisition with 50% normalized collision energy. The raw files were analysed with Sequest HT proteome discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific), with 1% FDR (False discovery rate) using percolator and XCorr (Score Vs Charge) against the NGS generated lizard database. All the proteins, in duplicates, were analysed against the control (0-dpa). Differentially regulated expression by more than 1-log fold changes were selected as proteins associated with regeneration.

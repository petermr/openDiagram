 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> MIL-1 (DSM 14913) was grown in sterile 160 ml Nunc Cell Culture Treated Flasks containing 100 ml of ONR7a media (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dyksterhouse et al., 1995</xref>). Cultures were enriched separately with the medium-chain alkane 
 <italic>n</italic>-Tetradecane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub>), or the long-chain alkane 
 <italic>n</italic>-Octacosane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>), or the non-hydrocarbon control Tween 80 (0.1% w/v) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4). Cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker (16Â°C, 60 rpm) and cells were harvested in early exponential growth phase for protein extraction after 4 days.

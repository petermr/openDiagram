 <caption> High-throughput RNA sequencing of Kawasaki disease (KD) sera-treated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from KD with coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL+; n = 3; group A) or KD without coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL–; n = 3; group B) for 4 h. The total RNA was isolated to perform Illumina novaseq 6000 RNA sequencing. (A) Differential expression gene clustering heat map. The abscissa is the sample name, and the ordinate is the normalized value of the differentially expressed gene FPKM. The redder the color, the higher the expression; the greener, the lower the expression. (B) Differential gene volcano-gram. The abscissa is log2FoldChange value, and the ordinate is –log10 padj or –log10 p-value. The blue dotted line represents the threshold line of the differential gene screening criteria. (C) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis bubble chart. The ordinate is GO Term, abscissa for the GO Term enrichment significant. (D) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis bubble chart. The ordinate is the KEGG pathway, and the abscissa is the significance level of the enrichment of the pathway. </caption>

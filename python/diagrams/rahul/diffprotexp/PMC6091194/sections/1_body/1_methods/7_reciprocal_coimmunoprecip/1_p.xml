<p id="Par47">Reciprocal coIPs were performed as described previously in the coIP section, except antibodies to the coprecipitates, SPARC and Parvin were used to coprecipitate Kcnma1 and Ilk, respectively, from P3 lysate. Antibodies and techniques used in the immunocomplex capture method were as before. Blots were probed with BKα polyclonal antibody at 1:400 (Chemicon) and Ilk-polyclonal antibody at 1:500 (Proteintech Group) with rocking O/N at 4 °C, followed with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:7500 or with mouse anti-rabbit light chain at 1:15,000 with rocking at RT for 1 h, respectively. Negative controls were as before and positive controls consisted of lysate probed with SPARC and Parvin. Immunoreactive bands were developed as described previously.</p>

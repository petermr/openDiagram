 <caption> P value plot of proteins in seminal plasma. Each square stands for a differentially expressed protein (a and b). Large squares show the proteins with a differential expression (P &lt; 0.05) between semen samples from fertile and infertile men. Squares around similar molecular weight were grouped (ten proteins). The behavior of these proteins in the two groups of patients is shown in the box and whisker graph. F: Fertile men; I: infertile men (c). m/z: Mass to charge ratio </caption>

0: Proteomics is a large-scale study of proteins expressed in cells, mostly detected using a mass spectrometer.
1: Proteomic findings have been widely used to identify and quantify proteins involved in the research of drug treatments, biomarkers and diseases, including PD.
2: For example, a previous study reported a proteomic approach using 2D gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to explore the protein expression pattern in primary skin fibroblasts of patients with PD ( 17).
3: Another study used non-gel based proteomics analysis to investigate proteomes in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with PD ( 18).
4: Furthermore, proteomics analysis has been applied for primary screening and detection of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, and for distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative diseases ( 19).
5: Proteomics, therefore, is a powerful technique for identification and quantification of proteins, as well as for protein profiling and identification of biomarkers of diseases.

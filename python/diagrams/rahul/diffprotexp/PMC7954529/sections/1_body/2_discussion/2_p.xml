<p>Importantly, inter-species differences identified using a comparative approach may be important not only for understanding primate evolution but may implicate candidate loci for further investigation in humans. For example, genomic regions that are conserved in primates may point to loci that are likely to have negative functional consequences in humans, potentially with effects on disease risk (

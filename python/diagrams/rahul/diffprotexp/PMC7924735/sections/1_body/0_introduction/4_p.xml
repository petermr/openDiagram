<p>Victor et al. (2012) first reported and characterized 
 <italic>Taenia solium</italic> secretion proteins. These authors used a database of secretion proteins from closely related helminths and the expressed sequence tags combined with BLAST and a mapping of super contigs in the genome of 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic>, taking advantage of its biological closeness with 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic>. While this strategy allowed to outline the possible secretome of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic>, it proved to have great limitations, and only 76 proteins, mostly involved in parasite survival, were identified as ESP. Among these proteins, only 27 had been previously described in 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic>; 32 proteins were identified as probably of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> origin by their homology to sequences found in other helminths, and 17 proteins were determined as produced by the host (
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) [

0: Electrochemical tests were carried out in CR 2032 coin cells with lithium metal as the reference and counter electrode.
1: Seventy percent active materials, 20% carbon black and 10 % PVDF were evenly mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to form the cathode slurry.
2: The active material loading was controlled at about 2 mg cm 2.
3: 1 M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (V eth: V die 1:1) was used as electrolyte.
4: Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were performed by using a multichannel battery tester (Neware BTS-610) in a voltage window of 03.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry curves (CV) were carried out on a PARSTAT 4,000 electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s 1 in the range of 3.00.01 V(vs. Li/Li +).
5: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested in the frequency range of 100 kHz0.01 Hz.

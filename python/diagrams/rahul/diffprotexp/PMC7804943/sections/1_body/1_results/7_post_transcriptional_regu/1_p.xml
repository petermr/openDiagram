<p id="Par22">Given the contributions of AS, APA, and IR to the latent factors defined in the whole-brain analysis, we next asked whether these post-transcriptional regulatory layers, independently of GE, can distinguish different properties of neurons. We therefore applied MOFA under two scenarios: one using data from only AS, APA and IR, and one using data from GE alone (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>; see Methods). To determine whether similar groups of neuronal subtype populations were identified in both situations, the latent factor weights assigned by MOFA for each neuronal subtype population cluster were used to compute pairwise correlations (Fig.

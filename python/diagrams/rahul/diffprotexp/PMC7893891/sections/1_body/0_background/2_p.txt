0: Several in vitro protocols have been developed to convert progenitor cells, such as human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), into MNs [ 2 4].
1: There are still challenges limiting clinical application of these iPSC-derived MNs.
2: For example, the generation of physiologically active neurons requires a lengthy cell maturation period and often results in a heterogeneous population of neuronal subtypes [ 5].
3: Protocol reproducibility can also vary as different cell lineages have unique maturation and functional properties.
4: To address these challenges, we present a 28-day transcriptome study coupled with functional assays.
5: Our main objective was to resolve the underlying mechanisms driving MN differentiation.
6: The results from this study can guide experimental strategies to obtain populations highly enriched with the desired MN subtype.

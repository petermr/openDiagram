<p>To identify biological function of DEGs, GO term analysis was performed on DEGs using KOBAS with corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>-value cut-off ≤ 0.05 (
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the full design, significant up-regulated (UR) GO term candidates were endopeptidase regulator and oxidoreductase activities, and down-regulated (DR) GO terms were cell aging and hydrolase activity. In individual variety design, for ‘Jessie’ significant UR GO terms were response to oxygen-containing compound and flavonoid biosynthetic process, whereas photoperiodism and response to stimulus were among candidate DR GO terms. In ‘QQ74’, cellulose catabolic process and telomere maintenance were significant UR GO terms, and telomere organization and beta-glucan catabolic process were DR GO terms. In ‘Red Head’, UR GO terms were chloroplast accumulation movement and response to stress, and DR GO terms were response to chemical and chlorophyll metabolic process (

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). With all the experimental factors in the statistical design, glycerophospholipid metabolism was among significant UR KEGG pathways; and pyrimidine metabolism was the only enriched DR KEGG pathway. Within each variety design, in ‘Jessie’, flavonoid biosynthesis was the most enriched UR KEGG pathways, and circadian rhythm was a significant DR KEGG pathway candidate. In ‘QQ74’, top enriched UR KEGG pathway was sulfur metabolism, whereas the most significant DR pathway was biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In ‘Red Head’, top enriched UR KEGG pathway was circadian rhythm, and the most significant DR pathway was glycerolipid metabolism (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244364.s015">S4 Table</xref>). Overall, among the enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways, modulation of hormonal signaling, plant-pathogen interaction (PPI), photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and amino acid biosyntheses were shared at least once between varieties.

 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> typically has a monopolar, monotrichous flagellum, although a monopolar tuft of four flagella has also been observed (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Yakimov et al., 2004</xref>). We identified a whole array of corresponding genes spanning the region TOL_2479-TOL_2522 that code for proteins involved in chemotaxis and for components of the flagellum and flagellar motor. Three proteins, coded by genes in this region were significantly upregulated during growth on

 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub> and Tween 80 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These include a purine-binding chemotaxis protein, CheW (TOL_2481; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, MCP (TOL_2508; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and a histidine kinase, CheA (TOL_2510; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Expression increased 2.5-fold, 2-fold, and 4-fold, respectively, compared to growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub> and Tween 80 suggesting a putative role in chemotaxis toward long-chain alkanes. An uncharacterized protein (TOL_0708; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) was also significantly upregulated, increasing twofold during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>. The gene that codes for this protein is located adjacent to the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (TOL_0709) that was expressed during growth on 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>28</sub>. Domain analysis revealed a HAMP domain and an MCP signal domain, indicating the protein is another MCP. Considering that other M have been detected next to alkane-oxidizing monooxygenases [e.g., 
 <italic>tlpS</italic> in 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Smits et al., 2003</xref>), 
 <italic>alkN</italic> in 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> GPo1 (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">van Beilen et al., 2001</xref>)], this suggests that the protein is involved in chemotaxis toward alkanes with a specific role in long-chain alkane metabolism.

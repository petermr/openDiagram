<p id="Par26">To address these questions, we have compared the cytotoxicity of AS6 in normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells, human mammary epithelial normal cells (HUMEC), and Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 (MCF7) cells. An interesting finding was that MCF7 cells were much more susceptible to AS6 than HUMEC, and some major cell cycle factors were differentially regulated in these cells by AS6. Therefore, we further investigated the impact of AS6 on genomic expression and used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to analyze the changes in expression of all protein-coding and non-coding genes in these cells with or without AS6 treatment. Strikingly, AS6 altered the transcription of a large number of genes in MCF7 cells whereas much fewer genes were differentially expressed in HUMEC in the same condition. Our bioinformatics analyses have identified a number of cellular pathways that were significantly impacted by AS6 in MCF7 cells. The downregulated pathways included cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and DNA repair whereas the upregulated pathways involved apoptosis and stress-response. Furthermore, we validated these genomic data through the real-time PCR and immunoblotting analyses to quantify the expression of several critical genes at the RNA and protein levels. Our intriguing results suggest that AS6 treatment at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 μM increases cellular stress and genomic instability, ultimately inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF7 cells, but not in HUMEC. Our results therefore, provide the essential and fundamental understanding of the cytotoxicity, anticancer effects, and genome regulation of AS6 for the future evaluations and applications in the environmental and medical fields.</p>

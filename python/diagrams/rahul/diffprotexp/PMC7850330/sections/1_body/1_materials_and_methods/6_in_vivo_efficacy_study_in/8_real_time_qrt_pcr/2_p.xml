<p>cDNA synthesis was performed for equal quantities of total RNA in all samples employing the kit of RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis (#K1632, Thermo Scientific Fermentas, St. Leon-Ro, Germany). Real-time PCR was performed with single-stranded cDNAs. PCRs were accomplished by SYBER Green [#K0251, Thermo Scientific Fermentas St. Leon-Ro, Germany-Maxima SYBER Green qPCR Master Mix (2X)] using the detection system of StepOne Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystems). The set of primers used for IL-1 
 <italic>(</italic>GenBank accession NC_013670.1) were as follows: forward primer was 5′-AGCTTCTCCAGAGCCACAAC-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-CCTGACTACCCTCACGCACC-3′. Primers for GAPDH (GenBank accession NC_013676.1) were 5′-GTCAAGGCTGAGAACGGGAA-3′(forward primer) and 5′-ACAAGAGAGTTGGCTGGGTG-3′(reverse primer), and primers for TGF-β (GenBank accession NC_013672.1) were 5′-GACTGTGCGTTTTGGGTTCC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCTGGGCTCCTCCTAGAGTT (reverse primer). primers for TNF-α (GenBank accession NC_013680.1) were 5′-GAGAACCCCACGGCTAGATG-3′(forward primer) and 5′-TTCTCCAACTGGAAGACGCC-3′ (reverse primer). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using 20
 <bold> </bold>μl of RealMOD Green qRT-PCR Mix kit (iNtRON biotechnology) with 0.02
 <bold> </bold>µg RNA per reaction containing 10 Pmol of specific primers, for 30 runs for 10
 <bold> </bold>sec of 95
 <bold> </bold>°C and 1
 <bold> </bold>min of 60
 <bold> </bold>°C. Threshold cycle or comparative Ct method was employed to establish the relative products amounts. The relative expression was computed employing the formula 2 (-ΔΔCt) (Mullou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). They were scaled in relation to controls whereas control samples had a value of 1.

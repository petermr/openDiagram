 <caption> Variations in the expression of genes and their protein products are associated with melanogenesis in B16F1 cells induced at differential pigmentation and a decrease in proliferation. Relative expression radius (rER) by RT-qPCR, n = 4, representative photographs of the location and distribution by immunofluorescence (red) in nuclear counterstain with DAPI (blue), quantification of expression by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and western blot for the master regulator of melanocyte cell differentiation—MITF ( a– c), and the enzymes Tyr ( d– f), Trp1 ( g– i), and Dct ( j– l). The level of significance (*) using two-tailed multiple t-tests. The differences were considered statistically significant for a p-value &lt; 0.05, ns: not significant. Significant (*) with p &lt; 0.05, very significant (**) with p &lt; 0.01, highly significant (***) with p &lt; 0.001 and very highly significant (****) with p &lt; 0.0001. </caption>

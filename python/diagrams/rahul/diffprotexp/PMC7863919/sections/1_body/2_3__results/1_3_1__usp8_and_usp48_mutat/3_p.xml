<p>Among patients with silent corticotroph tumors, significantly higher 24 h UFC level was observed in patients with 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations than in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt patients (median 124.4 vs. 66.32, respectively; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0334). No difference in morning serum ACTH level, morning serum cortisol level, or midnight serum cortisol level were observed between these patients. We did not observe any difference between 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt patients in invasive growth status as determined with Knosp grading, proliferation index, or histological subtype (sparsely vs. densely granulated) either in the group of Cushingâ€™s disease patients or in those with silent tumors. The results are presented in

<p id="Par15">There is a longstanding interest in understanding the reliability of using the cytosolic or nuclear RNA as a proxy for whole-cell gene expression analysis. To obtain a more accurate view of the differences between the cytosolic and nuclear transcriptomes as a source for gene expression analysis, we compared the results of differential gene expression analysis between cytosolic and nuclear transcriptomes from the fetal frontal cortex and the adult frontal cortex (cytosolic vs cytosolic [cyto–cyto], and nuclear vs nuclear [nuc–nuc]). To control for the differences in the amount of sequencing data produced from the fetal and adult tissues (Supplementary Table 1), we first subsampled the read counts to obtain equal library sizes for the samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two samples for the cyto–cyto and nuc–nuc before and after subsampling showed that the subsampling had a marginal effect on the number of DEGs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Subsampled data were used for the rest of the analysis in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. We then compared the number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes between the two tissues in the cyto–cyto and nuc–nuc data. There was a clear difference in the number of DEGs detected in cyto–cyto and nuc–nuc, with a higher number in the cyto–cyto analysis compared to the nuc–nuc (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Comparing the lists of DEGs between the two analyses revealed that although there was an overlap between the DEGs identified from the two analyses, a large fraction of the DEGs was unique to cyto–cyto analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). GO analysis for the unique list of DEGs obtained from the cyto–cyto comparison revealed enrichment of transcripts related to translational processes, various metabolic and biosynthetic processes and gene expression and RNA processing. Meanwhile, the unique DEGs from the nuc–nuc analysis were mainly enriched for transcripts that belong to mitochondrial translation, which as we mentioned was a result of the mitochondria being separated with the nuclear fraction in the extraction protocol (Supplementary Table 9–12). Dividing the lists of DEGs from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B into protein-coding and lncRNA revealed that even though the nuc–nuc analysis resulted in a smaller number of protein-coding genes, it harbored a larger number of differentially expressed lncRNAs as compared to the cyto–cyto analysis, which was not surprising given that most lncRNAs were localized to the nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Collectively, these results indicate that although the cytosol and the nuclear fractions contain largely overlapping lists of DEGs, each fraction also contains unique groups of DEGs. To our surprise, when we investigated the expression fold change of all DEGs obtained from cyto–cyto, and the nuc–nuc analysis, a group of 61 genes showed opposite differential expression patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). For example, 
 <italic>ETV2,</italic> which encodes a transcription factor and is overexpressed and critically required during development, was up-regulated in the fetal sample when using cyto–cyto analysis and up-regulated in the adult sample when using the nuc–nuc analysis. Other genes that showed opposite differential expression patterns are highlighted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D and listed in Supplementary Table 13 and Supplementary Table 14. These results imply that gene expression analysis using either of these fractions could lead to different conclusions on differential expression between samples. Therefore, we suggest that neither the cytosolic nor the nuclear transcriptomes alone represent an accurate proxy for a complete view of gene expression levels in a cell. In addition, using either the cytosol or the nucleus may lead to conflicting data.

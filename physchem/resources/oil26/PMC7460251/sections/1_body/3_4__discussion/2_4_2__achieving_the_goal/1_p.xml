<p>To be a success, goal-based enrichment should promote a “goal” that may have an impact beyond just using the enrichment item [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, an enrichment item that promotes a foraging goal should, in theory, result in more total foraging (enrichment-directed and other foraging behavior) on days that enrichment is given versus days it is not. Overall, both stated enrichment goals were achieved by the enrichment provided to accomplish that goal. Days when foraging enrichment was given had a higher percentage of the time spent in foraging behaviors, and days when exploring enrichment was given had a higher percentage of the time spent on investigating non-food items, as well as locomotion (taken together to describe exploration). However, some specific enrichment items did achieve their stated goals better than others. Although all foraging enrichment promoted more total foraging than exploring enrichment, paper towel treat tubes appeared to be the best at achieving this goal. Compared to other enrichment items, warthog scented towels promoted more time spent investigating non-food items, and pools promoted more time spent locomoting.

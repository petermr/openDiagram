  <title>Anticipated inter- and intra-chain interactions supported by through-space two-dimensional NMR measurements and ATR FT-IR analysis.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Inter- and intrachain interactions due to side groups and copolymer backbone in p(MMA/nBA); inter-/intra-CH
   <sub>3b</sub>–CH
   <sub>2b</sub> are represented by a′ and a″ resonances at 1.62 and 0.96 ppm, respectively; inter-/intra-CH
   <sub>3m</sub>–CH
   <sub>b</sub> are represented by b′ and b″ resonances at 2.11 and 1.28 ppm (intensity changes of a′, a″, b′, and b″ resonances in NMR experiments are listed in Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). 2D NOESY 
   <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of p(MMA/nBA: 
   <bold>b</bold> undamaged, 
   <bold>c</bold> air-cut/air-healed (0 min); 
   <bold>d</bold> air-cut/air-healed (120 min); 
   <bold>e</bold> air-cut/water-healed (120 min); 
   <bold>f</bold> NOESY cross-peak intensities of CH
   <sub>3m</sub>–CH
   <sub>b</sub> (a′, a″) (curve a) CH
   <sub>3b</sub>–CH
   <sub>2b</sub> (b′, b″) (curve b), and undamaged (curve c) resonances as a function of time for air-cut/water-healed specimens. All resonances were normalized to α-methyl-CH
   <sub>3</sub> and the -OCH
   <sub>3</sub> proton cross-peaks at 3.61, 0.87 ppm (not shown) due to MMA units. 
   <bold>g</bold> ATR-FTIR spectra of damaged p(MMA/nBA) copolymer exposed to water for 0 (a), 30 (b), 60 (c), 90 (d), 120 (e), and 150 (f) min.

0: The antimicrobial activities of the SoEO were assessed  in vitro by well diffusion method (Guven et al., 2006[ 17]), with some modifications.
1: The SoEO was dissolved in ethanol/water (v/v) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and then filtered through a sterile Millipore membrane filter (diameter 0.45 m) and used for activity assay.
2: 100 L of indicator strain (approximately 10 6 CFU/mL) were displayed on plate filled with LB or PDA.
3: Wells (06 mm diameter) were drilled in the agar plates with a sterile Pasteur pipette and then 50 L of SoEO were added to the wells.
4: The plates were incubated at the optimal temperature of the indicator organism and inhibition zone diameters were measured after appropriate time as described above.
5: Gentamicin (10 g/wells) was used as a positive control in antibacterial tests, while amphotericin B (20 g/wells) was used as a positive control in antifungal activity.
6: Negative control consisted of 50 % ethanol which is used to dissolve the SoEO.
7: The experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice.

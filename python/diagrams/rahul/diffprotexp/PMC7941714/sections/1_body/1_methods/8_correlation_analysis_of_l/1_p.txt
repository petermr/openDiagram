0: We performed Pearson correlation analysis and selected the positive correlations between the lncRNAs and mRNAs in ceRNA network.
1: Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.4 and  P < 0.001 were used as inclusion criteria.
2: Based on the above co-expression relationships, we constructed a ceRNA subnetwork to investigate the potential mechanisms.

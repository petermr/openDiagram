<p id="Par37">In summary, the pineal gland transcriptomic study reveals differential regulation of lncRNAs and mRNAs related to prolificacy in sheep with different 
 <italic>FecB</italic> genotyping. We screened several sets of target genes of DE lncRNAs and DE genes under reproductive cycle and genotypes, they were annotated to multiple biological processes such as phototransduction, circadian rhythm, melanogenesis, GSH metabolism and steroid biosynthesis, which directly or indirectly participate in hormone activities to affect sheep reproductive performance. Additionally, we predicted potential role of these DE lncRNAs and constructed network of lncRNAs-mRNAs to expand our understanding. All of these differential lncRNAs and mRNAs expression profiles provide a novel resource for elucidating regulatory mechanism underlying STH sheep prolificacy.

<p>A CTWD of 44 mm led to mean hardness values of 271 HV1 in the 1st layer, which was approximately 30 HV1 higher than the mean hardness value at 12 mm CTWD in the same position. According to the CCT-diagram of the unalloyed steel, martensitic phase exceeds hardness values of 257 HV1 [

 <sub>8/5</sub>-times between 12 and 44 mm CTWD, this can be explained by reduced heat input and less dilution between filler material and substrate. As a result, a fine grained microstructure (CTWD = 44 mm) led to increased hardness. Moreover, the slightly different chemical composition of the filler wire to the used CCT-diagram must be considered. Increasing percentage of silicon and manganese of approximately 0.3% might affect martensite start temperature as well as phase fraction.

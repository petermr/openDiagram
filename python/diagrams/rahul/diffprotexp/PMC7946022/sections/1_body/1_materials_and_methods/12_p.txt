0: Effect of biofilm DNAse treatment on   S. aureus vancomycin susceptibility in single and mixed biofilms with   C. albicans.
1: 24 hr-preformed single and mixed-species biofilms were grown as described above and, after removal of non-sessile cells, DNAse I (0.625 mg/ml), vancomycin (800 g/ml) or a combination of both were added to appropriate wells with biofilms.
2: Following 24 hrs of incubation at 37C, wells were sonicated, and cell suspensions were diluted and plated on species-specific chromogenic media for CFU enumeration.
3: Control wells with no treatment were included; DNAse I optimal activity concentration was pre-determined in a doseresponse assay (data not shown) and the vancomycin concentration used was based on our previously published work on mixed biofilm assays [ 29].

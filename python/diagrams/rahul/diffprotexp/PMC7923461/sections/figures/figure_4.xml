  <p>The relationship between the expression of TUBA1C and TIICs. 
   <bold>a</bold> The results of the relative ratios of TIIC that were obtained using the CIBERSORT algorithm. The ratio of 28 immune cells in LUAD tissues in the TUBA1C high and low expression groups (*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001). 
   <bold>b</bold> Negative correlation exists between the TUBA1C expression level and infiltrating levels of B cell (r =  − 0.331, P = 8.22e−14) and CD4+ T cells (r =  − 0.2, P = 9.64e−06) in LUAD. 
   <bold>c</bold> Cumulative survival is related to B cell and the expression of TUBA1C in LUAD. (The B cell and the expression of TUBA1C are factors related to the cumulative survival rate of LUAD over time)

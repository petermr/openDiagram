<p>The use of experimental designs can improve the yields of essential oil. They also optimize the extraction of the major constituents of the essential oils by organizing the steam distillation with a minimum number of experiments to be performed (Silou, Malanda, &amp; Loubaki, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Silou et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Taking into account the scientific interest that seems to represent the isomers of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐menthadienol and aristolone, we have tried to optimize the extraction of these major constituents by using a 2
 <sup>n</sup> full factorial design. We have used a simple model of the first degree which gives the representation of the response function based on variables, which allows us to evaluate the influence of different factors studied on the contents of the aristolone and 
 <italic>p</italic>‐menthadienol isomers.

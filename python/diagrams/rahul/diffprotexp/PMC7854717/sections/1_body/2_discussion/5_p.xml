 </sup> where, besides the cardiomyocytes (the majority of cells), fibroblasts, nerve endings, immune system cells, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, stem cell niches and other supporting cells are also present. Though we did our best to dissect and profile as homogeneous as possible small regions from the muscular walls of each heart chamber, the cardiomyocyte RNA was inevitably mixed with unknown amounts of RNA from non-cardiomyocyte cells. Nevertheless, as we proved in previous publications, e.g.

 </sup> by profiling mouse cortical astrocytes and oligodendrocytes cultured alone and co-cultured in insert systems, the organization of each cell type transcriptome is significantly modeled by the heterogeneous cellular environment. Hence, gene expression analysis of mono-cellular cardiomyocyte cultures gives a different picture than that of the cardiomyocytes embedded in the myocardium, although it is hard to estimate how much different. Unfortunately, even single-cell RNA-sequencing

 </sup>. Hence, a good approach is to focus analysis on cardiomyocyte-specific genes. Therefore, we provided in Supplementary Table

0: Small RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq Small RNA Sample preparation protocol (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) at Genotypic Technology Pvt.
1: Ltd., Bangalore, India.
2: One microgram RNA was used as starting material for the assay.
3: Then 3 adapters were ligated to the specific 3OH group of micro RNAs followed by ligation of 5 adapter.
4: Adapter ligated fragments were reverse transcribed with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Cat# 18080044, Invitrogen, USA), enriched and indexed by 15 cycles of PCR amplification.
5: The libraries were quantified by Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and its fragment size distribution was analyzed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA).
6: The libraries were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina, SanDiego, USA) for 75 bp single read chemistry following manufacturers procedure.

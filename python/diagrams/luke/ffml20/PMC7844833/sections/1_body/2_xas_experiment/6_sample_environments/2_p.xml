<p>The critical component of 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS measurements is the development of sample environments: furnaces, cryostats, reaction cells, etc. that enable the controlled exposure of the sample to the desired reaction conditions. In catalysis and electrocatalysis in particular, the challenge is to achieve a satisfying compromise between ensuring that the reaction conditions are close to those used in industry and lab-based investigations of catalyst performance, while simultaneously providing an unobstructed path for the incident X-rays, as well as transmitted or fluoresced X-ray photons or secondary electrons.

<p>Based on the results presented above the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system is applied in the integrated process of leaching and separation of Co(II) from real waste NiMH battery black mass obtained from an industrial recycler (Recupyl, Grenoble, France). NiMH battery black mass is characterized by a high Ni(II) concentration, as well as lesser quantities of rare earth elements, Co(II), Mn(II) and Zn(II). Impurities such as Fe(III) are often also encountered [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. To minimize acidâ€“base neutralization from residual KOH battery electrolyte, the black mass was rinsed with deionized water until a stable pH was obtained prior to leaching studies. Two systems were evaluated for the leaching of Co(II) from the complex waste matrix: (i) an aqueous solution of 27.0 wt.% CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH, (ii) 73.0 wt.% [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + 27.0 wt.% CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH. Co(II) leaching in the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH mixture is comparable to that using an aqueous acetic acid solution but present a greater selectivity, with a lower Ni(II), Mn(II) and rare earth element concentration, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05570-f006">Figure 6</xref>A. However, an increase in Fe(III) and Zn(II) leaching is observed due to the higher chloride concentration resulting from the lower water content.

<p>As an R package developed for quantitative proteomics analysis, DEqMS also provides functions (such as median sweeping normalization) to aggregate peptide or PSM intensities to protein abundance and auxiliary functions to visualize fitting curves and raw peptide intensities in different samples. Further, it is a computationally fast method as the analysis of 10,000 proteins finishes in a second with a standard PC. Taken together, DEqMS is a robust, universal and highly competitive statistical method for differentially expressed protein analysis of both labeled and label-free proteomics data.</p>

<p>Similarly, we have characterized duplicate 
 <italic>LIF</italic> gene in elephants that lack the start codon of the parent LIF gene. This duplicate gene (
 <italic>LIF6</italic>) is also expressed, encodes a functional transcript with translation initiated at an alternative downstream start site, and contributes to enhanced DNA damage sensitivity in elephant cells.

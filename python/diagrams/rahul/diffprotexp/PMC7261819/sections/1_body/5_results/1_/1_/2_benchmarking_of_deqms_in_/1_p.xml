<p>To systematically benchmark our method, we used two spike-in data sets (data set D2 and D3) for evaluation of the performance of DEqMS compared with Limma, 
 <italic>t</italic> test, EBRC and ROTS. In addition, variance stabilization normalization (Limma(vsn)) (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and intensity-based moderated 
 <italic>t</italic> test (Limma(trend = T)) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) were also included in the comparison as previous studies have shown that variance is dependent on peptide intensity (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).

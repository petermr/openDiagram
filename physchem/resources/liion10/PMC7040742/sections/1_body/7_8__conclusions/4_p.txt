0: Apart from direct recycling and hydrometallurgical leaching, a new approach being developed is selective leaching, in which lithium is selectively extracted from the hosting material while retaining the internal structure of the cathode material.
1: Combined with most recent developments in mechanical separation, this approach may have a considerable success for the treatment of mixed cathodes or LFP batteries.

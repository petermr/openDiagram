<p>In the absence of shrimp cell lines, nucleosomes used to analyze nucleosome proteins’ interaction with PirB were purified from 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider 2 cells (a kind gift from Jianguo He of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China). First, nuclear fractions were extracted as described previously with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Cultured S2 cells were collected, centrifuged, and washed twice with cold 0.01 M PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM PMSF, pH 7.5), incubated on ice for 5 min followed by the addition of 5.0 µL of 20% Triton-X-100 and the shearing of cells by passing through a 21 G needle with a 1 ml syringe at least 10 times. Next, samples were incubated on ice for 5 min before being centrifuged at 3,000 g for 4 min at 4°C to collect the pellet as nuclear fraction. After purifying the nuclear proteins, samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and then incubated at 37°C with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase, NEB, Beijing, China) for 90 min. The supernatant was collected for gel ﬁltration chromatography (Supersose™ 6 increase 10/300 GL, GE healthcare, CT, USA) on an AKTA pure 25 system (GE healthcare, CT, USA). Finally, all separated components were collected and analyzed using SDS-PAGE or Native-PAGE and Western blot, as described in subsection 2.2, with mouse anti-histone H3 antibody (1:1000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China). The obtained nucleosome proteins were used for subsequent experiments.

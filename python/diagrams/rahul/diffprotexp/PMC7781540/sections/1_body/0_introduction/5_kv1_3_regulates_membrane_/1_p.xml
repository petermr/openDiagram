<p>Despite the above described well documented ameliorative effects of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers on neuroinflammation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and on microglial signaling cascades and inflammatory mediator expression and secretion 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers affect microglial functions was long unclear. Many investigators, our own laboratory included, simply assumed that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 was serving the same function in microglia that it was fulfilling in T cells, namely regulating membrane potential and calcium influx [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In T cells, K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition leads to membrane depolarization and reduces calcium influx through calcium release-activated calcium channels (CRAC) following T cell receptor stimulation [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Calcium influx via CRAC channels is critically required for dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent transcription factor NFAT [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which triggers transcription of the cytokine IL-2 [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. IL-2 is released from activated T cells upon synthesis and stimulates T cell clonal expansion in an autocrine and a paracrine manner. By inhibiting the counterbalancing potassium efflux that is necessary to sustain calcium influx through CRAC channels K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers disrupt T cells activation, prevent NFAT dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] leading to reduced T cell proliferation and reduced inflammatory cytokine production and secretion at 48 hours [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, it had never been tested in microglia, which unlike T cells also express the inward rectifier K
 <sub>ir</sub>2.1 [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the two-pore potassium channel THIK-1 (K
 <sub>2P</sub>13.1) [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], whether K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers would have the same molecular effects or if the role of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 was taken over by these other potassium channels. In a recent study our group accordingly addressed this question by first reexamining the fundamental significance of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 in maintaining resting membrane potential and resisting depolarization [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As expected, overexpression of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 in CHO cells lowered the typically very depolarized resting membrane potential of these cells from −20 mV to −50 mV, while K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition with ShK-223 depolarized microglia, which inherently maintain a more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, which in our hands averaged around −90 mV in undifferentiated microglia predominantly expressing K
 <sub>ir</sub>2.1 and around −65 mV in LPS stimulated microglia expressing higher K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 and lower K
 <sub>ir</sub>2.1 current densities [

<p>Further, the effects of DEHP on ovarian somatic cells were investigated. For immune cells, eight clusters were produced, and DEHP-treated cells at PD3 seemed to be more distinct from others (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>A). Gene differential expression revealed that DEHP up- and down-regulated 10 genes respectively at PD0, and 26 genes were reduced but 88 genes were increased at PD3 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>B). GO terms of DEGs at PD0 enriched the biological processes of “multi-organism”, “immune system” and “localization”, while the top terms at PD3 were “immune system process”, “cell proliferation”, and “response to stimulus”. In terms of stromal cells, six clusters were generated, and the expression pattern of cells in the PD3-DEHP group was largely different from others (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>D). Particularly, DEHP hardly affected stromal cells at PD0, with only one DEG (
 <italic>Birc5</italic>) being detected; at PD3, there were 12 down- and 75 up-regulated genes as a result of DEHP exposure (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>E). Functional enrichment of DEGs at PD3 suggested the greatest enrichment of “cell proliferation”, “reproductive process”, and “cellular component organization or biogenesis” (

<p>SLEV strain BeH 355964 was provided by Prof. Maur√≠cio L. Nogueira. BeH 355964 stocks were generated by passage in C6/36 mosquito cell monolayers, cultivated in Leibovitz-15 supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cultilab, Brazil) and antibiotics. Clarified supernatants containing virus were titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells and viral titers were expressed in plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL of supernatant. SLEV BeH 355964 complete genome sequence is available at GenBank under accession number KM267635 [

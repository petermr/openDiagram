<p>In the past few years, transition metal- and nitrogen-doped carbon (TMNC) catalysts have attracted significant attention as promising catalysts for CO
 <sub>2</sub> conversion to CO. These catalysts, typically synthesized via pyrolysis of metal, nitrogen, and carbon precursors, are currently considered promising alternatives to the more expensive Au and Ag catalysts for CO production.

 </sup> In TMNC catalysts, the nitrogen atom is incorporated into the carbon and forms a binding site for metal species. These singly dispersed metal sites are commonly considered to be the active species for CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR.

 </sup> However, the large number of different structural motifs that can coexist in TMNC materials (e.g., pyrollic and pyridinic nitrogen environments, coexistence of singly dispersed metal species with metal clusters, metal carbides, oxides and nitrides) complicates severely both the unambiguous identification of the main catalytic species and their structural characterization using sample-averaging spectroscopic methods.

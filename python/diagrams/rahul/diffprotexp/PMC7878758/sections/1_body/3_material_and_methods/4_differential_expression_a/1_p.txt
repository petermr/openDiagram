0: The transcripts were further analysed for their expression level using FPKM (Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads)and analysed for differential expression level on 1, 2 and 5-dpa time points against 0-dpa as control 35.
1: Differentially expressed transcripts having at least 1.0 log fold change in any one of their regenerating time points were considered for the study.
2: All the differentially expressed genes were analyzed using GENE ONTROLOGY online tool ( www.geneontology.org) 49,  50.
3: The gene list weremapped against  Anolis carolinesis database for biological process.
4: Significant genes having a p value of < 0.05 were selected for all the time points.

<p>Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the cathode electrode SSY@LFP from the corresponding SEM image (

 </xref>) revealed the existence and distribution of various elements. In detail, Fe, P, and O elements from LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> and the C element from CNTs are well observed. In addition, the even distribution of Fe, P, and O elements strongly indicates that the cathode material is uniformly coated onto the surface of the flexible SSY without severe agglomeration. The uniform distribution of C elements further evidences that the uniform three-dimensional network of CNTs is formed (

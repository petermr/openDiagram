Moreover, we performed a series of analyses to determine the expression of TUBA1C in different types of cancer and to comprehend its correlation with the abundance of TIICs. These TIICs were further classified as follows: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. By using the TIMER algorithm, we performed a correlation analysis between TUBA1C, its related genes, and the markers of immune cells [

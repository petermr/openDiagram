<p>BVDV has caused huge economic losses to the livestock industry. Although great progress has been made in the research of BVDV in recent decades and several signaling pathways closely related to BVDV infection have been reported [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref>], the infection and pathogenesis of BVDV are so extremely complex that the relevant mechanisms have yet to be comprehensively characterized. In recent years, lncRNAs have been found to play an important role in regulating viral infection and host immune responses involved in host–virus interaction. However, the profiles and functional activities of lncRNAs in host cells in response to BVDV infection have not been elucidated. In this study, we determined the changes in the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells. As a result, differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, providing a new perspective on gene regulation in the host–BVDV interactions. Moreover, the expression changes of randomly selected DE lncRNAs and DE mRNAs were confirmed by qPCR assay, indicating the reliability of the Illumina sequencing results.

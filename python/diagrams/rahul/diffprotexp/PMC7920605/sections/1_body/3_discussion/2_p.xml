<p>The m6A and RNA sequence approaches were utilized to construct the m6A methylation library and RNA library to investigate differentially m6A methylation and gene expression in MH7A cells. Our results showed that there were 206 differentially expressed m6A methylation genes and 1207 differentially mRNAs in MH7A cells after stimulation with TNF-ฮฑ. By analyzing the transcriptional region with the m6A peaks, the differentially expressed m6A methylated genes were mainly concentrated in the 3สน-UTR, which was quite consistent with the previous findings of Dominissini et al.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> On the other hand, according to the joint analysis of genes with differentially expressed m6A methylation and mRNA, there were significant differences between the m6A methylation and mRNA expression levels of 88 genes. We suspected that these potential genes, through m6A methylation, are involved in the occurrence and development of RA.

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A presents the galvanostatic cycling stability of aqueous Zn-ion batteries working with several different MnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based cathodes. Here, the capacity was calculated based on the mass of the initial weight of solid MnO
 <sub>2</sub> on the cathode. For fair comparison, parameters including (1) the mass loading of cathode (area: 0.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, areal loading of MnO
 <sub>2</sub>: ∼2.0 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), (2) the concentration of MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> additive (0.2 M), and (3) the volume of electrolyte (200 μL for each battery) were well-controlled for all batteries. The δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode synthesized via a molten-salt-assisted method (see 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Transparent Methods</xref>) showed an initial discharge capacity of 252 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and reached 317 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after a five-cycle activation process (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Unlike most of the previously reported works, it is interesting that the discharge capacity of the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode kept increasing during subsequent cycling at a current density of 300 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and reached a discharge capacity of 403 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 100 cycles. α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, another cathode material widely utilized in Zn-ion batteries, was also evaluated for its cycling stability. Although showing better discharge capacities in the first five cycles (first discharge: 325 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and fifth discharge: 339 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>), the α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode exhibited inferior capacity retention to that of the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode. It suggests that different cathodes delivered different electrochemical behaviors in Zn-ion batteries.

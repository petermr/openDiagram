 <caption> Orientation time correlation function C 1(t) obtained from ab initio MD simulations of pure liquid water. The early stage of fast loss of correlation is caused by librational motion. The long‐term decay is due to reorientational motion and is fitted by a bi‐exponential function a⋅exp(‐t/τ 1)+b⋅exp(‐t/τ 2). </caption>

0: Prior to hemolymph collection, the snail shell was cleaned with 70% ethyl alcohol and snails were then soaked for 20 min in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 100 g/ml of streptomycin and 200 units/ml of penicillin to eliminate potential microorganism contamination.
1: Hemolymph samples were collected by stimulation of the head-foot region of the snail as described previously [ 12].
2: Briefly, the head-foot was punctured with a needle resulting in the retraction of the head-foot into the shell and subsequent leakage of hemolymph.
3: The hemolymph was collected using a micropipette and transferred to a new tube on ice to avoid hemocyte aggregation.
4: The hemolymph samples from 100 snails of each replicate and time point were pooled, centrifuged at 3,500  g for 10 min at 4C to pellet hemocytes, and the resulting plasma (supernatant) was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and supplemented with EDTA-Free SigmaFAST Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Sigma) as per manufacturers instructions.
5: Pellet containing the hemocytes was washed twice with cold PBS, centrifuged at 3,500  g for 3 min at 4C.
6: Plasma and hemocytes were kept at -80C until processed.
7: Whole soft bodies of all snails were subsequently examined for infection by PCR [ 46].

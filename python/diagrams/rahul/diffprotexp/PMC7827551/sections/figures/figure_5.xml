  <p>Analysis of expression of the twelve genes in the exponential and in the stationary growth phases by qRT-PCR. Cultures were grown to an OD600 of 0.5 and 2.8, respectively, and the total RNA was extracted from each phase. (
   <bold>A</bold>) mRNA levels were normalized using the geometric mean of the housekeeping genes, 
   <italic>sigA</italic> and 
   <italic>groL</italic>. Data are shown as the means of triplicate experiments with three biological replicates. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Heatmap for the differential expression of the 12 genes between the exponential and the stationary phase of the growth of the MAH 104. Gene numbers correspond to those listed in

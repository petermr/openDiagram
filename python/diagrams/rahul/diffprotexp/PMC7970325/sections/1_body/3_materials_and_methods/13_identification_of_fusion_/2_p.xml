<p id="p0365">Fusion transcripts were initially screened using STAR-Fusion software. Preliminary files containing fusion candidates for genes 
 <italic>ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, BCR, ABL1</italic> were generated and the corresponding RNA sequencing reads were extracted. The output data were manually inspected using UCSC BLAT and UCSC Browser (

The inputs with three positive flags were considered as those supporting fusion transcripts.

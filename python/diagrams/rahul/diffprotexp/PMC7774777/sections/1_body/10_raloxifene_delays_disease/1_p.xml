<p>Based on the effect of raloxifene on the proteasomeâ€“ubiquitin pathway at multiple levels and the fact the proteasome dysfunction is a pathogenic hallmark of ALS, we initiated a pilot trial with raloxifene in SOD1-G93A mice. Since subcutaneous injections twice daily over months would cause unacceptable distress to the animals, for long-term treatment we used slow release pellets. Male and female SOD1-G93A mice were treated chronically with subcutaneous slow-release raloxifene pellets, which were implanted at 50 days of age, prior to the onset of disease symptoms. We used 10-mg pellets in females and 15-mg pellets in males to account for the larger body weight of males. Mice were randomized in 2 cohorts, placebo treated and raloxifene treated. Grip strength and body weight were measured weekly and the grip/body weight ratio determined. We found that females treated with raloxifene maintained a significantly higher grip/body weight ratio for 4 consecutive weeks during disease progression compared with placebo-treated animals (

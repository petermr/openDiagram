T: tumor (PC), N: normal prostate tissues, and TPM: transcripts per million. Statistical analyses were performed by GEPIA2, * p &lt; 0.05. ( B) Analyses were performed using the Sawyers dataset in R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform. Expressions were presented as log2-transformed data. Statistical analyses were performed by the R2 Platform using one-way ANOVA. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>

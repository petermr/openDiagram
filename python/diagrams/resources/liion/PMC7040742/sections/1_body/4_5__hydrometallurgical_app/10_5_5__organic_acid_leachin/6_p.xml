<p>Oxalic acid was also efficient for lixiviation of calcined LFP, as demonstrated by Li et al. in 2018 [
 <xref rid="B207-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. During this process, illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00801-f016">Figure 16</xref>, the calcined LFP was exposed to 0.3 M oxalic acid at 80 Â°C. While lithium and phosphate are solubilized, the iron precipitated as iron oxalate and iron oxide. The iron-rich residue was recovered through filtration and Li was separated from the phosphate solution using an ionic sieve.

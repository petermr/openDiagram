0: Reproduction, one of the major factors significantly affecting profitability of sheep production, is a complicated physiological process and determined by the integrated hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in breeding season [ 1].
1: Reproductive traits like litter size directly determine benefit of sheep production, are controlled by poly-gene at the micro level.
2: How to undertake at molecular level to improve reproduction, thereby serving macro production is a hotspot in recent years.
3: BMPRIB,  BMP15 [ 2] and  GDF9 [ 3] are major fecundity genes which significantly influence sheep prolificacy.
4: FecB is a mutation in  BMPRIB occurring in base 746 from A to G, one copy of this mutation significantly increases ovulation rate in sheep about 1.5 and two copies by 3.0 [ 4].
5: To date, this mutation has been detected in diverse sheep species such as Booroola Merino sheep (Australia) [ 5], Small Tail Han (STH) and Hu sheep (China) [ 6].
6: Wherein STH sheep is a famous native breed with year-round estrus and high fecundity, being officially recognized as one of the polytocous breeds in China.
7: The average litter size and lambing rate of STH sheep are 2.61, 286.5%, respectively [ 7].
8: There are three genotypes based on effects of  FecB mutation in STH sheep, namely  FecBBB (with two-copy  FecB mutation),  FecBB+  (with one-copy  FecB mutation) and  FecB++ (with no  FecB mutation), which is closely correlated with litter size of ewes [ 8].
9: Therefore, this breed can be used as a classic model for study molecular mechanism of  FecB gene regulation of reproductive traits in sheep.

<p id="Par37">We performed MethylC-seq using the HYPO and TnA from the same males used for RNA-seq (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3/treatment). We first looked for large-scale differences in methylation levels between prenatal treatments. This was performed for both CpG (mCG) and non-CpG methylation (mCH, where H = A, C, or T), which is present in the neuronal genomes of birds [

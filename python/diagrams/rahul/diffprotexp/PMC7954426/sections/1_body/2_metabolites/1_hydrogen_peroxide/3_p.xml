<p>Hydrogen peroxide production was identified in all types of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> and the wild strains of 
 <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>, although the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-producing ability was different among these isolates [
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> serial passage of a high H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-producing strain (119B96) of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> led to reduced H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> levels, but did not affect substrate oxidation compared with that of the parent strain. After the 50Â 
 <sup>th</sup> passage, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was reduced to approximately 50%, which may be linked to the loss of a 32-kDa protein, as indicated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. Comparative genomics demonstrated that certain genes with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and indels in 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic>, but outside the 14.2-kb deleted region, might be associated with the altered H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> production [
 <xref rid="cit0195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Zhu et al. indicated that eDNA is required for 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> generation [
 <xref rid="cit0194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>].

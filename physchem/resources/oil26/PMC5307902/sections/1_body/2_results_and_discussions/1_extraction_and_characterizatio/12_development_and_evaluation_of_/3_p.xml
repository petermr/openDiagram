To produce stable emulsions, surfactants are added to the system.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The selection of the surfactant used is fundamental in the production of formulations with a good stability. The first step in the selection of the correct surfactants for the emulsion system is the identification of the HLB value of the oil fraction. The concept of the hydrophile-lipophile balance [HLB] was first described by Griffin[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and is used as a semi-empirical scale for selecting surfactants to form stable emulsions. A well established methodology to identify the HLB of essential oils is the study of long-term stability of a bath of emulsions produced with the essential oil, and ranging the HLB value of the surfactants.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The HLB value of the more stable emulsion is considered the HLB of the essential oil.</p>

Milling of sample S2 caused a broadening of the diffraction lines and the increase of background due to the decrease of crystallite size and the increase of lattice defects. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of S3 contains, beside strong and narrow diffraction lines typical of silicon, diffraction lines of lower intensity typical of silver (Ag, space group

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00891-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The obtained results indicate that this sample is predominantly silicon (~99.5%). The amount of the second crystalline phase, silver, was estimated at ~0.5%. The weighted residual error index (R
 <sub>wp</sub>) of the refined pattern was less than 9%.

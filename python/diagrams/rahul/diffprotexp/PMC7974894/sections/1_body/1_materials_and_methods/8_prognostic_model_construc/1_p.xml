 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. A log-rank test was executed to screen the significant candidate prhRBPs further. Subsequently, based on the above preliminary screened significant candidate RBPs, we constructed a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model and calculated a risk score to assess patient prognosis outcomes. The risk score formula for each sample was as follows:

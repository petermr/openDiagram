<sup>3</sup>&#160;Pa. The oven temperature was held at 40&#160;&#176;C for 2&#160;min, and then programmed to 250&#160;&#176;C at a rate of 8&#160;&#176;C/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1&#160;ml/min. The mass spectra (MS) were operated in electron impact mode (70&#160;eV) with the electron multiplier set at 1823.5&#160;V, and the MS data were acquired in scan mode. The peaks were quantified by calculating the percentage of the peak area of each component by comparison to the sum of the peaks of other compounds. The identification of the components was performed on the basis of chromatographic comparison of the recorded retention time with computed mass-spectrum data libraries (Pal600K and Wiley275).

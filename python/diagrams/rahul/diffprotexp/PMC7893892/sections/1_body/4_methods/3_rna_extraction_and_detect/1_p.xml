<p id="Par41">Total RNA was extracted from 12 samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instruction. 1% agarose gel was used to monitor whether isolated RNA was degraded or contaminated. Quality, integrity and concentration of RNA were assessed by NanoPhotometer® spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA), RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) and Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in Qubit® 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA), respectively. Among them, the ratio of intact RNA with RIN ≥ 7, 28S: 18S ≥ 1.5:1.</p>

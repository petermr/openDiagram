<p>Overall we found that the sedimentation speed following autoaggregation of bacteria expressing different AAF variants was apparently anti-correlated with the capacity to form biofilms on PVC (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004 f0005 f0006">Figures 4 and 6</xref>). This might appear paradox at first sight, but if, e.g., the affinities of the fimbriae toward each other are higher than the affinity toward the surface, the bacterial aggregates might simply form too fast and sediment before an effective attachment to the surface can occur.

<p>In this experiment, an iTRAQ proteomic approach was used to investigate the differential proteinic expression in natural Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice at the proteome and metabolome levels. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways were used to analyze the differential protein profiles and signalling pathways related to rice biology. The functional annotation and characterization of these proteins will provide the basic information and be helpful to scrutinize Se responsive mechanisms. The signal pathways identified by the bioinformatic analysis and their verification will provide a basis for further research on the anti-oxidation and anti-ageing mechanisms of Se-enriched rice.</p>

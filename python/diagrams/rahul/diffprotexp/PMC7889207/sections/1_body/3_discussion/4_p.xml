<p>Epigenetic modifications represent a mechanism through which genetic and environmental exposures impact on the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic diseases [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Indeed, DNA methylation alterations have been identified in both human and rodent obesity [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and there is accumulating evidence to show that exposure to high calorie diets, which promote expression and enzymatic activities of DNA methyltransferases, impacts on global and gene-specific DNA methylation [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Using an ELISA-based method, we showed that CD induced global hypomethylation in both SAT and VAT. These findings are in line with studies reporting reduced DNA methylation in inguinal (SAT) and epididymal (VAT) adipose tissues from both genetic and dietary obesity mouse models [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, in severely obese humans, Turcot et al. [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported that lower global DNA methylation, as assessed by LINE-1 repetitive elements methylation analysis, in VAT is significantly associated with a greater risk for metabolic syndrome. These studies, together with ours, highlight the potential use of epigenetic changes for therapeutic targets for prevention and early treatment of obesity.

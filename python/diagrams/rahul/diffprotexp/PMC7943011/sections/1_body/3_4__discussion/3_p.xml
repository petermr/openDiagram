<p>A more detailed pathway analysis (GO and KEGG) of differentially expressed proteins discriminated between the effects caused by either metformin or insulin. The generated data from the DAVID database revealed that both metformin treatment and hyperinsulinemia targeted similar pathways (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, the regulated proteins varied among the treatment groups compared to untreated controls. Metformin and hyperinsulinemia changed the expression of extracellular proteins (e.g. metformin: CTSL, EGFR, IL5, KLK3; insulin: IL4, IL15, PGC, SORL1). Molecular functions of differentially regulated proteins were mainly related to binding, growth factor and immune-related cytokine activities (e.g. metformin: EGFR, IL1B, IL5, IL17A; insulin: EGFR, IL4, IL5, VEGFA). Affected biological processes included proliferation, adhesion, migration, angiogenesis and immune responses (e.g. metformin: CD3E, IL5, IL17A, TFRC; insulin: CEACAM8, CTGF, EGFR, IL4, IRS2). KEGG analysis identified adhesion, hematopoiesis and cancer-related proteoglycans as affected pathways (e.g. metformin: CD9, CTSL, IL5, HGF; insulin: EGF, EZR, PLCG2, TFRC). Furthermore, changes of proteins involved in PI3K/AKT signaling were detected (e.g. metformin: AKT3, CCND2, EGFR, FGF2; insulin: COL1A1, IL4, EGFR, VEGFA), a pathway that is a well-known target of metformin [

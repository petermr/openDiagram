<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The yield of hull essential oil of <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L. variety Bronte (HEO) was 0.25% (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>w</italic> fresh material), well above others reported in literature (&gt;3.50 times) [<xref rid="B20-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], demonstrating how the Bronte variety possesses a much higher content of essential oil, probably due to characteristic pedoclimatic conditions of growth and probably to the extraction carried out immediately after harvest, which allowed for an increase in the extraction efficiency. This practice also led to a reduced formation of peroxidation, isomerization, or rearrangement of products due to temperature, light, and oxygen availability [<xref rid="B29-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

0: In this regression problem, the MSE is majorly selected for the quantification of the model performance on the given data set.
1: The coefficient of determination can be used to quantify the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.
2: In this study, to further assist the model selection in this multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) regression problem, the Pearson correlation coefficient 57 is used to indicate the accuracy of the predicted results.

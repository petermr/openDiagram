<p>Altogether, our analyses indicate that MIA drives acute and lasting transcriptional changes that impact specific cell populations during forebrain development, disrupting normal developmental timing and causing increased numbers of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and altered molecular properties of GABAergic interneurons. The timing of MIA during gestation is known to cause a range of phenotypes in offspring, and thus the findings here regarding mid-gestational MIA at E12.5 may not generalize to other models with different timing of MIA induction, especially for later gestational MIA after neurogenesis is largely complete. Further, the strong embryonic signatures we observe were generally consistent across sexes, raising the question of whether secondary insults or sex-specific protective effects contribute to some reports of sex differences in pathology following MIA (

Nonetheless, the overlapping results between our study and published single time-point studies of the acute MIA fetal brain transcriptional response suggest some consistency across bacterial and viral mimics, and rat and mouse models. Our study substantially expands previous work, revealing new molecular pathways and providing a temporal map of MIA-induced changes across fetal neurodevelopment that will be relevant to understanding the pathology of, and informing future treatments for, NDDs.

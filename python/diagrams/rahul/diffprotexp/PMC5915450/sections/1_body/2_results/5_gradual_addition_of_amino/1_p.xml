<p id="Par20">The results presented thus far are from simulations in which the entire nascent peptide is present at all times during the simulation, which does not reflect what happens during protein synthesis. It is therefore possible that our results are affected by interactions between residues that would not normally be present at a given point during synthesis, and the rest of the system. To address this issue we more accurately modeled the synthesis process by only turning on non-bonded interactions of nascent peptide residues as they pass 4 Å’s into the exit tunnel, which is the approximate distance between successive amino acids.</p>

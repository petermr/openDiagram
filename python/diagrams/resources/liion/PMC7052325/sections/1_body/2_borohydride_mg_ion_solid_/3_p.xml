<p>Le Ruyet and Janot followed the work on Mg(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)(NH
 <sub>2</sub>) in 2019, and studied the influences of the synthesis parameters on the ionic conductivity (Le Ruyet et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). They carefully investigated the synthesis parameters and the ionic conductivity could reach as high as 3 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 100°C, which was three orders of magnitude higher than that reported by Higashi. The improvement in conductivity was attributed to the creation of a glass-ceramic-like composite due to the presence of an amorphous additional phase.

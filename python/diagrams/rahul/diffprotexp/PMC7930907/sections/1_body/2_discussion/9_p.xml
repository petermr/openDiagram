<p>In the multi-omics analysis of SASCs and PASCs, three hub genes, 
 <italic>Rrm1</italic>, 
 <italic>Rrm2</italic>, and 
 <italic>Gla</italic>, were mainly involved. In 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reported that obese and overweight patients had an increased risk of colon cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, renal cancer, and esophageal cancer (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Basen-Engquist and Chang, 2011</xref>). In 2003, a cohort study by Calle (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Calle et al., 2003</xref>) involving 9,000,000 adults in the United States showed that obesity also increases the risk of other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myeloma. In early reports, 
 <italic>Rrm1</italic> and 
 <italic>Rrm2</italic> are regulatory subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, negative rate-limiting enzymes for DNA synthesis and repair, playing crucial roles in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, aging, and tumorigenesis (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>). 
 <italic>Rrm1</italic> and 
 <italic>Rrm2</italic> are widely found in 25 different human tissues, which is normal at low expression levels. However, 
 <italic>Rrm1</italic> and 
 <italic>Rrm2</italic> are overexpressed in various malignant tumors, acting as tumor drivers (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). At present, the mechanism by which obesity is associated with the risk of multiple malignant tumors is still unknown. We speculate that the increased risk of some malignant tumors may be associated with the overexpression of 
 <italic>Rrm1</italic> and 
 <italic>Rrm2</italic>, and the main signaling pathways involved may be related to the HIF-1 signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, and apoptosis.

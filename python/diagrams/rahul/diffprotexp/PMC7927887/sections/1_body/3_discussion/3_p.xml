<p>We detected significant disruption to the splicing and expression of 
 <italic>MZB1</italic>, resulting in differential expression at the transcript level as well as differential splicing and the introduction of novel transcripts due to novel splice sites. 
 <italic>MZB1</italic> in B cells is an endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein and plays a role in protein folding and antibody secretion.

 <italic>MZB1</italic> has been shown to have a prognostic value in many mature B-cell diseases such as CLL, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where higher expression is associated with poorer survival.

 </sup> Additional experiments will be needed to see if changes to 
 <italic>MZB1</italic> isoform ratios, as well as to the altered splicing of its transcripts, have similar prognostic value in MM.

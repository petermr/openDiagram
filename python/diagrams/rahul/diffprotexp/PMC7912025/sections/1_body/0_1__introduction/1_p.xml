<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for seasonal outbreaks of respiratory tract infections worldwide. This enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus of the human 
 <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> genus of the Pneuomoviridae family is the most common cause of pediatric hospitalization in children less than 5 years of age [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. After inoculation into the nasopharynx, RSV fuses with ciliated epithelial cells and replicates to high levels, spreading throughout the airways to the conductive and lower-airway cells involved in gas exchange. Here, productive infection in small-airway epithelial cells induces the rapid secretion of cytokines [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], exosomes [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and damage-associated patterns [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that mediate mucus production and leukocytic inflammation. The findings that the initial clinical manifestations of hypoxia are correlated with epithelial-derived cytokines [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] detected in the airway fluids of naturally infected children and experimentally challenged adults [

<p>A laboratory-melted medium manganese steel was studied in this work and its chemical composition is detailed in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-00958-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A relatively low carbon content of the investigated steel (0.16 wt.%) is beneficial due to the improvement in steel weldability [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The 4.7 wt.% of manganese was added to enhance the thermal stability of austenite upon cooling. A high aluminum content (1.6 wt.%) prevents the carbide precipitation during a bainite reaction, hence increasing the carbon content in the austenite [

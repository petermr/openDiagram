<p>Endometrial cancer (EC) is the 6
 <sup>th</sup> most common cancer in women and constitutes the leading malignancy of the female reproductive system in developed countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. EC can be subdivided into an estrogen-dependent type I, and a less common (15–25%) but more aggressive and invasive, estrogen-independent type II [

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The incidence of EC has increased over the past years and mainly affects postmenopausal women while it is uncommon to be diagnosed under the age of 45 years [

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Obesity and obesity-associated diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) lead to elevated levels of circulating estrogens that, in turn, increase proliferation of endometrial cells and promote EC development, especially in the absence of progesterone [

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Elevated blood glucose levels of diabetic patients may further contribute to the risk of EC development via an increased glycolytic-lipogenic metabolism and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway [

 <caption> After DU exposure, the expressions of ETHE1 and ACY-3 in MT−/− and MT+/+ mice and the effects of exogenous ETHE1 and ACY-3 on HEK293 cell survival rates. MT−/− and MT+/+ mice were administrated with a single dose of DU (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or equal volume of saline (control). After 4 days, ETHE1 and ACY-3 proteins in kidney were analysed by western blotting ( a). Quantitative analyses of western blots of ETHE1 ( b) and ACY-3 ( c). In addition, HEK293 cells were pretreated with or without ETHE1 (100 ng/ml) or ACY-3 (100 ng/ml) for 0.5 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. The cell viability was measured by a CCK-8 assay ( d), and Calcein-AM/PI staining ( e) was used for analysis of the living cell (yellow-green fluorescence) and dead cell levels (red fluorescence) as described in Materials and Methods. Results represent means ± SD of five separate experiments. The indicators were evaluated by a two-way ANOVA for two independent variables and by a one-way ANOVA for one variable. * p &lt; 0.05, LSD test for multiple comparisons. </caption>

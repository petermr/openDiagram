<p>Although they do not appear as a homogeneous response, we identified some other differentially expressed proteins in all of the studied conditions. Such is the case of the different peroxidases; they generally decrease, but there are some spots containing peroxidase isoforms that increase in intensity in

When blasting the peroxidase sequences found in the different spots, two differentiated groups were found; one of them with the highest homology to peroxidase 12 proteins from other species (spots 746 and 577) and another that could not be linked to a specific group of peroxidases (spots 601 and 703) (

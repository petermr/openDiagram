  <p>RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in normal and malignant tissues. RNA expression of 
   <italic>ACE2 (left)</italic>, 
   <italic>TMPRSS2 (middle)</italic>, and 
   <italic>CTSL (right)</italic> in 20 matched normal and malignant tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal (GTEx, n = 4,744 Samples)

   </sup> and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 9,026 Samples)

   </sup>; respectively. The mean expression in log
   <sub>2</sub> TPM (transcripts per million) was calculated for each tissue, then ranked based on each gene. Organ systems of interest are highlighted by colour: gastrointestinal tract (green), genitourinary tract (yellow), respiratory tract (red), and other organ systems (grey).

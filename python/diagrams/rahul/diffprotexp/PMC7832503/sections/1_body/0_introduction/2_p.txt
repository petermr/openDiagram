0: Thorough understanding of contributions to severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pathogenesis is essential to advance the treatments and design of new vaccines.
1: Earlier researches on the severity of influenza mainly focused on the viral virulence and properties [ 7].
2: It has been noticed that the host genetic variants may be related to the susceptibility of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection among different populations [ 811].
3: Nevertheless, the host genetic background responsible for the development of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 diseases have not been well defined.
4: About one-quarter to one-half of patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were previously healthy and did not have comorbid conditions, implicating that the inter-individual genetic variation may have accounted for the distinct disease severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [ 12, 13].

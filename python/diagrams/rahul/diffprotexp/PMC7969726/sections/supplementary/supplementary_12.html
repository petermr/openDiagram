 <caption> Motif analysis and interacting RBPs identified in 3′ UTRs regulated by CPSF1. (A) Lengthened and shortened sequences of 3′ UTR transcripts regulated by CPSF1 were analyzed using the MEME motif discovery tool, and the significance threshold was set at E-value &lt; 0.05. The motifs were submitted to the Tomtom motif comparison tool for RBP identification. The top three significant RBPs identified are shown. (B) Lengthened and shortened sequences of 3′ UTR transcripts regulated by CPSF1 were analyzed by TargetScan tool. The APA event number and microRNA target sites are indicated. </caption>

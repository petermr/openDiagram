0: Little is known about the protein expression in MAH 104 during exponential and stationary growth phases and how this change contributes to pathogenesis.
1: Here, we harness the proteomics technology to analyze the whole proteome of MAH 104 in these two growth phases.
2: This will aid in better understanding the MAH 104 infection course and will help in its treatment.
3: Particularly when the MAH 104 infection treatment period is long to very long, it is associated with mediocre to good outcomes.
4: Therefore, basic knowledge of the cell biology is needed to develop new treatment strategies.
5: Knowing the exact protein expression pattern might help to identify potential drugs targets.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The studies by Guerra-Rosas, Morales-Castro,[<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] showed that after the emulsification, the droplets migrate to the surface of the sample (coalescence) after a few hours of emulsification, forming a layer of cream. Consequently, there is a decrease of the CI over storage time in which the emulsion is preparing for phase separation.</p>

<p id="Par10">The differential splicing events were detected at the level of both exons and exon-exon junctions (EEJs). Differentially used exons (diffUEs) were identified by use of DEXSeq, limma/diffSplice and JunctionSeq, while differentially used exon-exon junctions (diffEEJs) were identified using limma/diffSplice and JunctionSeq functionality

 </sup>. This combined approach detected a comprehensive set of differential splicing events in dependence on the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 status.

<p id="Par23">Subsequently, we focused on the proteomics-inferred PPI networks in the three stressed groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5Aâ€“C</xref>). PPI networks of the three groups were constructed by the use of those differential proteins correlated to the significantly enriched KEGG pathways. Based on a unified conceptual framework, 23, 46, and 69 proteins as key nodes were identified from the three networks generated in the depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups, respectively. The included PPI networks revealed a similar correlation between the dysregulated proteins and the KEGG pathways, while offering a minor interactome pool associated with the three different behavioral phenotypes.

 <caption> Phenotype of transgenic tobacco plants. In the photos, there is shown the phenotype characteristics of the transgenic plants in two physiological ages. The first, at 6-weeks-old both plants ( A) L1 and ( B) L8 were practically identical. At this age, samples were taken for the WGBS. At 3-months-old, both plants still looked similar, but the plants ( C) L1 presented a light yellowing in the basal leaves compared with the ( D) L8 plant. </caption>

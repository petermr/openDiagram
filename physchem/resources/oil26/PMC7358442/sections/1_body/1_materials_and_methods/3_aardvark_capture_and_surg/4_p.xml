<p>We closely observed recovery of each aardvark during the weeks following surgery. Each study aardvark was recaptured annually, and a similar procedure to that used for implants was followed to replace, or remove, the loggers and tracking transmitter. The implant sites had healed and no signs of infection from the implantation surgery were visible at recapture.</p>

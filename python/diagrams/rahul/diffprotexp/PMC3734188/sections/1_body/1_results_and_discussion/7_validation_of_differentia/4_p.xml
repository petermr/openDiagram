<p>In addition, perfusion conditions cannot entirely mimic true 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> conditions and may cause stress or ischemia-related injuries, which might affect the relative abundance of certain proteins in the perfusate. Thus, some proteins identified as being differentially expressed in perfusates may result from perfusion, rather than disease-related perturbation. And such false-positive identifications should therefore be ruled out by further validation in plasma or serum.

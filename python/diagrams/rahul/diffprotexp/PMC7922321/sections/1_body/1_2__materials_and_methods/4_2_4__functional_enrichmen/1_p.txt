0: Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed by using R package clusterProfiler from Bioconductor to analyze the functional profile of gene clusters from differentially expressed genes (up- and downregulated genes of individual glioma grade) and transcription factor regulon clusters (positively and negatively regulated targets for each ETS regulon) [ 39].
1: The enriched GO term and KEGG pathways were determined by using a Benjamini & Hochberg corrected  p-value< 0.05 significance level and context manner term filtration.

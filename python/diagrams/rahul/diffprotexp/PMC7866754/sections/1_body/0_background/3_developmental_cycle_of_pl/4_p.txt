0: This problem is particularly relevant for  P. falciparum, whose genome annotation is relatively incomplete despite its clinical significance [ 19].
1: Even with the advancement of sequencing techniques and computational power, over 33% of predicted genes in the parasite genome remain functionally unannotated [ 20], which represent a great challenge for discovering vaccine candidates and therapeutic drugs.
2: Furthermore, untranslated region such as 5 and 3 UTRs are also absent in the annotation, which have been shown to regulate protein expression in  P. falciparum [ 21].
3: The lack of annotation despite community efforts can be attributed to several factors.
4: As an  Apicomplexan parasite, it is evolutionarily distant from other eukaryotic model organism where less than 25% of the protein sequences share significant similarity with those outside the phylum [ 22].
5: Even within the same phylum, many of the parasites have evolved pathways for cell invasion of their specific host and, therefore, only 1234% of the protein-coding genes are shared by all apicomplexans [ 23].
6: Therefore, there is a pressing need for improving the genome annotation of  P. falciparum.

  <title>Purpose</title>
  <p>LINC00466 is a newfound long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been rarely explored in cancers. However, the specific role and molecular mechanism of LINC00466 in glioma remain to be further elucidated.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Bioinformatic analysis was used to screen differentially expressed genes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression of LINC00466, microRNA-137 (miR-137) and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14B (PPP1R14B). Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA binding protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were employed to verify the binding relationship among LINC00466, miR-137 and PPP1R14B. The sensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide (TMZ) was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay. The xenograft nude models were used to test the effects of LINC00466 on glioma tumor growth

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Highly expressed LINC00466 and PPP1R14B and lowly expressed miR-137 were eventually revealed in glioma tissues. Overexpression of LINC00466 could promote proliferation, metastasis and drug sensitivity to TMZ of glioma cells. LINC00466 could bind to miR-137, and up-regulation of miR-137 could attenuate the enhancing effects caused by LINC00466 overexpression. We took a further step and found that miR-137 could bind to PPP1R14B. Besides, LINC00466 could function as a sponge to miR-137 to regulate PPP1R14B. In addition, overexpression of LINC00466 could promote tumor growth

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>These findings validate LINC00466 could restrain the miR-137 expression to up-regulate PPP1R14B and therefore promote proliferation, metastasis and resistance to TMZ of glioma.</p>

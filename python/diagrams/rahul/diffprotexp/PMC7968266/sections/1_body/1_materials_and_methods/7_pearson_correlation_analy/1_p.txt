0: Through the ROC and survival analysis, we screened the top 5 core genes with better diagnostic efficiency and higher prognostic value for EOC.
1: We further analyzed whether 5 core genes expression is related to the level of different immune checkpoint proteins through the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database ( http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/detail.php) [ 12].
2: Then, the types of immune checkpoint proteins that are positively correlated with gene expression were selected and shown in picture.

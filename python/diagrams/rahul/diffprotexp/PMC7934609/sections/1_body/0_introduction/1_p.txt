0: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a severe parasitic zoonosis caused by infection with the larval stage of  Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato [ 55], resulting in the development of CE cysts in domestic animals and humans [ 27].
1: The life cycle of  E. granulosus is complex and involves two hosts: definitive and intermediate.
2: Infection with  E. granulosus occurs after oral ingestion of infective eggs (an oncosphere containing invasive hexacanths [ 11]).
3: The parasite then hatches in the small intestine of the intermediate host, penetrates the mucosal tissue, enters the blood circulation system, and then migrates to various organs (e.g.
4: liver, lungs, etc.
5: ), where it develop cysts filled with fluid and protoscoleces.
6: However, in definitive hosts like dogs, adult parasites develop from the protoscolex in the intestine [ 7,  41].
7: Oncosphere, adult and protoscolex are, therefore, the three consecutive stages in the life history of  E. granulosus.

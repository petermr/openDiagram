 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the X-ray diffraction analysis pattern of the pure PVdF, SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and the prepared membrane composed of PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> at 2θ range of 18.3° and 19.8°, 26.6° attributed to the α(010), α(110), and α(021), which can reveal the pure PVdF contains only α-phase [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. From the diffraction pattern of the PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane, it is observed that a strong peak appeared at 2θ = 20.2° assigned to the β-phases viz, β (110) and β (200) planes [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It can be clearly concluded that the introduction of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> into the pure PVdF changed the α-phase into β phase which elevates the amorphous nature with transformation in the prepared PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane. This enhanced the ionic movement for larger Na-ion during the intercalation process.

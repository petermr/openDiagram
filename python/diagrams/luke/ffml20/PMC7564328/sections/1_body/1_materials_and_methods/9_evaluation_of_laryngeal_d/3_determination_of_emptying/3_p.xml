<p id="p0145">The laryngeal deposition rate was used as an evaluation index to compare the difference between CD-MOF, SCU@CD-MOF, SCU@DEX@CD-MOF and DEX@CD-MOF by NGI. Firstly, the eight impactor stages were successively covered with 1% dimethicone in 
 <italic>n-</italic>hexane solution to prevent the powder from bouncing back. After 
 <italic>n-</italic>hexane was dried, about 15 mL of 40% methanol solution was added into the pre-separator. A sample-filled capsule was placed in the inhalation device and the capsule was punctured by pressing the buttons on both sides of the device. The inhalation device was connected horizontally through an adapter to the artificial throat as required. The parameters such as inhalation time were repeated for the measurements of five capsules. After the NGI test was completed, each part was washed with 40% methanol solution and transferred to a volumetric flask and diluted to volume. The concentration of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-CD was determined using HPLC-ELSD (Agilent 1290, Agilent Technologies), with the drift tube temperature of 70 °C, the N
 <sub>2</sub> pressure of 3.2 bar, and the gain of 10. The InertSustain AQ-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used for separation with column temperature at 35 °C. The mobile phase was made up of methanol and water (15:85, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with 5 μL of injection volume. The laryngeal deposition was the ratio of the dose deposited in throat part in NGI to the total dose deposited at all the parts.

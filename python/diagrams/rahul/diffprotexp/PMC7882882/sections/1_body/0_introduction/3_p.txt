0: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA molecule with a transcript >200 nucleotides in length, and they play an important role in regulating gene expression through epigenetic or posttranscriptional mechanisms; however, they do not encode proteins ( 24 26).
1: The differential expression and dysregulation of lncRNAs is considered to be involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression, recurrence and metastasis ( 24).
2: However, the role of lncRNAs in NFPA recurrence and the regulation of cellular processes remains unknown.
3: A study have shown that LINC00858 plays a tumor-promoting role in colon cancer by upregulating hepatocyte nuclear factor 4- and downregulating WNK2 ( 27).
4: Xu  et al ( 28) showed that the overexpression of lncRNA PAXIP1-AS1 can upregulate KIF14, thereby enhancing human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis in gliomas.
5: Moreover, several studies found that identifying novel lncRNA-mRNA networks using microarray analyses could contribute to exploring the potential molecular mechanisms and prognosis of tumors ( 29 31).
6: The aforementioned studies indicate that the dysregulation of lncRNAs and lncRNA-mRNA interactions may affect the prognosis of NFPAs.

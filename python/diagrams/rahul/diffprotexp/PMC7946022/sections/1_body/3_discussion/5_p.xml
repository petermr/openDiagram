<p>Interestingly, in contrast to our findings, recent studies by Todd 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] aiming to elucidate observed enhanced mortality during polymicrobial 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> intra-abdominal infection, identified 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>-mediated increase in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> secreted alpha- and delta-toxins during polymicrobial infection. Although these factors are important virulence factors in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> crucial to its ability to cause systemic and disseminated infections, down-regulation of these factors might contribute to survival, persistence, and growth in a biofilm environment, as was seen in our biofilm infection model. Nevertheless, the contrasting regulation of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> exotoxins mediated by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> between the two animal models highlights the complex interactions between these two pathogens, and support the notion of niche-specific augmented pathogenesis in a co-infected host.

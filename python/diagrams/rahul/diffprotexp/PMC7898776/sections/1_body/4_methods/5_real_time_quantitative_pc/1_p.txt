0: We searched the cDNA sequences from transcriptome data of mandarin fish, designed the primers with Primer 5.0 software (Table  6).
1: The potential housekeeping gene according to the literature [ 32],  beta-actin,  b2m,  rpl13a, and  hmbs were examined, and  Rpl13a gene was more stable and selected as the internal control.
2: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with MyiQTM 2 Two-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) as the methods described by Liang et al.
3: [ 33].
4: The target gene expression relative to  rpl13a expression were calculated by the optimized comparative Ct (2 -Ct) value method [ 34].
5: Data with six biological replicates and three technical replicates were presented as mean  S.E.M.

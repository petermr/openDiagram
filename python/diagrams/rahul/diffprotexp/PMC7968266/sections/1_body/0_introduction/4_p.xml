<p id="Par22">In our study, DEGs between LMP and EOC were first screened based on three GEO datasets. Then, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were performed for these DEGs. Next, PPI network, ROC, survival and Pearson correlation analysis were utilized to further validate core genes, which show better diagnostic efficiency and higher prognostic value for EOC. Furthermore, the chemical-core gene network was constructed based on 5 core genes, and the top 15 related chemicals for EOC were identified. Finally, we found that all 5 core genes mainly regulate EOC development via the cell cycle pathway by the bioinformatic analysis, which may help to provide new ideas for EOC treatment.</p>

<p>The comparison of traditional hardening and the LSTH process are shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03136-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. After furnace hardening, samples were quenched in 3 different environments (water, air, and oil). In water, micro-cracks were created and hardness in the air was very low (about 421 Vickers). After oil quenching, the sample showed hardness as high as 572 Vickers). Since Nd:YAG LSTH treatment produced 673 Vickers, the increment in hardness was 18% higher with respect to the furnace treatment.

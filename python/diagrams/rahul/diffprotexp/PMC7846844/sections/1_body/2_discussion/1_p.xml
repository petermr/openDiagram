<p id="Par13">The skeletal muscle is the largest organ in mammalian animals. In pigs, skeletal muscle have important economic significance for production, and understanding the development of skeletal muscle is important for improving productivity and meat quality. In this study, we identified 361 potential lincRNAs based on the designed pipeline and found that 53 of them are novel lincRNAs. At the same time, we obtained 138 DELs. LincRNA generally indirectly exerts its potential regulatory effect by regulating the target protein-coding genes

 </sup>. Therefore, we predicted the PTG of DEL and the potential function of these PTGs. We found that multiple biological processes of these PTGs are related to skeletal muscle development. Such as muscle structure development, muscle organ development, muscle cell differentiation and skeletal muscle tissue development. Further, We also found that there are multiple PTGs involved in cAMP signaling pathway, which can promote muscle growth and protein synthesis

 </sup>. In addition, in muscle tissue, there is a balance between muscle synthesis and degradation, and rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays a key role in regulating protein synthesis

 </sup>. We found that multiple PTGs are related to mTOR signaling pathway. On the other hand, QTL mapping analysis of DELs showed that 1137 of the 3018 QTLs were related to skeletal muscle development. The proportion of loin muscle area QTL and body weight QTL is the highest.

Overall, FGM concentrations were not significantly related to the stated enrichment goal (F<sub>1,105</sub> = 0.48, <italic>p</italic> = 0.49) or enrichment item (F<sub>4,94</sub> = 1.51, <italic>p</italic> = 0.21; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01433">Table S10</xref>). Values for the remaining fixed factors are based on models using the stated enrichment goal and were non-significant for: time in the study (F<sub>1,98</sub> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0.81), sample collection time (F<sub>1,104</sub> = 0.28, <italic>p</italic> = 0.60), the interaction of stated goal and samplecollection time (F<sub>1,105</sub> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.51), amount of time spent using enrichment in seconds (F<sub>1,103</sub> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.79), amount of time spent pacing in seconds (F<sub>1,101</sub> = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.76), count of enrichment events (F<sub>1,99</sub> = 0.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.65), count of pacing events (F<sub>1,103</sub> = 0.004, <italic>p</italic> = 0.95), total affiliative interactions (F<sub>1,99</sub> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0.81), or total agonistic interactions (F<sub>1,106</sub> = 0.74, <italic>p</italic> = 0.39).</p>

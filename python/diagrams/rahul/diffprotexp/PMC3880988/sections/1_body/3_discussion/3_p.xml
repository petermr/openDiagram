<p>Activity of GAPD in cMSC and ACs has increased three folds as compared to MSCs. Rocha et. al. (2012) reported similar outcome of which the cytoskeleton-related and metabolic-related protein were upregulated 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>. Increased expression of GAPD is associated with the synthesis and deposition of ECM molecules 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Cartilage ECM proteoglycans formation is preceded by markedly increased activity of uridinediphosphoglucose dehydrogenase (UDPGD), which is directly associated with GAG synthesis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPD and succinate dehydrogenase 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. In this study, ALDOA expression was lower in cMSCs than both the MSCs and ACs. ALDOA is a glycolytic enzyme for energy generation in chondrocytes, particularly marked at cell maturity 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Reduction of energy modulated by ALDOA may limit the ability of ACs to restore GAG matrices 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. Recently, both GAPD and ALDOA have been found to interact with S100A1 and S100B proteins that suppress hypertrophic differentiation and mineralization of chondrogenic cells

<p>The presence of retained austenite is due to its high thermal stability revealing during heat treatment. Its stability is influenced by carbon and manganese contents in the austenite, a morphology, dislocation density and the neighborhood of soft or hard phases [

 <xref rid="B8-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These factors determine the amount of retained austenite present in the microstructure and resulting mechanical properties. A good way to determine the stability of austenite is dilatometry. This method allows for analyzing changes in a sample length during heat treatment. The change in length corresponds to the phase transformation undergoing in the material. There are possibilities to determine critical temperatures of steel: A
 <sub>c1</sub>, A
 <sub>c3</sub>, martensite start (M
 <sub>s</sub>) and finish (M
 <sub>f</sub>) temperatures. The rate of transformation can be also analyzed.

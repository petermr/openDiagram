0: IHC was performed for all 14 samples used in the LC-MS/MS screening as well as for other cystic thyroid and parathyroid reference tissue samples ( S1 and  S2 Tables) according to previously published protocols [ 11,  12,  26,  27].
1: Briefly, 4 m FFPE tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in graded series of ethanol and incubated in citrate buffer (Dako, Sweden) for 20 min at 9599C for antigen retrieval.
2: Slides were incubated in 0.5% H 2O 2 to deactivate endogenous peroxidase.
3: Unspecific binding sites were blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin.
4: Slides were incubated overnight with a primary antibody: polyclonal rabbit anti-S100A13 (HPA019592, Atlas Antibodies AB, Sweden) at dilution 1:1,500; anti-annexin A3 (HPA013398, Atlas Antibodies AB) at 1:1,500; polyclonal rabbit anti-CMBL (HPA036571, Atlas Antibodies AB) at 1:1,000; monoclonal mouse anti-CK-19 (clone RCK 108, Dako) at 1:300; or anti-human mesothelial cell (clone HBME-1, Dako) at 1:400.
5: A secondary biotinylated antibody was applied followed by an avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) according to the manufacturers instructions (Vectastain, Vector Burlingame).
6: The result was visualized with diaminobenzidine and counterstaining in hematoxylin.

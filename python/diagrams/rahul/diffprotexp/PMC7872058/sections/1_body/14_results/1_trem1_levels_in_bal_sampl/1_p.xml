<p>To investigate the role of TREM1 in IPA, we compared the levels of TREM1 in BAL fluids from patients diagnosed with IPA and matched controls (non-IPA patients). A total of 98 subjects, including 50 cases of “probable” or “proven” IA according to the EORTC/MSG criteria and 48 controls with no 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection were included in this study (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a</xref>. IPA patients showed significantly higher levels of sTREM1 than control patients. To corroborate its utility for the diagnosis of IPA, we analyzed the AUCROC for sTREM1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a</xref>). sTREM1 demonstrated reasonable sensitivity and specificity (AUCROC = 0.718; 95% CI, 0.618–0.819; p = 0.002) with a cutoff level ≥ 800.8 pg/mL calculated using Youdens index.

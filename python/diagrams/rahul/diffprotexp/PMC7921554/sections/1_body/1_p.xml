<p id="Par2">Metformin, a widely prescribed drug for treating type II diabetes, has shown an important anti-cancer property.

 </sup> However, new launched clinical trials did not achieve such desirable results.

 </sup> One explanation could be that metforminâ€™s anti-cancer mechanisms and precise therapeutic targets remain unclear. To identify potential therapeutic targets of metformin in bladder cancer, we screened differential proteins with metformin treatment in T24 cells by high-throughput protein chip. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Clusterin was screened as a target of metformin in bladder cancer. The direct binding of metformin with Clusterin was further confirmed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Meanwhile, results from Western blot and RT-PCR showed that treatment with metformin resulted in significant Clusterin downregulation in UMUC3 and J82 cells (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a, b</xref>). Clusterin is a conserved glycoprotein which plays key roles in cellular stress response and survival.

 </sup> As evidenced by its key roles in cancer, Clusterin served as a therapeutic target for fighting tumor growth.

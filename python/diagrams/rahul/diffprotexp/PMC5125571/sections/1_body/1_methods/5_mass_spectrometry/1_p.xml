<p>For spectral library generation, samples were analysed by LC-MS/MS on a Shimadzu Prominance Nano HPLC coupled with a SWATH-MS-enabled AB SCIEX Triple TOF 5600+ mass spectrometer. Sample was injected onto a 50 mm 300 μm C18 trap column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) and peptides eluted onto an analytical nano HPLC column (150 mm x 75 μm 300SBC18, 3.5 μm, Agilent Technologies) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. A gradient of 1–40% buffer B over 35 min followed by a steeper gradient from 40%-80% buffer B over 5 min was used. Buffer B consisted of 90/10 acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid, and buffer A contained 0.1% formic acid (aq). The mass spectrometer was operated in DDA top20 mode, with 500 and 150 ms acquisition times for the MS1 and MS2 scans respectively, and 20 s dynamic exclusion. Rolling collision energy with a collision energy spread of 15 eV was used for fragmentation.</p>

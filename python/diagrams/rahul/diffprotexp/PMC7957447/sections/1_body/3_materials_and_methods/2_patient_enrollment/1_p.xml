<p id="Par24">Blood samples from 33 COVID-19 patients without any complications were collected at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 19th February 2020 to 17th March 2020. A flowchart of sample preprocessing for this study is shown in Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. The mean age of the COVID-19 patients was 50.0 years old (standard deviation = 11.9), and the male:female ratio is 1.06:1. All patients were diagnosed in accordance with the guidelines for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment (Trial Version 7) released by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Selected patients were classified into two groups, including severely and critically ill. The critical state was defined with at least one of the following criteria: shock; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation; and other organ dysfunction requiring admission to ICU. The severe state was defined with at least one of the following criteria: respiratory rate ≥ 30 times/min; arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
 <sub>2</sub>) ≤ 300 mmHg; oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at resting state; and pulmonary imaging inspection showing significant injury progression by &gt; 50% within 24–48 h. The definition of disease severity was consistent with previous study [

The exclusion criteria of comorbidities included hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, surgical history, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, immunodeficiency disease, chronic hepatitis, and tuberculosis.

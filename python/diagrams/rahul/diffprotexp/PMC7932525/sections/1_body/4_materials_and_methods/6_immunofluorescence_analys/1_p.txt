0: Immunofluorescence analysis of nitrogenase iron protein was performed as previously described with minor modifications [ 48].
1: After 72 h culture under nitrogen-replete and deprivation conditions, strain PCC 7120 was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 25C.
2: The samples were rinsed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), and then incubated for 5 min in PBST at 25C.
3: The samples were incubated for 1 h with 6 g/mL affinity-purified anti-NifH antibody (Agrisera, Vaesterbotten, Sweden) diluted in PBST containing 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin and three washes with PBST.
4: The samples were incubated in the dark with rabbit anti-chicken IgY conjugated to FITC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 45 min and then washed twice with PBST.
5: The samples were mounted in Vectashield medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA H-1500) and viewed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2).

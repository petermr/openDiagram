<p id="Par5">Therefore, in this study, we investigated the expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN proteins in PFC and NAc, regions that receive dopaminergic input and are considered to be affected in schizophrenia. This analysis was performed in 49 postmortem samples from subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and control subjects (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, we analyzed the associations between this expression and genetic variants of dopaminergic signaling-associated molecules for 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a much larger set of postmortem samples to examine the potential involvement of genetic variants in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

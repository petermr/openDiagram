 <caption> Neuropathological hallmarks in AD. Oligomeric proteins were determined in post-mortem human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of sporadic AD patients and controls. The levels of Aβ oligomers were determined in: ( A) SNpc; ( B) Hippocampus and ( C) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. ( D) Densitometric analysis of the levels of Aβ oligomers. The levels of SNCA oligomers were determined in: ( E) SNpc; ( F) Hippocampus and ( G) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. ( H) Densitometric analysis of the levels of SNCA oligomers. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5, #p &lt; 0.05, versus hippocampus control subjects; &amp;p &lt; 0.05, versus cortex control subjects). </caption>

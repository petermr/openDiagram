<p id="Par47">Although cytology is the gold standard for the diagnosis of malignancies, serum biomarkers are also invaluable in the screening and auxiliary diagnosis of malignant tumors as well as monitoring curative effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The serum proteome holds significant interest as a potential source of biomarkers and is an easily accessible fluid for auxiliary diagnosis. Four tumor biomarkers, including AFP, CEA, CA125 and CA199, are widely used in clinical practice. An observational study presented by Chen et al
 <italic>.</italic> revealed the association between the levels of these biomarkers and the tumor stage of LAC. Serum AFP was not correlated with T stage, N stage or M stage, but serum CEA and serum CA125 were positively correlated with T stage, N stage and M stage. Serum CA199 was not correlated with T stage but was positively correlated with N stage and M stage [

In our study, the results indicated that there were no significant differences in serum CEA, AFP, CA125 and CA199 levels between the T2DM + LAC group and the T2DM group, indicating an urgent need for the identification of promising biomarkers for the detection of LAC in T2DM patients.

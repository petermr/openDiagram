<p>In AlZnMg(Cu) alloys, quench-induced precipitates of the Î·-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub> phase can be considered the most detrimental precipitation in terms of quench sensitivity, since this phase forms at relatively fast cooling rates while its precipitates barely have a hardening effect. Quench-induced phases at even lower temperatures, namely thin Y-phase platelets [

(<italic>A</italic>) Values of &#955;<sub>max</sub> for M/LWS for extant and ancestral taxa. The values obtained in this study by either direct measurement (*) or estimation from critical sites (&#8224;). Published &#955;<sub>max</sub> values are based on either direct measurements or sequence-based predictions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2002235117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S1</ext-link>). Across the two clades, branches and &#955;<sub>max</sub> values are colored by wavelength sensitivity, as yellow (550 nm to 556 nm), green (&#8804;549 nm), and blue (490 nm). Gray indicates no value. Predicted values are shown in italics. For branches leading to gerbil and elephant-shrew, all amino acid substitutions are shown, with critical sites identified here underlined. Other focal branches show known critical substitutions only (bold) (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). For gerbil and elephant-shrew, recorded absorbance peaks (difference spectra) and &#955;<sub>max</sub> values for all three pigments are shown. (<italic>B</italic>) Phylogenetic tree showing position of the focal orders Rodentia and Macroscelidea (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Published &#955;<sub>max</sub> values for each mammalian order are shown as either ranges (black bars) or single point values (black triangles). The &#955;<sub>max</sub> values measured in this study are indicated by red triangles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2002235117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S1</ext-link>).</p></caption><graphic id="gra1" xlink:href="pnas.2002235117fig01"/></fig>

<p id="par0045">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proteomics study that assesses the proteome profiles of invasive FV-PTC and NIFTP lesions in order to increase the understanding of the biology behind these noninvasive neoplasms. Here we present a label-free quantitative mass spectrometry approach with high resolution and high mass accuracy to investigate invasive FV-PTC and NIFTP proteomes and compare the protein profiles with CV-PTC and benign lesions. Our results led to the identification of over 2500 proteins, providing comprehensive proteome information of FV-PTC, CV-PTC and benign lesions. From our results, we aimed to refine our understanding of biology behind the variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma.</p>

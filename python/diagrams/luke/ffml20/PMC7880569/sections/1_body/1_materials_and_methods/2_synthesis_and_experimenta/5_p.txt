0: Surface Mn AOS values of AcidBir (AOS = 3.69; 72% Mn IV, 25% Mn III, and 3% Mn II) and -MnO 2 (AOS = 3.52; 58% Mn IV, 36% Mn III, and 6% Mn II) were resolved by fitting of the Mn 3s region according to the method of Ilton  et al.
1: ( 43) Of note, these oxidation states are highly similar to those of Ling  et al.
2: ( 44) obtained using the same analysis method of a birnessite synthesized by reduction of permanganate under acidic conditions (AOS = 3.69; 68% Mn IV, 22% Mn III, and 4% Mn II), as in AcidBir, and for another birnessite by a redox reaction at high pH (AOS = 3.69; 60% Mn IV, 38% Mn III, 2% Mn II), as in -MnO 2.
3: See the  supplementary section for a discussion on the fitting procedure and results, in  Figures S2S4 and Table S1.

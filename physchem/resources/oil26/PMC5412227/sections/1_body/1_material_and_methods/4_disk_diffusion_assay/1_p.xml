<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The protocols used in this study were conducted according to the guidelines of CLSI, formerly known as NCCLS (Wayne 2007) with slight modifications. In summary, each sterile Petri dish with a diameter of 9 cm was prepared with 20 ml of Mueller-Hinton medium. Then, 100 &#956;L of a bacterial suspension (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was spread on the plates. After 5 min, a sterile filter paper disc (6 mm) containing 20 &#956;L of <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil was placed on the surface of the plate. In order to accelerate essential oil diffusion into the agar, the plates were incubated at 4 &#176;C for 1 h followed by incubation at 37 &#176;C, for 24 to 48 h. The diameters of the inhibition zones (mm) were measured, including the diameter of the disks. Gentamycin (30 &#956;g/disk) and vancomycin (30 &#956;g/disk) served as positive controls for Gram-positive and Gram-negative, respectively. All tests were performed in triplicate.</p>

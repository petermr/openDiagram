 <caption> Associations of the indicated LE genes with prostate cancer relapse in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCancer ( n = 492) and MSKCC ( n = 140) cohorts. Univariate Cox PH (proportional hazard) analyses were performed using R survival package. The PH assumption was violated for FBXO6 in the MSKCC cohort; the assumption for others was confirmed. The FBXO6 expression in the MSKCC cohort was presented as log2 transformed data. HR and 95% CI for TEME45B in the TCGA dataset are 1, respectively. </caption>

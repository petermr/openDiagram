<p id="Par24">We used laser microdissection and Illumina technology for single-cell RNA-Seq analysis to clarify the relationship between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pol CMS in NILs. After raw data were trimmed, a total of 52,936,673 and 52,606,810 clean reads were obtained for fertile and sterile samples, respectively. Furthermore, the Q20 and Q30 were &gt; 96.61 and &gt; 92.53%, respectively. The GC content for both sterile and fertile samples was regularly shown to be approximately 45%, signifying that the sequencing was exact. All clean reads (105,543,483) were aligned using the Trinity program, resulting in 117,332 contigs with a mean length of 901 nt (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We performed clustering and identified 80,851 unigenes (&gt; 200 bp); the average length was 1054 nt, and the N50 was 1586 nt. The length of all unigenes recorded was longer than 199 bp, and 86.95% of them ranged from 200 to 1999 bp. We subjected all assembled unigenes to search against the Nr, Swiss-Prot, and COG databases, and 66,143 (81.81%), 54,857 (67.85%), and 28,129 (34.79%) unigenes were aligned against these three protein databases, respectively (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Among them, 114,517 and 104,780 genes were detected in the sterile and restorer line materials, respectively, and 98,735 genes were detected in both materials.

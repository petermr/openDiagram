<p>We performed 2DE on the peritoneal dialysate from DM and CGN patients, and more than 300 spots were detected using the image analysis software (

The most abundant proteins in the peritoneal dialysates were matched with the plasma 2DE map (according to the MW, pI, and pattern of spots) such as albumin, microglobulin, haptoglobin, glycoprotein, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulin.

<p>Other authors developed thermal refunctionalization processes, during which the active material was calcined with or without a lithium precursor. Wei et al. proposed a process of thermally reactivating the transition metal oxides after selective leaching of the aluminum current collector with NaOH [

(Tokyo, Japan) patented a process that selectively leaches contaminants, namely, lithium compounds, adsorbed to the surface of active material using ammonia water [

<p id="Par15">Further notable examples of compounds with the potential to reverse molecular changes include IB-MECA, VEGF-receptor-2-kinase-inhibitor-IV and nornicotine. IB-MECA is used as an anti-inflammatory drug in rheumatoid arthritis, and has been shown to prevent cartilage damage, osteoclast/osteophyte formation and bone destruction in a rat model of chemically-induced osteoarthritis

 <italic>VEGF</italic> receptor inhibitor. 
 <italic>VEGF</italic> modulates chondrocyte survival during development, is essential for bone formation and skeletal growth, and dysregulated in osteoarthritis

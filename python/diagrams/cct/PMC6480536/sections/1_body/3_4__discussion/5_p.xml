<p>In the tested steel, 0.001 wt.% boron was added to promote acicular ferrite formation. Boron had a significant influence on the effectiveness of oxide particles under different austenitizing conditions. Segregation of boron atoms at the austenite grain boundaries could retard the austenite-to-ferrite transformation occurring at the boundaries. It was shown that ferrite side plates or bainite start temperatures were reduced by about 50 Â°C during continuous cooling because of boron segregation [

 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-01070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, boron would not reduce the intragranular nucleation ability. In the present study, with an increase in austenitization temperature, the austenite grain size grew coarse and the segregation degree of boron at the grain boundaries became higher. The grain boundary ferrite, ferrite side plates, or bainite transformation will be further inhibited, resulting in acicular ferrite formation to a greater extent. Therefore, in addition to MDZ development, boron segregation at the austenite grain boundaries and absorption into Ti-oxide particles is an important factor influencing the transformation behaviors under different austenitization conditions.

0: Protein spots were selected by using the criteria: protein expressions are a twofold difference between DM and CGN patients (greater than twofold or less then 50%).
1: Statistical significance was determined by using the two-tailed Fisher exact test at  P< 0.05.
2: The protein spots were excised manually, reduced, alkylated, and then digested using sequence grade trypsin (V511A, Promega) by standard protocols [ 16].

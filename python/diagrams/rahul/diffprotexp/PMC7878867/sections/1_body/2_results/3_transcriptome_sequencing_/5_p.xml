<p id="Par26">Degradome sequencing generated over 676.58 million raw reads from the eight degradome libraries (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). For each degradome library, the number of reads aligned to mRNA transcripts ranged from 146,426 to 167,119. Degradome signatures consistent with miRNA-guided cleavage events within the mRNA transcripts were analysed. A total of 218,179 and 222,077 miRNA-guided target sites were identified in the flag leaf and developing grain libraries, respectively (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">S13</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">S14</xref>). Degradomics data, with pairing information (paired and unpaired sites, miRNA-mRNA complementary sequence) between durum miRNAs and their targets, is listed in Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">S13</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">S14</xref>.

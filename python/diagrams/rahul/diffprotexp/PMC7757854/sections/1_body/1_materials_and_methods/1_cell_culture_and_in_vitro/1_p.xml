<p>MEFs cells were grown in 60-mm treated tissue culture dishes (Thermo Scientific). Cells were maintained in growth media (GM) containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Gibco™) supplemented with 10% by volume of foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Corning) and 1% by volume of Pen/Strep/Glutamine (Gibco™) in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C. MEFs were seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in six-well tissue culture plates (Corning). At confluency, cells were induced into adipogenesis by incubating with differentiation media (DM) containing GM supplemented with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma©), 10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma©), 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma©) and 10 μM rosiglitazone (Sigma©). Cells were treated for 3 days (D3), followed by replacement of DM with GM, and incubation for another 2 days (D5).

<p>Obtaining a large dynamic range is a much bigger challenge in cooling experiments than in heating experiments. Each DSC device has its own spectrum of heating/cooling rates, which also depends on the particular setup of the device (see Ref. [
 <xref rid="B83-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] for more details). The scanning rate spectrum is typically analysed by measuring a performance diagram (see the example in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f010">Figure 10</xref>). It can be seen that during heating, a scanning rate of 5 K/s is reached after a short period, and can be controlled over nearly the entire temperature range, which was 0 to 600 °C in this case. However, during cooling, control over the scanning rate is lost at a certain temperature, and this takes place earlier at increasing cooling rates. The loss of cooling control is accompanied by the loss of an evaluable DSC signal, which is typically more severe for power-compensated calorimeters. In the example given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f010">Figure 10</xref>, the critical temperature during cooling at 5 K/s is about 350 °C. This is clearly a limiting factor, since relevant reactions might occur at lower temperatures, and these cannot be therefore analysed with this particular DSC device at this cooling rate.

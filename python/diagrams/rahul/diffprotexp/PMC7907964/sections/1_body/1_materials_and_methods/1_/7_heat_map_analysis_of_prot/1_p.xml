<p>The MS ion intensities of each protein (average peptide ion intensities) were normalized by those in the healthy control group and counted as 1.00-fold. The expression levels (normalized intensity ratio) of proteins were represented in a heat map constructed using R version 3.3.1(
 <xref rid="b24-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The proteins were sorted by their expression levels, starting from high to low, in comparison with those of the control group. All samples were clustered with the Euclidean distance computational method and the complete agglomeration method (

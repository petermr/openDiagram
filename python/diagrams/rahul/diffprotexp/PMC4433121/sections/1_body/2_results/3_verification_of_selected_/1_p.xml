<p>Four proteins that were found up-regulated in cPTCs were selected for verification: cytokeratin 19 (CK-19), S100A13, annexin A3 (ANXA3) and carboxymethylenebutenolidase homolog (CMBL). The selection was based on the number of peptides, their identification as up-regulated in cPTCs vs. benign cystic lesions in univariate analyses (

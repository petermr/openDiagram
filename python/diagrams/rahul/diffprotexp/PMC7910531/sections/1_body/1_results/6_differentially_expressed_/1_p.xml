<p id="Par12">Ninety-one of the genes with significantly different expression profiles between high- and low-grade cartilage were also associated with genetic risk of osteoarthritis (i.e. among the 238 genes with gene-level significant association in a recent meta-analysis

 <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> gene expression and lower protein abundance in high-grade cartilage (suggesting a potential role for post-transcriptional regulation for this gene). For 
 <italic>SLC39A8</italic>, the GWAS signal was fine-mapped with posterior probability of 0.999 to a single missense variant predicted to be possibly deleterious by PolyPhen-2

<p>The GO, KEGG and COG annotation of the identified proteins were carried out to comprehensively reflect the biological function and significance of these proteins in various life activities. Functional annotation of all proteins obtained from Se-enriched and non-Se enriched rice revealed a sum of 3235 differential proteins. Of these, 3122 proteins were sub-categorized into 53 hierarchically-structured GO classifications (

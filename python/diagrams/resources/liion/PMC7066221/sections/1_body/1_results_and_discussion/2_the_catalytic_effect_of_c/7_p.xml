<p id="p0120">The mechanism behind the facilitated deposition of active Mn compound could be ascribed to dual-catalysis effects from Mn(IV) species and Co(III) species on the cathode. Usually, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte is more stable than most of the Mn cations due to the high tendency of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> disproportionation (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>). A recent research reported by Qiao's group indicated that the deposition of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> on a carbon fiber using a Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>-containing electrolyte took place at a high potential of 2.2 V versus Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>/Zn in a chronoamperometry charge process (

 <sup>2+</sup> could result in a large overpotential. Our LSV scan for the SS electrode in the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>-containing electrolyte (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B) also indicates a similar result where an onset potential of deposition of the active Mn compound was higher than 1.85 V versus Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>/Zn, which is beyond the voltage window for a typical Zn-ion battery. The unique facilitated deposition observed in this work within the voltage range below 1.85 V could be ascribed to the following two different catalysis routes (

<p>The determination of the enthalpy level of any initial state can be utilised in indirect DSC reheating experiments. The basic idea is to perform systematic variations of the initial state via defined heat treatments and the subsequent determination of the enthalpy level by a DSC reheating experiment [

 <xref rid="B130-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. One prerequisite for this approach is that the alloy allows the formation of a complete solution at the solution treatment temperature. The complete solid solution is an equilibrium state, and its enthalpy level h
 <sub>0</sub> can be defined as zero. A second prerequisite is that this equilibrium enthalpy state h
 <sub>0</sub> = 0 must be reached again during reheating.

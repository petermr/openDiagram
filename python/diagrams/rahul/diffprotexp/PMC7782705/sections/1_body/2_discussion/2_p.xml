We show, using bulk tissue RNAseq data, that alterations in gene expression are highly prominent in biological samples obtained from the temporal lobe, which harbors the first brain regions affected in the AD pathogenesis

 </sup>. Conversely, few changes are present in biological samples derived from the frontal lobe, where cells are affected only at advanced stages of AD. These observations are in line with recent data showing that changes in protein expression levels in AD brains are much more prominent in the temporal lobe (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and cingulate gyrus) than in the frontal lobe (motor cortex)

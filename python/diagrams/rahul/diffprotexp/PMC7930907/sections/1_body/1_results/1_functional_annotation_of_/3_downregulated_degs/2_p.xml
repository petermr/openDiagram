<p>Similarly, the top scored network analyses of common downregulated DEGs were found to be most associated with peptide metabolic process (24.0%), mitochondrial translational elongation (12.0%), mitochondrial translational termination (12.0%), translation (20.0%), and gene expression (42.0%) (

The unique downregulated DEGs in PASCs were involved in cyclic nucleotide catabolic process (16.3%), cAMP-mediated signaling (26.5%), purine ribonucleotide catabolic process (16.3%), ribonucleotide catabolic process (16.3%), and cyclic-nucleotide-mediated signaling (26.5%) (

Additionally, the unique downregulated DEGs in EASCs showed the top scored network is in response to hormone (46.0%), response to the endogenous stimulus (52.0%), response to organic cyclic compound (46.0%), regulation of multicellular organismal development (54.0%), and regulation of multicellular organismal process (64.0%) (

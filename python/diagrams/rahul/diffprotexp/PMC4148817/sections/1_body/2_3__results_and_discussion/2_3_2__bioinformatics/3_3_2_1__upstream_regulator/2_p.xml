<p>Adenosine receptor A2a (ADORA2A) is a receptor for adenosine. The activity of this receptor is mediated by a G protein that activates adenylyl cyclase. It has been shown that the inhibition of ADO-R 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> prevented activation of CFTR and also resulted in airway surface liquid (ASL) height collapse and a failure to effect ASL height homeostasis [

 <sup>âˆ’</sup> secretion via CFTR in Calu-3 cells after exposure to CNTs [

   <bold> DEHP triggered apoptosis in germ cells and ovarian somatic cells. (A)</bold> Immunohistochemical staining of MVH (red) and γH2AX (green) in ovaries with and without DEHP treatment at PD3, PD5, and PD7. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar = 50 μm. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> TUNEL (green) and MVH (red) staining of ovarian sections at PD3. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). White arrows and pentagram mark the germ cells and granulosa cells with TUNEL, respectively. Scale bar = 50 μm. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The number of TUNEL positive germ cells (upper) and granulosa cells (lower) for each section at PD3. Data are shown as mean ± SD. **

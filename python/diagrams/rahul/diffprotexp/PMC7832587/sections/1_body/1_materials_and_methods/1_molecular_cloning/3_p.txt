0: Co-expression vectors: pYedBAD-BAD-Drs2p/Cdc50p-His was cloned previously [ 31].
1: To construct the other co-expression vectors we used a previous strategy.
2: The fragments containing the cassette Promoter-Cdc50-TEV-His10-Terminator from each pYeDP60-Cdc50-TEV-10xHis vector were amplified by PCR, incorporating the  SbfI restriction site at both the 5 and the 3 ends.
3: The PCR fragments were then cloned at the  SbfI site of the corresponding species-specific single-expression vectors pYeDP60-ATP2-TEV-BAD and pYeDP60-BAD-TEV-ATP2.

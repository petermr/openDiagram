<p>The ubiquity of 
 <italic>Alancaivorax</italic> and its success as an alkane degrader may result from the ability to also efficiently utilize branched alkanes as the sources of carbon, which provides a competitive advantage over other OHCB which are unable to utilize these more difficult to degrade substrates (Pirnik

 <italic>n‐</italic>alkanes or pyruvate. However our knowledge of the proteins involved branched alkane degradation remains very limited. This study is first to compare the differences in protein expression during linear and branched alkane degradation in

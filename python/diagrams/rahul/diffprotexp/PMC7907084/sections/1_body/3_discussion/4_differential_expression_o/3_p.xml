<p id="Par35">In this study, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, the FPKM values of the transcript encoding 
 <italic>LHCGR</italic> in F5 follicles (G5p: 32.86, G5d: 29.28) are much lower than in F1 follicles (G1p: 493.52, G1d: 599.95). 
 <italic>LHCGR</italic> showed a distinct differential expression between Gp and Gd in F1 follicles. Our finding is consistent with previous studies, in which Gd cells were shown to have higher 
 <italic>LHR</italic> mRNA levels and show higher responsiveness to LH treatment in term of P4 production in F1 follicles

 </sup>. The high abundance of LHR is likely to coordinate the surge of LH, thus initiating the oviposition process

 </sup>. Our findings support that the pituitary gonadotropin LH is most likely involved in the control of cell heterogeneity and functional diversity of GC through LHR signaling. Along follicular development, granulosa cells change from FSHR dominance to LHR dominance

 </sup>. In line with this tendency, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, the expression of FSHR are lower at the later follicular stage in both Gp and Gd cells. Similar to the expression profile of 
 <italic>LHCGR</italic>, the expression of FSHR also showed the differential pattern between the two cell subpopulations in F1 follicles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), suggesting its possible role in the heterogeneity and functional diversity observed between Gp and Gd cells.

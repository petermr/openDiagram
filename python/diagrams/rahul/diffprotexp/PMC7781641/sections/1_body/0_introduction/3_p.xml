<p>In this study, we have analyzed the differential gene expression pattern of trigeminal ganglia (TG) from FRICT-ION mice compared to naïve mice and established a potential role for the Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 T-type calcium channel. We performed behavioral pharmacology experiments using a selective Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3-blocking peptide and found that mechanical allodynia is alleviated in both male and female FRICT-ION mice. Furthermore, we also show that the Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3-blocking peptide appears to be more effective in female than male mice in alleviating mechanical allodynia in our model.

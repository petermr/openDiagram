<p>From a molecular biology point of view, 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations cause deregulation of the protein polyubiquitination/deubiquitination balance and impair the normal proteasomal degradation process [
 <xref rid="B16-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In corticotroph tumors, a sustained EGFR signaling was found to be a consequence of the mutation [
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the 
 <italic>USP8</italic> changes probably affect normal turnover of many other proteins regulated by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 8 [
 <xref rid="B26-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The pleiotropic effect of the mutation is observed not only at the level of protein degradation, but it is also manifested at the level of gene expression [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this study, we aimed to characterize the difference in miRNA profile in tumors with 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations and wild-type PitNETs.

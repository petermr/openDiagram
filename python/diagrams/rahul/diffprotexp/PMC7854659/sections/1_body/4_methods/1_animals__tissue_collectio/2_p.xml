 <italic>n</italic> = 7/group), liver (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7/group), and muscle (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7/group) were collected from fetuses through ovariohysterectomy

 </sup>. Tissue collection was performed at this time because fetal organogenesis have already finished and it is in the peak primary myogenesis

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. The tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at − 80 °C, and later on, RNA isolation and sequencing were performed by the University of Minnesota Genomics Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN), as reported elsewhere

 </sup>. After RNA quality control, strand-specific RNA libraries were prepared, and sequencing was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Sequencing was pair-end (50-bp reads) at a depth of 2 × 10.4 M reads/sample in both forward and reverse directions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Fetal sex was determined by PCR based on the hind limb DNA amplification of the 
 <italic>DDX3X</italic> and 
 <italic>DDX3Y</italic> genes located on the X and Y chromosomes. The PCR product was analyzed on agarose gel electrophoresis, where males showed two bands, and females resulted in only one. This analysis was based on the primers, and PCR parameters reported elsewhere
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, were evaluated 6 males and 1 female in the CON group and 5 males and 2 females in the RES group.

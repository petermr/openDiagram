  <title>Genetic variation analysis of quinoa varieties.</title>
  <p>(A) Distance matrix within and among samples. In color legend, the blue representing the closest distance between samples and the red represents farther distance between samples. (B) Unrooted phylogenetic tree of quinoa varieties with their biological replicates. J, Q, and R are initials of the varieties, 1,4 are days post inoculation, and respective biological replicates represented by either R1, R2, or R3 symbols. There was close relationship among the individual samples of each variety, however they were not identical (

<p id="Par11">We used the Genomic Fabric Paradigm (GFP) that goes beyond the traditional transcriptomic analysis limited to the average expression level (AVE) of individual genes by considering also their relative expression variability (REV) and correlation (COR) with each other gene

 </sup>. REV informs about the strength of the cellular homeostatic control to confine the expression fluctuations into narrow intervals. COR analysis responds to the “Principle of Transcriptomic Stoichiometry”

 </sup>, a generalization of the “Law of Multiple Proportions” from chemistry, requiring genes to be expressed in certain proportions to optimize the functional pathways. Thus, GFP provided the most (theoretically possible) comprehensive characterization of the topology of each heart chamber transcriptome and their differences. Moreover, in each chamber, we have also established the gene hierarchy according to their Gene Commanding Height (GCH) score and identified the corresponding Gene Master Regulator (GMR)

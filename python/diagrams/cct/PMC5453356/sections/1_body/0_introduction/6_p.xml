<p>This study therefore aims to develop a method that enables the measurement of isothermal TTP diagrams of aluminum alloys by 
 <italic>in situ</italic> differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Thus, the whole heat treatment will be performed in the DSC and it will be possible to follow precipitation reactions during the isothermal soaking procedure at selected temperatures.

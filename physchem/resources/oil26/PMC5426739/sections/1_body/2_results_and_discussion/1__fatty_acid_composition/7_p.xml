Fatty acid composition of oils can change during storage. Results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> confirm that there was a significant change (p&lt; 0.05) during 90 days storage of oil samples. There was a significant decrease (p&lt; 0.05) in 18:2 and 18:3. However, this decrease could not increase the &#969;<sub>6</sub>:&#969;<sub>3</sub> ratio beyond optimal levels. It has been previously reported that changes in fatty acid composition of olive oil occurs during storage.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>

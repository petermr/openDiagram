 </sup> In this study, nanostructured Cu powders with variable amounts of B dopants (1.3–2.2%) were prepared, and 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> investigated by XAS after reduction at applied negative potentials (5 cycles with 0.1 V/s between −0.5 to −2 V
 <sub>RHE</sub>),

 </xref>b, signaling that the presence of B dopants stabilizes cationic Cu species, with a Cu average oxidation state up to 0.78 being achieved at the highest B concentration. 
 <italic>In situ</italic> XAS measurements confirmed that the enhanced concentration of Cu(I) species was preserved also under CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions (

 </xref>c). Importantly, the B-doped catalysts showed exceptionally high Faradaic efficiency toward C
 <sub>2</sub> hydrocarbon formation (80% FE) and complete suppression of C
 <sub>1</sub> products formation at the optimal copper valence state of +0.35.

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the present study the comparative analysis of the chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils distilled from three varieties of basil, <italic>O. basilicum</italic> var. <italic>purpureum</italic>, <italic>O. basilicum</italic> var. <italic>thyrsiflora</italic>, and <italic>O.</italic> x <italic>citriodorum,</italic> was carried out<italic>.</italic> The plants under investigation were grown in the same soil, at the same elevation, and under the same climatic conditions. The first two cultivars were varieties of <italic>O. basilicum</italic> specie<italic>s</italic>, or Sweet basil, and the third one, the Lemon basil (<italic>O. x citriodorum</italic>) was a hybrid between <italic>O. basilicum and O. americanum</italic>. The purpose of this paper was also to study the biological activities of given oils and to evaluate their potential using in food industry, cosmetics and medicine.</p>

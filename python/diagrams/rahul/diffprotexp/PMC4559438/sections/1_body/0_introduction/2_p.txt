0: The pathogenesis of congenital cholesteatomas seems to be different from acquired cholesteatomas, which usually arise from the retraction pocket of the pars flaccida of tympanic membrane and have attic destruction [ 4,  5].
1: Several pathogenic mechanisms of congenital cholesteatoma have been suggested, including epithelial rests from faulty embryogenesis, invagination or implantation of squamous epithelium, and metaplasia of middle ear epithelium [ 6].
2: These suggested pathogenic mechanisms are based on temporal bone histology studies [ 7 12].
3: There have been several studies that investigated differences in molecular properties between congenital and acquired cholesteatomas.
4: Upregulation of P21, shorter telomere length, increased surviving expression, and absence of ICAM-1 expression and LFA-1 positive cells have all been suggested to play a role in congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.
5: Unfortunately, their exact roles have not been fully identified [ 3 5,  13].
6: These studies investigated several target proteins, but no reports have identified differences in molecular expression between congenital and acquired cholesteatoma by mass screening of proteins in each tissue, largely because of the lack of an ideal animal model and a limited number of specimens, which restricted basic molecular and biochemical research on congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.

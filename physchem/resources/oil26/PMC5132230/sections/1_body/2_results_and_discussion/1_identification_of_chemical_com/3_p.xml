However, a refined phytochemical screening of the EOs by GC-MS provide the chemical profile of the species, as well as contribute to the prediction of biological activities. According to Almeida et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166684.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], linalool and the &#948;- decalactone has proven anticonvulsant activity, which may indicate a potential use of EOs of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suaveolens</italic>.</p>

0: Skin tissue were lysed in 350 ml Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
1: Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).
2: cDNA was synthesized from 5 ng of RNA by using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Bio- systems, Foster City, CA, USA) following manufacturer protocols.
3: SYBR green assays were designed to span intron/exon boundaries.
4: Oligonucleotides were aligned against the mouse genome by Primer-BLAST ( http://www.NCBI.org) to ensure specificity.
5: Gene expression was assayed in triplicate using 1/40 of the cDNA template and 300 nM of forward and reverse primers in a 20 l Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reaction in a StepOne-Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
6: Gene expression was normalized to mouse GAPDH gene expression.
7: Relative expression values were calculated using the DDC t method (Pfaffl  2001).
8: Oligonucleotide primer sequences for HAS1, HAS3, and HYAL1,2 and KIAA1199 are listed in  Table 3.
9: Mouse HAS2 (Bio-Rad, qMmuCID0024398), and HYAL1 (Bio-Rad, qMmuCED0040215) primers were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratory.

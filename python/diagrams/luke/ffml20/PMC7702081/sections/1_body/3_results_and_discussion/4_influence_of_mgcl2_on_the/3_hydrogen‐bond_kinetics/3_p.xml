  <sub>HB</sub>

 <sub>2</sub> solution 
 <italic>with</italic> CIPs (Table S7 in ESI). Therefore, the presence of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl

 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl

  <sup>[80]</sup>

 </xref> Dissolved Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions have a long‐range effect, which goes beyond the first hydration shell. In comparison, the

 <sub>HB</sub>(

 <sup>−</sup> overlap with that of bulk water (Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B) suggesting that the chloride ion does not have short‐ or long‐range effects on the HB dynamics of water. The computed values of the HB relaxation time of the solvent molecules in the first (1.35 ps) and second (1.25) shell of chloride, and in the bulk of the solution (1.28 ps) confirm this observation (Table S7 in ESI). The different influence of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> on the HB dynamics of the surrounding water molecules should be linked to the hydration numbers of these two ions, which have estimated values of

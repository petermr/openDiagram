<p id="Par8">Through the comparative analysis of the ovarian tissues in two groups (H1 vs H3) and (H3 vs H8), log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 1.5 and FDR &lt; 0.05 were used as screening criteria. A total of 36,580 lncRNAs and 44,990 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) including novel coding regions were detected in the ovarian tissues of H1 vs H3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, 6716 mRNAs differed in expression, out of these, 3377 were up-regulated, while 3339 were down-regulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Similarly, 1972 lncRNAs were differentially expressed, 1093 were up-regulated, and 879 were down-regulated in H1 vs H3. Conversely, 72,882 genes did not differ in their expression in the H1 vs H3 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A total of 1280 mRNAs and 1413 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in H1 vs H8. In comparison with H3 and H8, a total of 36,549 lncRNAs were identified, out of these, 636 were differentially expressed (256 were up-regulated and 380 were down-regulated) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Also, 2903 out of 44,973 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the H3 vs H8 group. These consisted of 1736 up-regulated and 1167 down-regulated mRNAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There was no variation in the expression of 77,983 genes detected. Individually, DEGs identified among the nine samples (H1O1, H1O2, H1O3, H3O2, H3O3, H3O5, H8O1, H8O2 and H8O3) positively correlated with each group/sample (r = 0.85–0.99) (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>a,b). Comparatively, a total of 118 differentially expressed unique genes were identified simultaneously among the three pairwise groups (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>c; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). These consistently detected DEGs comprised 72 genes with known functions, whereas 46 are novel genes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). These unique DEGs may be screened further as potential candidate biomarkers for marker-assisted breeding applications.

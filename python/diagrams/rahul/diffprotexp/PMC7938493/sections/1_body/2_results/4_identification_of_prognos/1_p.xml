<p id="Par53">A total of 373 key differential RBPs were screened from the PPI network. To determine the association between RBPs and BLCA patients’ outcomes, univariable Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of these key differential RBPs which identified 19 hub RBPs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Subsequently, multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to further analyse these 19 RPBs which showed eight hub RBPs to be independent prognostic predictors in BLCA patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).

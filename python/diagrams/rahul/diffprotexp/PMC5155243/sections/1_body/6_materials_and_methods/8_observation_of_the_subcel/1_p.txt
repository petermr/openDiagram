0: HEK293 cells in logarithmic phase were inoculated into specific culture plates for laser scanning confocal microscopy at 2  10 5 cells/plate.
1: After being conventionally cultured for 24 h, the cells were stained with DU (0, 125, 250, and 500 M) for 24 h. The cells were fixed in 95% ethanol for 30 min.
2: Next, the ethanol was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS.
3: Mito-Tracker Green (Life Technologies Corporation; CA, USA) working solution was subsequently added at a final concentration of 50 nM, followed by incubation at 37 C for 30 min.
4: The Mito-Tracker Green working solution was then discarded, and the cells were washed twice with PBS.
5: The specific rabbit primary antibody diluted 1:200 (anti-ETHE1, Abcam) was subsequently added, followed by incubation at 37 C for 60 min.
6: After the cells had been washed twice with PBS, Cy3-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) diluted 1:500 was added, followed by incubation at 37 C for 30 min.
7: The cells nuclei were labelled with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies Corporation; CA, USA).
8: Finally, after cells had been washed with PBS 3 times, the subcellular localization of ETHE1 was observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS-SP5, Bensheim, Germany).

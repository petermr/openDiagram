An Upset plot is a Euler diagram that shows the intersection between multiple sets, and is a way to show intersection between more than 3 sets without using Venn diagram like overlapping shapes. In Upset plots lines indicate the intersection between sets, in this case pathway terms. We have introduced a description of Upset plots in Figure 3 and a &#8220;see Figure 3 for description of upset plots&#8221; note in the caption for Figure 4.</p>

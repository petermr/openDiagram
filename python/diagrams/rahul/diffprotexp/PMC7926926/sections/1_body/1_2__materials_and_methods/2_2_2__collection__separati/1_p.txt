0: The fruit-bodies of  S. luteus were searched in the masson pine forest by trampling.
1: The collected fruit-bodies were cleaned to get rid of any surface contamination.
2: The cleaned fruit-bodies were individually numbered and placed in a Ziplock bag, placed in an icebox, and brought back to the laboratory.
3: Young and tender fruit-bodies were selected for further experiment.
4: Separation work was carried out on an ultra-clean workbench.
5: The surface of the fruit-bodies was disinfected with 75% alcohol and rinse twice with sterile water.
6: The fruit-bodies were then transferred to Pachlewski medium and placed in an incubator for dark culture at 25 C with a 50% humidity level.
7: Hyphae were collected after appearance and cultured in a new medium until the strain was purified [ 46].
8: To confirm the purity, mycelium was collected from the outer surface and transferred to the Pachlewski medium.
9: Active mycelium was collected and transferred from the solid cultured colony to the Pachlewski medium and observed for ten days of cultivation.
10: The samples with no contamination were stored in the refrigerator at 4 C for later use [ 47].

0: Electrokinetic potential values of MWCNTs and the modified MWCNTs were measured in deionized water in the 310 pH range by means of LitesizerTM 500 Anton Paarat at room temperature.
1: Suspensions were prepared to get the particle concentration of 1 mg/mL.
2: The pH value of the investigated systems was adjusted with HCl and NaOH.
3: Before measurement, 30 min ultrasonic bath treatment (at 44 MHz) was applied.
4: The values of zeta potential presented in this paper represent the mean average of triplicate measurements.

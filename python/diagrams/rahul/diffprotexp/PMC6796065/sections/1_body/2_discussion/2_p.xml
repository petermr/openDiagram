<p id="Par11">If decreased DARPP-32/CaN expression ratio is the primary pathophysiological alteration in the patients with schizophrenia, that means that upregulation of CaN promotes the inactivation of DARPP-32

 </sup>. Decreased DARPP-32 activity induces a reduction in dopaminergic signaling in the PFC, which results in a so-called “hypofrontality” in schizophrenia. It is possible that a decrease in DARPP-32 expression in the PFC observed both in the current as well as in previous studies results, at least in part, from this process. On the contrary, it is of interest that the changes in CaN expression in the NAc evinced opposite tendencies in patients with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder. Since, upon the stimulation of dopamine D
 <sub>1</sub> receptor, CaN inactivates DARPP-32 by dephosphorylation, it can be concluded that CaN exerts a buffering action against excessive dopamine signaling. It is probable that variations in CaN expression may reflect different dopaminergic pathologies between these two major psychiatric diseases.

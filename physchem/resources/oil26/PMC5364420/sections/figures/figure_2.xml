 <p> Protection effects of the essential oil from C. rotundus rhizomes on DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe 2+ and AAPH. Lane 1, the native DNA; lane 2, the DNA treated with Fe 2+/AAPH; lane3, the DNA treated with Fe 2+/AAPH and solvent; lane 4–9, the DNA treated with the essential oil. Different lowercase letters indicate statistically significant differences between the means ( p &lt; 0.05) for essential oil of different concentration. Different capital letters indicate statistically significant differences between the means of DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe 2+ and AAPH ( p &lt; 0.05) for essential oil at the same concentration. </p>)

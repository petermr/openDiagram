<p id="Par3">Previous studies demonstrate that circular RNA played a certain role in autophagy. At present, no systematic and in-depth study exists on the function and potential mechanisms of circular RNA in autophagy. Therefore, Torin 1-induced autophagy and sequencing were used in this study to explore the expression pattern of circular RNA in autophagy in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells. The study also investigated the function and potential mechanism of circular RNA in autophagy.</p>

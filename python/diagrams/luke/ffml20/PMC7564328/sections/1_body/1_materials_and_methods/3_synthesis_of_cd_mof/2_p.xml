 </xref>. In a nutshell, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-CD (64.8 g) and KOH (22.4 g) were dissolved in purified water (2000 mL) with a molar ratio of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-CD to KOH of 1:8. After adding methanol (1200 mL), the reaction mixture was kept in water bath (60 °C) until a clear solution was obtained. PEG 20,000 (12.8 g) was added, conducing to the rapid sedimentation of crystalline particles after further heating the solution for 20 min. The suspension liquid was incubated in ice water overnight, then the CD-MOF crystals were harvested by centrifugation (2826×
 <italic>g</italic>, 3 min) and washed with anhydrous ethanol (4% acetic acid) to neutralize the alkaline CD-MOF. Finally, CD-MOF was washed with methanol till reaching a pH about 6.5–7.5, and then dried at 60 °C for 5 h to obtain white powders of cubic crystal particles.

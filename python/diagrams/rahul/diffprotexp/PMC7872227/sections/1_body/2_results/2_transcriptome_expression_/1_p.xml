<p>Items that were significantly enriched in the GO analyses were screened out. It was found that the functional proteins involved in the process of gene expression (GO: 0010467) were enhanced fundamentally in the absence of ammonium and urea (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g007">7</xref>). Since transcription was one of the most basic and direct processes in gene expression, the process of gene expression might involve those functional proteins associated with transcriptional activity. After transcription, the genetic information of the mRNA would be expressed as functional proteins through the process of translation. According to the results of GO analyses, it was clear that the expression of functional proteins associated with translation (GO: 0006412) were significantly enhanced, together with the ribosome (GO: 0005840) which was the basic organelles of translation and closely related to translation. The expression of functional proteins of ribonucleoprotein complex and the structural constituents of ribosome (GO: 1990904, GO: 0003735) were similarly significantly enhanced (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g007">7</xref>), and the metabolic pathways of ribosomes showed significant enrichments in KEGG analyses too (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g008">8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g009">9</xref>). It was known that peptides were obtained after translation and before the formation of mature proteins. The expression of functional proteins related to peptide biosynthetic process (GO: 0043043) was also enhanced. Meanwhile, tRNAs were required to exercise their transport functions by activating and binding the corresponding amino acids during the translation process. Meanwhile, the tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation (GO: 0006418) and amino acid activation (GO: 0043038) of related proteins also showed significant enhancement of expression.

The normal human astrocytes were placed in 96-well culture plates (4 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well) and were treated with various concentrations of HR and SGR essential oils (0&#8211;3200&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) or LPS (1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) for 24&#8201;h. As a control was used the cells incubated in the culture medium, for 24&#8201;h. The MTT assay was carried out according to the previous study [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. All experiments were repeated three times.</p>

<p>Some data loggers failed, thereby reducing our sample size to 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 aardvarks for body temperature and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 9 aardvarks for activity data. We excluded body temperature and activity data recorded on capture days and for 2 days after capture attempts from all analyses. To account for differences in the sensitivity of individual activity loggers, each 5-min reading of activity was expressed as a percentage of the maximum activity reading (% of maximum) for each logger while implanted in a study animal (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">McFarland et al., 2013</xref>). For each aardvark over each 24-h period, we calculated the minimum, maximum, and amplitude (difference between maximum and minimum) of body temperature rhythm. To compare 24-h patterns of aardvark body temperature and activity during the hottest and coldest months of a drought year with a non-drought year, we calculated mean Â± SD of hourly body temperature and activity recordings averaged across all aardvarks over 4 months of interest, namely February 2013 (drought summer), August 2013 (winter following drought), February 2014 (non-drought summer), and August 2014 (winter following non-drought summer). We obtained air temperature at the time of emergence and at the time of return of each study aardvark per day (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 to 5), and averaged the air temperature coinciding with time of emergence and time of return between these aardvarks for each 24-h period.

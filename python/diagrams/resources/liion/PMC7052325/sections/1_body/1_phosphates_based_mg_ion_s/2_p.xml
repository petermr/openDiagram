<p>The earliest report on NASICON-type Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> conductor came from Ikeda in 1987, who studied the system of Mg-Zr-PO
 <sub>4</sub> in various molar ratios as Mg ion conductor using mechanochemical synthesis (Ikeda et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Among them, MgZr
 <sub>4</sub>(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>6</sub> (MZP) showed the highest conductivity of 2.9 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> and 6.1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 400 and 800°C, respectively. The Tubandt's method and the electron probe microanalysis were used to confirm the charge carrier to be Mg ions. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, the author simply claimed that the crystal structure of MZP similar to NaZr
 <sub>2</sub>(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>, resulted in the best conductivity relative to analogs with other ratios, while no further evidence was provided in the report.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00420-f002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the formation of the molten pool of the one side pouring mode. The process and dimensions are specified as follows: the melt is ejected on one roll through a nozzle, a strip shell forms along the roll surface, and the strip shell thickness is marked as 
 <italic>d</italic>, which has the same value as nozzle. The metal shell of this part is cooled by the roll (the metal-roll contact side) and the atmosphere around it (the metal-air contact side), nearly the same as melt spinning process. As the metal shell rolling down towards to the nip, it contacts to the other side roll, and the height to the nip from this location is marked as 
 <italic>h</italic>. The metal of this part is cooled by both of the rolls. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00420-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, 
 <italic>h</italic>, which is marked as 
 <italic>h
  <sub>a</sub>
 </italic>, depends on the metal shell thickness 
 <italic>d</italic> and the roll gap. We can get a larger value of 
 <italic>h</italic> with a smaller roll gap under a certain metal shell thickness 
 <italic>d</italic>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00420-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, a molten liquid level has formed, and 
 <italic>h</italic> here is marked as 
 <italic>h
  <sub>b</sub>
 </italic>, which is higher than 
 <italic>h
  <sub>a</sub>
 </italic> under the same metal shell thickness and roll gap, and can change independently. With the effect of roll pressure (i.e., roll separating force), a thin solidified strip forms and escapes from the roll nip. The total height of the molten pool is marked as 
 <italic>L</italic>.

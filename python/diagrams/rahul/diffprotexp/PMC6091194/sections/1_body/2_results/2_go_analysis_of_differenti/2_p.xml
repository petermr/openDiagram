<p id="Par52">From the 447 differentially expressed proteins, the GO annotations for cellular localization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), molecular function (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), and biological process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) of upregulated proteins on P3 relative to P14 and P30 show similar trends. Proteins located in organelles (72 and 65%, respectively), cytoplasm (56 and 51%, respectively), and membrane (34 and 30%, respectively) are the most highly expressed, whereas, as before, cilium (1 and 1%, respectively), vacuole (1 and 1%, respectively), and ribosome (2 and 2%, respectively) are the most lowly expressed. When observing up and downregulated proteins on P3 relative to P14 and P30, these proteins follow a similar trend of expression relative to cellular localization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), molecular function (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), and biological process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). In addition, there are no downregulated proteins on P3 relative to P14 involved in signaling or reproduction. The GO analysis for cellular localization, molecular function, and biological process of proteins up- and downregulated on P14 relative to P30 follows a similar trend when compared to the other age groups. However, GO analysis shows that downregulated proteins for cellular localization, molecular function, and biological process are significantly higher on P14 relative to P30. When observing molecular function of the most highly expressed proteins, 48% are involved in binding, 40% catalytic activity and 20% transporter activity. Among the downregulated proteins between all age groups, there are no proteins involved in immune system processes.

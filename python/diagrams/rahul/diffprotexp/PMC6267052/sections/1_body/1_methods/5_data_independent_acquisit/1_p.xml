<p id="Par18">The instrumental set-up for the DIA analysis was almost the same as for the DDA analysis with some exceptions. In the DIA analysis, a longer gradient of 135 min was used, which started with 3% solvent B for 5 min, then increased to 35% solvent B in 120 min and then went up to 95% solvent B in 5 min. It ended with 95% solvent B for 5 min. For the MS settings, the MS1 scan (390-1210 m/z) was set to have a resolution of 70,000, 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> automatic gain control (AGC) and 100 ms maximum ion injection time. This was followed by data-independent acquisition collision-induced dissociation MS2 scans at a resolution of 35,000, 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> automatic gain control (AGC) and 120 ms maximum ion injection time. A loop count of 32 was used in the range 400-1200 m/z. The isolation windows were 26.0 m/z wide including 0.5 Da overlap.

0: Confluent CaLu-3 cells were inoculated in triplicate with wild-type or ORF6 deletion strains at 0.2 MOI and incubated for 24 h at 36C with 5% CO 2.
1: For basal transcriptomic levels, a mock infection condition was also tested in triplicate.
2: Cellular RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, DE) after supernatant removal and cell lysis directly in the culture vessel.
3: Purified RNA was quantified with the Qubit RNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA).
4: Host gene expression was evaluated using an 87-gene panel (Supplementary Table 1) with NanoString technology.
5: Data treatment was performed using nSolver analysis software (version 4.0, NanoString Technologies).
6: To normalize for differences in RNA input we used the geometric means over four housekeeping genes ( DECR1, HPRT1,  RPL19, and  RPLP0).

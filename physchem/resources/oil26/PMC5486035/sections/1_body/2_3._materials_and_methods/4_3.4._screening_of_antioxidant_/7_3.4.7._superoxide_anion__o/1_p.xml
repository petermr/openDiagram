<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The superoxide anion scavenging activity of the sample was determined according to Barreca et al. [<xref rid="B23-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The reaction mix was composed of 1.0 mL of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) solution (156 &#956;M NBT in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), 1.0 mL of &#946;-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) solution (468 &#956;M in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), and 20 &#181;L of sample solution (range 60&#8211;3.75 &#181;g/mL). The reaction was started by adding 100 &#956;L phenazine methosulphate (PMS) solution (60 &#956;M PMS in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) to the mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 &#176;C for 5 min, and absorbance at 560 nm was measured against blank samples with a Varian Cary 50 UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).</p>

<p>Immune cell responses and particularly myeloid cells are altered under the immunosuppressed conditions that are normally used in murine models of IPA [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For this reason and in order to see the intact role of TREM1 in response to 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection we used from now on a non-immunosuppressed infection model. Lung preparations from 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>−/−</sup> and 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>+/+</sup> mice were analyzed on 2, 3 and 5 dpi. Innate immune response was evaluated by the presence of granulocytes (Gr-1+ CD11b+) and monocytes (Gr-1-CD11b+) (

 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> instillation induced an important amount of both populations after 2 dpi. In the case of 
 <italic>Trem1</italic>
 <sup>−/-</sup> infected mice, granulocytes and monocytes were strongly diminished in comparison with infected WT mice. No significant differences were observed in alveolar macrophage numbers in either strains (data not shown). Lymphocyte recruitment was determined by the presence of CD3+ (T-lymphocytes), and CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ (B-lymphocytes) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4c</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4d</xref>). A rapid recruitment of lymphocytes was detected after 2 dpi on WT mice. In the case of 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>−/-</sup> infected mice, minimal levels of CD3+ and CD19+ cells were detected at 2 dpi and a delayed lymphocytic response was detected from 3 dpi.

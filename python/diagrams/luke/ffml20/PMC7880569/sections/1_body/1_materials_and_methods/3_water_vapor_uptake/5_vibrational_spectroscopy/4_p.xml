<p>Water vapor adsorption and desorption experiments were carried out by exposing the resulting mineral film to 0.4–95% RH in the reaction cell at 25 ± 1 °C. A 250 mL/min flow of water vapor of controlled pressure was first generated by mixing predetermined proportions of humid N
 <sub>2</sub>(g) and dry N
 <sub>2</sub>(g) using a humidity generator module (proUmid MHG32). Water vapor pressures were continuously monitored by a sensor equipped with the module and a nondispersible infraRed device (LI-7000, Licor Inc). A separate deuteration exchange experiment (

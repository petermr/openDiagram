 <caption> Differential expression of stage-specific germ cells with or without DEHP treatment. (A) Volcano plots of germ cells with three developmental stages. The left panel illustrates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of germ cells at the pre-stage of PF formation with or without DEHP treatment for PD0 and PD3, respectively. The middle and right panels refer to pre- and late-stage. (B) Venn plots of germ cells with three developmental stages. The light green and violet red circles represent the number of DEGs at PD0 and PD3. (C-D) GO terms of key DEGs at early- (C) and late-stages (D) of PF formation. </caption>

<p>In order to identify mutations of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators, cBioPortal for Cancer Genomic was used (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>, mutation and amplification were frequently seen in m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators. 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic>, 
 <italic>NSUN5</italic>, and 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> showed relatively higher copy number amplification. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, we also found that there are many types of mutations in m
 <sup>5</sup>C RNA methylation regulators, such as inframe mutation, missense mutation, amplification, and deep deletion. Among them, amplification has the largest proportion of types, and deep deletion also accounts for a large proportion. Overall, about 13% of the samples (246/1,924) had genetic changes, and the mutation rate of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators was relatively higher in esophagus and stomach cancers than in other cancer types. Furthermore, 28% (52/186) of EC, 8% (14/186) of PC, 19% (91/478) of stomach cancer, 5% (33/640) of colorectal cancer, 13% (56/442) of liver cancer, and 12% (234/1,928) of GI cancer had genomic changes of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators. Notably, the mutation frequencies of 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> in esophagus and stomach cancers, 
 <italic>NSUN3</italic> in esophagus cancer, and 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> in liver cancer were particularly high. Changes in protein structure were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>. Mutation in protein sequence was more often found in 
 <italic>NSUN1</italic> and 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> than in other genes.

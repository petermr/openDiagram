<p id="Par51">In addition to specific cellular stresses, elevated ISR signaling components have been implicated in early pregnancy disorders characterized by placental abnormalities. For example, phosphorylated eIF2α, ATF4 protein, and/or CHOP protein were elevated in placental tissue obtained from pre-eclamptic pregnancies compared with normal pregnancies (Du et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>; Fu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>). Another study reported mRNA expression suppression of an ATF4-mediated placental growth factor (
 <italic>PlGF</italic>) in placentae from women diagnosed with early-onset pre-eclampsia and confirmed those results using two trophoblast cell lines (Mizuuchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2016</xref>). Furthermore, prolonged eIF2α phosphorylation decreased proliferation and invasion of trophoblast cell lines in vitro (Yung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2008</xref>), a defining pathological characteristic of IUGR and pre-eclampsia (Brosens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1972</xref>; Caniggia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>; Kadyrov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>; Meekins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1994</xref>). Consequently, ISR activation in trophoblasts, as modeled here by HTR-8/SVneo cells, maybe a mechanism by which the TCE metabolite DCVC contributes to placental dysfunction.

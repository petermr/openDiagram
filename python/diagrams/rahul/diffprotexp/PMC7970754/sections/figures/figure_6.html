 <caption> POLD1 rescue experiment (A) Immunofluorescence of POLD1 transfected with lentivirus. (B) POLD1 protein expression after transfection (control and POLD1-NC: * P=0.035, POLD1-NC and POLD1-OE: * P=0.048). (C) Gene expression of POLD1 after transfection (control and POLD1-NC: ** P=0.007, POLD1-NC and POLD1-OE: ** P=0.007). (D) Apoptosis indicators of breast cancer cells after transfection (POLD1:*** P&lt;0.001, PARP1: control and RSV+POLD1-OE: ** P=0.004, RSV and RSV+POLD1-OE: ** P=0.001, Cleaved PARP1/Full Length PARP1: *** P&lt;0.001, PCNA: ** P=0.004, BCL-2:control and RSV: ** P=0.001, RSV and RSV+POLD1-OE: ** P=0.006, Cleaved Caspased 3: ** P=0.003),. (E) CCK8 detection of resveratrol treated breast cancer cell survival after transfection (** P=0.001, *** P&lt;0.001). (F) Flow cytometry detection of resveratrol-treated apoptosis of breast cancer cells after transfection (on the two-parameter scatter diagram of flow cytometry, the lower left quadrant represents living cells; the upper left quadrant represents necrotic cells; the lower right quadrant represents apoptotic cells (late apoptotic cells), and the upper right quadrant represents early apoptotic cells). </caption>

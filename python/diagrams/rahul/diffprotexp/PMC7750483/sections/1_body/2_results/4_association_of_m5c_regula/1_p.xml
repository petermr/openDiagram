<p>We investigated the association of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulator expression with gender (male and female), cancer status (tumor and normal), tumor grade (G1, G2, and G3), and pathological stage (stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV) as shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The results showed that the overall expression of m
 <sup>5</sup>C writers was significantly associated with pathological stage and tumor differentiation grade and the expression of m
 <sup>5</sup>C reader was significantly associated with gender, cancer status, and pathological stage. The association of respective m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulator with these parameters is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. The expression of 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> and 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic> was significantly higher in female than in male patients. The level of 
 <italic>NSUN3</italic> and 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic> was increased in tumor samples, whereas the level of 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic>, 
 <italic>NSUN5</italic>, and 
 <italic>NSUN7</italic> was decreased in tumor samples. For tumor grade, all m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators gradually increased from G1 to G3 except 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic>, which showed an opposite trend of expression. Similar to the result for tumor grade, the expression of all m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators was elevated from pathological stage I to IV, except for 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic> whose expression was lowered. We also performed the same analysis of the nine m
 <sup>5</sup>C writers and readers in different types of GI cancer and liver cancer separately (

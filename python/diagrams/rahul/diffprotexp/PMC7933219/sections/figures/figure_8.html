 <caption> MiR-124-3p targeted PRKAA2 3’UTR in HEK 293T cells. pcDNA3.1(-)-miR124-3p was co-transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing pGL3-PRKAA2-3’UTR-WT or pGL3-PRKAA2-3’UTR-MUT in 293T cells; Firefly luciferase activity for each construct was normalized to the co-transfected Renilla luciferase construct presented miRNA-124-3p-NC transfected group. The data are presented as the means ± SD ( n = 3, *** P &lt; 0.001, PRKAA2-3’UTR-WT + miR-124-3p vs. PRKAA2-3’UTR-WT + miR-124-3p-NC). </caption>

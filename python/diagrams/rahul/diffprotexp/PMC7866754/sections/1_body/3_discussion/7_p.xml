<p id="Par62">In summary, the novel ORFs in oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites were identified through proteogenomics analysis, which allowed analysis on transcription and translation events outside the coding sequences that are annotated using conventional criteria. Combining analyses of differential expression, GO term enrichment and predicted structures, this work has shown that some of these nORFs may play a role in the parasite invasion and expression control. Therefore, they are interesting targets for further experimental validation on their existence and functional roles.</p>

<p id="Par19">Metabolic analysis of the flower buds of sterile and restorer lines of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS near-isogenic lines identified 699 metabolites, including 88 amino acids derivatives, 71 phenylpropanoids, 17 alcohols, 10 polyphenols, 26 phenol amides, 57 nucleotide derivatives, 8 anthocyanins, 41 flavones, 25 flavonols, 17 flavonoids, 14 flavanones, three quinones, 32 alkaloids, 21 carbohydrates, 17 terpenes, 3 vitamins and derivatives, four isoflavone, 8 indole derivatives, 110 organic acids and derivatives, one proanthocyanidin, six steroids, 65 lipids, and 35 others (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the abundance of the metabolites in the flower buds of sterile and restorer lines of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS changed tremendously, and the sterile and fertile were well separated, with the largest reaching 23.39% and the groups reaching 36.36% (Fig.

<p id="Par36">Protein–protein interaction analysis was performed on the differentially expressed proteins using STRING online software. From this analysis 24 of the 32 differentially expressed proteins were identified, and the results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The overall set of differentially expressed proteins is divided into three sections, and the albumin (ALB) protein connects these three sections. The ALB protein is involved in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As a node of the regulatory network, it may play an important role in the virus infection process. Moreover, the proteins essentially interact with each other. The proteins ATP5FB, MDH2, ECHS1, and HSPA1L are located in the key site of the network and play crucial roles in the difference in virulence between H5N1 and H9N2.

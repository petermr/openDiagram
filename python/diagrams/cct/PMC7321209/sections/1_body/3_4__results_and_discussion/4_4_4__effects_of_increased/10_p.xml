<p>The cross sections of the 35th layer show a microstructural composition of coarse-grained ferrite with embedded globular bainite for a CTWD of 12 mm. An increased CTWD of 44 mm led to a reduced grain size. This correlated to the decreased energy input per unit length (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and reduced t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times in the center of the structure (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f013">Figure 13</xref>). Furthermore, a periodical reheating of the bead throughout the following layers enhanced grain growth. In the 70th layer a bainitic-ferritic structure is visible, independently from the adjusted CTWD. This corresponds to the state of the art [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The fine grained microstructure can be explained by a lack of post-weld heat treatment in the last layer of the WAAM process. Further heat input throughout a following layer is not present.

<p>Results are presented as means ± SEM (standard error of the mean). Statistical analysis was performed using 
 <italic>GraphPad Prism</italic> 8 software. Normality was tested with the 
 <italic>Kolmogorov–Smirnov</italic> test. Depending on the result of the normality test, an unpaired Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test or an unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test with 
 <italic>Welch’s</italic> correction (when equal variance was not assumed) was used. Moreover, we performed an animal experimentation sample size calculation to estimate the number of animals required to attain statistical significance. Significant differences are indicated for 
 <italic>p</italic>-values of &lt;0.05, &lt;0.01, or &lt;0.001. All qRT-PCR and western blotting experiments were performed in triplicates.

0: The DNA modifications include C5-methylcytosine (5mC), N6-methyladenine (6mA), and N4-methylcytosine (4mC) [ 5].
1: There are some other DNA modifications as the O6-methylguanine (O6-mG), N7-methylguanine (7mG) or N3-methyladenine (N3mA) that are believed to be cause by endogenous and/or environmental alkylating agents [ 6] and are emerging as important markers with adverse effects.
2: 5mC methylation is the most abundant and studied.
3: As mentioned, in plants, the 5mC presence ranges from 5 to 30% depending on the species [ 7], while others, as the 6mA levels are less than 0.8% in eukaryotes and in  Arabidopsis has been reported as less than 0.2% [ 5].
4: In plants, the 5mC DNA methylation exists in three different sequence contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH.
5: The CG context takes place in dinucleotides C and G, and it is called symmetrical context.
6: For the CHG and CHH contexts, the H can be any base as A, T, or C [ 8, 9].
7: The accumulation of DNA methylation in all contexts results in chromatin condensation and, therefore, gene silencing [ 8].

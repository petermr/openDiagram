<p id="Par44">We excluded samples from four patients due to non-European ancestry (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The final dataset included low-grade and high-grade cartilage samples each from 99 patients, with 4801 proteins was observed in ≥30% of samples, and 1677 proteins in all samples, in line with the resolution depth of the isobaric labelling method employed. To account for protein loading, abundance values were normalised by the sum of all protein abundances in a given sample, then log2-transformed and quantile normalised.

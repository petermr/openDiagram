<p id="Par18">We also observed isoform switches in the AD causal gene APP with possible functional consequences in neuronal cells. While two APP isoforms were downregulated (ENST00000348990 and ENST00000354192), the isoforms ENST00000346798 and ENST00000357903 were upregulated in Mayo and MSBB datasets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>). Noteworthy, significantly downregulated APP isoforms lack exon 7, which contains the Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) domain. KPI is one of the main serine protease inhibitors and increased KPI( + )APP mRNA and protein expression levels have been described in AD brains and are associated with increased amyloid-beta deposition

 </sup>. At the exception of ENST00000354192, the other transcripts are mostly expressed in neurons (Marques-Coelho and Costa, unpublished data), indicating that these cells may have a selective increase in the expression of KPI(+)APP and, consequently, enhanced production of Aβ1–42.

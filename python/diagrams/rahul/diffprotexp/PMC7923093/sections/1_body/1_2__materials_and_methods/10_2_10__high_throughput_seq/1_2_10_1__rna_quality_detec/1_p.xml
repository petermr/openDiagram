<p>The total amount of extracted RNA sample was above 50.70 µg and the A260/A280 values of RNA were between 2.08 and 2.13. The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values of samples were between 7.8 and 9.6 and the 28S/18S between 0.7 and 1.7 (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). This was in line with further high-throughput sequencing requirements.</p>

0: In vitro transcription sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (IVT-SAPAS) libraries were constructed at different time points after 1 h, 4 h, 7 h, 10 h, 13 h, 16 h and 19 h post-infection.
1: To explore the dynamic gene regulation of IPEC-J2 cells after PEDV infection, we introduced SAPAS methods combined with in vitro transcription (IVT) and magnetic beads purification to analyze the polyadenylation pattern and expression profile [ 16].

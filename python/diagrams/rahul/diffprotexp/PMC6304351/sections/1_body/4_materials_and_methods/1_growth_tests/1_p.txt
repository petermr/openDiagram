0: Microcosms were established to determine the alkane substrate range of  T. oleivorans in sterile 40 ml vials with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) lined silicon septa containing 20 ml of ONR7a media ( Dyksterhouse et al., 1995).
1: Triplicate single-substrate microcosms were inoculated with  T. oleivorans MIL-1 (DSM 14913) and enriched separately with the following alkanes at a final concentration of 0.1% w/v:  n-alkanes: decane ( n-C 10), dodecane ( n-C 12), hexadecane ( n-C 16), eicosane ( n-C 20), tetracosane ( n-C 24), octacosane ( n-C 28), and dotriacontane ( n-C 32) (Sigma-Aldrich) or the branched alkane pristane (Sigma-Aldrich).
2: Microcosms were incubated in an orbital shaker (20C, 60 rpm) for 21 days with the optical density (OD 600) measured using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer.
3: Alkane degradation was measured at day 21 by GC-MS as previously described ( McKew et al., 2007b).

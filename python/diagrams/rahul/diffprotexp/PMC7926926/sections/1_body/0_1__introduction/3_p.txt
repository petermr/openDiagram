0: The continuous decline in forest population is mainly attributed to soil acidification, resulting from air pollution and intensive fertilizer applications.
1: Moreover, nutrient depletion coupled with an accumulation of toxic elements also causes adverse effects on the forest population.
2: The acidification of soils associated to an increased level of Aluminum (Al), causes a substantial reduction in plant growth by inhibiting root development [ 15, 16], water uptake [ 17, 18], and translocation of nutrients [ 19, 20].
3: A controlled inoculation of ectomycorrhizal fungi is a useful approach for enhancing the performance of out-planted seedlings [ 7, 21].
4: Previous reports showed enhanced fitness in different  Pinus species against toxic concentrations of heavy metals under mycorrhizal fungus inoculation [ 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].
5: Suillus luteus, an ectomycorrhizal fungus, is considered a symbiotic solution for heavy-metal toxicities, including Al 3+ stress [ 27, 28, 29, 30].
6: Another study described the positive growth regulation of  P. massoniana under the inoculation of the mycorrhizal fungus,  Pisolithus tinctorius [ 31].

<p>Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were collected by incubation (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37°C for 1 h) with 2 ml cellular lysis buffer (8 M urea, 30 mM HEPES, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM DTT). Ultrasonic processing (pulse on for 2 sec, pulse off for 3 sec; power, 180 W) of this solution was then performed using an ultrasonic processor and centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at −80°C until use. For each sample, proteins were precipitated with ice-cold acetone prior to being redissolved in dissolution buffer (50% TEAB and 0.1% SDS). The proteins were quantified by the Bradford protein assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Subsequently, 100 mg protein was tryptically digested and the resultant peptide mixture was labeled using the iTRAQ reagent (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The protein solution was further digested with sequence-grade modified trypsin. For labeling, each iTRAQ reagent was dissolved in 70 µl isopropanol and added to the respective peptide mixture. Protein samples were labeled with iTRAQ isobaric tags: 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119 and 121.

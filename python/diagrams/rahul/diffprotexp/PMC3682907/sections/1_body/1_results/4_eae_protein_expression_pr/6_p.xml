<p>Principal component analysis of fraction Q2 with a LMW acquisition protocol (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) shows a clear discrimination of EAE stage 3 samples from controls + EAE stage 1 samples. Hierarchical clustering analysis also clusters the EAE stage 1 (E1) sample with controls rather with the more advanced EAE disease samples (E2 – E5). The possibility that some protein fractions might be able to discriminate early from advanced EAE disease is interesting. However, with only one early stage EAE sample, this clustering may not be significant. In all cases, the first three principal components account for most (&gt;80%) of the variation in the data, indicating that much of the structure in the dataset can be represented by a relatively low dimensionality analysis.

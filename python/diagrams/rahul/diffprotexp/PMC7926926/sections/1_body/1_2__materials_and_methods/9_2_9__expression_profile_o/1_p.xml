<p>Expression profiles of genes governing differentially expressed proteins were estimated using Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Genes related to Al-responsive proteins were identified and selected, and specific primers for qRT-PCR, corresponding to the identified genes, were designed using Oligo 7 software (

RNA was extracted from masson pine needles using Tiangen RNAprep Pure Plant kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). A list of primers for the nine genes is presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(a</xref>) shows the results of a typical assay. The bacterial autoaggregation was strictly dependent on the expression of the AAF-encoding gene clusters as judged by complete absence of sedimentation for the negative control, for which the OD
 <sub>600</sub> slightly increased, as expected (compare AAF/I, AAF/III, AAF/IV, and AAF/V to vector control in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(a</xref>)). Amongst the AAF variants, AAF/I and AAF/V mediated reproducibly the fastest sedimentation with a comparable rate, followed by AAF/III, which lagged until t = 20 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(b</xref>)). Of all tested fimbrial variants, expression of AAF/IV resulted in the slowest bacterial sedimentation and did so significantly until t = 30 min (p &lt; 0.001). After 60 min, no further significant drop in OD
 <sub>600</sub> was observable.

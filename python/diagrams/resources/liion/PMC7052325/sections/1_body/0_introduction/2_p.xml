<p>Therefore, next generation advanced rechargeable batteries, such as multivalent metal (Mg, Ca, Al etc.) batteries, have aroused much interest due to high energy density in theory (Aurbach et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Yoo et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Among them, rechargeable Mg batteries are considered as the most promising battery technology because of the highest theoretical volumetric energy density of Mg anode (3,866 mAh cm
 <sup>−3</sup>), surpassing that of Li anode (2,066 mAh cm
 <sup>−3</sup>) (Aurbach et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Bucur et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While Li metal reacts violently with water, the reaction between Mg and water is much more stable because of the passive Mg hydroxide/oxide film formed on the surface. In addition, there is no dendrite formed for Mg anode during the reversible plating/stripping process. These advantages endow Mg anode high safety compared to Li anode (Aurbach et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In addition, Mg is more abundant relative to Li in earth crust.

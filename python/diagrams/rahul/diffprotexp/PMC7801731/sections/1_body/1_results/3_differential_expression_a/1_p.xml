<p id="Par12">Mapped reads against the reference transcriptome encompassed &gt; 90% of the total reads used for the analysis (see supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref> online). A total of 8460 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were found significant (adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05) at day 1 of regeneration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Upregulated transcripts (Log2 Fold Change ≥ 2) comprised 3585, while downregulated (Log2 Fold Change ≤  − 2) were 4875. On day 3 of regeneration, the total number of transcripts with differential expression was 8216, of these 3663 were upregulated and 4553 downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). When both days 1 and 3 regenerating intestines were compared to controls, a total of 3884 transcripts were differentially co-expressed on both days; 1723 were upregulated and 2161 downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).

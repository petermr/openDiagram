0: Cells seeded in coverslips in the presence or absence of 5 mM L-Tyr or 2.5 g/mL 5-Brd-2-dU were fixed with 4% ( m/ v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.3% ( v/ v) Triton X-100 and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Dallas, TX, USA): anti-Cdk2 (sc-163), anti-Cdk4 (sc-260), anti-cyclin D1 (sc-717), anti-p21 (sc-756), anti-TRP1 (sc-25543), anti-Dct (sc-25544), anti-Tyrosinase-Tyr (sc-15341) or anti-MITF (sc-11002), the latter made in goat.
1: To detect H3K9me3, we used a polyclonal antibody made in rabbits (ab8898) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), in all cases, final concentration of primary antibody was 0.4 g/mL.
2: As a secondary antibody, we used a CFL-647-labeled goat anti-rabbit (sc-362292) (Santa Cruz), and for H3K9me3 and MITF, a CFL-488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (sc-362262) and a chicken-marked anti-goat marked with Texas Red (sc-3923), respectively, both from (Santa Cruz) with concentrations and incubation times following manufacturers recommendations (0.4 g/mL).
3: After nuclei labeled with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma-Aldrich) and the coverslips mounted on 25% ( v/ v) glycerol (Merck), we acquired the images under an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Kobe, Japan) in a bright field and with the filter corresponding to the used fluorophores.
4: We quantified the mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) and calculated the apparent cell area from the bright-field photographs after defining each cells perimeter on the NIS-Elements program.

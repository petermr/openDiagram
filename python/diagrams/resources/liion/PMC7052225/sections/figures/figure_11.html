 <caption> Long cycling experiments performed at a constant charge/discharge current of C/2 between 1.2 and 2.5 V versus Li/Li +. Two LTO electrodes, one composed of VGCF–COOH (▪) and the other of a mixture of VGCF–COOH and CNT–COOH ( ), are compared. Full and empty characters represent charges and discharges, respectively. </caption>

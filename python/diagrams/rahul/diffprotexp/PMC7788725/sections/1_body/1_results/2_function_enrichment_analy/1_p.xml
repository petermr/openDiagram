<p id="Par34">We, respectively, intersected the different binding genes across the selected 3 group samples (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2A). Venn diagram indicated the intersection between the control and the DCM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Then, the unique genes were chosen to perform GO and pathway analysis with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. For the binding between LMNA and euchromatin (MACS), the enrichment results of control group (MACS) in GO biological process (BP) analysis showed that signal transduction and positive regulation of gene expression were involved (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). As to DAVID pathway analysis, some signaling pathways including WNT signaling pathway, FAS signaling pathway (CD95), and TNFR1 signaling pathway were found (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). However, we could not obtain the enrichment results from the limited 15 unique genes in DCM (MACS).

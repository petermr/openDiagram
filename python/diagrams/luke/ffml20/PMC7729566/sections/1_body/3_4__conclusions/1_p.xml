<p>The phase diagram of the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH + H
 <sub>2</sub>O system is studied here for the first time, it being shown that the system presents an unusual “type 0” closed phase diagram and an LCST type behavior. MD simulations of the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system indicate that the formation of the biphasic regime is due to a “washing-out” phenomenon upon addition of water, driven by water nanostructuring ultimately resulting in solvophobic segregation of the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl with acetic acid. This behavior is markedly different from conventional IL-salt, polymer-IL or even IL-inorganic acid aqueous biphasic system [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system, in the absence of additional water, presents a good solubility for CoO as well as for Nd
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. UV–vis analyses indicate varied metal speciation in the mixture from anionic chlorometallate complexes for Co(II) and Fe(III), acetate Nd(III) specie to more complex speciation in the case of Ni(II).

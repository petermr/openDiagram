<p>First, we apologize that the description of our dissection methods was not specific enough and have clarified the Materials and methods text in the revised manuscript (see below). We have also made clear in the Discussion that some subpallial tissues may have been collected in addition to cortex at the youngest age examined, and that this difference in approach may drive some aspects of the differential expression signature (see text below). Finally, we clarify that our strategy at E12.5 was to collect mainly dorsal telencephalon/pallium, but that our approach likely also captured some ventral telencephalon/sub-pallial structures as well as superficial tissue.</p>

0: SEM, TEM characterizations, in combination with tensile tests, provided an intriguing observation that ultra-high-strength and good ductility could be achieved simultaneously by changing the ratio of large and small precipitates in high-carbon steel (1.0C-1.5Cr-0.31Mn-0.20Si, wt %).
1: The high yield strength of 670 MPa, tensile-stress of 740 MPa, and good ductility (elongation of 26%) were obtained by adopting spheroidization annealing, cold rolling, recrystallization annealing, and cold drawing.
2: This led to nanosized precipitates with a large ratio of big size to the small size of 0.28, promoting high dislocation storage of 1.39  10  14 m  2.
3: In addition, the finite element (FE) method was used to simulate the cold-rolling process, and the largest stress and strain were 830 MPa and 0.6 at a depth of 3 mm after the fourth pass of the 0.10C-1.50Cr steel, respectively.
4: The stress and strain accumulation in the top layer was potentially caused by severe plastic deformation, as well as attrition rendered by the rollers.
5: This explained the emergence of dense low-angle grain boundaries in the region close to the surface of the cold rolled steel.

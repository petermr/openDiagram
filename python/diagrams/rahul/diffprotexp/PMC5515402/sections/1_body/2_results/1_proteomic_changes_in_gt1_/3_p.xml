 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180409.t002">2</xref> show overexpressed and underexpressed protein spots and their correspondent proteins that were differentially regulated after treatment with AAS. From those 23 recognized spots, 17 different proteins were identified. Two to four proteins were detected per protein spot collected. Top protein hits with the best Mascot scores were selected for validation as having major contribution to DIGE abundance data. UniProt database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>) revealed that differentially expressed proteins after AAS treatment are related to cellular metabolism, cell cycle, cell motility, stress response, drug detoxification, as well as protein and nucleotide processing or binding (

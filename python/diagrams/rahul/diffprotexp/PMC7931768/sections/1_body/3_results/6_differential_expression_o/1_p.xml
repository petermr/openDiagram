<p>Given the robust differential IFN gene signature in CLE skin, we explored whether expression of IFN genes in blood would discriminate between participants with CLE and HVs. For this analysis, we used an abbreviated 22-gene IFN signature
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> to measure the gene expression in paired blood-derived and skin tape-derived RNA samples from five participants with CLE (

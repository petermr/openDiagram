<p id="Par38">Time-dependent differential gene expression was further investigated by evaluating temporal patterns in the regulation of gene expression. When grouped by chronological expression patterns, the majority of genes with a logFC magnitude &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3], fit into one of the four different groups consisting of early and late responders: that is, differential expression (up or downregulated) at one time point and unchanged expression at the other time point. Each of these groups contained &gt; 100 genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These results indicate a pattern of nonlinearity in gene expression over time. Furthermore, the no change → upregulated groups were enriched for the ATF4 transcription factor for both 10 µM (enriched odds ratio: 26, FDR = 6.51 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>) and 20 µM DCVC (enriched odds ratio: 23, FDR = 2.84 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>). Additionally, the no change → downregulated group for 20 µM was enriched for two transcription factors and one histone modification that regulate gene expression during embryonic development: transcription factors PAX6 (enriched odds ratio: 8, FDR = 1.28 × 10
 <sup>–2</sup>) and SMAD3 (enriched odds ratio: 7, FDR = 1.54 × 10
 <sup>–2</sup>), and histone tri-methylation site H3K27me3 (enriched odds ratio: 23, FDR = 1.18 × 10
 <sup>–10</sup>). The other 4 groups consisting of temporary and consistent responders-genes with expression logFC magnitude &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3], at both 6 and 12 h (up and/or down-regulated)—each contained &lt; 50 genes with no enrichment for specific regulation of gene expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref> illustrate the first three cyclic CV curves of the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich composites. In the first cathodic scan, the CV curves of the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens and the 3D flower-like composites exhibited two significant reduction peaks at ~0.88 and 0.26 V. The reduction peak at 0.88 V was derived from the formation of Li
 <sub>x</sub>MoS
 <sub>2</sub> after lithium ions were inserted into (002) plane of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), while the other peak at 0.26 V was induced by the conversion of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> into Mo and Li
 <sub>2</sub>S. The anodic scan peak around 2.39 V reflected the reaction of Li
 <sub>2</sub>S into Li
 <sup>+</sup> and S. Over the next two cycles, both CV curves displayed an additional reduction peak near 1.86 V. This additional reduction peak was mainly attributed to the formation of gelatinous polymeric layers (Du et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The electrochemical reaction mechanism of each peak was written as (Wang Z. et al.,

0: Therefore, next generation advanced rechargeable batteries, such as multivalent metal (Mg, Ca, Al etc.)
1: batteries, have aroused much interest due to high energy density in theory (Aurbach et al.,  2000,  2007; Yoo et al.,  2013; Wang et al.,  2019).
2: Among them, rechargeable Mg batteries are considered as the most promising battery technology because of the highest theoretical volumetric energy density of Mg anode (3,866 mAh cm 3), surpassing that of Li anode (2,066 mAh cm 3) (Aurbach et al.,  2000; Bucur et al.,  2015).
3: While Li metal reacts violently with water, the reaction between Mg and water is much more stable because of the passive Mg hydroxide/oxide film formed on the surface.
4: In addition, there is no dendrite formed for Mg anode during the reversible plating/stripping process.
5: These advantages endow Mg anode high safety compared to Li anode (Aurbach et al.,  2001).
6: In addition, Mg is more abundant relative to Li in earth crust.

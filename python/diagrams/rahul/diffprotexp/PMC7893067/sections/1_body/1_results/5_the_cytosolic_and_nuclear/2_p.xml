<p id="Par16">A recent study by Lake et al
 <italic>.</italic> revealed a high concordance in the nuclear and whole-cell transcriptomes from mice when profiling cellular diversity using cell-type-specific marker gene expression signatures

 </sup>. We compared our list of significant cytosolic and nuclear transcripts obtained from all brain samples with the whole-cell and nuclear data from Lake et al
 <italic>.</italic> and found that our analysis resulted in a larger number of cytosolic/nuclear-localized genes (5201 compared to 1518 cytosolic genes, and 5548 compared to 791). This is likely due to the higher complexity and heterogeneity of samples used in our study. We also found that 65% of their cytosolic-accumulated and 45% nuclear-accumulated genes overlapped with our results (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">7</xref>). We investigated overlaps between our list of genes that demonstrated opposite differential expression patterns between the cytosol and nucleus (Supplementary Table 13 and 14) with the list of cell-type-specific genes from Lake et al. We found three cell-type specific markers: 
 <italic>Hsd17b10</italic> for Oligodendrocyte, 
 <italic>AK3</italic> for Astrocyte, and 
 <italic>Chrnb1</italic> for Endothelial cells which showed opposite differential expression patterns between the cytosol and the nucleus i.e. 
 <italic>Hsd17b10</italic> and 
 <italic>Chrnb1</italic> were upregulated in the fetal sample when using cyto–cyto analysis and upregulated in the adult sample when using the nuc–nuc analysis. Meanwhile, 
 <italic>AK3</italic> was upregulated in the adult sample when using cyto–cyto analysis and upregulated in the fetal sample when using the nuc–nuc analysis.

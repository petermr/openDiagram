<p>The conversion of pristanol to pristyl aldehyde could be catalysed by either the alcohol oxidase (ABO_1174; exclusively expressed on pristane) or alcohol dehydrogenase (ABO_0061; two‐fold up‐regulated on pristane), which utilize two different biological modes of alcohol dehydrogenation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Alcohol dehydrogenases are nicotinamide dependent, while alcohol oxidases are flavin dependent and generate hydrogen peroxide (Geissler and Hemmerich,

 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). Following terminal oxidation, the alcohols generated are normally oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde by means of alcohol dehydrogenases in bacteria, although alcohol oxidases have been reported in alkane degrading yeasts and moulds, for example,

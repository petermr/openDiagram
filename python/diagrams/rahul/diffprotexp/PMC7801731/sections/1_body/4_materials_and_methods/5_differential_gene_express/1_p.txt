0: The differential expression analysis was carried out with Salmon 79 applying the default parameters and using the quality filtered RNA-seq data and the assembled transcriptome generated with Trinity as reference.
1: Three samples of normal mesentery, 3 of day 1 regenerating intestine and 3 of day 3 regenerating intestine were used for the differential expression analysis.
2: Equivalence classes generated by Salmon were used to hierarchically cluster contigs by sequence similarity and expression using Corsetv1.06 80 with default settings and the parameterD 9 for all samples (9).
3: Lastly, DESeq2 tool package 81 was used to extract differentially expressed clusters of contigs from the read count files generated with Salmon.
4: Files with less than 30 read counts were filtered from every biological replicate of each sample.
5: Workflow used in the differential expression analysis can be found at  https://github.com/davidjquispe/DGE_Analysis.

<p>Adhesive properties of the different AAF variants were tested on HEp-2 cells (

 <sup>âˆ’</sup> expressing AAF/I, AAF/III, or AAF/V formed a similar pattern. The bacteria piled up to stacked bricks, which resembled the aggregative adherence (AA) pattern as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Notably, expression of the AAF/I variant also led to rudiments of honeycomb formations and resulted in the formation of the largest aggregates on the cells, very similar to what has been described for EHEC O104:H4 (

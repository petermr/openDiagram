0: One approach that can address the challenges above is proteogenomics, which combines the power of genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data to improve genome annotation and the current understanding of protein expression (Additional file  1: Figure S2) [ 28].
1: The traditional proteomics analysis detects peptides by matching spectra from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) against existing reference protein sequence database, which is prone to the assumption that the database contains all proteins in the genome of interest [ 29].
2: Especially for less well-annotated genomes, this assumption will have a more significant impact on peptide identification and downstream analysis like protein quantification.
3: The peptide search in proteogenomic approach uses customized database instead, which can be generated by either six frame translation (6FT) of the genome, or by translation of the transcriptome [ 30].
4: It allows the detection of translation of nORFs that may otherwise be neglected, such as those from non-coding regions, including antisense transcripts, lncRNAs, intergenic and intronic sequences.
5: The definitions of nORFs used in this study are as shown in Fig.
6: 1a.
7: Conversely, the proteomic data can provide peptide evidence for novel transcripts and RNA editing events, further improving the gene models.
8: This approach can be iterative as more multi-omics data are being generated, and continuously improve genome annotation.

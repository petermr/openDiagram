0: The cerebral AVM nidus structures were collected from the patients who underwent resection of AVM at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) between 2015 and 2017.
1: The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committees of both SCTIMST and Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB).
2: The control tissues consisted of vascular brain tissue from epileptic patients who had corrective surgery.
3: Both AVM tissues and control tissues were stored immediately after resection in RNA later solution (Invitrogen, Cat No: AM7021).
4: The transcriptome sequencing analysis was done in three independent cerebral AVM nidus and three control tissue samples, and validation studies were done using 10 AVM and 10 control tissue samples.
5: For immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses, tissues were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).

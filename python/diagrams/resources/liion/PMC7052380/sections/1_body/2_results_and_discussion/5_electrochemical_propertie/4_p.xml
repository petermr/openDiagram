<p>The charging and discharging capacity profiles of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C at progressively increasing C rates from 0.1 to 10 C are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>. The cells are cycled in the voltage window of 2.7–4.2 V at room temperature. For LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites, the initial discharge capacity is 166.3 mAhg
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0.1 C, and the discharge capacity decreases to 156.1 mAhg
 <sup>−1</sup> with an increase in the discharge rate to 1 C. At a higher discharge rate of 5 C, the cell delivers a capacity of 132.4 mAhg
 <sup>−1</sup>. Even at a 10 C rate, the capacities can reach 120.9 mAhg
 <sup>−1</sup>, and a good voltage plateau remains above 3 V. For LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C, the discharge capacity is 154.8, 133.8, 121.6, 105.9, and 86.4 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C rates, respectively. The cycling performances of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C from 0.1 to 10 C are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>. Although for LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene, the specific capacity decreases with increasing current rate, the capacity retention remains very good for all of the different rates; the discharge capacity retentions are, respectively, 99.5, 99.2, 99.4, 99.1, and 97.1% at 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C current rates after being cycled 10 times. While for LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C, the discharge capacity retentions are, respectively, 97.7, 96.9, 93.0, 87.1, and 79.5% at 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C current rates. All of the results demonstrate that LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites have better rate performance and cycling stability. This can be attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene, which can improve the conductivity and stability of materials.

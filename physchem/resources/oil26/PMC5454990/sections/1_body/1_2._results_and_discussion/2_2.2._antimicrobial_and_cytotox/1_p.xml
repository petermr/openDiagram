<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All essential oils displayed high antimicrobial activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &lt; 19.5 &#956;g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). <bold>Cau-L</bold> and <bold>Cuj-L</bold> oils showed notable activity against <italic>S. epidermis</italic> and <italic>B. cereus</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t003">Table 3</xref>). It is not obvious what component(s) are responsible for the activity against <italic>E. coli</italic>. Most essential oil components show only marginal activity against this organism. The antibacterial activities against the other bacteria are consistent with the activities of the essential oil components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t003">Table 3</xref>). On the other hand, the cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells did not display variation in the median inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values among all samples with an average of 63.0 &#956;g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t003">Table 3</xref>).

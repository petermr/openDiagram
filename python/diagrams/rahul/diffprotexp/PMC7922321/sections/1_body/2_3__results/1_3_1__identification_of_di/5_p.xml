<p>To clarify the functional profiles of the identified DEGs in glioma grades, enrichment analysis was performed, and significant GO and KEGG annotations were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpm-11-00138-f003">Figure 3</xref>). For the GO enrichment analysis of biological processes, initially, up- and downregulated genes of the different glioma grades were analyzed. While the upregulated gene clusters of grades were observed with cell cycle related phenotype in all glioma grades, the downregulated gene clusters of grades showed neuronal phenotype, such as synaptic transmission, as would be expected (

In the KEGG enrichment analysis, while the upregulated genes of glioma grades were enriched in p53, TGF-β, and Notch signaling pathways, prominent downregulated gene clusters fell into synaptic function related pathways, such as glutamatergic, GABAergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic pathways (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). For instance, the TGF-β signaling pathway was found to be altered through glioma progression, as observed by an increase in the level of BMP molecules, including BMP3 and BMP4, as well as their targets, such as Smad1/5/8 and Id. Additionally, the expression of cMyc and p15 associated with cell cycle were significantly increased. On the other hand, Notch signaling pathway genes, such as Delta, Notch, and Fringe, were observed to be upregulated in glioma. The MAPK signaling pathway was found to be enriched in downregulated clusters, with the expression of genes, such as Ras, MEK1, ERK, JNK, and Elk-1, being downregulated. All of these functional enrichment analysis results confirmed that, in all of the glioma grades, cells had downregulated pathways directly related with neuronal function, but upregulated signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and survival. It is interesting to note that the grade 4 glioma samples did not exhibit significant TGF-β pathway upregulation, but PI3K pathway upregulation instead (

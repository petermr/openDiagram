<p>In addition, before transcriptome functional annotation, nine differentially expressed genes were randomly selected to conduct real-time PCR analysis to verify the expression of genes detected by RNA sequence. The 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene was used as an internal control (for PCR verifications only). Primer sequences are listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The mRNA expression levels for all samples were normalized to the level for 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> housekeeping genes. The expression level in every sample group was expressed by the mean ± standard deviation (
 <italic>x</italic> ± s). The data were analyzed by 
 <italic>SPSS</italic>17.0 software.

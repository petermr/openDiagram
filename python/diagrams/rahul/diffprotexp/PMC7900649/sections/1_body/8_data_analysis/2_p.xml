<p id="Par42">Two types of APA switching events, named tandem APA switching and switching between coding regions and 3′ UTR, were considered in this study. To test tandem APA switching, poly(A) site usage between infected and uninfected cells were identified by the linear trend test and the independence test. As to test switching between coding regions and 3′ UTR, APA sites within a gene were classified into two groups according to their locations, referring as coding region and 3′ UTR. Then Chi-squared test was introduced to evaluate whether the switching that occurred within these two regions is significant. If the usage of the APA sites in the coding region is increased, it is determined as CDS-prefer, otherwise is UTR-prefer [

<p>The expression of an AlmA homologue (ABO_0282) was at least 4‐fold greater during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> differentially expressed compared to pyruvate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although AlmA is a long‐chain monooxygenase, it has been shown in other bacteria to have some activity on shorter alkanes but has much lower activity compared to growth on long‐chain alkanes, for example, &gt;
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>20</sub>. For example, 
 <italic>almA</italic> gene expression of 
 <italic>M. koreensis, M. alkaliphilus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. lipolyticus</italic> responded to alkanes ranging in length from 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>9</sub> up to 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>36</sub> (Wang and Shao, 
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2012a</xref>). AlmA in 
 <italic>A. dieselolei</italic> was shown to have activity against alkanes ranging in length from 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>10</sub> up to 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>36</sub>. This suggests that 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> is within the substrate range of ABO_0282 and therefore the protein is expressed. However, if 
 <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> was grown on longer alkanes the expression of ABO_0282 would potentially be much higher.

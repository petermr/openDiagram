0: The hydrogen phase diagram has several unusual features which are well reproduced by density functional calculations.
1: Unfortunately, these calculations do not provide good physical insights into why those features occur.
2: Here, we present a fast interatomic potential, which reproduces the molecular hydrogen phases: orientationally disordered Phase I; broken-symmetry Phase II and reentrant melt curve.
3: The H  2 vibrational frequency drops at high pressure because of increased coupling between neighbouring molecules, not bond weakening.
4: Liquid H  2 is denser than coexisting close-packed solid at high pressure because the favored molecular orientation switches from quadrupole-energy-minimizing to steric-repulsion-minimizing.
5: The latter allows molecules to get closer together, without the atoms getting closer, but cannot be achieved within in a close-packed layer due to frustration.
6: A similar effect causes negative thermal expansion.
7: At high pressure, rotation is hindered in Phase I, such that it cannot be regarded as a molecular rotor phase.

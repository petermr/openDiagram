<p>Currently, there are various databases gathering genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data on viruses and their impact on the host.

 </sup> Several databases were developed to obtain hostâ€“pathogen interaction data (gene expression and protein interaction), such as VirHostNet 2.0,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
 </sup> Virhostome,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
 </sup> the HIV-1 human interaction database,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
 </sup> the Gene Expression Omnibus,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> and the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
 </sup> On SARS-CoV-2, there are already two databases: Coronascape,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
 </sup> available at Metascape database, and The COVID-19 Drug and Gene Set Library,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
 </sup> which contain a collection of drug and gene sets related to COVID-19. Although not the first SARS-CoV-2 database, SARSCOVIDB is certainly the first to devote itself exclusively to this specific focus on differential expression after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of the data generated by other databases are automated by concentrating generic information, which can result in inaccurate information.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
 </sup> The SARSCOVIDB proposes to fill this gap in a simple, organized, and objective way by curating the data manually, making it reliable. Furthermore, the user, who does not need a bioinformatic background or skills, can query data from different experimental perspectives, such as the methodology used, host, virus strain, and so forth.

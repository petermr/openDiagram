<p>To identify the mRNA targets of 68 differentially expressed miRNAs, a two-step procedure was applied. First, miRNA–mRNA interactions were predicted with the use of an mirDIP tool [
 <xref rid="B23-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and subsequently, the correlation analysis of matched miRNA and gene expression profiles was applied. This analysis included 24 tumor samples. For 49 out of 68 miRNAs differentially expressed in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut vs. 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors, significant correlation with predicted target mRNA was observed. A total of 442 miRNA–mRNAs interactions were identified with a median of four putative target mRNAs per single miRNA particle (ranging from 1 to 38 target mRNAs). Mostly negative correlation between miRNA and gene expression was observed as found for 303 miRNA/mRNA pairs (range of Spearman R coefficient −0.575 to −0.7922; median −0.6182). Positive correlation was observed for 139 miRNA/mRNA pairs (range of Spearman R coefficient: 0.5753 to 0.8361 median: 0.6215). Results are presented in detail in

<p>Although the genes and proteins that enable the uptake and passage of aromatic hydrocarbons across the bacterial outer membrane have been characterized (for a review, see 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Shao, 2013</xref>), the transport mechanisms involved in long-chain aliphatic alkane uptake remain unclear. Direct uptake of alkanes from the water phase is only possible for low molecular weight compounds which are sufficiently soluble to facilitate efficient transport into cells (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Rojo, 2009</xref>). As the molecular weight of the alkane increases its solubility in water decreases (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Eastcott et al., 1988</xref>). Our data suggests that, to overcome this problem, 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> MIL-1 utilizes a combination of both active and passive transport systems for uptake of alkanes, with higher expression on 
 <italic>n</italic>-C28 compared to the non-hydrocarbon control, including a TonB-dependent receptor (TOL_0244, active, sevenfold increase in 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>) a FadL homolog (TOL_1625, passive, ninefold increase in 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>) and a specialized porin (TOL_3188, passive, exclusively expressed in 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>). An inner membrane transport protein (TOL_3187, active, 42-fold increase in 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>) involved in the export of an outer membrane protein was also expressed.

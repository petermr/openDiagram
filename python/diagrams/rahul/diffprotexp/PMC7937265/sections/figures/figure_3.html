 <caption> Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis in the hypothalamus. a PPI network of differentially expressed genes; hub genes are shown in bold with their closest neighbors (inset depicts the full network). b PPI subnetwork and significant Gene Ontology (GO) processes. Node size represents number of degrees, triangular nodes indicate a potential hub gene, and color represents log 2 fold change (logFC) (red, up-regulated; blue, down-regulated). Node border color, when present, indicates differential methylation (blue, lower methylation) </caption>

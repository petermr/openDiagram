0: Cells were synchronized at G0 phase and then incubated in complete medium to allow cell-cycle progression.
1: After the treatments, cells were collected, fixed with 1 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol, incubated at -20 oC for 24 h, and centrifuged at 380 g for 5 min.
2: Cell pellets were treated with l mL of cold staining solution containing 20 g/mL propidium iodide, 20 g/mL RNase A, and 1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 15 min in dark.
3: After the incubation, the cells were subjected to cell cycle distribution analysis by using a FACS Calibur system (version 2.0, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) with CellQuest software.
4: Each treatment was performed in triplicate for statistical analysis.

0: In the process of charging and discharging, the concentration of the lithium ion in the solid phase of the electrode material is dynamic.
1: According to  eq   2,  S is a state function independent of the process, that is to say, it is not affected by the charging and discharging process and only changes with the concentration of the lithium ion.
2: The relationship between them can be expressed by the entropy change curve.
3: Currently, the entropy curves of many electrode materials and full-cells have been reported, including Li xTiS 2, 24 LiMn 2O 4, 25 LiCoO 2, 24 Li xV 2O 5, 26 graphite, 27 and so forth.
4: With these basic physical chemistry parameters, people can build a more accurate thermoelectric-coupled modeling, 28 so as to realize the accurate prediction and simulation of the electrochemical performance and thermal behavior of lithium-ion batteries.

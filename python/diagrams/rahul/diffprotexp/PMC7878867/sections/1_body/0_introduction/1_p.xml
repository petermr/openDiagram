<p id="Par2">Globally, the agricultural industry is tasked with the ever-growing difficulty of supplying the rapid increased demand for food production. Water deficit is a major abiotic stress that negatively affects agricultural production worldwide, particularly in rain-fed areas like the Mediterranean region. Durum wheat (
 <italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>durum</italic>) is an important staple food crop in Mediterranean countries, for its unique grain quality characteristics such as high protein content and amber-coloured kernels

 </sup>. In durum wheat, reproductive stage water-deficit stress significantly reduces grain yield mainly through its negative impact on grain-setting processes, such as floral initiation, fertilisation and spikelet development

 </sup>. Water deficiency that continues to grain filling also affects grain quality traits including total starch content and grain protein accumulation, through its impacts on biological processes associated with dry matter accumulation such as photosynthesis and nutrient transport

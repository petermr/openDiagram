<p>The nasal route represents a promising noninvasive alternative route of drug delivery for treatment of different conditions. Rapid absorption of drugs into systemic circulation is permitted through the porous endothelial membrane of the lush vascular capillary layer beneath the nasal mucosa (Illum,

<p>DIscBIO is a multi-algorithmic pipeline for an easy, fast and efficient analysis of sub-populations and the molecular signatures that characterize them. The pipeline consists of four successive steps: (1) data pre-processing; (2) cellular clustering and pseudo-temporal ordering; (3) determining differentially expressed genes (DEGs); and (4) biomarker identification, including decision trees, networking and gene enrichment analysis (

<p>The limitation of this study is that we did not further explore the advancing mechanisms of how OXPHOS affects E-selectin expression and which specific factors in sera affect the expression of E-selectin. We also lack 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data to support our conclusions. Although freshly harvested endothelial cells isolated from the coronary arteries can most intuitively reflect the changes of the cell functions in patients during the development of KD, a measurement of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> cell wall extract (LCWE)-induced mouse models in exploring the effects of E-selectin and OXPHOS pathway on vasculitis may warrant further studies.

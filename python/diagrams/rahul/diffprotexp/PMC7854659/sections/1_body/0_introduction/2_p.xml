 </sup>. The liver plays a key role in body energy metabolism
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, whereas the brain, by regulating liver metabolism, prioritizes its own glucose needs over those of other tissues
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, with restricted energy availability, more glucose is allocated for the functioning of the central nervous system
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, potentially impairing muscle development and reducing muscle mass
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Reduced number of myofibers and liver sizes have been reported in nutrient restricted sheep fetuses and adults, respectively
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, intrauterine growth restricted bovine fetuses showed increased brain weight as a percentage of fetal body weight in response to early maternal undernutrition
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Altogether, the nutritional regulation of fetal programming underlies a complex genomic regulatory network that modulates gene expression and leads to changes in tissue structure and function

 </sup>. Differences in gene expression patterns and regulation of epigenetic mechanisms were reported as underlying the tissue-specific metabolic changes observed in nutrient restricted offspring

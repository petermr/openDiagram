<p>As seen in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, PcCdc50A-His presented two electrophoretic bands, suggesting glycosylation events typical of Cdc50 proteins. Glycosylation of Cdc50 proteins plays often important roles in the stability and the activity of the P4-ATPase/Cdc50 complex [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Using the online server NetNGlyc (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/</ext-link>), one potential glycosylation site was predicted at position N260 within the FNDT motif situated in the extracellular or luminal domain that connects TMs 1 and 2 of PcCdc50A (Figure supplement 4). This motif is conserved in Cdc50 proteins from others organisms, including the 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cdc50 protein, Cdc50p, whose glycosylation state has already been observed when overexpressed in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, no potential N-glycosylation sites were predicted in the extracellular or luminal sequence of PcCdc50B. To analyze the possible N-glycosylation of PcCdc50A and PcCdc50B when expressed in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we performed enzymatic deglycosylation assays using membranes co-expressing BAD-PcATP2/PcCdc50B-His or BAD-PcATP2/PcCdc50A-His, and using two deglycosydases: the amidase PNGase F and the N-glycosydase EndoH. As control, we used Cdc50p co-expressed with its 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> P4-ATPase partner, Drs2p (BAD-Drs2p/Cdc50p-His). Consistent with previous studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Cdc50p ran as two major bands in the western blot (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>); the fully glycosylated fraction (∼50 kDa) and the non-glycosylated one (∼37 kDa). After incubation with either PNGase F or EndoH, the glycosylated band of Cdc50p disappeared while the intensity of the lowest non-glycosylated band increased. Similarly, the upper band of PcCdc50A disappeared after incubation with either PNGase or EndoH, while the lowest band became more intense with the same electrophoretic mobility (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), thus confirming the N-glysosylation of PcCdc50A. Conversely, the band corresponding to PcCdc50B remained unaltered after enzymatic treatment with regard both electrophoretic mobility and intensity (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Of note, just above the band of PcCdc50B there is a faint band in the non-treated protein sample that disappeared after enzymatic digestion (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This band could represent a non-specific protein since it is also present (although less intense) in the experiment with untreated PcCdc50A. Nevertheless, we can conclude from these experiments that most of PcCdc50B expressed in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is not N-glycosylated.

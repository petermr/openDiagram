0: 291 ACE2 sequences, including the six ACE2 proteins with missing S-RBD binding residues in  Supplementary Table S2, were subjected to multiple sequence alignment (MSA) analysis using Clustal Omega 29 with default parameters.
1: Pairwise sequence identities between the full-length sequence of hACE2 (accession ID: NP_001358344.1) and the other ACE2 sequences were calculated based on the MSAs.
2: Besides the full-length sequence identities, the sequence identities for the 20 interface residues 30 and five critical S-RBD binding residues 31 were also calculated from the MSAs.
3: The results for these three types of sequence identities are shown in  Supplementary Table S4.

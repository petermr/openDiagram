<p>The last pair of Venn diagrams on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246695.g001">Fig 1</xref> show comparison of differential gene expression in groups treated with ibuprofen only or a combination of FPI and ibuprofen, both started at day 5 after infection; the same combination of treatments, but started at day 3, is also compared to the placebo. It is of interest to see how gene expression differs in lung lesions when combined treatment was administered, since it was the most clinically effective combination. Lists of unique genes that were differentially expressed in lung lesions only in groups with combined treatment shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246695.s004">S2 File</xref>. The gene lists are relatively short and functional analysis (with threshold of 2 genes per GO term or KEGG pathway) demonstrated only one GO term enriched in group 5; it was “positive regulation of potassium ion transport” (p = 0.00011). 2 DE genes (FHL1, WNK1) were associated with this term. Expression of FHL1 was 1.85 logFc lower and WNK1 was 1.07 lower in lung lesion, with relatively high average expression of these genes. Even though functional analysis did not bring any enriched pathways for group 6, differential expression of CD180 and CMTM7 deserves close attention from an immunological stand point. Expression of CD180 was 3.9 logFc lower and CMTM7 was 2.1 logFc lower in lung lesion than in non lesion lung.

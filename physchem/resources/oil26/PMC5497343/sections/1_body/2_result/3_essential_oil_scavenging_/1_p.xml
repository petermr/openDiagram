<p id="Par24">The essential oil (EO) of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> scavenging activity on the DPPH radical is as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The EO as well as the positive control (Vitamin C) displayed concentration-dependent inhibitory effects activities on DPPH radical. The inhibitory effect of the oil at the highest concentration (0.50 mg/mL) is comparable to the inhibitory effect of the vitamin C. The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower displayed highest DPPH inhibitory effect of 72% ± 0.012 at 0.5 mg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.45 mg/mL while vitamin C displayed higher inhibitory effect (78% ± 0.002) on DPPH radical with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.26 mg/mL.

 <caption>
  <p>Ethogram of behaviors. All behaviors were used for instantaneous scan sampling. Asterisks (*) are used to indicate behaviors that were also scored using all-occurrence sampling. For social all-occurrence behaviors, initiators and recipients were noted. Triangles (▲) are used to indicate behaviors that were scored using continuous sampling as well.</p>

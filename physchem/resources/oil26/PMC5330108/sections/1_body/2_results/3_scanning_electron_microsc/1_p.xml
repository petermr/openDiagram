<p>The effect of the MPE on the morphology of 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> as examined through SEM is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. The control fungus grown on PDA had normal tubular hyphae with regular morphology [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">b</xref>]. After 48 h of treatment using the MIC and MFC of the MPE treated fungal mycelia showed distorted, shrunken morphology [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">d</xref>].

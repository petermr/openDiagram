<p id="Par37">Statistical analyses were performed using PRISM 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). All data were expressed as group means ± SEM of at least four different samples. Differences between two datasets were evaluated by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. Statistical tests between multiple datasets and conditions were carried out using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test to determine statistical significance, as appropriate. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

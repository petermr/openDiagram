<p>CARDS TX selectively binds phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin over other membrane lipids [
 <xref rid="cit0208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Nevertheless, CARDS TX is known to bind to SP-A, which may contribute to additional colonization and pathogenic pathways [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Krishnan et al. showed that CARDS TX can bind to certain cell types in a dose- and time-dependent manner, followed by rapid internalization by clathrin-associated endocytosis via a temperature-sensitive mechanism [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. Interestingly, CARDS TX internalization can also occur in SP-A-deficient cells [
 <xref rid="cit0214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>], demonstrating the presence of alternative binding receptors. Sudha et al. discovered that CARDS TX, especially the C-terminus of CARDS TX, binds recombinant AnxA2 in a specific, dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="cit0215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Cells pretreated with anti-AnxA2 monoclonal antibody or AnxA2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) show reduced binding, internalization, and vacuolization, while this is not the case in AnxA2 siRNA-transfected HepG2 cells [
 <xref rid="cit0215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. These results suggest that AnxA2 may serve as another functional receptor for CARDS TX in certain cells and participate in toxin-related pathogenic events.

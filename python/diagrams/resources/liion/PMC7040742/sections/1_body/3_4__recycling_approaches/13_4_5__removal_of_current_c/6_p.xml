<p>The removal of the PVDF binder could be performed via dissolution in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at 80–100 °C [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Once PVDF was dissolved, the active material easily separated from the Al current collector. While highly toxic, NMP is the most efficient solvent for PVDF, as reported by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] after they compared the efficiency of several solvents. Particularly, coupling NMP with sonication helps to detach the coating from the Al substrate [

 <xref rid="B100-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Ionic liquids have been used by Zeng at al. as alternatives to NMP for binder dissolution [
 <xref rid="B101-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], and Zhou et al. reported good separation using N-N-dimethylformamide at 60 °C [

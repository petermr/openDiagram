<p>XAFS features before and immediately after the edge are known as X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), or near edge XAFS (NEXAFS), and are sensitive to the details of the density of electronic states near the Fermi level, including the presence of localized and hybridized states, thus providing information about the chemical state of the absorbing atoms, local symmetry, and chemical bonding.

 </sup> This region of the absorption spectra is followed by the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), which extends into the range of a few thousands eV above the absorption edge energy. Because of the high density of available electronic states, and high energy of the photoelectrons, the EXAFS region is much less affected by the details of the electronic structure but is a sensitive probe of spatial arrangements of nearest neighbors around the absorbing atoms.

 </sup> XANES and EXAFS portions of the absorption spectra thus provide highly complementary information.

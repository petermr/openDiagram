<p>Our results further indicate that the TAT-C3P peptide, which selectively inhibits Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 channels [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], can reduce protein levels of Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 in the TG of injected mice compared to controls. This suggests that TAT-C3P may help normalize Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 to baseline levels. We are uncertain as to how the acute blockade of Cav3.3 may translate to downregulation of the protein; however, it is possible that TAT-C3P may be influencing channel trafficking in addition to blocking channel activity as has been observed with other calcium channel-modulating neuropathic pain drugs such as pregabalin [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. TAT-C3P has no effect on Cav3.3 currents when applied acutely to Cav3.3-expressing HEK cells or when dialyzed acutely into cells via the patch pipette, which usually rules out a direct action on the channel [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This suggests either an effect on the trafficking/stability of the channel, or potentially an effect on gene expression, which might be consistent with our observation that Cav3.3 levels are decreased upon injection of the TAT-C3P peptide

<p id="p0290">RNA sequencing FASTQ files were processed with STAR aligner [
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. We used ‘GeneCounts’ mode with the Ensembl human transcriptome annotation (Build version GRCh38 and transcript annotation GRCh38.89). Complete HGNC dataset [
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], version of July 13, 2017, was used to convert Ensembl gene IDs to HGNC gene symbols.

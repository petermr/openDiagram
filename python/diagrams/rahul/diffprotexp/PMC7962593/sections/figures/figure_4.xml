  <p>Biological functions and KEGG pathways enriched in common genes. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Common genes of sepsis patients relative to controls involved in up- or down-regulated biological processes, as quantified by gene set variation analysis (GSVA). FC, fold change. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Common genes of sepsis patients relative to controls involved in up- or down-regulated KEGG pathways, as quantified by single-sample GSVA. FC, fold change. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Common genes involved in up- or down-regulated KEGG pathways of GSEA results in sepsis patients relative to controls.

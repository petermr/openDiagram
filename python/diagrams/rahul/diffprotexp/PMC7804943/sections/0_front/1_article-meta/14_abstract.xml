 <p id="Par2">Post-transcriptional gene regulation is an important contributor to cell type-specific differences at the transcriptomic level. Here, the authors use a multiomics approach to characterize neuronal diversity in the mouse nervous system, analyzing the relative contributions of multiple layers of transcriptomic regulation in the specification of cell type identity.</p>

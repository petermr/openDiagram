0: Lawrence [ 4] named four major chemotypes of basil: methyl chavicol-rich, linalool-rich, methyl eugenol-rich, and methyl cinnamate-rich.
1: Both methyl chavicol and methyl eugenol are phenylpropanoids produced by shikimic acid pathway and are reported to be toxic to insects and microbes.
2: Linalool is a terpenoid produced by mevalonic acid pathway and known to possess antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [ 5].
3: Methyl cinnamate is the methyl ester of cinnamic acid.
4: It is found naturally in many aromatic plants, including fruits like strawberry and is known to attract pollinators.
5: According to Marotti et al.
6: [ 6] the European basils are mostly of linalool and methyl chavicol types, whereas tropical basils have methyl cinnamate as their major constituent.
7: Basils of methyl eugenol chemotype could be found growing in North Africa, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia [ 7].

<p>For Co-, Ni-, and Mn-based batteries, the leaching power of HCl is high enough; therefore, a reducing agent is not necessary. From the literature reviewed, only two authors had used H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> as a reducing agent [
 <xref rid="B162-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>,
 <xref rid="B163-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The resulted Li and Co recoveries (83% for both) obtained by Shuva et al. [
 <xref rid="B163-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>] were even lower than those in other studies without a reducing agent (for example, almost 100% for Li and Co) [
 <xref rid="B129-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Takacova et al. demonstrated that HCl leaching in the absence of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> presents a two-step kinetic, controlled first by the chemical reaction rate of cobalt (
 <italic>Ea</italic> = 40–48 kJ/mol) followed by a mixed control process (
 <italic>Ea</italic> = 20–26 kJ/mol) [
 <xref rid="B129-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The latter activation energy value is similar to that obtained for cobalt by Shuva et al. [
 <xref rid="B163-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>].

0: There are many studies on the characterization of volatile compound composition and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of various selected groups of essential oils.
1: Bozin et al.
2: characterized Lamiaceae species and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the oils of  Ocimum basilicum L.,  Origanum vulgare L., and  Thymus vulgaris L. [ 6], and the chemical constituents of four populations of  Piper aduncum L. from Distrito Federal, Brazil [ 7], were identified.

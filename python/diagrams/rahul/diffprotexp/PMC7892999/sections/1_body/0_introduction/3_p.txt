0: Regardless of the plant species, at least two classes of genes are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis: structural genes encoding the enzymes that directly catalyze the production of anthocyanins, and regulatory genes that control the transcription of structural genes 18,  19.
1: In most cases, the anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes are regulated by transcription factors (TFs) belonging to the R2R3MYB, basic helixloophelix (bHLH) and WD-repeat protein families, in the form of the MBW complex 19,  20.
2: Recent reports pointed out that gene regulation by TFs may play a key role controlling anthocyanin pigmentation in purple carrots 17,  21,  22.
3: Moreover, the broad variation observed among purple carrot root genotypes, regarding both anthocyanin concentration and pigment distribution in the phloem and xylem tissues, suggests independent genetic regulation in these two root tissues 23.
4: In this sense, Xu et al.
5: 16 found that the expression pattern of a R2R3MYB TF,  DcMYB6, is correlated with anthocyanin production in carrot roots and that the overexpression of this gene in  Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in vegetative and reproductive tissues in this heterologous system.
6: Similarly, Kodama et al.
7: 24 found that a total of 10  MYB,  bHLH and  WD40 genes were consistently up- or downregulated in a purple color-specific manner, including  DcMYB6.
8: Iorizzo et al.
9: 25 identified a cluster of MYB TFs, with  DcMYB7 as a candidate gene for root and petiole pigmentation, and  DcMYB11 as a candidate gene for petiole pigmentation.
10: Bannoud et al.
11: 23 showed that  DcMYB7 and  DcMYB6 participate in the regulation of phloem pigmentation in purple-rooted samples.
12: Finally, Xu et al.
13: 26, by means of loss- and gain-of-function mutation experiments, demonstrated that  DcMYB7 is the main determinant that controls purple pigmentation in carrot roots.

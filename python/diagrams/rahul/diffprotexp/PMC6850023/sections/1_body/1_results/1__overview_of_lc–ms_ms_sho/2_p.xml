<p>A total of 381 proteins were significantly differentially expressed during growth on 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> compared to pyruvate, with 80% of these being up‐regulated on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). In contrast, only 23 proteins were differentially expressed during growth on pristane compared to pyruvate, 39% of which were up‐regulated on pristane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Between the linear (
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub>) and branched (pristane) chain alkanes, 288 proteins were significantly differentially expressed, with 91% of these being up‐regulated on 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Overall the total proteomes differed markedly between the three growth substrates with highly similar proteomes between replicates (Fig.

<p>Changes in atomic structure can react to the specific nitrification process indirectly. The hybrid type of nitrogen atom in NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> turns from sp to sp
 <sup>2</sup> when it bonds with other atoms. The bonding atoms centered on N tend to be on the same plane. Hence, a facile method could be used to further determine the reaction type and sites by analyzing the changes of bond length, angles and coplanarity in the stable configuration when groups and NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> are at different distances. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00058">Tables S1 and S2</xref>, as the distance between epoxy groups and NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> gets closer, NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and the oxygen atoms of epoxy tend to be coplanar. However, both carbon-oxygen bonds of the central epoxy group become longer, and then break when N atom and O
 <sub>3</sub> atom are in the bonding distance. The marginal epoxy only fractures one carbon-oxygen bond in 1.63 Å of 
 <italic>L</italic>(N··O
 <sub>4</sub>) (the length between N atom and O
 <sub>4</sub> atom, ‘··’ means unbonded function and ‘–’ is the bond function). It means that the epoxy groups on the edge can undergo a ring-opening reaction to form a nitrate group. In 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00058">Table S3</xref>, when NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> gets closer to the marginal hydroxyl group, the coplanarity of NO
 <sub>1</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>5</sub> gets better and 
 <italic>L</italic>(O
 <sub>5</sub>–C
 <sub>5</sub>) becomes longer, tending to form the nitro group. Meanwhile, the changes in NO
 <sub>1</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> and 
 <italic>L</italic>(O
 <sub>5</sub>–H) have the same tendency. This analysis illustrates that these two groups could take esterification and substitution reactions. Therefore, when the 
 <italic>L</italic>(N··O
 <sub>5</sub>) and 
 <italic>L</italic>(N··C
 <sub>5</sub>) get shorter to bond, the configuration is hard to stabilize. For the result of central hydroxyl and NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00058">Table S4</xref>, NO
 <sub>1</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> tends to be in a plane, but the O
 <sub>6</sub>–H bond is stable firmly. The coplanarity of NO
 <sub>1</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>C
 <sub>6</sub> is fine outside the C··O
 <sub>6</sub> bonding distance because of the conjugate between NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and graphene base. However, NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> prefers to connect with hydroxyl rather than forming a nitro group when O
 <sub>6</sub>–C
 <sub>6</sub> bond breaking. From the analysis above, NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> could react with the epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the edge in accordance with the result of the Fukui function index.

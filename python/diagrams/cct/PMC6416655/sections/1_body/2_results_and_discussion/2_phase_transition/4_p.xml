<p id="p0075">The CCT curves of high-alloy mould steel slab at different cooling rates were shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The area between red and green solid lines is the phase transition area. The high-alloy mould steel contains mainly bainite and martensite when the cooling rate less than 0.5 K/s. The martensite domain started from623–673 K and ended at 513–528 K when the cooling rate is above 0.5 K/s. The martensite transformation region was vast, as shown in the CCT curve, and the critical cooling rate was between 0.1–0.5 K/s. Generally, in the practical continuous casting process, the cooling rate is within 10–15 K/s (the average cooling rate of caster mold), under which the steels contains mainly martensite, resulting in increasing the hardenability and cracking susceptibility.

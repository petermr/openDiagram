 <bold>Data analysis</bold>. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. All 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were performed on at least 3 separate occasions and in triplicate where applicable, and averages were used to present data. Multiple groups were compared by 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison correction. The set of data obtained from WT and lrg mutants biofilm susceptibility to vancomycin alone or combined with DNAse was analyzed by 2-WAY ANOVA using the Multiple Effect analysis (Mixed Model). Student’s unpaired t-test was used to compare differences between two samples; p values of &lt;0.05 were considered to be significant. For 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, the database for statistical analysis was built up by incremental addition of experimental data. Based on our analysis, a sample size of 5 mice per experimental group will have at least 80% power to detect difference of 80%. All experiments were performed on at least three separate occasions, analyzed separately and averages used to present data. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test and Dunnet’s Multiple Comparison Test were used to compare differences between multiple groups and statistical significance, respectively. P values &lt;0.05 were considered to be significant.

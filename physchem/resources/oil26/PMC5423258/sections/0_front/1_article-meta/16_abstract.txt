0: Family Cupressaceae is the largest coniferous plant family.
1: Essential oils of many species belonging to family Cupressaceae are known to have several biological activities specially antimicrobial activity.
2: The essential oils from aerial parts of   Calocedrus decurrens Torr.,   Cupressus sempervirens stricta L. and   Tetraclinis articulata (Vahl) Mast.
3: were prepared by hydrodistillation.
4: The chemical composition of the essential oils has been elucidated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis.
5: The prepared essential oils were examined against selected species of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and   Candida species.
6: Broth dilution methods were used to detect minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC).
7: Sixteen compounds were identified in the essential oils of both   Calocedrus decurrens and   Cupressus sempervirens L. and fifteen compounds were identified in the essential oil of   Tetraclinis articulata.
8: -3-Carene (43.10%), (+)-Cedrol (74.03%) and Camphor (21.23%) were the major constituents in the essential oils of   Calocedrus decurrens,   Cupressus sempervirens L. and   Tetraclinis articulata, respectively.
9: The essential oils showed strong antimicrobial activities against the selected microorganisms in concentration range 0.02 3- 3.03 L/mL.
10: This study could contribute to the chemotaxonomic characterization of family Cupressaceae.
11: In addition, it proved that the essential oils under investigation possess potential antimicrobial properties.

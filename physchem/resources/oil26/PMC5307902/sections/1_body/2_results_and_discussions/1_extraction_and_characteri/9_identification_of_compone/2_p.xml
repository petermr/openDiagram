<p>The qualitative data of the major compounds are in agreement with data previously reported for 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> sp. oils from Brazil.[
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] However, the quantitative data were different for: carvacrol [33,5%], 
 <italic>p</italic>-cyneme [10.3%], and Î³-terpinene [5.9%]. Other studies on the composition of the 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> oil also showed carvacrol as the main constituent, but the concentrations ranged from 28.65% to 90-98%.[

 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] According to Haddouchi, Chaouche[
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] the knowledge about essential oil composition is fundamental in its correct application as a bioactive product. To control the types of components and the essential oil yield in the plant, it is necessary to standardize the cultivation conditions as well the harvest and postharvest procedures. Thus, the extraction of high quality essential oils is feasible.[

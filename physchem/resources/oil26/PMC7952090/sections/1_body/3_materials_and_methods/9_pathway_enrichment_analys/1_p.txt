0: To determine if gene duplications were enriched in particular biological pathways, we used the WEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) ( Liao et al., 2019) to perform Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) using the Reactome database ( Jassal et al., 2020).
1: Gene duplicates in each lineage were used as the foreground gene set, and the initial query set was used as the background gene set.
2: WebGestalt uses a hypergeometric test for statistical significance of pathway over-representation, which we refined using two methods: a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-based approach and an empirical p-value approach ( Chen et al., 2013).
3: The BenjaminiHochberg FDR multiple-testing correction was generated by WebGestalt.
4: In order to correct p-values based on an empirical distribution, we modified the approach used by Chen et al.
5: in Enrichr ( Chen et al., 2013) to generate a 'combined score' for each pathway based on the hypergeometric p-value from WebGestalt, and a correction for expected rank for each pathway.
6: In order to generate the table of expected ranks and variances for this approach, we randomly sampled foreground sets of 105000 genes from our background set 5000 times, and used WebGestalt ORA to obtain a list of enriched terms and P-values for each run; we then compiled a table of Reactome terms with their expected frequencies and standard deviation.
7: These data were used to calculate a Z-score for terms in an ORA run, and the combined score was calculated using the formula  C=logpz.

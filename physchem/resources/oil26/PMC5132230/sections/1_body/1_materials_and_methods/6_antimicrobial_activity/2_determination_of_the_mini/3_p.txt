0: To determine the MIC, the EO was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (4% DMSO).
1: The orifices of the microplate were filled with 50 L NaCl and 50 L of solution OE  A.  suaveolens.
2: Then serial dilutions were made from 100 to 0.048 g.mL -1.
3: Additionally, 50 L was distributed suspensions of microorganisms in each well of the microplate.
4: As a positive control, it was used amoxicillin (50 L.mL -1).
5: There were performed the control of the culture medium, EO control and the negative control (4% DMSO).
6: The microplates were incubated at 37C for 24h.
7: The experiments were performed in triplicate.
8: The MIC was considered the lowest concentration of EO which was not displayed microbial growth.
9: The presence of turbidity in the wells indicated microbial growth and therefore there was no antimicrobial activity.

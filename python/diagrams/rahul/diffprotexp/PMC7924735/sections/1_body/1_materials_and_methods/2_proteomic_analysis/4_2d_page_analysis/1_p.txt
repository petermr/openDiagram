0: Isoelectric focusing was performed as described elsewhere, with some modifications [ 22].
1: The sample was desalted in an Illustra NAP 5 column (GE healthcare), and the proteins were then concentrated by freeze-drying (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) and precipitated by adding TCA-DOC-acetone (2% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) to a final 0.02% concentration, 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final 10%, 200 l of ice-cold acetone).
2: The protein pellet was resuspended, and the final volume was adjusted to 125 l with rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG buffer pH 47, and 20 mM DTT).
3: Then, the sample was applied on Immobiline DryStrip pH 310, 7-cm linear-gradient strips (GE healthcare) for 16 h to dehydrate at room temperature, following the manufacturers instructions.
4: Focusing was performed in an Ettan IPGphor 3 Isoelectric Focusing System (GE healthcare) starting at 500 V (for 5 h), increasing potential to 4500 V (90 min) and finally to 14,000 V. After focusing, the strips were equilibrated for 20 min in sample buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 0.002% bromophenol blue, and 0.5% DTT).
5: The strips were then transferred onto 4.515% SDS-PAGE.
6: After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

<p>Comparison of the distribution of proteins between primary and metastatic tumors revealed differences of proteins involved in metabolic, developmental, and multicellular organismal processes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Based on the results of searches carried out in the primary and metastatic tumors, eight candidate proteins were selected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Among these proteins, TAGLN2, TPI-1, and ENO1 were subjected to further investigation.

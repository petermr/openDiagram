<p id="Par36">In this study, IHC and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were performed to elucidate the correlation between TUBA1C and LUAD. Furthermore, we used the computational algorithms CIBERSORT and TIMER to explore the relationship between TUBA1C and TIICs in LUAD patients. In addition, STRING software, GeneMANIA Analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were used to further study the function and mechanism of TUBA1C in LUAD patients. The findings proved that TUBA1C played an important role in the development of LUAD. Furthermore, we elucidated the potential relationship between TUBA1C and tumor-immune interaction.</p>

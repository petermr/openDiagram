<p>In conclusion, a better understanding of co-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms, such as APA, may point to additional mechanisms contributing to the decoupling of mRNA and protein abundance and more generally, enhance our understanding of how variation percolates through genetic variants, mRNA, and protein to ultimately affect human phenotypic diversity.</p>

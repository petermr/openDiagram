<p>Much of the pathophysiological discussion until now has been in relation to the acidosis induced during an inflammatory response, especially in relation to musculoskeletal conditions. However, bone itself can undergo and respond to changes in pH. For example, mild drops in bone pH (pH 7.3–6.9) affect the osteoclast–osteoblast balance which underpins bone integrity, such that acidity shifts the equilibrium to greater bone degradation and active osteoclasts themselves produce an acidic microenvironment [

Cancer-associated bone pain (CABP), affects &gt;70% of metastatic bone cancer patients and the role osteoclasts and acidification have been implicated in the pain experienced with ASIC3 implicated being involved in transmission of CABP, such that ASIC3 expression is elevated in rat DRGs with tumor-associated CABP [

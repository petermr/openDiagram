 <italic>RPS6KA1</italic> encodes ribosomal kinase 1 (RSK1, pp90
 <sup>RSK1</sup>), which promotes cell proliferation and survival by linking MAPK signaling to the MTOR pathway and inhibiting pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative factors including BAD and CDKN1B (also known as p27)

 </sup>. Interestingly, RUNX1/RUNX1T-positive AML expresses significantly lower amounts of 
 <italic>RPS6KA1</italic> transcripts than other AML subtypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). Furthermore, high expression levels of this gene correlate with a worse clinical outcome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). We, therefore, wondered if the upregulation of RPS6KA1 may rescue t(8;21) AML cells from transient RUNX1/RUNX1T1 loss and the therewith connected to impaired self-renewal capacity.

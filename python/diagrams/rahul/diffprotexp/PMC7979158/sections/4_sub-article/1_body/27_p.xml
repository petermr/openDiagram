<p>We are grateful for the reviewerâ€™s point that Ctip2 is not a definitive marker distinguishing layer 5 or 6, and we have clarified this in the Figure 5 legend. As requested, we performed new experiments co-staining for TBR1 and SATB2 to further investigate the layer 5/6 lamination phenotype via labeling SATB2+ putative upper layer cells that form layers 2-4, as well as some Layer 5 cells. These experiments show that SATB2+ cells exhibit similar differences in positioning and differential overlap with Tbr1+ cells as Ctip2+ cells. These findings indicate generalized perturbation to lamination, rather than a specific impact on Ctip2+ layer 5/6 cells. Our new experiments show that SATB2+ cells in the MIA group are already in their more superficial position and show a more rounded morphology, indicating a more complete stage of lamination and further progression of migration of SATB2+ cells. These findings provide further evidence of lamination defects, and are consistent with our general interpretation that MIA alters developing cortical anatomy.</p>

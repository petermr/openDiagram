 <xref rid="Tab15" ref-type="table">15</xref>. The highest zone of inhibition was shown against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> at 800 μg/well but there was no observable zone of inhibition was found in 
 <italic>T. sp</italic>. On the other hand, no zone was observed at 400 μg/well dose level. The standard drug fluconazole was highly sensitive to all the fungi at the dose of 100 μg/well. In the MICs and MBCs experiments, the essential oil showed the highest inhibition i.e. the lowest MICs and MBCs. In the case of fluconazole, it completely inhibited the entire test fungi.

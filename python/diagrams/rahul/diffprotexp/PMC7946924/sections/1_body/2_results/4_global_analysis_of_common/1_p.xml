<p id="Par28">The comparative study of number of positively and negatively regulated miRNAs of apical and basal spikelets of cultivar SR-157 verses SR-159 exhibited different dynamics with passage of time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). At anthesis stage the number of positively- and negatively-regulated miRNAs expressing differentially in apical spikelet of SR-157 over SR-159 was almost identical (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). But the situation was not identical for the basal spikelet (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), where the number of negatively expressed miRNA was two times higher. The expression dynamics changed on day 5 post-anthesis. On this occasion, the number of negatively regulated miRNA increased in apical spikelet (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d) but not so much in basal spikelets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). For apical spikelet, the number of miRNA regulated positively or negatively in SR-157 compared with SR-159 reached highest level on day 10 post-anthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f,g). On the same occasion, the number of negatively regulated miRNAs differing between the two cultivars was also high in basal spikelet, but in comparison, the number declined considerably for the positively regulated miRNAs. DGE analysis of selected miRNAs in the apical and basal spikelets of SR-159 and SR-157 during 0, 5 and 10 days after anthesis was performed. Heat map generated from this analysis indicated UP-, DOWN- and NEUTRALLY- regulated miRNAs in different developmental stages of grain filling (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5</xref>h).

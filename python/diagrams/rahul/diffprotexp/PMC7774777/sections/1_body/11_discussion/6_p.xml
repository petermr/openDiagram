<p>Finally, our findings open multiple new lines of future investigation, including cell type specificity of the transcriptional effects of SERM, which could be studied by single cell transcriptomics of the CNS, as well as the effects of additional SERM. Notably, acolbifene, turemifene, clomifene, and endoxifene, to name only a few, are all SERM that have never been tested for their neuroprotective effect. The data presented in the current study may launch an entirely new search for SERM with better efficacy, specifically in the CNS. Therefore, it is expected that in the future the knowledge gained will allow the development of more rational use of SERM in disease affecting the CNS.</p>

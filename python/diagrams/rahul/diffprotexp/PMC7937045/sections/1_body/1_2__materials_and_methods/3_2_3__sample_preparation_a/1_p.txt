0: For the LC-MS analysis, frozen serum and urine samples were thawed on ice.
1: Serum samples with each group (100  L of serum) were merged; the urine samples within each group (2 mL of urine) were merged.
2: PierceTM Top12 Abundant Protein Depletion Spin Columns were used to remove high-abundance proteins from the serum samples of each group.
3: The filtrate was collected and denatured with 8 M urea.
4: DTT and IAA were added to reduce alkylation, and 1  g of Trypsin was then added at a ratio of 1 : 30 (enzyme : protein).
5: The sample was hydrolyzed overnight at 37C.
6: Urine samples were precipitated with precooled acetone, and urea was used to redissolve the precipitate, followed by protein quantification using a BCA kit.
7: Lastly, 3.3  g Trypsin was added to 100  g protein from each group, and the samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed (1 : 30, enzyme : protein).

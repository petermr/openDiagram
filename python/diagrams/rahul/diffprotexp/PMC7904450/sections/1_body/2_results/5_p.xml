<p id="p0075">To contextualize 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic>-drug concordance scores and 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic>-drug concordance scores, and to increase the statistical power of our study, we further expanded our analyses to include all cell lines generating 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic>-drug concordance scores (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C) and 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic>-drug concordance scores (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D) for at least one drug of interest. In addition to the previously reported cell lines, these comparisons include the HA1E, HT29, and MCF7 cell lines. In A549 cells, concordance scores quantifying the similarity between drug-treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells are as follows: 0.4371 for dexamethasone treated cells, and 0.6458 for bupropion treated cells, and 0.3067 for dexamethasone treated cells. In HA1E cells, the concordance scores quantifying the similarity between drug-treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells are as follows: 0.2262 for fluoxetine treated cells, and 0.3597 for paroxetine treated cells. In HA1E cells, the concordance score quantifying the similarity between dexamethasone treated cells and 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown cells is 0.2979. In HT29 cells, the concordance score quantifying the similarity between dexamethasone treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells is 0.2930. In HT29 cells, the concordance scores quantifying the similarity between drug-treated cells and 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown cells are as follows: 0.3218 for fluoxetine treated cells, and 0.2313 for dexamethasone treated cells. In MCF7 cells, the concordance scores quantifying the similarity between bupropion treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells is âˆ’0.3242. In MCF7 cells, the concordance scores quantifying the similarity between drug-treated cells and 
 <italic>NFBK1</italic> knockdown cells are as follows: 0.379 for fluoxetine treated cells, and 0.2252 for paroxetine treated cells. We present summary data tables containing all calculated concordance scores, mean values, and standard deviations for 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E) and 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F) drug-knockdown comparisons across A375, A549, HA1E, HEPG2, HT29, and MCF7 cell lines. In this way, we represent the concordance scores generated by comparisons of differential gene expression signatures elicited by drug treatments and differential gene expression signatures elicited by 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> or 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown in each evaluated cell line, as well as the mean concordance scores calculated across all cell lines. The mean concordance scores quantifying the average similarity between drug-treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells are as follows: 0.5461 (SD: 0.2920; N: 3) for fluoxetine treated cells, 0.4497 (SD: 0.1310; N: 4) for dexamethasone treated cells; 0.3082 (SD: 0.4370; N: 4) for bupropion treated cells; and 0.4390 (SD: 0.0776; N: 3) for paroxetine treated cells. The mean concordance scores quantifying the average similarity between drug-treated cells and 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown cells are as follows: 0.3440 (SD: 0.0307;N: 3) for fluoxetine treated cells, 0.2904 (SD: 0.0410; N: 4) for dexamethasone treated cells; 0.2407 (N: 1) for bupropion treated cells; and 0.2891 (SD: 0.0564; N: 4) for paroxetine treated cells.

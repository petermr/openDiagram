<p>According to previous studies, VAT secretes higher levels of proinflammatory factors and lower levels of anti-inflammatory factors, decomposes FFA, and increases plasma more easily than SAT. As reported, high concentrations of FFA can inhibit insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle and liver, induce insulin resistance, and eventually increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, blood pressure can be elevated by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and mechanisms related to insulin resistance (

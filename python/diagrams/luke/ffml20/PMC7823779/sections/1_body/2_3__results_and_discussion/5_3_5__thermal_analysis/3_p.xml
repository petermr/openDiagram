<p>It can be seen from the experimental data (

 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>p</sub> of NGO ranges from 201.4 to 218.0 °C, and the Δ
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> increases as the 
 <italic>β</italic> get larger. The 
 <italic>E</italic>a of NGO is 166.6 kJ/mol in the range of 163 kJ/mol and 188 kJ/mol [

 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which is the first-order (O–NO
 <sub>2</sub> bond fracture) reaction energy of several nitrate energetic materials. This further confirms that the initial thermal decomposition of NGO is the breaking of O–NO
 <sub>2</sub> bond, and NGO is equivalent to common nitrates in thermal stability and heat release. Compared to the decomposition performance of GO at the heating rate of 10 °C [

<p>The structures of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites were investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (X'pert PRO, Panalytical, Holland) with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The contents of graphene and carbon in the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites were calculated from TG-DSC (STA449F3, NETZSCH, Germany), which was carried out from room temperature to 700°C under an air atmosphere at a rate of 10°C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The morphologies of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-IT300 at 20 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2100F Japan at 200 kV). The Raman spectra of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites were recorded from 100 to 3,200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> on a Renishaw Raman microprobe (INVIA, China) using a 514.5 nm argon-ion laser at room temperature.

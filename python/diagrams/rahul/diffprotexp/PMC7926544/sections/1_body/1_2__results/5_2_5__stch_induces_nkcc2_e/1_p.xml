<p>Based upon the above findings, we hypothesized that STCH association with NKCC2 promotes endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of immature misfolded NKCC2, leading to a decrease in total expression and maturation of the co-transporter. Accordingly, investigations of ERAD inhibition and consequent probable changes in NKCC2 expression were conducted in cells treated with kifunensine, which inhibits α-mannosidases I (including ER mannosidase I and EDEM) required for the early steps of ERAD misfolded glycoprotein recognition. Towards this end, cells were transfected with Myc-NKCC2 cDNA in the absence (empty vector) or presence of STCH-GFP construct for 5 h before treatment with kifunensine overnight. Again, given that the data described above clearly demonstrate that the immature form of NKCC2 is the preferred substrate of STCH, cell lysis was performed 16–18 h post-treatment to better visualize the immature form of the co-transporter during immunoblotting analysis. As can be seen in the upper panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, kifunensine (KIF) increased total expression of immature N-glycosylated NKCC2, as expected following impaired mannose trimming in the ER. Most importantly, upon treatment with kifunensine, the STCH-dependent decrease of NKCC2 protein level was abrogated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Hence, these data clearly indicate that STCH-enhanced degradation of NKCC2 requires mannose trimming by α-mannosidase I to target misfolded NKCC2 for ERAD.

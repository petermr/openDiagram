<p id="Par26">Virus-infected cells were washed once with precooled PBS, and lysis buffer (25 mM mannitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA [w/v]) was added. The cells were scraped and placed in a homogenizer for homogenization. The cell sample was centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation in the previous step was centrifuged at 10,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the precipitate was mitochondrial protein [

The previous centrifugation step was repeated, and the precipitate was combined with that obtained in the previous step to further maximally enrich mitochondrial protein. The obtained mitochondrial protein was suspended in acetone precooled to − 20 °C, stored at − 20 °C for 12 h or more, and centrifuged at 8750 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed, and the centrifugation step was repeated once. On an ultraclean work bench, samples were naturally air-dried on ice, and an appropriate amount of lysate was added to fully dissolve the precipitate. Protein was further dissolved by vortexing [

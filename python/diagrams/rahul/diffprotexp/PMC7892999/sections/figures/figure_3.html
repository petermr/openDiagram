 <caption> Strand specific expression of R2R3â€“MYB TFs and their lncNATs. Coverage data for the sense (green) and antisense (red) strands corresponding to DcMYB7/ asDcMYB7 ( A) and DcMYB6/as DcMYB6 ( B), respectively. Tracks correspond to four carrot libraries: two phloem samples Purple_F1 and Orange F1; and two xylem samples Purple_X1 and Orange_X1. Data Range of each track was set to allow an even visualization of the mRNA and lncRNA transcripts by enlarging the last ones (20x). </caption>

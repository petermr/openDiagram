<p id="Par53">Since the early banana improvement breeding efforts through tissue culture, dwarfism and stem height variants have been commonly observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Remarkable advances have been made to understand the mechanisms governing plant height in banana as well as other fruit trees. However, stem height/elongation is a complex physiological and biological process that involves various biological pathways (GA metabolism, BR, ABA, and auxin), mechanical properties of cell-walls, and coordinated signaling between the growing cells/tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Here, we studied the DEGs and DAMs based on combined transcriptome and metabolome profiling of WT and MT of Pisang Awak Aifen No.1 for insights into the mechanisms related to banana plant height. We discuss the main pathways to which the studied DEGs and DAMs were associated.

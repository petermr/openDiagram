<p id="par0140">The control and HS-treated samples of HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk were used for the identification of DEPs using 2-DE. The gels were scanned and the protein spots were identified using IMP7 software (GE Healthcare) version 7.0.6. (Fig. S1). The gel image of control and HS-treated samples were superimposed over each other in order to identify the DEPs. We observed 88 DEPs in HD3086 with 22 unique protein spots, whereas 58 DEPs was observed in BT-Schomburgk with 11 unique protein spots with high resolutions (

 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Some of the proteins identified in HD3086 are – mitogen-activated protein kinase 2 (spot ID 28), RuBisCo (spot ID 14), oxygen evolving enhancer protein (OEEP; spot ID 52), MAP kinase (spot ID 18), etc. Similarly, protein spots identified in BT-Schomburgk using MALDI-TOF/MS are – CDPK (spot ID 8), HSP16.9 (spot ID 25), SOD (spot ID 2), RuBisCo activase (spot ID 49), OEEP (spot ID 14), etc.

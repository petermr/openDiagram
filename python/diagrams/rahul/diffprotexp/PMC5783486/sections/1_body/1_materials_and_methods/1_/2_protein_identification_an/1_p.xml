<p>iTRAQ labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sciex). Briefly, 100 µg of each protein sample was reduced with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride reducing reagent (Sciex) at 60°C for 1 h, and alkylated with methyl methanethiosulfonate cysteine-blocking reagent (Sciex) for 30 min at room temperature. Then, proteins were digested with 2% trypsin (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) at 37°C overnight, at a ratio of 1:50 (enzyme-to-substrate). Each sample was labelled separately with the iTRAQ tags (118 tag for control, 113 tag for CAA and 116 tag for CAD), then dehydrated by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 4 h at 25°C in a vacuum centrifuge.</p>

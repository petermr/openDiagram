<p id="Par47">The TCGA database was used to identify the differences in the mRNA levels of TUB1AC in normal tissues and LUAD tissues. The data obtained from 535 tumor tissues and 59 normal tissues was analyzed in this study. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, a boxplot was plotted using the data of expression of TUBA1C in normal and tumor tissues. The results indicate that the expression of TUBA1C in tumor tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissues (P = 8.913e-21). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, the Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curve showed a high expression of TUBA1C in LUAD tissues, which indicated poor prognosis of LUAD. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, multivariable analysis was performed by adjusting for the following factors: age, stage, lymph node metastasis, and TUBA1C expression. Furthermore, boxplot, pathological stage plot, and survival curves were constructed by plotting the expression levels of TUBA1C with the help of GEPIA. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, a high expression of TUBA1C was significantly associated with the following parameters: different disease states (Tumor or Normal) (P &lt; 0.05), pathological stage (P = 1.82e-04), overall survival (P = 3.8e−05), and disease-free survival (P = 0.047). Immunohistochemical analysis of TUBA1C expression in 390 cases of lung adenocarcinoma and 60 cases of normal tissues is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a–f. From our data, there is no correlation between the level of TUBA1C expression and clinicopathological parameters of lung adenocarcinoma (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The KM curve analysis of TUBA1C shows the same results as TCGA data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that only the TUBA1C expression was an independent prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h).

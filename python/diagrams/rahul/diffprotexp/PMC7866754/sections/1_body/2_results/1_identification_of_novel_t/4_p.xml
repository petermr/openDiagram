<p id="Par38">Majority of the novel peptides belong to the alternative ORF (AltORF) category, which was defined as the translational products from a non-canonical reading frame of the overlapped coding sequence, including those that fall into introns and the 3′ and 5′ UTR regions of the transcript. AltORFs have previously been found in viruses, bacteriophages as well as humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], but their existence has not yet been reported in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. This suggests that the proteome of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> may be much more complicated than previously thought, and the abundance of AltORFs suggests that the parasite may use it to expand the coding potential of existing genes in the compact genome. Although the functions of AltORFs remain largely unknown, it was thought that the translation of these non-canonical ORFs alone could provide a mechanism for expression control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. It would, therefore, be interesting to investigate if these novel peptides could explain the development of infectivity for human host in the parasite.

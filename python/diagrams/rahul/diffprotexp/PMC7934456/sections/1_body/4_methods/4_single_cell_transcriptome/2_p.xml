<p id="Par45">First, the flower bud sections were treated with 75, 85, and 95% alcohol in a water bath of 58 °C each for 90 s each, followed by n-butanol and absolute ethanol at varying ratios 1:1 and 3:1 at 58 °C twice for 90 s each. Finally, the pre-embedding treatment of the micro-cut material was completed by treatment with n-butanol at 58 °C for 90 s. Subsequently, the sample was immersed in paraffin at 65 °C three times for 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min each, and then embedded in an embedding box. Slides with glass slide membrane were treated with RNase and 75% alcohol. The thickness of the sections was selected according to the depth of the treated material. The flower bud width was sliced 16 μm.</p>

 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. From the TG/DSC spectra in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f007">Figure 7</xref>a, the decomposition of NGO has a major exothermic peak in 218 °C with a 48% mass loss. Enthalpy of decomposition (Δ
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>) could be obtained by integrating the peak area as 662 J·g
 <sup>−1</sup> (negative values indicate exotherm). This level is between the nitroglycerin (353.8 J·g
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (881 J·g
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). Element analysis of NGO and solid remains illustrates that about 4.6% of carbon atoms as well as the whole N, O, and H atoms participate in the decomposition reaction to generate gas products. These gas fragments were measured by synchronous MS analysis. There are two possibilities for the 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 44, namely N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sup>+</sup> and CO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>. The fragment could be determined by the synchronous FTIR analysis that the spectra of gas have characteristic peaks of CO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> (two peaks at 2312 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2368 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). Then the reaction mechanism of NGO could be speculated preliminarily: the decomposition of oxygen-containing groups produces CO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sup>+</sup>; and NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> is from the break of nitro groups; HNO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> may come from the hydrogen atom rearrangement of nitrate groups and then take disproportionation to produce NO

0: The MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of HR and SGR essential oils and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
1: The normal human astrocytes were placed in 96-well culture plates (4  10 4 cells per well) and were treated with various concentrations of HR and SGR essential oils (03200  g/mL) or LPS (1  g/mL) for 24 h. As a control was used the cells incubated in the culture medium, for 24 h. The MTT assay was carried out according to the previous study [ 19].
2: All experiments were repeated three times.

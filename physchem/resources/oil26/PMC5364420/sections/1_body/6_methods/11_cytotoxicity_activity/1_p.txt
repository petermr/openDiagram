0: To assess the cytotoxic effects, the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was used in this study.
1: Cells were seeded into 96 and 24-well plates in 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, antibiotic and antimycotic solution in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 95% air at 37 C. The media was changed on alternative days and once the confluency was reached, the cells were treated with sample at different concentrations.
2: The MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay was performed to determine the cell viability as described in a previous report 2.
3: Briefly, the SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1  10 4 cells/well and grown for 36 h and then subjected with essential oil at concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000 g/mL.
4: After treatments, MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 C and the formed formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO, and then the percentage of cell viability was calculated.
5: For LDH release assay, the SH-SY5Y cells were plated at a density of 5  10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates.
6: After 24 h, the cells were treated with essential oil for 24 h and then lysed with, 10 L of 2% Triton X-100.
7: The cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 C. The supernatant (100 L) was mixed with 900 L of kit reaction mixture and the enzyme activity was measured in terms of intracellular LDH released into the medium at a wavelength of 340 nm.

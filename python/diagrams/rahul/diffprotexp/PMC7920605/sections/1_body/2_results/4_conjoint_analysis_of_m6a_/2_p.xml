<p>Then, we analyzed these common genes by GO and KEGG assays. The GO analysis showed that there were 532 enriched GO terms and these genes were particularly enriched in the tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway, I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, and cellular response to tumor necrosis factor (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">E</xref>). Similarly, KEGG analysis found that 59 pathways were enriched, and these genes were closely related to inflammation-related pathways such as the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway and cell apoptosis. The top 30 enriched GO terms and pathways are shown in

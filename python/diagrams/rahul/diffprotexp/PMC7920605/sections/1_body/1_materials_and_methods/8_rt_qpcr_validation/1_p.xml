<p>RT-qPCR was used to detect candidate gene m6A methylation and mRNA expression levels. Total RNA from MH7A cells and synovial tissues of AA rats was extracted by Mireasy Mini Kit (cat 217004, Qiagen). A Nanodrop nd-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Science, Walsham, Massachusetts, USA) was used to determine the concentration and purity of RNA. Then, cDNA reverse transcription and RT-qPCR reactions were performed using StepOne SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (ABclonal, RK20404). Reactions proceeded using the following conditions: 95°C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 30 s. Melting curves ranging from 60°C to 95°C were included in each run.</p>

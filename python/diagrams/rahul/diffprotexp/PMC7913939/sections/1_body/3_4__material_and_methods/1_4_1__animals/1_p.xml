 </italic> mice of the C57BL/6J genetic background were generated as previously described by 
 <italic>Bueler</italic> et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As controls, we used WT mice from the same genetic background. The body weight of all animals varied between 25 and 35 g and they were either 3 or 9 months-old.

 </italic> mice showed age-dependent behavioral abnormalities as given in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01566">Supplementary Table S1</xref> and and earlier reports [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Five (WT group) and six (

  <sup>−/−</sup>

<p id="Par8">Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differential expressed genes (DEG’s) were carried out against Anole Lizard database to determine the biological process. The DEG’s GO of all the 254 genes revealed highly enriched functional roles and almost 80 enriched terms were listed including genes responsible for muscle system process, muscle tissue morphogenesis, cellular component organization and biogenesis, immune system process and regulation (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In GO of upregulated genes at 2-dpa &amp; 5-dpa, we identified only 5 &amp; 22 high enriched terms whereas at 1-dpa no significant term was identified. Downregulated genes at 1-dpa, 2-dpa &amp; 5-dpa found to be associated with 84, 24 &amp; 5 high enriched terms respectively. The GO terms in upregulated genes included regulation in response to stimulus, anatomical structure morphogenesis, muscle system process, mitochondrial protein complex, cytoskeletal protein binding and among others.

Vegetation greenness provided a measure of resource availability because the aardvarks&#8217; primary prey item, the harvester termite <italic>Hodotermes mossambicus</italic> (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Weyer, 2018</xref>), consumes grass (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nel and Hewitt, 1969</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Symes and Woodborne, 2011</xref>). The higher the EVI, the more abundant or nutritious would have been the termites, and the greater the amount of dietary energy, and dietary water, available readily to the aardvarks. The aardvarks consequently lost body condition when EVI was low (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Weyer, 2018</xref>). Loss of body fat would have compromised the capacity of the aardvarks to respond metabolically to cold. If they were to respond, aardvarks would have to do so behaviourally by retreating to warmer burrows and exploiting ambient warmth during the day. That they did by engaging in diurnal activity, and the lower their minimum 24-h body temperatures were, the greater was the proportion of their active phase that took place diurnally. Many aardvarks died at our study site at the end of the 2013 summer drought (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Rey et al., 2017</xref>), with some aardvarks shifting activity entirely to the daylight hours in the weeks leading up to their deaths. Those deaths and failure of some of our biologging devices reduced our sample size and we did not have continuous measurements of body temperature and activity in the same individuals over the 3.5-year study, but we are confident that our GLMM analyses were robust. Indeed, these analyses have allowed us to present the longest and most comprehensive study on the ecophysiology of free-living aardvarks to date.</p>

0: Data were analysed using linear mixed effect models for variables with a normal distribution (soil moisture and temperature) and generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs) for variables that were not normally distributed (soil compaction, vegetation cover and species richness).
1: These analyses were implemented using the lme4 package 55 and the MASS package 56 in R statistical software 57.
2: Microsites (i.e.
3: burrow entrance, impacted area and control) and burrow age (i.e.
4: fresh, abandoned and collapsed) were set as fixed effects.
5: The location of each burrow and its associated microsites were set as a random effect to account for potential differences in environmental conditions across each study area.
6: Since the impact of burrows on soil temperature may differ between warmer and cooler times of the day 38, the interaction of time and microsite was included as a predictor variable.
7: Soil compaction data were analysed assuming a binomial distribution since the penetrometer data was bounded at both its upper and lower limits.
8: Vegetation cover and species richness data were analysed assuming a binomial and a Poisson distribution respectively.
9: The interaction between microsite and burrow age was included in models when it significantly improved model fit (assessed using the  anova function).
10: However, for models that required analysis using the  glmmPQL function (due to algorithm failure with the  glmer function), formal model comparisons were not possible.
11: In such analyses the more complex model (i.e.
12: including the interaction term) was only reported when the interaction terms coefficients were significantly different from zero.

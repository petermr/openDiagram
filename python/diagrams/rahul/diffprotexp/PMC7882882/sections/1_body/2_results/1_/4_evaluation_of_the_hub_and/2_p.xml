<p>RT-qPCR was conducted to confirm the reliability of the expression profiles generated using the microarray and DEG analyses. Among the prognostic hub and module genes aforementioned, NOL6 and LL21NC02-21A1.1 were randomly selected for verification (P&lt;0.05; 
 <xref rid="f6-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). As expected, the RT-qPCR results basically matched those of the microarray analyses. These results indicated that the bioinformatics analysis of the microarray data reliably identified critical candidate genes involved in NFPA recurrence.

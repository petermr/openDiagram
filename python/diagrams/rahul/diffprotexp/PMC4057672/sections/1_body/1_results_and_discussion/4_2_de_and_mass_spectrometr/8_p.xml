<p>High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is a non-histone chromatin-binding protein, and a highly phosphorylated protein. HMGB1 is involved in gene transcription and DNA replication, repair and recombination by assembling and stabilizing the nucleosomes and binding to transcription factors [

Studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines TNF-α or IL-1 can stimulate monocyte-macrophages to release HMGB1, which reversely stimulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and induces the chemotaxis of neutrophils. HMGB1 also plays an important role in the development of anti-virus vaccines [

The expression level of HMGB1 significantly increased in the experimental group, which might be the direct result of this inflammatory response.

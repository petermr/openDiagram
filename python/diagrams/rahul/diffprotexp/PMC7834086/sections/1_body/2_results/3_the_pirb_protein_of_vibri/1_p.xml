<p>After establishing that PirB could interact with histones, we explored the functional significance of this interaction. First, the effects of purified endotoxin-free rPirB protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5a</xref>) on primary shrimp hemocytes were examined. Hemocyte apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry after treating primary shrimp hemocytes with purified endotoxin-free rPirB protein, PBS (negative control), or apoptosis inducer A (positive control) for 4 h, followed by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5b</xref>, a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells was observed in the rPirB-treated cells than in control (PBS). The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of PirB on shrimp hemocytes was also determined by injecting shrimp with purified endotoxin-free rPirB protein or with sterile PBS as negative control, followed by harvesting hemocytes from hemolymph, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and flow cytometry analysis. It was observed that the proportion of apoptotic cells in rPirB-injected shrimp were significantly higher at 24 h (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05), 36 h (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05) and 48 h (
 <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.01) compared with PBS injected shrimp at the same time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5c</xref>). These results suggest that PirB protein from VP
 <sub>AHPND</sub> induces apoptosis in shrimp hemocytes under both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.

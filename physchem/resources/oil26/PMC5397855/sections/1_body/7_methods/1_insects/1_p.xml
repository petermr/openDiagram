<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Individuals of <italic>T. molitor</italic> were obtained from the Laboratory of Biological Control of the Institute of Applied Biotechnology to Agriculture (BIOAGRO, Universidade Federal de Vi&#231;osa) in Vi&#231;osa, Minas Gerais State, Brasil. Adults of <italic>T. molitor</italic> were kept in plastic trays (60&#8201;cm long&#8201;&#215;&#8201;40&#8201;cm wide&#8201;&#215;&#8201;12&#8201;cm) and maintained at 25&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1&#8201;&#176;C, 70&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10% RH and 12:12&#8201;h L:D photoperiod. These adults were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> with wheat bran (12% protein, 2% lipids, 75% carbohydrates and 11% mineral/sugar), pieces of sugarcane, <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> (L.) (Poaceae) and chayote <italic>Sechium edule</italic> (Jacq.) Swartz (Cucurbitaceae). Sheets of paper were placed on the substrate to prevent the stress from insects and facilitate oviposition. Healthy larvae, pupae and adults of <italic>T. molitor</italic> without amputations, apparent malformations or nutritional deficiencies were used in the bioassays.</p>

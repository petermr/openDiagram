<abstract xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><p><italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> L. (Cyperaceae) is a medicinal herb traditionally used to treat various clinical conditions at home. In this study, chemical composition of <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> rhizomes essential oil, and <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant, DNA damage protective and cytotoxic activities as well as antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens were investigated. Results showed that &#945;-cyperone (38.46%), cyperene (12.84%) and &#945;-selinene (11.66%) were the major components of the essential oil. The essential oil had an excellent antioxidant activity, the protective effect against DNA damage, and cytotoxic effects on the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell, as well as antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens. These biological activities were dose-dependent, increasing with higher dosage in a certain concentration range. The antibacterial effects of essential oil were greater against Gram-positive bacteria as compared to Gram-negative bacteria, and the antibacterial effects were significantly influenced by incubation time and concentration. These results may provide biological evidence for the practical application of the <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes essential oil in food and pharmaceutical industries.</p></abstract>

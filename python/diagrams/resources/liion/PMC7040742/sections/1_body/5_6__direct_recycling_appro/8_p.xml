 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> as the lithium precursor. Although the optimal process temperatures were similar in both studies, the 12 h duration claimed by Sloop was significantly longer than the 4 h one proposed by Shi et al. Both processes ended with final annealing, at a temperature slightly higher in Shi et al.’s study (800 °C). Sloop’s process flowchart is shown in

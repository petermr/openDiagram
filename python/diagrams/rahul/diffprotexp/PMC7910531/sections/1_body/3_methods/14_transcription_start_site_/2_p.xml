<p id="Par54">Across all genes, 47.9% had the same most abundant transcript in at least 90% of samples in both cartilage and synovium; 71% of genes had the same most abundant transcript in 60% of samples in cartilage and synovium. We mapped the most abundant transcript (using the ENST identifier) to GRCh37 using ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/grch37/release-87/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.87.chr.gtf.gz. For 93 transcripts, ENSG identifiers differed between the builds, therefore genes were identified by a composite ID in the format GeneName(b37)_ENSG. We excluded 1940 transcripts with missing start or end positions (largely in patched genome build regions), and ~500 transcripts mapped to chromosomes X, Y or mitochondrial DNA, we established the TSS for 13,180 autosomal genes included in the cartilage and 13,708 genes included in the synovium molQTL analysis.</p>

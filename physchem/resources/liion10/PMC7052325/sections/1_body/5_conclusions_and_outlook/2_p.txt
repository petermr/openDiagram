0: As summarized in  Figure 2B, the impressive progress has been achieved with the conductivity of initially 10 3 S cm 1 at 800C improved to be 10 4 S cm 1 at ambient temperature.
1: Despite the efforts, phosphates are still far from to meet the requirement of high ionic conductivity at low temperature and show poor progress over decades, demonstrating little promise as Mg solid conductors.
2: In contrast, significant improvements in conductivity have been shown by the recent development of borohydrides, chalcogenides and MOFs.
3: These novel solid conductors should be the development emphasis in next stage.

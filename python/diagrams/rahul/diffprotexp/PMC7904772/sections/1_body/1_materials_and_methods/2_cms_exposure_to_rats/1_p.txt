0: The animals were habituated to sucrose consumption and the CMS procedure was carried out, as described previously 22.
1: Based on baseline sucrose intake from the three tests, the rats were divided randomly among the stressed or control units.
2: The stressed sample was subjected to CMS for 8 weeks, while the control group remained without intervention.
3: Paired housing, a soiled cage, a 45 cage tilt, water scarcity, strobe light, continuous lighting, an empty water bottle, and white noise were used to form the CMS model.

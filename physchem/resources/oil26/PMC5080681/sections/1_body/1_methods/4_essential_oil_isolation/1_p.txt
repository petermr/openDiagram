0: The microwave-ultrasonic method is a recently developed method used for the extraction of essential oils from medicinal plants.
1: In this method, the volatile oil was extracted using a microwave oven with ultra-sonication.
2: However, during the extraction process, the powder suspension being extracted was exposed to ultrasonic waves to improve the extraction process.
3: In this study, the apparatus consisting of a microwave oven combined with an ultrasonic extractor was used (Ultrasonic-microwave Cooperative Extractor/Reactor (CW-2000, China)).
4: A one L round bottom flask containing about 100 g of the plant was placed in this apparatus.
5: In this flask, the plant was suspended in about 500 ml deionized water.
6: Then, the flask was connected with Clevenger apparatus, which was placed in the same apparatus.
7: While carrying out the extraction process, the power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000 W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was adjusted at its maximum power as well (50 W and at a frequency of 40 kHz).
8: The extraction process using this apparatus was conducted for 10 min at 100 C. This process was repeated three times.
9: The obtained volatile oil was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried and stored in well closed dark amber colored bottles in the refrigerator at 4 C. The yield of this extraction method was 1.4 % w/w based on the fresh weight.

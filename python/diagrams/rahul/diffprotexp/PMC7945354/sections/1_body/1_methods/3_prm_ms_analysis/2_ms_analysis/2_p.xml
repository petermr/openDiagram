<p id="Par33">The samples were chromatographed and analyzed by a Q Exactive mass spectrometer with the following parameters; analysis time of 60 min; detection method was positive ion; precursor ion scan range of 350–1500 m/z, resolution of the primary MS was 60,000; AGC target was 3e6; and primary maximum IT was 45 ms. The mass-to-charge ratios of peptides and peptide fragments were collected according to the following method: 10 fragment patterns (MS2 scan) were collected after each full scan (MS2 scan); MS2 activation type was HCD; isolation window was 2 m/z; MSMS resolution rate was 15,000, AGC target was 2e5; secondary Maximum IT was 45 ms; and normalized collision energy was 27 eV.</p>

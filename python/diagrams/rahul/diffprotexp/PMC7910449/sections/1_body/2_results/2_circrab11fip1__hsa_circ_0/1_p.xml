<p id="Par19">Based on the circRNA, mRNA, and miRNA results, a regulatory network between circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA was constructed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). MiR-219a, miR-129, miR-146a, miR-23a, and miR-130b have been proven to regulate autophagy. CircRAB11FIP1 (hsa_circ_0005630) may potentially bind to miR-219a, miR-146a, miR-23a, and miR-129. CircTCF20 (hsa_circ_0008561) may potentially bind to miR-23a, miR-130b, and miR-129-5p. Therefore, this study investigated whether circRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 were involved in autophagy. First, the expression of circRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 was detected by qPCR in ovarian cancer SKOV3 and A2780 cells. Torin 1 induced the expression of circRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 in SKOV3 and A2780 cells. The higher the concentration of Torin 1, the higher the expression of circRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B, C</xref>). The expression of circRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 was higher in SKOV3 cells than in A2780 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B, C</xref>). Also, the expression of circRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 was detected in 30 EOC and 30 matched non-carcinoma tissue samples. The expression of circRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 increased compared with that in normal ovarian tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D, E</xref>).

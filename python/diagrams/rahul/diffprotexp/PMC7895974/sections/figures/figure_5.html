 <caption> Identification of a regulatory element for TCF15. a ATAC-seq profile at the TCF15 locus. Grey boxes indicate putative enhancers identified ( TCF15 Enh-1 and TCF15 Enh-2). RARA footprint identified within TCF15 Enh-2. Mutant reporter sequence for TCF15 Enh-2 RARA mutant. b TCF15 Enh-1 ( n = 15/15) and c TCF15 Enh-2 ( n = 9/9) reporter expression in presomitic mesoderm (Psm), notochord (Nc), somites (So) and lateral plate mesoderm (Lpm). d Combined TCF15 Enh-1/Enh-2 reporter expression ( n = 9/9). e Transverse sections of embryo in c immunostained for Citrine showing TCF15 Enh-2 expression in somites and lateral plate mesoderm, white dashed line in c indicates location of section, representative of ( n = 4/4). Nuclei stained with DAPI (blue). f TCF15 Enh-2 Citrine reporter with RARA binding site mutation displays lack of expression in somites ( n = 6/6). Epigenome engineering using dCas9-Krab with ( g) control scrambled sgRNAs resulted in no change ( n = 8/9) and ( h) sgRNAs targeting endogenous RARA binding site led to loss of TCF15 expression ( n = 6/8) as shown by wholemount in situ hybridisation. i Percentage of embryos with normal (blue) or reduced (orange) TCF15 in situ expression after electroporation of control scrambled sgRNA with dCas9-Krab or sgRNAs targeting TCF15 Enh-2 RARA binding site with dCas9-Krab. All scale bars = 500 μm except for e scale bar = 100 μm. </caption>

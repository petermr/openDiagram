<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Supplementary Table 2). The oldest ToxB-sensitive accession identified was the spring variety &#8216;Thatcher&#8217; (released in the USA in 1934), followed by &#8216;Aronde&#8217; (France, 1962) and &#8216;Maris Dove&#8217; (UK, 1971). Analysis of the pedigree found three varieties to act as &#8216;hubs&#8217; for frequent transmission of ToxB sensitivity: (1) &#8216;Xi19&#8217; (UK, year of release&#8201;=&#8201;2000, sensitivity&#8201;=&#8201;2.9) had six sensitive descendants (&#8216;Cocoon&#8217;, &#8216;Cubanita&#8217;, &#8216;Curlew&#8217;, &#8216;Gallant&#8217;, &#8216;KWS Curlew&#8217; and &#8216;Panorama&#8217;), collectively representing 15% of the sensitive European varieties identified. (2) &#8216;Cordiale&#8217; (UK, 2001, sensitivity&#8201;=&#8201;1.2) had 12 sensitive descendants, representing around a quarter of ToxB-sensitive accessions. (3) The winter wheat variety &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; (UK, 1997), parent or grandparent of 12 sensitive varieties, representing 27% of all ToxB-sensitive lines identified. Despite its prominence in the pedigree of ToxB-sensitive varieties, &#8216;Aardvark&#8217; was found to be insensitive. All three &#8216;hub&#8217; varieties shared features in common: all were formally found to have ToxB-insensitive parents, and all had &#8216;Cadenza&#8217; or a sib of &#8216;Cadenza&#8217; listed as one of their parents (Fig.&#160;

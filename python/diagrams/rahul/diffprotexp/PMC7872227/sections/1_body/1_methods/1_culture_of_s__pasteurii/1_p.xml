 <italic>pasteurii</italic> strain (BNCC 337394) used in this study was purchased from Bnbio (Beina Chuanglian Biotechnology Institute, Beijing). The whole genome sequencing results of this strain were uploaded to NCBI (NZ_CP038012.1) in March 2019 [
 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The received bacterial lyophilized powder was first activated with premade activation medium (tryptone 5g/L, yeast extract 3g/L, urea 20g/L, pH = 7.3) and incubated at 30°C for 24 hours. Then, the obtained small amount of bacterial culture was streaked onto Christensen’s Urea Agar [
 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] plate and grow at 30°C for 24 hours. A single colony with good growth potential was selected for expansion and subsequent studies. The medium was the NH
 <sub>4</sub>-YE medium recommended by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

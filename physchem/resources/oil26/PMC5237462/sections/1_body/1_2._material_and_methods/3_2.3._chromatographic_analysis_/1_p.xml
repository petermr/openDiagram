<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The essential oil analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the Federal University of S&#227;o Carlos (UFSCar). We used Shimadzu equipment, GCMS Shimadzu QP 5000, and employed a capillary column of fused silica OPTIMA&#174; 5&#8211;0.25&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>m, 30&#8201;m in length, and 0.25&#8201;mm internal diameter and nitrogen as a carrier gas. The gas chromatograph operating conditions were as follows: internal column pressure of 67.5&#8201;kPa, split ratio 1&#8201;:&#8201;20, the gas flow in column 1.2&#8201;mL/min. (210&#176;C), injector temperature 260&#176;C, and the temperature detector or the interface (GC-MS) of 280&#176;C. The initial column temperature was 50&#176;C followed by an increase of 6&#176;C/min. up to 260&#176;C and maintained constant for 30&#8201;min. The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform readings in a range 29&#8211;400&#8201;Da, 0.5&#8201;s intervals with ionization energy of 70&#8201;eV.</p>

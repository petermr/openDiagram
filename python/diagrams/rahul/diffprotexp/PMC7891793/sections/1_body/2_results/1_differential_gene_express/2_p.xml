<p>Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246695.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) did not show strong separation of samples from any treatment group but demonstrated apparent difference between samples from lesions and lung tissue without lesions. The highest number of differentially expressed genes (60 genes) with p&lt;0.05 was observed in group 3 –placebo (
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the lowest number of differentially expressed genes was in group 1, treated with only ibuprofen, starting at day 3. In other groups the number of differentially expressed genes was in the range from 36 to 48. Lists of genes are presented in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246695.s003">S1 File</xref>). Area-proportional Venn diagrams (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246695.g002">Fig 2</xref>) visually demonstrate that the number of differentially expressed genes was relatively smaller in groups where ibuprofen was administered without FPI in comparison to the placebo group, which showed 39.39% differentially expressed genes that were unique for this group in this set of comparisons. A similar picture was observed when these two groups were compared to group 4, treated with fusion protein inhibitor only. Groups with combined (ibuprofen + FPI) treatment demonstrated larger proportions of non-shared DE genes and, at the same time, larger proportions of genes shared with both placebo and FPI only groups. In the attempt to identify functional significance of these differences in gene expression, lists of genes that differentially expressed uniquely in certain treatment groups were generated (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246695.s004">S2 File</xref>). Comparing gene IDs of 3 lists of genes uniquely expressed in sets of comparison of groups 1-2-3, 1-3-6 and 2-3-5 demonstrated 37.5% (data not shown) genes common for all 3 sets and genes from 2-3-5 almost completely overlap with 1-2-3. Functional analysis of these 3 gene sets demonstrated following GO terms significantly enriched in all 3 gene sets: “negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to stress” (adjusted p = 0.0003), “regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to stress” (p = 0.003) and “regulation of DNA-templated transcription in response to stress” (p = 0.002). 2 genes (DNAJB1 and TMBIM6) are associated with these GO terms and were uniquely differentially expressed in lung lesions of the placebo group. Notably, expression of DNAJB1 was 3.15 log fold change (logFc) higher in lung lesion than in non-lesion, but TMBIM6 was 0.8 logFc lower in lung lesion. Both genes had relatively high average expression, if compared to other genes.

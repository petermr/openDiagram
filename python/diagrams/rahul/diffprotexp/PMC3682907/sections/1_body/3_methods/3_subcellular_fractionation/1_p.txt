0: Two tissue homogenization methods were tested.
1: In the first method (M1), 60 m tissue slices (approximately 250 mg) were cut and a Brinkmann blender was employed to homogenize the tissue.
2: In the second method (M2), small blocks (approximately 250 mg) of brain tissue were cut and homogenized with a Teflon pestle homogenizer.
3: For both homogenization methods, frozen brain tissue was suspended in whole cell homogenization buffer (20 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.9 0.5% NP-40, 5% glycerol, with protease inhibitors (P2714, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)).
4: The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4C.
5: The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 minutes at 4C.
6: The supernatant was removed and stored at -80C as the cytosolic fraction.
7: The pellet containing the mitochondrially enriched fraction was washed twice in 20 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4.
8: The mitochondria were then lysed in mitochondrial lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 7M urea, 3% CHAPS with protease inhibitors) for 20 minutes at room temperature.
9: The mitochondrial lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4C.
10: A modified Lowry protein assay was used to determine the protein concentration.
11: All samples were stored at -80C until further analysis.

<p>In addition to transition metal oxides, phosphides, nitrides, chalcogenides and borides have also been proposed as promising catalysts for OER. The advantage of these systems is their significantly higher electrical conductivity. At the same time, due to the fact that these materials are thermodynamically less stable under OER conditions than the respective oxides, they might get oxidized under reaction conditions, and consequently, the actual active species might be again the oxides, hydroxides and oxyhydroxides formed on their surface.

 </sup> XAS data available for these materials confirm this hypothesis. For example, a pronounced metal–P contribution was observed in the EXAFS spectra for the as-prepared highly conductive amorphous NiFeP,

 </sup> However, after their exposure to OER conditions, the formation of oxide and hydroxide species was observed, as evidenced by shifts in the respective absorption edges and the appearance of metal–oxygen contributions in the EXAFS spectra.

 </sup> Similarly, the oxidation of the Co species and the formation of a CoOOH-like surface layer after exposure to reaction conditions were observed via XAS in another promising catalyst for OER, namely Co
 <sub>4</sub>N nanowires.

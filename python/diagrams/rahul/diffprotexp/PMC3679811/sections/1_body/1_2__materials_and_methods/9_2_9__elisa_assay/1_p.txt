0: Each peritoneal dialysate sample was analyzed for the concentrations of APOA1 (E-80AP1, Immunology Consultants Laboratory), alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin preproprotein (AMBP) (E90217Hu, Uscn Life Science Inc.), mutant retinol-binding protein (RBP4) (E90929Hu, Uscn Life Science Inc.), and haptoglobin (HP) (E-80HPT, Immunology Consultants Laboratory) in duplicate, using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.
1: The protein concentrations were tested by standard protocols, according to the suggestion of the manufacturers.
2: The model of ELISA reader was Multiskan EX, which was made by Thermo Scientific (Vantaa, Finland).
3: Statistical significance was determined by using the two-tailed Fisher exact test at  P< 0.05 and ROC analysis.

<p>Next, we analyzed the RNA-seq data in the control and CPSF1-siRNA transfected groups using DaPars algorithm to identify 3′ UTR alteration profiles. The significantly differential APA genes were determined by three criteria: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, ΔPDUI ≥ 0.2, and absolute PDUI fold change ≥ 1.5. Consequently, 36 shortened and seven lengthened transcripts were identified, of which 40 were protein-coding and three were non-coding transcripts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, previous reports indicated that CPSF1 binds to the canonical AAUAAA or similar motifs AUUAAA located 10–50 nt upstream of the 3′ UTR. Analysis of the motif distribution of these 43 transcripts indicated a preferentially high enrichment in the distal polyadenylation sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), further suggesting that CPSF1 preferentially selects distal compared to proximal polyadenylation sites.

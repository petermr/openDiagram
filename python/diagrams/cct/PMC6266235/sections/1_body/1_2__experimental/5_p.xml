<p>The Metallographic specimens of simulated HAZs were polished and etched with 2% nital before conventional light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100UHR STEM/EDS, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) studies were carried out on thin foils. Thin foils were prepared by cutting thin wafers from the simulated HAZ samples, and grinding to 0.1 mm in thickness. Three millimeter discs were punched from the wafers, and were electropolished using a solution of 5% perchloric acid/95% acetic acid. Foils were examined by conventional transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV using standard bright field and dark field imaging techniques.</p>

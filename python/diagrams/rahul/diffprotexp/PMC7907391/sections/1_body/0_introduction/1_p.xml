<p id="Par2">Currently, cancer patients comprise a greater than expected proportion of all patients who have Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). Initial studies in Wuhan, China reported that approximately 1 in 14 hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cancer

 </sup>. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed the pooled prevalence of cancer was 3.50% (95% CI 1.70–5.80) and pooled risk ratio for a cancer patient to develop severe disease to be 1.76 (95% CI 1.39–2.23) across 20 studies and 32,404 patients from the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Singapore, Thailand, France, India, South Korea, as well as China

These data are corroborated by our own institutional experience, whereby routine COVID testing for all cancer patients during March to June 2020 showed a positivity rate of 0.83% (29/3,491), on a background of 2,191 active COVID-19 cases in a metropolitan population of 2.9 M in Toronto, Canada (0.08%)

<p>The topical combination without 4-MU (formulation no.13) had the highest skin HA levels (535.248 ng/µg protein) in these cohort of animals. The last 6 animals (animals 15–20) were experimental replicates, administered with a topical formulation at the midpoint of the CCD; all 6 resulted in a consistent degree of HA reduction in the skin.</p>

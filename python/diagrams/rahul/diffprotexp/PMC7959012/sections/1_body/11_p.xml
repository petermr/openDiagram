<p>In the analysis of the KEGG pathway, it was found that a large number of pathways associated with amino acids, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters in the RPE cells of the mice in the myopic model, as well as the oxidation-related pathways (such as the fructose/mannose metabolism) and galactose metabolism pathway, were activated, suggesting the occurrence of glycolysis [

Some related pathways concerning the dysfunction of neurons and neurotransmitters, such as the dopaminergic synapses, glutamate, and cholinergic synaptic signalling pathways, were also found (the dysfunction of neurotransmitters may affect the development of RPE) [

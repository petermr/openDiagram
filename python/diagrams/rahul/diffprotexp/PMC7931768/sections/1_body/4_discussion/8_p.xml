<p>There are two, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms to explain the finding that mean fold change of IFN genes was higher in skin relative to whole blood involving either pDCs and associated inflammatory infiltrates and/or keratinocytes. In subjects with SLE, pDC numbers are decreased in blood.
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> By contrast, pDC numbers are increased in target organs including kidney
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52 53</xref> and skin.
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54 55</xref> pDCs isolated from CLE skin biopsies express multiple IFN-α subtypes, IFN-β and IFN-ε.
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> As potent producers of IFN, localised, tissue-based enrichment of pDCs as part of an inflammatory infiltrate also expressing elevated levels of IFN-induced genes
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 57</xref> may contribute to enhancement of IFN-stimulated gene expression in the target organ. In addition, cross-talk among the cells involved in CLE dermatitis, including NK, B and T, myeloid and pDCs may promote increased expression of IFN by pDCs and keratinocytes.

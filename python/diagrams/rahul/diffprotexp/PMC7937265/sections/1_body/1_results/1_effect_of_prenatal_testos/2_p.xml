<p id="Par33">Aggression was assayed in 15 min same-sex conspecific intrusion trials in adult males (mean age = 138 days post-hatch ±14 SE), during which the number of aggressive actions performed by the subject toward the intruder were recorded. Two assays were performed over separate days (mean = 48 days apart ±5 SE) and aggression scores were averaged. Repeatability of aggression was significant across the two behavioral trials (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.64 ± 0.18 SE; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005), suggesting individuals were moderately consistent in the way they responded to conspecific intruders. Males from T-injected eggs displayed more aggressive behaviors than controls (β = 0.76, 0.08–1.44 95% CI;

 <sub>1,21</sub> = 4.53, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.045; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); laying order was not significantly related to aggression (β = 0.12, − 0.18-0.43 95% CI; 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,21</sub> = 0.59, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.450). We collected trunk blood and brain tissue from unrelated males from each treatment group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3/treatment) at the completion of the behavioral assays. Plasma T measured in trunk blood did not significantly differ by prenatal treatment (β = 0.07, − 2.59-2.45 95% CI; 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>2.4</sub> = − 0.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.926; T treated: 2.12 ng/mL ± 0.19 SE; control: 2.05 ± 0.65 SE), although this finding should be interpreted cautiously as the power to detect statistical significance was low.

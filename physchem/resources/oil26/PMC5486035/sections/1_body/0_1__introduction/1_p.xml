<p>Plants producing essential oils represent a large part of natural flora and an important resource in various fields such as the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries, thanks to their flavour, fragrance, and biological activities [

Essential oils are a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons arising from the isoprenoid pathways and secreted by glandular trichomes disseminated mainly onto the surface of plant organs; therefore, they have a pivotal role in the growth and colonization of plants, conferring colour and scent to reproductive organs, attracting pollinators and favouring seed dispersal [

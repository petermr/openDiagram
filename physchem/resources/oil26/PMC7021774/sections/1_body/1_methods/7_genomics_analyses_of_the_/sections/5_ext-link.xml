(3) The two repeat masked sequences were aligned using minimap2 v2.16, using the &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; region as reference and with the command line options:&#8216;&#8211;cs&#8201;=&#8201;long -c -t 20 -K 500&#160;M &#8211;Y&#8217;. Methods for the liftover of the &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; gene models are further described in Supplementary Text 1. (4) RNA-seq reads (&gt;&#8201;8 billion) from BioProject accession numbers PRJDB2496, PRJEB12497, PRJEB25593, PRJEB25639, PRJEB25640, PRJNA213168, PRJNA243835 were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive (SRA). Further details on the processing of the RNA-seq data and subsequent transcript assembly, gene model and splice junction prediction are listed in Supplementary Text 1. (5) Protein datasets sourced from the genome assemblies of three cereal species (listed in Supplementary Text 1) were aligned to our synthetic 2B fragment from &#8216;W7984&#8217; that spanned the

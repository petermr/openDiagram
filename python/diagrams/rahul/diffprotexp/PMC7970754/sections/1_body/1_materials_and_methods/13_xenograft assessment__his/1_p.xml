<p>During the administration period, the body weight of the nude mice was measured every 4 days, and the longest diameter (a) and shortest diameter (b) of the tumor were measured with a Vernier caliper. Accordingly, 48 h after the last administration, the experimental animals were euthanized, the tumor was weighed, and the tumor inhibition rate was calculated. The tumor tissues were fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution for 24h and were subsequently fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of the dissected biopsies were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) using standard procedure and were examined under light microscopy. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with anti-PCNA (Abcam, USA), anti-Ki-67 (Maixin, China), and anti-Cleaved-Caspase3 monoclonal antibody (CST, USA). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was added and detected according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Maixin, China). Moreover, the imageJ software was used for image analysis.</p>

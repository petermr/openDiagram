 <caption> PCA analysis of GI cancer. Principal component analysis of liver cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and esophageal cancer according to genes expression level. N = 1,695 data points. X and Y axes show principal component 1 and principal component 2 that explain 39.5 and 16.4% of the total variance, respectively. Prediction ellipses are such that with probability 0.95, a new observation from the same group will fall inside the ellipse. The further apart the two samples are, the greater the difference in genetic background between them will be. </caption>

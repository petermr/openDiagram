<p id="Par54">Finally, the correlation between the protein expression of high-quality nORFs and that of their associated canonical gene was tested. By computing the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) values, it was possible to compare the expression across proteins and samples, which were used to perform Pearson Correlation analysis. In total, nORFs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) that showed significant expression correlation (p-values &lt; 0.05) with the parent gene were identified, which are all AltORFs except for one 3′ UTR. It is worth noting that majority of them showed positive correlation, suggesting that either a positive regulation on the parent gene is a wide-spread scenario in nORFs, or that their expression is a by-product of the canonical translation event via mechanisms such as ribosome shifting [

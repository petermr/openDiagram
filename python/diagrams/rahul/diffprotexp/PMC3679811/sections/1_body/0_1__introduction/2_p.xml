<p>Finding biomarkers in the complex biological matrix of proteins in the peritoneal dialysate for DM is a challenge. Although there are numerous proteins, lipids, and metabolic products in dialysate samples, disease biomarkers often appear at low concentrations. High-abundance proteins such as albumin, IgG, and fibrinogen are dominant and may repress the signals of the low-abundance proteins. In recent years, several maturing analytical tools have been applied in proteomic research, such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry analysis, which have provided much information on body fluid analysis [

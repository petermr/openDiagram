<p id="Par8">Plant samples in two biological replicates per treatment were used for sequencing on Illumina HiSeq sequencer at Genotypic Technology, Bangalore (India) to generate 150 base pair length paired-end reads. On an average 46.08 million raw sequencing reads for each treatment samples were generated which were processed for quality assessment and low-quality filtering before the assembly. The raw data generated was checked for the quality using FastQC

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Data with Q-score above 30 (&gt;â€‰99.9% correct) was taken as high quality data.

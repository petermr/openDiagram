0: The plant material was a wild type (WT) of a dwarf banana Aifen No.
1: 1 ( Musa spp.
2: Pisang Awak sub-group ABB) and its semi-dwarf mutant (MT).
3: The MT was obtained from tissue-culture induced somaclonal variations in Aifen No.
4: 1 WT at Institute of Fruit Tree Research, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, China by the corresponding author of this article (Professor Ou Sheng).
5: The specimens used in this study have neither been reported nor submitted in any herbarium.
6: The MT and WT were grown in nutrient-soil for four weeks of rooting and two days of hardening.
7: After this, the seedlings were grown to reach five to six leaf stage (6 weeks old).
8: The relative humidity, temperature, and photoperiod were 28 C, 60 ~ 80%, and 12 h (1500  200 lx), respectively.
9: After six weeks, the banana plantlets had five to six true leaves.
10: Triplicate pseudostems for WT as well as for MT were then cut and used for transcriptome and metabolome analyses (Fig.
11: 1a).

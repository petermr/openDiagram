0: By using graph theory algorithms, we can find critical vertices to control a network.
1: For example, [ 8] developed a feedback-based framework that provides realizable node overrides that steer a system towards one of its natural long-term dynamic behaviours; [ 9] provided a rational criterion for selecting key molecules to control a system with a feedback vertex set (FVS); [ 10] proposed a network control strategy to find driver mutations that drive a regulation network from the normal state to a disease state; and [ 11] considered applying minimum feedback vertex sets (MFVS) to real biologically directed complex networks and found essential proteins in both  Drosophila melanogaster and  Homo sapiens organisms.

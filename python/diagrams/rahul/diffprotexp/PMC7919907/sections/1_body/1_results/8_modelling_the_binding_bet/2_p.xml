<p>Collectively, the proposed antiviral mechanism of action of LF against coronaviruses is shown in 
 <xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8(F)</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles are recruited to cell surface by interaction with HSPGs, facilitating subsequent specific binding to ACE2 receptor and following internalization of the virion. LF binds to cell surface HSPGs, which blocks the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and HSPGs and subsequent viral attachment to host cells.

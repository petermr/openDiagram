   <bold>a</bold>) Heap map expression of 
   <italic>Hemidactylus frenatus</italic> transcript during tail tissue regeneration. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Heat map expression of differentially expressed proteins which are associated with tail regeneration; (
   <bold>c</bold>) Heat map expression of various genes differentially regulated during regeneration based on RTPCR analysis. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Venn diagram for number genes identified from Transcriptomics, proteomics and Real time PCR based gene expression analysis; e. Batches of genes/proteins which are differentially expressed at 1, 2 and 5-dpa. Genes/proteins which are in the red/organge arrow indicates the upregulation and in the green arrow indicates the downregulation.

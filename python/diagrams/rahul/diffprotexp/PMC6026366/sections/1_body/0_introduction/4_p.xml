 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, an internationally recognized model for studying life span that is widely used in antiaging medical research, was used to elucidate this issue 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. A proteomic approach of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to investigate changes in age-related specific indicators and relative abundance of proteins in expression caused by feeding with red ginseng extract (RGE). Our findings could be helpful in revealing the mechanisms and addressing biological questions underlying the effects of red ginseng on life span and antiaging.

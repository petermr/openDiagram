0: The pulmonary  Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease is the most common in NTM diseases, responsible for over 80% of NTM diseases [ 4].
1: The pulmonary MAC disease is generated due to either  M. avium subsp.
2: hominissuis (MAH) or  M. intracellulare and their prevalence differ from country to country.
3: The prevalence of pulmonary MAC disease due to MAH is seven times more than that due to  M. intracellulare [ 5].
4: The establishment of MAC diseases is associated with many factors; one of these factors is the bacterium themselves.
5: To elucidate the mechanism of pathogenicity related to these bacterial factors that affect the establishment of MAC disease, many genomic and transcriptomic studies have been done.
6: The complete genome of  M. avium different subspecies and strains has been sequenced: MAH [ 6, 7] and  M. avium subsp.
7: paratuberculosis [ 8].
8: However, the RNA sequencing for  M. avium was performed for the transcriptome profiling [ 9, 10].
9: Moreover, microarray was used in functional genomic research of  M. avium, enabling a deeper analysis of their genomic diversity and an accurate measuring of most of their gene expressions [ 11].

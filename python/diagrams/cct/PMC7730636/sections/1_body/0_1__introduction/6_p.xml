<p>The material acts against every deformation, and this reaction is called deformation resistance. The deformation resistance is related to the temperature, deformation rate and the value of the deformation. Therefore, stress affecting the material must be higher than deformation resistance in order to achieve plastic deformation and consequently required shape change of the material. The forging of semi- products at higher temperatures is also one of the fundamental steps in the production of advanced high-strength steel. The combination of phase transformation and the forging (deformation) allow significant increase of the steel strength properties. The investigations using quenching and deformation dilatometer were carried out with controlling different deformation parameters, i.e., the degree of deformation (by how much the sample is to be deformed), the deformation rate and the temperature at which the deformation occurs [

<p>Replication kinetics measured by viral genome quantification revealed no significant difference between the three variants throughout the course of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection on both BGM and CaLu-3 cell lines (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, a significant difference was observed between cell lines for each variant, with an increased level of replication on BGM (as early as 24 h post-inoculation). More specifically, viral replication spiked rapidly on BGM cells within the first 48 h, before reaching a plateau at 72 h. Conversely, viral replication on CaLu-3 cells rose steadily within the first 48 h, before reaching a plateau at 96 h. Of interest, a 2-log difference was observed for maximum genome quantification between BGM and CaLu-3, with an average of 5.76 × 10
 <sup>12</sup> and 4.01 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> copies/mL, respectively.

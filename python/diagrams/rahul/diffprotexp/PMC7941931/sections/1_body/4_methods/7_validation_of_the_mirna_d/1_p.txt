0: The 5-RLM-RACE method was used to investigate the miRNA-directed cleavage of their predicted target mRNA in vitro.
1: Total RNA was ligated to an RNA adaptor and was reverse transcribed using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
2: The 5-RLM-RACE was performed as described previously by DeBoer et al.
3: [ 6].
4: The primers used in this experiment are listed in Additional file  1: Table S13.

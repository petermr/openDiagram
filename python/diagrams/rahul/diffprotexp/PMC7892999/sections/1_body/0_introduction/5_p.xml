<p id="Par6">As mentioned above, several differential expression analyses have been performed between purple and non-purple carrot roots allowing the identification of the main structural genes and TFs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in whole roots and/or phloem tissues

 </sup>. However, the identification and functional prediction of lncRNA in carrot or putatively involved in carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation has not yet been reported. In the present study, we combined a high throughput stranded RNA-Seq based approach with a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline, to annotate lncRNAs and analyze the expression profiles of lncNATs putatively associated to the carrot root anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation. In addition, we individually analyzed the gene expression patterns in phloem and xylem root of purple and orange

<p>Although it is assumed that post-transcriptional mRNA processing represents a mechanism for substantial transcriptome and proteome diversity, the ability to directly identify and quantify changes in AS and APA have not been previously possible using conventional short-read mRNA. It is well established that short-read RNA sequencing lacks sufficient sensitivity and read length to reliably reconstruct individual AS isoforms [

While beyond the scope of this study, the high-confidence curated transcriptome of hSAECs contains &gt;113 K isoforms encoded by 13,038 genes. Predictably, the size distribution of unspliced genes was shorter than that of multi-exonic genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Of multi-exonic genes, a remarkable 45% encoded six or more mRNA transcripts. Almost certainly, this number is an underestimate that will be refined as long-read RNA sequencing technology and the informatics tools available to analyze these data mature. Our finding that the vast majority of RNA sequences map to within 50â€“100 nt of the annotated transcription start sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f002">Figure 2</xref>E) argues that our data are of high quality and the cDNA synthesis is representative of the hSAEC transcriptome. More work will be required to identify, characterize, and validate the novel transcripts in the curated hSAEC transcriptome.

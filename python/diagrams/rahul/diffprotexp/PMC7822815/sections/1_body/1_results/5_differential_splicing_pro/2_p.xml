We found that genes affected by RUNX1/RUNX1T1-dependent differential splicing encode 752 transcripts, of which 214 isoforms were differentially spliced. Here and below, the term “differentially spliced isoform” indicates a molecule of RNA with at least one differential exon-exon junction (upegulated or downregulated), while a non-differential isoform is a transcript lacking any diffEEJs.

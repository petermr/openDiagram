<p id="Par80">Library preparation and sequencing experiments were carried out at Instituto de Agrobiotecnología de Rosario (INDEAR), Rosario, Argentina. Libraries were built using the TruSeq® Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina) starting from 1 μg of total RNA. Procedures for mRNA purification (using oligo-dT hybridization), RNA fragmentation, double-stranded cDNA synthesis, end-adenylation, ligation of adapters and enrichment (amplification) of library fragments were performed following the protocol described in TruSeq® Stranded mRNA Illumina (October 2017). The library quality was checked with the DNA 1000 Kit (Agilent Technologies), using 1 ul of each preparation in a 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries resulted in double-stranded DNA fragments with an average size of 260 bp. Three biological samples were processed for each one of the developmental stages (premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis, anthesis), for both reproductive modes. Thus, a total of 24 (3 × 4 × 2) libraries were constructed. Before sequencing, the individual libraries were quantified by qPCR (Light Cycler 480 Roche) and normalized to a concentration of 3 nM. One equimolar pool of all libraries was prepared and quantified by qPCR (Light Cycler 480 Roche) using the Qiagen Library Quantification Kit. The pool was used for the generation of clusters in the sequencing cell. A sequencing run was performed by generating paired ends (PE) 2 × 100 bp reads in a HiSeq– Illumina device.</p>

<p>In order to gain insight into the biological function of DEGs, the genes found significantly differential expressed (65 up-regulated and 218 down-regulated) between survivors and non-survivors were analyzed using the Metascape tool. The analysis was based on combined datasets for enrichment analysis, including gene ontology, KEGG pathways, reactome gene sets, canonical pathways, and CORUM complexes. The data in 
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows that the significant DEGs were involved in functions of host immune response (n = 7), stress response (n = 6), cell development (n = 35), signaling transduction (n = 23), catabolic process (n = 16), and metabolic process (n = 24). The significant 65 up-regulated DEGs in non-survivors were involved in myeloid leukocyte activation (n = 14), Toll-like receptor cascades (n = 8), and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes (n = 8) (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A) while the majority of 218 down-regulated genes set in non-survivors were hematopoietic cell lineage (n = 10), adaptive immune system (n = 24) and lymphocyte activation (n = 23) (

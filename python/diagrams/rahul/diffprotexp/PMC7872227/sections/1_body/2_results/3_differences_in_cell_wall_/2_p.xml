<p>One of the most important things about bacterial cell walls is that bacteria have flagellum structures, and the presence of this structure endows them the ability to move and gather to nutrients or escape from harmful substances [
 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Then, in the absence of a nitrogen source, bacteria need greater motility to alleviate nutrient deprivation. In accord with this, the GO analyses revealed that genes related to bacterial-type flagellum-dependent cell motility (GO: 0071973) functions were all markedly up-regulated (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g007">7</xref>). Two thirds of the 39 genes of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> on flagellum assembly and composition showed enhanced expressions. Specifically, 26 flagellum-related genes were up-regulated without the nitrogen source in contrast to the ammonium-containing case (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246818.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). In contrast to the urea-containing case, 28 flagellum-related genes were up-regulated without nitrogen sources (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246818.s004">S2 Fig</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246818.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Among these genes, it was known that FliD and FliC were related to the flagella filament that acted as a helical screw to produce thrust for swimming motility. FliN, FliM and FliG were responsible for the C ring structure acting not only as a central part of the rotor for torque generation but also as a structural device to switch the direction of motor rotation. FliP, FliO, FliI and FliH constituted the type III protein export apparatus that was responsible for transporting axial component proteins from the cytoplasm to the distal end of the growing flagella structure to construct the axial structure beyond the cellular membranes. FliK was related to hook structures to control the hook length and FlgG was related to the distal rod. Both FliK and FlgG were involved in regulating the bending flexibility of the hook and rod structure [

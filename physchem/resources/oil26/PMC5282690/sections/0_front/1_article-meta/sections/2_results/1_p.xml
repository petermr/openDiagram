<p>AcEO is predominated by the volatiles: spathulenol, &#223;-eudesmol and p-cymene. The maximal antioxidant effect was obtained with the dose 2&#160;mg/ml of AcEO. The dose 1&#160;mg/ml of AcEO showed a maximum antiplatelet effect of, respectively 49.73% &#177;9.54 and 48.20% &#177;8.49 on thrombin and ADP. The vasorelaxation seems not to be mediated via NOS/GC pathway neither via the potassium channels. However, pretreatment with calcium channels blockers attenuated this effect, suggesting that the vasorelaxation is mediated via inhibition of L-type Ca
   <sup>2+</sup> channels and the activation of SERCA pumps of reticulum plasma.

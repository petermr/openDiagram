<p id="Par9">The steel was subjected to a heat-treatment process (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) consisting of heating at 920, 900, and 640 °C for 2, 2, and 8 h, respectively. Subsequently, the steel was austenitized at 860 °C for 5 h. To obtain different quenched structures, the quenching cooling rate (QCR) was determined from the continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curve. The critical phase transformation point and CCT curve of the steels were measured with a thermal dilatometer (Fuji Electronic Industrial, Formastor–F) according to the Chinese standard YB/T 5127–1993 and YB/T 5128–93. The specimens cut from the steel bars were machined into long 
 <italic>Φ</italic> 3 × 10 mm cylinders. These cylinders were then heated to 860 °C at a rate of 10 °C/s, austenitized for 5 min at this temperature, and then cooled to room temperature at linear cooling rates of 12.8, 6.4, 3.2, 1.28, 0.64, 0.28, 0.14, 0.07, 0.03 °C/s. The CCT curve was drawn based on the experimental data and is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The CCT curves show that a critical cooling rate (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>) of ∼35 °C/min is required for martensite formation. Therefore, QCRs of 60 °C/min (martensite) and 4.4 °C/min (bainite) were applied (surface and 1/4 
 <italic>T</italic>, Wall thickness: 
 <italic>T</italic> = 700 mm). Afterward, the steel was tempered at 620 °C for 8 h. All the specimens were then removed from the furnace and exposed to air until they were cooled to room temperature. Part of the sample was removed to determine the mechanical properties of the material from tensile and impact tests. Another part of the sample was subjected to a step-cooling heat treatment (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) that promotes temper-embrittlement. Then, the performance and microstructure analyses were carried out.

<p id="Par44">Potential lncRNA candidates were identified using the following workflow. (1) Transcripts with uncertain chain direction were removed by Cuffmerge. (2) Transcripts length &gt; 200 nt with exon number ≥ 2 were selected. (3) Cuffcompare v. 2.1.1. was used to compare different classes of class_code annotated by “i”, “u” and “x” that were retained, which corresponded to intronic, intergenic, and anti-sense transcripts, respectively. (4) Transcripts with FPKM ≥0.5 were obtained after calculating the expression level of each transcript by Cuffdiff v. 2.1.1. (5) Three tools of CNCI v.2.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], CPC v. 2.81 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and PFAM v.1.3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] were used to predict the protein-coding potential. After that, Pfam was implemented to exclude transcripts that overlapped with any protein-coding genes. Intersection of these transcripts without coding potential was used as the lncRNA data set. Additionally, mRNAs were obtained from the same RNA-seq libraries in this study.

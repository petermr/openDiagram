<p>At least some of the cellular effects of p53β appear to require its transcriptional regulatory activity since mutation of the DNA binding domain of p53β attenuated its ability to induce cellular senescence markers [
 <xref rid="B8-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Sporadic reports in the literature have suggested that p53β regulates known p53 target genes in a promoter-dependent manner [

 <xref rid="B26-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that the overexpression of p53β only impacts a subset of p53 target genes [
 <xref rid="B8-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which suggests that the transcriptional activities of p53β protein exhibit both similarities and differences from FLp53 protein. On one hand, as a transcription factor, p53β is able to transcriptionally activate certain p53 target genes, either in an FLp53-independent (such as TP53INP1) or an FLp53-dependent manner (such as GDF15), as determined through microarray analysis [
 <xref rid="B8-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the other hand, p53β may be able to repress the expression of other gene products, such as the ‘anti-aging’ genes BCL6 and SIRT, perhaps contributing to the role of p53β in IR-induced cellular senescence [
 <xref rid="B8-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is conceivable that global mapping and comparison of p53β and FLp53 genomic DNA binding sites coupled with RNA sequencing will be an important step in deciphering differential transcriptional activities of these two proteins. Moreover, the definition of the p53β cistrome will also lend insight into direct targets of p53β as well as potential transcriptional co-regulators of p53β activity.

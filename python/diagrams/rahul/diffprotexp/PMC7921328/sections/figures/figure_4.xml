  <p>The crosstalk between lncRNAs and immune-related biological processes in PRAD. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Network shows the connections between differential lncRNAs and top significant immune-related biological processes in PRAD. Circle sizes indicate the numbers of significantly enriched lncRNAs for individual immune-related biological processes. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Comparison of immune response activities between high and low expression levels of CTD-2521M24.9. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Comparison of immune system development activities between high and low expression levels of CTD-2521M24.9. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Points show the correlations between lncRNAs and representative genes in individual immune-related biological processes.

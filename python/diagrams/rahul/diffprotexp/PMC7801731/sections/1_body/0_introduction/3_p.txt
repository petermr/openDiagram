0: Echinoderms comprise an important group of organisms with extraordinary regeneration capabilities.
1: However, despite being among the most highly regenerative deuterostomes and their close relationship to vertebrates, the number of studies on their regenerative capacity is rather limited 5.
2: In recent years their use as regeneration model organisms has seen an upsurge with studies on spine regeneration in sea urchins 6, arm regeneration in crinoids, brittle stars and sea stars 7  9 and nervous system and viscera regeneration in sea cucumbers 10  14.
3: Sea cucumbers have been particularly attractive for intestinal regeneration studies because of their innate capacity of expelling their digestive tract in a process known as evisceration, which is then followed by its regeneration.
4: Research relating regeneration of the whole digestive system is scarce among regenerating competent organisms, where in addition to sea cucumbers, other studies include planarians 15,  16.

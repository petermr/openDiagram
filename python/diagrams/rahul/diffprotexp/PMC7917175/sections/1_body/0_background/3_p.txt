0: The aim of our study was to explore novel PAAD antigens for developing mRNA vaccines, and map the immune landscape of PAAD to select suitable patients for vaccination.
1: We identified 6 candidates associated with poor survival and antigen presenting cell (APC) infiltration from the pool of overexpressed and mutated genes in PAAD.
2: Based on the clustering of immune-related genes, we then defined 5 robust immune subtypes and 9 functional modules of PAAD, and validated them in an independent cohort.
3: Each immune subtype corresponded to distinct clinical, molecular and cellular characteristics.
4: Finally, the immune landscape of PAAD was defined by analyzing the distribution of the relevant gene signatures among individual patients.
5: Our findings point to a complex tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in each PAAD patient, and provide the theoretical basis for developing mRNA vaccines and selecting suitable patients for vaccination.

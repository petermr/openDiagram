<p>The XRD patterns of the LLZNO ceramic samples are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The phases of all the prepared ceramic samples were identified as cubic phases (PDF 63-0174). The crystal parameters of the different samples are showed in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-00560-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The XRD patterns of the samples sintered at 1200 °C × 60 min (SL1) and at 1100 °C × 360 min (SL5) showed a few impure phase peaks, mainly belonging to LiNbO
 <sub>3</sub> (PDF 82-0459) and Li
 <sub>7</sub>NbO
 <sub>6</sub> (PDF 29-0816), and due to the decomposition from the high sintering activity of the LLZNO after having been sintered for too long at a high temperature. Moreover, these impure phases decreased the total ionic conductivity of LLZNO ceramics by increasing the resistance of the grain boundary.

0: The outbreak of enterohemorrhagic  Escherichia coli (EHEC) O104:H4 in 2011 in Germany was one of the largest and most severe EHEC outbreaks in recent history with almost 4000 infections resulting in more than 50 fatalities [ 1].
1: Since then, research was focused on the strain that caused this unprecedented rate of infection, especially as it affected mainly healthy adults, which is not common for EHEC epidemics [ 2].
2: The severity of symptoms and the high percentage of patients developing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) were attributed to the unusual combination of virulence factors of different  E. coli pathotypes found in this strain [ 1, 3].
3: Typical EHEC markers include the Shiga toxin (Stx)- and the IrgA homologue adhesin-encoding determinants  stx2 and  iha, respectively, whereas the most prominent virulence markers of enteroaggregative  E. coli (EAEC) include the global virulence regulator AggR-encoding and aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF)-encoding determinants  aggR and  aggDCBA [ 4].
4: Whole genome analysis revealed a very close relationship of the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain with the prototypic EAEC isolate 55989, which was originally isolated from an HIV-positive patient in the Central African Republic with persistent diarrhea [ 58].
5: However, the subtype of the main virulence factor of EAEC, the AAF adhesin, was different in EHEC O104:H4 (AAF/I) when compared to EAEC strain 55989 (AAF/III) [ 9].

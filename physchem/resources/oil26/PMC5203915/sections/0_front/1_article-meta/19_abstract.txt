0: The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation from the hairy roots (HR) and roots of soil-grown plants (SGR) of   Rhaponticum carthamoides and were analyzed by GC-MS method.
1: In the both essential oils 62 compounds were identified.
2: The root essential oils showed the differences in the qualitative and quantitative composition.
3: The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (5562%) dominated in both essential oils.
4: The major compounds of HR essential oil were cyperene, 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene, and cadalene while aplotaxene, nardosina-1(10),11-diene, and dauca-4(11),8-diene dominated in SGR essential oil.
5: Both essential oils showed antibacterial activity especially against   Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and   Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) (MIC value = 125   g/mL).
6: HR and SGR essential oils also decreased the expression of IL-1  , IL-6, and TNF-   and the ROS level in LPS-treatment astrocytes.
7: This is the first report to describe the chemical composition of   R. carthamoides essential oil from hairy roots, its protective effect against LPS-induced inflammation and ROS production in astrocytes, and its antimicrobial potential.
8: The results show that   R. carthamoides hairy roots may be a valuable source of the essential oil and may be an alternative to the roots of soil-grown plants.

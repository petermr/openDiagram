 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00891-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows Raman spectra of samples S1, S2, and S3. The Raman peak at 510 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (~40 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> width) found in sample S1 is characteristic for the crystalline silicon (c-Si) powder. The mechanochemical treatment of the sample produced defects and strain and as a consequence the c-Si peak at 510 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was further shifted toward lower wavenumbers by 30 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and it was further broadened by an additional ~10 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. These changes indicate that the lattice has been further defected and strained, resulting in a change of the Si–Si bond length [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Sample S2 also shows photoluminescence (PL) as a result of new formatted Si-O bonds in the sample as shown on the FT-IR spectrum. The PL of porous silicon is attributed to the recombination centers related to Si-O bonds. The phonon confinement can be explained by the formation of the nanocrystalline silicon domains created by mechanochemical treatment. The Raman spectrum of sample S3 contains a peak at 510 and shoulder at 495 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The origin of the first one is due to phonon confinement in silicon nanoparticles and the second one is due to amorphous silicon layers or surface phonons of silicon nanoparticles [

 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The increased number of silicon nano-domains could be caused by MACE treatment. There is no observable PL effect in the sample S3 because the MACE process could remove the oxide layers by chemical etching.

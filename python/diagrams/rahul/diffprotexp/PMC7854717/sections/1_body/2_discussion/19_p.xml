 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e shows that, beyond their orchestrated contractions, each heart chamber has a specific gene hierarchy, indicating distinct transcriptomic organizations. As expected, among the most prominent genes in LV are: 
 <italic>Actc1</italic> and 
 <italic>Myl2</italic> (myosin light polypeptide 2 regulatory cardiac, slow). Interestingly, within the top 5 genes in all chambers, there are 4 mitochondrion genes: ATP synthase, H
 <sup>+</sup> transporting, mitochondrial complexes (
 <italic>Atp5b, Atp5j2</italic>) and cytochrome c oxidase subunits (
 <italic>Cox6a2, Cox7b</italic>). There are also 3 predicted genes: 
 <italic>Gm17511, Gm5805, Gm6222</italic>, all in the right atrium that deserve functional analyses to better understand their roles in the heart physiology. Of note is also the high GCH in the left atrium of the subunit (
 <italic>Lin37</italic>) of the dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F and multi-vulval class B (DREAM) complex that control the cell cycle

 </sup>. Our results explain why each chamber may develop a distinct pathology that needs a chamber-specific treatment. However, the top five genes in LV have similar GCHs in RV, indicating that a myocardium-targeted treatment for LV problems may be also efficient for RV.

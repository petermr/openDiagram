<p>Mucociliary clearance, an innate immune function, is an important mechanism for keeping the lung free of inhaled pathogens and debris. It has been demonstrated that CENPF, one of the genes that was differentially expressed, encoding a centromere protein, is involved not only in metaphase chromosome support, but also in cellular cilia formation by orientation of microtubules [

This makes it connected to mucociliary clearance and similar to what was happening in lung lesions also in group 6 when compared with group 2. Therefore, similar changes were observed in lung tissue with lesion and lung tissue without lesion, in group 6 when compared to group 2; these were characterized by cilia restoration and tissue remodeling with a more apparent difference in lung lesions.

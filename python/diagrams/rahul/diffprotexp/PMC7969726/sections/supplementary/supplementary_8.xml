  <p>CPSF1-depletion inhibits liver cell line proliferation. CPSF1 was silenced by transfection with CPSF1 siRNAs or overexpressed with plasmids in QSG7701 cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> CPSF1 protein levels were determined by western blotting. Statistical significance was calculated using Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Cell proliferation in the CPSF1-silenced or CPSF1-overexpression groups was detected by CCK8 assay over five consecutive days. The relative absorbance was measured at OD
   <sub>450</sub>. Fold enrichment was normalized to the absorbance on day 1 and assessed using two-way ANOVA. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Colony formation assays determined the effect of CPSF1 on cell growth. The number of colonies was counted using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States) and analyzed using Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. Statistical data are presented as mean ± SD. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our observation that gene duplicates in most lineages are enriched in cancer pathways suggest either that duplication of genes in cancer pathways is common in Afrotherians, or that there may be a systemic bias in the pathway enrichment analyses. For example, random gene sets may be generally enriched in pathway terms related to cancer biology. To explore this latter possibility, we generated 5000 randomly sampled gene sets of between 10 and 5000 genes, and tested for enriched Reactome pathways using ORA. We found that no cancer pathways were enriched (median hypergeometric p-value &#8804;0.05) among gene sets tested greater than 157 genes; however, in these smaller gene sets, 12&#8211;18% of enriched pathways were classified as cancer pathways. Without considering p-value thresholds, the percentage of enriched cancer pathways approaches ~15% (213/1381) in simulated sets. Thus, for larger gene sets, we used a simulated threshold of ~15% to determine if pathways related to cancer biology were enriched more than one would expect from sampling bias (<xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We directly compared our simulated and observed enrichment results by lineage and gene set size, and found that Afrosoricida, Cape golden mole, tenrec, Elephantidae, elephant shrew, Asian elephant, African Savannah elephant, African Forest elephant, Columbian mammoth, aardvark, Paenungulata, Proboscidea, Tethytheria, and manatee had enriched cancer pathway percentages above background with respect to their gene set sizes, that is expected enrichments based on random sampling of small gene sets (<xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, we conclude that duplication of genes in cancer pathways is common in many Afrotherians but that the inference of enriched cancer pathway duplication is not different from background in some lineages, particularly in ancestral nodes with a small number of estimated duplicates.</p>

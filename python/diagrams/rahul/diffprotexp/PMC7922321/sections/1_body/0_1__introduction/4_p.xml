<p>Ets-1 was found to be overexpressed in breast cancer, which was reported to be associated with poor prognosis [
 <xref rid="B10-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ets-1 is not only a critical regulator of invasion [
 <xref rid="B10-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but is also involved in regulating cancer energy metabolism in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B11-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has also been shown to play a role in telomere maintenance through the regulation of hTERT expression [
 <xref rid="B12-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. T417 phosphorylation of Elk-1, a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily, was found to be associated with the differentiation grade of colonic adenocarcinomas [
 <xref rid="B13-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, in high clinical stage prostate cancer, ELK-1, not TCF members ELK3 or ELK4, was found to be associated with disease recurrence [
 <xref rid="B14-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, ELK1 expression was reported to be higher than ELK3 in many cancer cell lines, including brain, skin, and myeloid tumors and sarcomas [

 <xref rid="B16-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The PEA3 subfamily of ETS domain transcription factors was also involved in a number of cancers, such as in lung tumors with MET amplification, and PEA3 subfamily members were found to play a role in migration and invasion [
 <xref rid="B17-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In colorectal carcinoma, PEA3 was shown to promote invasiveness and metastatic potential [
 <xref rid="B18-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In ovarian cancer, the loss of repressors of the PEA3 subfamily was shown to cause overaccumulation of ETV4 and ETV5 [

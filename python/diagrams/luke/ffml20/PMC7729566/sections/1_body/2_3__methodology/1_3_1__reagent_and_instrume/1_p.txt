0: The ionic liquids [P 4444]Cl (95.0 wt.%), [P 44414]Cl (95.0 wt.%) were obtained from Cytec industries, [N 4444]Cl (97.0 wt.%) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)and [C 14mim]Cl (98.0 wt.%) from Iolitec (Heilbronn, Germany).
1: Citric acid (99.5 wt.%) was obtained from Panreac, lactic acid (92.0 wt.%) from Riedel de Haen and acetic acid (99.9 wt.%) from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA).
2: Neodymium (III) oxide (99.99%), cobalt (II) oxide (95%) and iron (III) oxide (98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA, USA) whilst nickel (II) oxide (99.99%) and the gallium standard (1000 mg L 1) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich.
3: Ammonium acetate (98.0 wt.%) and sodium chloride (99.5 wt.%) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and and Fisher Scientific, respectively.
4: All chemicals were used as received.
5: Ultrapure deionized water was used in all experiments and obtained from an ultra-filtration system by reverse osmosis and subsequently passed through a Milli-Q plus 185 water purification apparatus (18.2 M cm to 298 K).
6: All systems were gravimetrically prepared through careful weighing of each component using an analytical scale (Precisa gravimetries AG, uncertainty 0.0001 g).
7: The cation of the ionic liquid ([P 44414] +) was quantified by  1H-NMR (Bruker Avance III, 400 Hz (Billerica, MA, USA)) using as internal standard a benzene probe of known concentration.
8: Acid-base titration was used to determine acid contraction in the phases (Titroline 6000 pH meter; 0.1%).
9: Karl Fischer titration was used to determine the amount of water (Titroline 7500 KF Trace; 0.15%).
10: A thermostatic bath (ME-18 V Visco-Thermostat, Julabo, (Seelbach, Germany) 0.1 K) was used for temperature control.
11: Viscosity was determined using a viscometer-densimeter SVM 3000 Anton Paar Rotary Stabinger (Graz, Austria), with a temperature uncertainty of 0.1 K and a relative uncertainty of dynamic viscosity of 0.35%.
12: Aggregate size measurements were made by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS) measurements.
13: For measurements of metals has been used Picofox S2 (Bruker Nano (Billerica, MA, USA)) total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometer with a molybdenum X-ray source.
14: The voltage of the X-ray tube was 50 kV and the current 600 A.
15: All carriers were first pretreated with 10 L of silicon in isopropanol solution and dried at 353 K for 30 min.
16: Ten microliters of each solution containing the metals and standard of Ga were added onto a clean carrier and dried on a hot plate at 60 C for 15 min.

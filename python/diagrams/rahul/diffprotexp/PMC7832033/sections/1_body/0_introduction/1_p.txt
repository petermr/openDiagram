0: Melioidosis is a severe infectious disease caused by  Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative bacterium and biothreat agent [ 1].
1: The disease is highly endemic in the tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia and northern Australia but reported cases are increasing globally.
2: Melioidosis carries a mortality rate of 40% or higher in many endemic regions where resources are limited.
3: This poor outcome from melioidosis has remained unchanged for many years [ 2, 3].
4: Melioidosis is associated with several host factors, but diabetes is the major risk [ 4, 5].
5: Pneumonia and bacteremia are the most common manifestations of disease; infections of these systems are frequently associated with septic shock and contribute to high mortality [ 2].

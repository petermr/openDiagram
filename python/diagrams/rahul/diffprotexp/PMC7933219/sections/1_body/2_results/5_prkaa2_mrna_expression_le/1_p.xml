<p>PRKAA2 is a key molecule in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M. It relates mRNA function with lncRNA according to the mRNA–lncRNA co-expression network. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, the expression of PRKAA2 mRNA in endothelial cells was significantly upregulated after the addition of PC-3M cells, which was consistent with the result of our bioinformatics analysis described above (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). In order to explore the upstream mediator of PRKAA2, we used three databases to predict the miRNAs targeted at PRKAA2. As a result, we found 67 miRNAs using the Targetscan database, 372 miRNAs using the miRDB database, and 1715 miRNAs using the RNA22 database, and we obtained 26 miRNAs predicted in all three databases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). We confirmed the expression of 4 common miRNAs (miR-124-3p, miR-320b, miR-320c, and miR-320d) in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M by performing qPCR. The results showed that miR-124-3p was significantly downregulated in the TC–EC model compared with EC alone (

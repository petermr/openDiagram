  <p>Heatmap of adalimumab good-responders and non-responders following real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of gene expression. Heatmap and hierarchal clustering is based on pairwise similarity in gene expression for the 104 transcripts measured in the RT-qPCR validation study. Good-responders and non-responders are represented in the upper and lower heatmaps, respectively. Heatmap rows and columns represent baseline and 3 months samples for 11 rheumatoid arthritis patients on adalimumab TNF-inhibitor therapy. BL = baseline and 3M = 3-months</p>

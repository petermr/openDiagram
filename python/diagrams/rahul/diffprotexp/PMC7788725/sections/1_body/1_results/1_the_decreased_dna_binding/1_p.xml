<p id="Par33">We used principal component analysis (PCA) to compare the correlations among 10 human samples. The results showed a clear distinction (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A, B). We, respectively, selected the top 3 samples (control: GSM3416675, GSM3416677, and GSM3416679; DCM: GSM3416685, GSM3416689, and GSM3416691) from PCA analysis between the control and DCM group, and performed ChIP-seq analysis by two peak calling software to detect LMNA mutation binding to euchromatin in myocardial tissue. To identify the distribution of LMNA mutation protein binding sites on euchromatin in human cardiac myocytes, we visualized their binding patterns and their chromosomal locations, and found that ChIP peaks were distributed in all chromosomes except for chromosome Y. The top 18 chromosomes contained the most DNA binding sites. Moreover, these DNA binding sites in DCM group were significantly reduced. Meanwhile, we observed that the peak shapes identified by the two software have certain differences. The narrow peaks were identified by MACS, and the broad peaks were identified by SICER (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). The narrow peak shape of MACS reflects the binding between LMNA alone and euchromatin, while the broad peak shape of SICER reflects the binding of LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes and euchromatin, which was consistent with previous reports [

 <caption> HAADF-STEM images of Y-phase platelets enriched in Zn and Cu after cooling of 7150 at 10 K/s, viewed from the [110]α direction, showing that the thickness varies along its length, with growth ledges indicated by arrows in ( c). The regular pattern in the matrix on either side of the plate in ( a) is an artefact caused by Moiré fringing between the lattice and scan frame. This plate appears to be nucleating from an attached void. Similar images in ( e– g) from a second plate, but viewed from the [112]α direction, show variations in thickness and stacking order along the length of the precipitate [ 143]. </caption>

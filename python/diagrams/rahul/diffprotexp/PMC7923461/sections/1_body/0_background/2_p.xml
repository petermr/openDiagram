<p id="Par35">Microtubule is an important component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Moreover, it is one of the most functional proteins, which play an important role in dynamic polymerization and depolymerization through cell replication and division [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Microtubules are uniformly assembled from highly conserved α/β-tubulin heterodimers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, several studies have reported that α-tubulin is involved in the occurrence of a variety of tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer and prostatic cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, α-tubulin is also associated with the development of astrocytoma and chemotherapeutic resistance of liver cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, TUBA1C is a subtype of α-tubulin, and its overexpression is associated with the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, no previous study has elucidated how the overexpression of TUBA1C affects LUAD patients.

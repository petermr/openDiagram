0: In a first instance, a screening of four different ILs, namely [N 4444]Cl, [P 4444]Cl, [P 44414]Cl and [C 14mim]Cl, with various water-soluble organic acids in aqueous solutions was performed at 323 K to identify potential biphasic mixtures.
1: For each IL + organic acid + H 2O system, two initial binary mixture compositions were selected to which the third component was titrated until the system became turbid.
2: Initial mixture compositions were of 75.0 wt.% IL in water and a 50:50 wt.% IL + organic acid (including the initial acid water content), respectively.

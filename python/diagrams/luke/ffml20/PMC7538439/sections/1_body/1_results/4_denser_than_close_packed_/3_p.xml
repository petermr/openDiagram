<p id="Par22">Intermolecular interactions are dominated by quadrupole–quadrupole interactions and steric repulsion. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the implied contribution from quadrupole–quadrupole interactions calculated by electrostatics from HMLP simulations. Although the ML potential has no explicit electrostatic terms, there is a strong orientation correlation, which lowers the quadrupolar energy, not only in Phase II, but also in Phase I and to a lesser extent in the liquid.

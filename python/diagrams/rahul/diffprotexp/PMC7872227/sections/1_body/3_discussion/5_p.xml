<p>There were several differences in energy production of

 <italic>pasteurii</italic> in the KEGG analyses between groups of N and U, including significant differences in oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways, in the ATP synthase expressions, and in the expression of urease genes. Combining the GO analyses results of the groups of N and B, as well as those of the groups of U and B, it was found that the changes in ATP synthesis and metabolism of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> also exhibited in the absence of either ammonium or urea. According to Jahnâ€™s findings that ammonium was directly responsible for stimulating ATP production in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>, our results also suggested that the stimulation of ATP synthesis by ammonium might persist even when urease was inhibited by the inhibitor. So, it was reasonable that urea played a similar role because of the hydrolysis of urea by urease. It was conceivable that the urea hydrolysis was catalyzed by urease, enabling the bacteria to obtain a direct nitrogen source at first, and the ammonium which was a product of urea hydrolysis played a key role in regulating the internal pH of the bacteria, increasing the bacterial electric potential and stimulating ATP synthesis in sequence.

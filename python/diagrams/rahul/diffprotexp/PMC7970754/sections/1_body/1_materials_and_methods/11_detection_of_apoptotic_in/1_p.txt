0: The cells in logarithmic growth phase were taken and adjusted to a cell concentration of 5  10 4/ml, after which they were inoculated in 96-well plates (200 l per well).
1: Next, they were divided into 5 groups with 5 replicates in each group and incubated overnight in a 37 C, 5% CO 2 incubator.
2: After the cells adhered, the medium was removed, and the experiment was divided into a control group, a virus no-load control group NC, a no-load control group NC + RSV group, a POLD1 overexpression + RSV group, and a POLD1 overexpression group.
3: Incubation continued under the same conditions for 36 h, after which 10 l of CCK8 solution was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 3 h. A microplate reader was then used to measure absorbance (A) at 450 nm, and the survival rates of the four groups of cells were compared.
4: The experiment was repeated three times, and the experiment was divided into control group, a virus no-load control group NC, a POLD1-OE group, a POLD1-OE + RSV group, and a no-load control group NC + RSV group.
5: After 36 h of processing, detection was performed using flow cytometry using the AnnexinV APC-7AAD kit (Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA) double standard method.

<p id="Par34">The cyclability of LTO self-standing electrodes is evaluated with long cycling experiments at a rate of C/2. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> presents the capacity retention of two different compositions of electrodes with more than 300 charge/discharge cycles. Practically 100% of the initial discharge capacity at C/2 is recovered at the end of experiment. Stable discharge capacities of 157 and 150 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> are thus obtained through several hundreds of cycles when the electrode is fabricated with (

Moreover, a stable Coulombic efficiency of appoximately 99.9% is obtained by both electrodes at 300 cycles. After cycling, the cell is disassembled, and the self-standing electrode remains totally intact without the dissolution of active material or carbon in the electrolyte (Fig.

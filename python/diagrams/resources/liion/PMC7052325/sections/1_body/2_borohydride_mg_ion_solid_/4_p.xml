<p>Roedern and Remhof synthesized a Mg(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> derivative by coordinating Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> with a neutral bidentate ethylenediamine ligand to replace two BH
 <sub>4</sub> ligand (Roedern et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It showed a high ionic conductivity of 5 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 30°C and 6 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 70°C. The good conductivity was attributed to the partially chelated, mixed coordination of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> leading to its high mobility. However, the electrochemical stability of this new phase is limited to 1.2 V vs. Mg/Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, due to the stability limitation by the ethylenediamine ligand.

<p>The genes responsible for the production of the differential proteins are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00305-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. They were detected by traditional PCR. Amplicon sizes for each gene products are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. The intensities of the band on the agarose gel were relatively different between the exponential and the stationary phases of growth (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). For further confirmation and to investigate the dys-regulation at the transcription level, we performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RNA quality was assured, as appeared on the gel (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>), and as shown in the spectrometer results that gave high purity with reasonable concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). RNA integrity was promoted using Bioanalyzer; RNA Integrity Number (RIN), the quality measurement from Agilent Technologies was 9.4 and 9.1 for RNA from MAH 104 in exponential and in stationary growth phases, respectively. Electropherogram profiles for RNA resolved on a Pico Chip of Agilent Bioanalyzer were accurate (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00305">Supplementary Figure S4C,D</xref>). Expression degrees were detected by the comparative threshold cycle through normalization to 
 <italic>sigA</italic> and 
 <italic>groL</italic>. Transcription analysis revealed a down-regulation in the mRNA of elongation factor (
 <italic>tuf</italic>) (5 fold), ATP binding protein (
 <italic>MAVA5_02330</italic>) (4.6 fold), universal stress protein (
 <italic>MAV_3137</italic>) (2.6 fold), dibenzothiophene desulfurization enzyme C (
 <italic>MAV_3806</italic>) (3 fold), and catalase (
 <italic>katE</italic>) (2 fold) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00305-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The expression of other genes was up-regulated at the transcriptional level, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00305-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, and in the heatmap (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00305-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Changes in RNA levels were rather different to the changes in protein levels.

<p id="Par4">The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the systemic inflammatory response to CPB are not completely understood, but are thought to include complement activation, cytokine release, and endothelial cell activation, leading to myocardial and vascular injury

 </sup>. Differences in the host’s genotype may determine their individual pro or anti-inflammatory response profile, and thus the magnitude of their systemic inflammatory response to CPB. Whole blood transcriptomic studies have accounted for the heterogenous inflammatory response seen after CPB in adults

 </sup>. However, there are no studies exploring whole blood transcriptome profile in neonates with critical CHD, and in particular HLHS. In this study we hypothesized that children with HLHS will have unique transcriptome profiles before and after their Norwood operation, and that they would correlate with the development of a post-operative LCOS.

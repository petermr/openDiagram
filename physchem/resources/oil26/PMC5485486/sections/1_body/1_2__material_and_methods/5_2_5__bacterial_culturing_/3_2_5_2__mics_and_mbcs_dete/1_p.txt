0: The MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimal bactericidal concentration) tests were performed (in triplicate) by the broth microdilution method.
1: The essential oils were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma).
2: Serial dilutions (1 : 2) from 2.5% (v/v) as the essential oil concentrations to be incubated at 37C for 24 h with the bacterial suspensions adjusted to 10 5 CFU/ml in wells of 96-well microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
3: Untreated control (wells containing bacteria with DMSO at a concentration of 1%) was included in the assay.

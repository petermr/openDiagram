0: The behavior of corneal epithelial cells and keratocytes varies in applied DC EFs, where epithelial cells, at field strength of 400 V/m, migrate in the cathodal direction and stromal fibroblasts (600 V/m) migrate in the anodal direction [ 8].
1: Applied external EF stimulations also influence the axis of corneal epithelial cell division, and in the presence of small EFs (e.g., 100 V/m), cultured corneal epithelial cell migration, orientation display serum, growth factor and substrate dependence in vitro [ 9, 10].
2: Application of high EFs, for example 250 V/m, is necessary to observe cathodal migration of corneal epithelial cells in serum-free culture conditions.
3: Further, human and bovine corneal epithelial cells show similar migration patterns in the applied small EFs [ 11, 12].
4: The strength of the EFs in the vicinity of the lesion also influences the rate of re-epithelialization [ 13], while increased wound field strengths enhance corneal wound epithelialization.
5: Studies on the role of wound-induced electrical currents show that Cl  and Na + are the major components of electric currents in rat corneal wounds.
6: In the resting, non-wounded cornea, Na + is the main component of ionic transport, whereas Cl  is an important component of the endogenous EF at the wound edges.
7: These findings allowed researchers to test clinically approved pharmacological agents such as aminophylline, ascorbic acid, and furosemide to control the Cl  flow, thereby modulating electric currents in wounds [ 14].
8: The same approach in the form of chloride-free or aminophylline eye drops has been shown to enhance healing of damaged human corneas by offering bioelectric stimulation without electrodes [ 5].
9: At the cellular level, corneal injury causes significant changes in distribution and expression pattern of the calcium-activated chloride channel CLC2 in the human corneal epithelium.
10: The time course of CLC2 mRNA upregulation correlates with increased Cl  flux, which sequentially reaches its maximum within 1 h after wounding [ 2].
11: Furthermore, applied EFs also influence the regeneration of nerves after injury [ 15] and wound-generated endogenous EFs also control the rate of nerve sprouting, nerve growth, and regeneration, along with epithelial wound healing [ 16, 17].

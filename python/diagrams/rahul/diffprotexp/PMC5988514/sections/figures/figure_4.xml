  <p>Expressional levels of IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 proteins were compared between CV-PTC, FV-PTC and benign samples. IQGAP1 expression level was higher in CV-PTC and relatively lower in FV-PTC and benign samples. Conversely, CV-PTC and benign samples showed significantly lower levels of IQGAP2 protein.</p>

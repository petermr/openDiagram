0: Mass spectrum (MS)-dependent strategies offer novel insights for the identification and validation of disease-related biomarkers [ 9,  10].
1: For example, Geyer et al .
2: developed a plasma proteome analysis pipeline using label-free quantitative MS, which detected 284  5 proteins containing > 40 FDA-approved biomarkers without removing high-abundance proteins [ 11].
3: Sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectrum (SWATH-MS) is a newly developed strategy using a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method with high quantitative accuracy and reproducibility [ 12].
4: Using this strategy, increasing numbers of disease biomarkers have been identified, and novel criteria for disease typing based on proteomics have been established [ 13 15].

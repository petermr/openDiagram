0: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was used to analyze cell proliferation.
1: Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 1d, 2d and 3d, respectively.
2: 100 L T98G or A172 cell lines were planted into 96-well plates at a density of 510 3 cells/100 L. Each treatment was conducted in triplicate.
3: The absorbance value at 450 nm was measured by an enzyme-labeled instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
4: For TMZ experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 1d, followed by treatment with 200uM TMZ for another 2d.
5: For colony formation assay, 110 3 cells/well T98G or A172 cells were added into plates with 6 repeated wells for each treatment.
6: After 14 days, the culture medium was replaced.
7: The colonies were fixed in 30% Formaldehyde (thermo fisher, USA) for 15 min, and then stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet (thermo fisher, USA).

<p>The results of the study make it clear that only looking at gene, or even transcript expression, can obscure important changes in the transcriptome. Alternative splicing may be an important pathogenic disease mechanism in MM that affects a wide range of important pathways. Additional studies of the MM transcriptome may provide important insights into the disease pathogenesis.</p>

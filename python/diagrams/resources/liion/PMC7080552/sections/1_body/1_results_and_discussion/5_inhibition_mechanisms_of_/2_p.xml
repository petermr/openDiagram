<p>The uneven electric field distribution is regarded as a main driving force for the uncontrolled Li dendrites growth.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> The currently proposed porous and conductive 3D LiB skeleton is expected to decentralize the electric field, reduce the local current density and regulate the Li
 <sup>+</sup> deposition. To elucidate the effect of the LiB skeleton on electric field distribution, electrical conduction model via finite element analysis (FEA) simulation is conducted. (Note that the simulation is concentrated mainly on the electric field distribution on the composite surface during the initial Li deposition process.) The results are shown in

 </xref> (details and Figure S7 are shown in the Supporting Information). As illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>aâ€“d, the uniformly distributed electric field generated from the LiB skeleton facilitates the uniform deposition of Li, inhibiting the formation of Li dendrite. Moreover, the remaining Li(Mg) solid solution with high Mg concentration will also help to guide the uniform deposition of Li
 <sup>+</sup> due to the strong affinity to Li as mentioned earlier. In comparison, the Li tips on the Li surface would eventually evolve into Li dendrites due to the inhomogeneous incoming Li
 <sup>+</sup> flux (Figure

<p>While the fast and ultrafast time-resolved studies attract a lot of attention and excitement, we would like to emphasize also the need for studies of catalyst transformations on much longer time scales. The majority of the current 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS studies are limited in time by a few minutes or, maximum, a few hours. However, the activation and deactivation/degradation processes in real-world catalysts can take much longer times (hours, days, and even weeks). The understanding of these processes at the atomistic level that can be achieved by XAS is extremely important for practical industrial catalysis applications. The current user access model employed at synchrotron radiation facilities is, however, incompatible with such experiments. When dedicated beamlines are not available, alternative solutions might be provided by the ongoing development of laboratory-based XAS setups.

<p>Mice were challenged with intratracheal (I.T.) LPS at 0.1 mg/kg (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) or intraperitoneal (I.P.) LPS at 5 mg/kg (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) to model direct and indirect lung injury, respectively. The above dosages were chosen based on published reports [

 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], as well as our pilot studies. I.T. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) and I.P. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) administration of vehicle alone (sterile saline) were used as the control, and data from the two control groups were combined as there were no differences between the two groups.

 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], I.T. LPS treatment resulted in significant increases in BALF protein concentration (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). In contrast, although mice receiving I.P. LPS suffered greater weight loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), there were no significant increases in either BALF protein concentration or neutrophil numbers compared to the vehicle treated controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). Although BALF protein concentration was not increased in the I.P. LPS treated mice, as revealed by our proteomic analysis (below), BALF protein expression profiles of the I.P. LPS group were significantly different from those of the controls. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of lung tissue sections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f001">Figure 1</xref>D) confirmed the accumulation of neutrophils in the alveoli following I.T. LPS challenge. In contrast, I.P. LPS treatment did not result in neutrophil recruitment into the alveolar space; however, neutrophils can be found within the alveolar septa (arrows in

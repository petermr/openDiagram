Total annual rainfall over 33 years, including 30 years before the study commenced, was highly variable (1982&#8211;2015: median 228 mm, 1st and 3rd quartile 178 and 270 mm, range 138&#8211;392 mm). In the year before our study started (July 2011&#8211;June 2012), rainfall was &#8764;340 mm, i.e., within the higher quartile range, and resulted in high vegetation productivity during that summer (&#8764;85% of the maximum during our study) and the following winter. In year 1 of the study (July 2012&#8211;June 2013), rainfall was 196 mm, i.e., between the lower quartile range and the median, and no rain occurred during the hottest months of the summer. Vegetation productivity during the summer 2012&#8211;2013 and the following winter 2013 (termed &#8220;drought summer&#8221; and &#8220;drought winter&#8221;) was less than &#8764;54% of the maximum EVI during our study. In year 2 (July 2013 to June 2014), rainfall was 461 mm, within the higher quartile range, and spread over 4 months. The high rainfall of the 2013&#8211;2014 summer resulted in the maximum vegetation productivity (EVI = 0.26) which only slowly declined until July 2014 even though rainfall virtually ceased after March. In year 3 (July 2014 to June 2015), rainfall was 172 mm, i.e., within the lower quartile range of the 33-year period, resulting in a slightly lower vegetation productivity that prevailed until year 4 (July to September 2015, when the study ended). Although the summer of year 3 (notably February 2015) was dry and EVI low, the rainfall was not delayed as long as it was during the summer of year 1, so the reduction in EVI was not as drastic, declining to &#8764;62% of the maximum.

 <caption> Transcriptional profiling of developing somites. a Schematic representation of HH14 chick embryo with presomitic mesoderm (PSM), epithelial somite (ES), maturing somite (MS) and differentiated somite (DS) dissected for RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, in triplicate. b– d Volcano plots showing enriched genes (log fold change &gt;1.5) comparing PSM with ES, ES with MS, and MS with DS. e Heat map showing GO terms associated with PSM or DS enriched genes. f Clusters of highly correlated genes identified for myoblast differentiation and cartilage condensation. g Wnt, FGF and retinoic acid (RA) signalling pathways are shown in heat map. h Heat map showing k-means linear enrichment clustering across PSM, ES, MS and DS. i Dimension reduction algorithm t-SNE used to map top genes in each cluster determined by k-means. j Cluster B and k Cluster I are shown with some genes labelled to identify key transcription factors and signalling components. </caption>

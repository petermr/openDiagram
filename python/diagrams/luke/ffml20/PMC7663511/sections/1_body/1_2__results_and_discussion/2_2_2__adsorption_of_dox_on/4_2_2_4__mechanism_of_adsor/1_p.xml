<p>On the basis of the data presented, it can be concluded that the drug adsorption capacity of the modified MWCNTs is high and the rate of adsorption is high and fast. The explanation of the phenomena is based on three factors: the unique structure, electrostatic interaction, and the ability to bond formation. Generally, the structure of MWCNTs permits the contact between the carbon atoms and the drug molecules and thus enables the interaction between them. However, the first layer of carbon atoms in MWCNTs is more exposed to contact with the drug molecules than the deeper ones. The molecules of DOX can also locate inside nanotubes but the probability and efficiency of this phenomenon are meaningless in comparison with adsorption on the MWCNTs. The structure of oxidized material with nanodefects (confirmed by TGA analysis) and functional groups (TGA and EDS) cannot be treated as a homogenous and potential adsorption sides as equivalent. The electrostatic interactions depend mainly on the charge of the surface of MWCNTs. As shown on the basis of zeta potential measurements, the modified MWCNTs exhibit a negative charge in the whole pH range considered. Thus, the positively charged molecule of DOX can be easily attracted and adsorbed onto the career. The charge on the surface of pristine MWCNTs strongly depends on the pH value (

Although the surface of the nanotube is negatively charged at alkaline pH, the charge is much lower when compared to that on the modified carrier. Therefore, electrostatic interactions are less effective and the adsorption less efficient. The ability to form bonds affects the adsorption capacity of the material. It is associated with the presence of functional groups in both the DOX molecule (OH, COOH, NH
 <sub>2</sub>) and nanotubes (OH, COOH). The possibility of hydrogen-bonding between OH-COOH, NH
 <sub>2</sub>-COOH, OH-NH
 <sub>2,</sub> and OH-OH groups increases the adsorption capacity of the modified CNTs. Moreover, modified MWCNTs can form also an ester bond between the primary hydroxyl group of the chemotherapeutic agent and the carboxyl group located on the surface of the nanocarrier [

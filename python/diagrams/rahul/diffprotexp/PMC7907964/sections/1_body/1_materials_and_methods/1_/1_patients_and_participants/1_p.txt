0: Clinical samples, including primary skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood samples, were used in this study.
1: Primary skin fibroblasts were obtained from 4 patients with PD (median age, 46 years; age range, 41-57 years) and 4 healthy age-matched controls (median age, 45.5 years; age range, 45-53 years).
2: These included two patients with PD carrying different heterozygous  GBA variants, including c.1309delG and IVS2+1G>A, and two patients with PD carrying different heterozygous  PARK2 variants, including c.2T>C and exon 8 deletion (exon8del).
3: All participants were screened and were free of common  LRRK2 mutations as well as  TBP, SCNA, FBX07 and  GCH1 mutations.
4: The age, sex, genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the investigated individuals are shown in  Table I.
5: Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, and the study protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ramathibodi Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand; approval no.

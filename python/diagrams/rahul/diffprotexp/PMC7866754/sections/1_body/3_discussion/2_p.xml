<p id="Par57">In this work, putative novel transcripts were classified based on how they map to the canonical genes and subsequently determined where their peptide-spectrum matches align to the translated sequence to identify novel peptides. A total of 1734 novel peptides were identified, where 269 of them passed the high-quality filter of Mascot score &gt; 20. A method was also developed to predict the full-length open reading frame from peptides by finding the most suitable start and stop codons in the translated transcript, so that differential analysis could be performed for novel ORFs. The results for the length-normalized spectral abundance factors of canonical genes correlated well with those reported by Lindner et al. [

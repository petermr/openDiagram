<p>The larvae of worker and queen honeybees (
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L.) were randomly collected at 72 (3 days), 120 hours (5 days) from a frame in May 2009 at the Institute of Apicultural Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science. To guarantee that the exact aged larvae were sampled, the queen was confined to a single wax comb frame containing worker cells for 5 hours with a cage made of a queen excluder, through which workers but not the queen could pass. Subsequently, the queen was removed and the eggs contained in the frame were maintained in the honeybee colony for further development. After the eggs had hatched, the young larvae were transferred from the worker cells to the queen cell cups in a queen rearing frame and put into the queenless colony to sample queen larva. The worker larvae were collected directly from the worker cells. A total of 100 larvae were sampled for the queen and the worker larvae at each time point and the homogenates were frozen at −80°C until use, and an aliquot of 10 g homogenate larvae were used for protein extractions.

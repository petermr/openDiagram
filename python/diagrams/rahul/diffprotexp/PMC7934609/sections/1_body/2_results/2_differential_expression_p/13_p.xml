<p>Interestingly, analysis of the differential protein pathways showed that these differential proteins are mainly enriched in metabolic pathways, Huntington’s diseases, Alzheimer’s diseases, and ribosome metabolic pathways. Among these differential proteins, the expression levels (determined by protein quantifications, details shown in section “Materials and methods”) of paramyosin, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, cathepsin L1, cathepsin D, casein kinase and calmodulin were significantly more highly expressed at specific development stages and attracted our attention.</p>

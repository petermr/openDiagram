The associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms (i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cell component) were annotated based on the database. Additionally, to further investigate the signaling pathways of the identified proteins, proteinâ€“protein interactions analyzed by available experimental evidence, and statistical enrichment tests were carried out for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations.

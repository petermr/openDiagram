  <p>The GluN2B, but not GluN2A or GluN2D, isoform is preferentially expressed in the medial versus the lateral region of the SDH in male rats. (a) Representative confocal images (20x objective) illustrating the immunofluorescence for GluN2A (left), GluN2B (middle), and GluN2D (left). For each isoform, the OD per area was quantified in selected oval regions positioned within the medial, central and lateral regions of the CGRP+ SDH, as shown. There was a visible increase in intensity and distribution of fluorescent puncta in the medial SDH compared to the lateral SDH for GluN2B but not GluN2A or GluN2D. Scale bar: 200 µm. (b) Statistical analysis showing the mean medial vs lateral OD ratio for GluN2A, GluN2B and GluN2D. The medial/lateral OD ratio was significantly higher for GluN2B compared to both GluN2A and GluN2D. *p &lt; 0.05</p>

  <title>Log
   <sub>2</sub> fold-change of significantly differentially expressed proteins from plasma.

  <p>The table includes also the blast name results (description) and gene ontology categories for each protein. Control values have been normalized to 0 for comparison to the other time-points and a '-' indicates that the fold-change was non-significant and therefore were omitted from the supplementary table.</p>

<p>Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory process of the lungs that develops in response to direct (pulmonary) or indirect (extra-pulmonary) insults to the alveolarâ€“capillary membrane, resulting in increased permeability with subsequent interstitial/alveolar edema and diffuse alveolar damage [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The causes of pulmonary ARDS include pneumonia (most common), aspiration and lung contusion, whereas the causes of extra-pulmonary ARDS include sepsis of non-pulmonary origin (most common), shock, burn injury and mass transfusion, among others [

In pulmonary ARDS, the direct insult primarily affects the alveolar epithelium with a local alveolar inflammatory response, whereas in extra-pulmonary ARDS, the indirect insult affects the vascular endothelium by inflammatory mediators through the bloodstream, exhibiting more severe endothelial injury with increased plasma markers including angiopoietin-2 and greater degradation of endothelial glycocalyx [

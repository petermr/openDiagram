0: After 4 h transfection and additional culture for 24 h in serum free DMEM-F12, HGrC1 cells (15 samples including 3 replicates for 5 conditions) were lysed using TRIzol reagent (catalog #15596026, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA was extracted with Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (#R2052, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA).
1: RNA Quality control was performed by Agilent TapeStation (Additional file  1: Figure S1).
2: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TrueSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep (Illumina, catalog #20020595) and sequenced using an illumina HiSeq4000 Platform using 75-bp single-end reads, to an average of 22.9  3.4 million reads per sample.

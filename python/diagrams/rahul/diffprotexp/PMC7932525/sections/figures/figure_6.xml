  <title>Validation of DEGs by qRT-PCR analysis in 
   <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120.
  </title>
  <p>The relative expression levels of four chosen DEGs were obtained by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. Bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). Different low case letter above each column indicated significant difference at 
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.05. ‘NDV’ and ‘NDH’ refers to vegetative cells and heterocysts cultured respectively under nitrogen deprivation condition, and ‘NV’ refers to vegetative cells cultured under nitrogen-replete condition. In three paired comparisons, X vs. Y refers to Y/X.

<p>Magna RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) kit (Millipore, USA) was used to complete RIP assay in T98G cells. The cell lysate was cultured in RIP buffer containing magnetic beads and then combined with human rabbit anti-Ago2 antibody. Input was used as positive control. IgG was used as negative control. Protease K was used to purify and immune-precipitate RNA. The sample and Input were digested by protease K and then RNAs (LINC00466 and PPP1R14B) were extracted for subsequent qRT-PCR analysis. All the antibodies used were listed in

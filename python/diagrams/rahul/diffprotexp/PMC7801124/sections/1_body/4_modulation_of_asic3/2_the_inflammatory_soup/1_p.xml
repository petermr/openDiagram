<p>As discussed previously, tissue acidosis commonly develops in inflammation, but protons are just one of a plethora of mediators present in the inflammatory soup that can activate and sensitize sensory neurones; sensitization being mediated by a mixture of changes in nociceptor gene expression and/or post-translational modification of receptors involved in transducing or transmitting noxious stimuli. For example, it has been shown that the following inflammatory mediators lead to increased ASIC3 transcription in DRG neurones: nerve growth factor (NGF, 7-fold alone vs control), serotonin (5-HT, 10-fold), interleukin-1 (IL-1, 5-fold) and bradykinin (BK, 4-fold) with a combined effect of an 8-fold increase [

With regard to post-translational modification of ASIC function, protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) enhanced amplitudes of rASIC3 currents, but only when co-expressed with ASIC2b, this is because only ASIC2a/b, and not ASIC3, can interact with protein interacting with C kinase-1 (PICK-1), which is necessary for PKC modulation [

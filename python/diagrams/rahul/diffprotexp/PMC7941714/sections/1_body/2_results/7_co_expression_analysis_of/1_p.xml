<p id="Par47">To verify the hypothesis that lncRNA positively regulates mRNA expression by interacting with miRNA in the ceRNA network, we performed Pearson correlation analysis between seven clinically relevant lncRNAs and their target mRNAs. The results showed that MIR4435-2HG was positively correlated with 15 mRNAs (r &gt; 0.4, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), of which COL5A2, LOX, OSBPL3, PLAU, and VCAN had a significantly positive correlation with MIR4435-2HG (r &gt; 0.5). We speculated that MIR4435-2HG upregulated the expression of the above five DEmRNAs through different DEmiRNAs (mir-29a, mir-424, mir-335, mir-193a, and mir-193a) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a-f). Our correlation analysis of ELFN1-AS1 showed that seven mRNAs were positively associated with ELFN1-AS1 (r &gt; 0.4, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), whereas SRM and E2F1 had a significantly positive correlation with ELFN1-AS1 (r &gt; 0.5). Based on the ceRNA hypothesis, ELFN1-AS1 may upregulate the expression of SRM and E2F1 by acting as sponges of mir-423 and mir-93, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>g-i).

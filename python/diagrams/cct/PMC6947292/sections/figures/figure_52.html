 <caption> TEM image of an air-cooled 7150 sample (average cooling rate 1 K/s) showing a recrystallised grain on the left-hand side and several subgrains on the right. It can be seen that the quench-induced Î·-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu) 2 precipitates preferentially nucleate at grain/subgrain boundaries and also appear inside the recrystallised grain, nucleating at Al 3Zr dispersoids [ 119]. </caption>

<p>One of the drawbacks with the crystal structures that have been employed for in silico virtual screening is that they only represent a snapshot of a fluid channel; moreover, currently only the structure of cASIC1a is available. Due to only the cASIC1a structure being available, any virtual screening protocol against an ASIC other than cASIC1a must employ a homology model and will thus be less accurate compared to when using the actual crystal structure. The amino acid homogeneity between cASIC1a and rASIC3 is 52%, and the two proteins have similar sequence lengths, 527 and 533 residues, and molecular weights of 60.0 and 59.2 kDa, respectively [

The amino acid differences may lead to a greater degree of structural differences than predicted by the homology models used in silico, with the regions showing the greatest disparities being 1–85 and 472–542 (the transmembrane regions, which can affect the ability to produce a biphasic current) and 110–161 (finger region, which has yet to be implicated in modulation).

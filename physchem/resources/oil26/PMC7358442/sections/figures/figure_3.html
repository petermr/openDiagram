 <caption> Actogram showing locomotor activity of a single representative aardvark ( A08) at Tswalu, free-ranging in its natural environment, for the period July 2013 to May 2015 ( N = 675 consecutive days). Days are stacked vertically, data are displayed in 5-min intervals. Black bars represent periods when the aardvark was active (â‰¥5% of maximum activity); white areas represent periods when the aardvark was inactive (&lt;5% of maximum activity); dark grey line is the time of sunset; light grey line is the time of sunrise. For better visualisation of seasonal shifts in nychthemeral rhythms, activity is plotted over 48 h, with two consecutive 24-h periods displayed beside each other. </caption>

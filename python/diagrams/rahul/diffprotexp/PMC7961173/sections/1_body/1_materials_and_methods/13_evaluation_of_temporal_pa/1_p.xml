<p id="Par23">Differentially expressed genes with a logFC magnitude difference &gt; 0.35 were grouped together by treatment based on temporal expression patterns (upregulated, downregulated or no change) for the two treatment durations (6 and 12 h). There were a total of 8 groups within each DCVC concentration: consistent responders (up → up and down → down) temporary responders (up → down, and down → up) early responders (down → no change and up → no change), late responders (no change → up and no change → down. Groups that contained &gt; 100 genes were tested for enrichment on the Enrichr platform (RRID: SCR_001575) (Chen et al.

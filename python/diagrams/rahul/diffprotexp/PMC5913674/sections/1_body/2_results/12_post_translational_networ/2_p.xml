<p>Beyond histone proteins, KAc and K-MMe modification networks showed further fluctuations. The approximately 2-kDa band observed in MtzR isolates was lost upon discontinuation of drug exposure, as were several lower intensity bands between approximately 70–100 kDa. Two prominent bands observed at approximately 60 and approximately 50kDa showed significantly different intensity profiles between 713-MtzR-P0 and 106-MtzR-P0, increasing linearly in 713-MtzR-P8 and again in 713-MtzR-P16, while increasing in 106-MtzR-P8, then decreasing in 106-MtzR-P16 to levels lower than in 106-MtzR-P0 lines. Changes in the K-MMe modification networks increasingly diverged between 713-MtzR and 106-MtzR. Overall, 713-MtzR displayed a trend to increased K-MMe in 713-MtzR-P8 and 713-MtzR-P16, including appearance of the methylated protein band at approximately 25 kDa previously observed exclusively in 106-MtzS and 106-MtzR isolates (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). As observed for KAc, K-MMe was highest in trophozoites at 106-Mtz-P8 and then decreased comparatively at 106-MtzR-P16.

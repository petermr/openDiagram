0: Meanwhile, numerous studies have attempted, without success, to replicate previously reported genetic associations of multiple candidate genes with schizophrenia.
1: Therefore, in recent years, most researchers have extensively investigated the functional correlations between schizophrenia risk alleles and intermediate phenotypes using neuroimaging, and cognitive and neurophysiologic indexes.
2: Kleinman  et al.
3: (2011) proposed genetic neuropathology, a novel strategy in which the expression of mRNA and proteins in postmortem brains is used as ultimate intermediate phenotypes.
4: They hypothesized that insights into the mechanisms of psychiatric diseases and identification of novel therapeutic targets will emerge from the association of genetic variations with relevant molecular phenotypes in postmortem brains 24.
5: Actually, several recent postmortem studies 25  28, including our own 16,  29, have adopted this strategy and provided unique insights into genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.

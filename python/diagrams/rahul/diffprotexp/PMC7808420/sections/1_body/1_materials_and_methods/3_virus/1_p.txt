0: SLEV strain BeH 355964 was provided by Prof. Mauricio L. Nogueira.
1: BeH 355964 stocks were generated by passage in C6/36 mosquito cell monolayers, cultivated in Leibovitz-15 supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cultilab, Brazil) and antibiotics.
2: Clarified supernatants containing virus were titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells and viral titers were expressed in plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL of supernatant.
3: SLEV BeH 355964 complete genome sequence is available at GenBank under accession number KM267635 [ 30].

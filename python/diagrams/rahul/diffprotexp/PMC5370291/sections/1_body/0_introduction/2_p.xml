<p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) possesses multipotent bioactivity that mediates various cellular responses, including proliferation, proinflammatory factor production, and cell death. Particularly, TNFα is known to involve in the pathophysiology of multiple liver disorders such viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The roles of TNFα in liver injury acts as not only a mediator of cell death but also an inducer of cell proliferation

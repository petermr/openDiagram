0: Although macrolides do not directly contact the PTC, the interaction between the peptide and macrolide can alter the PTCs structure.
1: By hindering the movement of the peptide through the exit tunnel, the nascent chain can compress and push back on the P-site, altering the structure of nucleotides within the PTC and thereby suppress catalysis of peptide bond formation.
2: For example, in the presence of ERY, rRNA nucleotide U2585s position is shifted within the tunnel, which could sterically conflict with the ErmCL nascent chain 11.
3: Ramu and coworkers 12 demonstrated that the presence of ERY and ErmAL1 peptide in the exit tunnel alters the properties of the A-site, preventing particular tRNAs from binding.
4: The binding of macrolides in the exit tunnel can even alter the conformation of the PTC before the sequence of peptide has reached the macrolide through an allosteric mechanism 13.

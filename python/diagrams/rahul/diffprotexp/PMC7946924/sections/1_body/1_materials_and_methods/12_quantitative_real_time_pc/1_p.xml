<p id="Par22">Total RNA from apical and basal spikelets of rice genotypes SR-157 and SR-159 at 0 and 5 days post-anthesis was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and was treated with DNase I (Promega) to get rid of genomic DNA contamination which was confirmed by –RT PCR (treated RNA used as template, actin primer set). The genomic DNA-free RNA isolated as above was reverse transcribed using QantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). The c-DNA prepared was used as template for qRT-PCR analysis by QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast). Each gene and 18S rRNA as reference control was amplified using gene specific primers designed through Primer Blast. Fold change in gene expression was calculated using 2

0: Mg battery is considered as a promising next-generation advanced battery technology possessing high theoretical volumetric energy density, good safety and high abundance.
1: Nevertheless, before the battery technology becomes viable, several critical technological challenges should be conquered, including the development of proper electrolyte and cathodes.
2: The SEI formed on the Mg surface is ionic-blocking for Mg ion when Mg batteries employs the conventional carbonate-based solvent commonly used in LIBs.
3: The electrolyte development for Mg batteries therefore cannot simply mimic LIB electrolytes but requires novel design strategies.
4: The proposal of ether-based solvent demonstrated the ability to avoid the formation of insulating passivation layer, but the practical application is still highly limited by the corrosive issues from Grignard salts and the safety concern, as well as the small electrochemical potential window.
5: Featuring high stability and safety, ionic solid conductor could be an ideal solution to the above problems.
6: But Mg ions have sluggish mobility within solid conductor due to the high charge density.
7: Several types of solid conductors, including phosphates, borohydrides, chalcogenides and MOFs, have been developed to improve the performance of Mg ionic solid conductor over the recent years ( Figure 2A).

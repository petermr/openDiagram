<p id="Par12">In the PTG prediction section, we predicted 409 PTGs corresponding to 138 DELs. To confirm this result, we randomly selected 5 lincRNA genes with significant positive correlation based on their expression levels. The correlation coefficients were all greater than 0.80, and the 
 <italic>p</italic> values were less than 0.05. We performed RT-qPCR experiments on nine samples, and the results were analyzed using linear regression. The expression levels suggested that the five pairs of lincRNA genes and their PTGs are significantly positively correlated, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.80 and 
 <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05. The experimental results of RT-qPCR showed that the results of the two datasets are in good agreement, further improving the reliability of the present study (Fig.Â

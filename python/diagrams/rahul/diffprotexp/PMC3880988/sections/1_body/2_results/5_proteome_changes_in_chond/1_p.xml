<p>About 1050 spots were detected using 2-DE analyses
 <italic> (p</italic>&lt;0.01). From the 1050 spots, 146 protein spots were classified as differentially expressed based on the computer-assisted 2-DE gel differential analysis. Of these, six highly modulated proteins were excised from the preparative gels for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The positions and the densitometry analysis of the six protein spots were labelled on the 2-DE gels (Figure

<p>Though genes are ultimately expressed as proteins, many studies (including current studies by our group) still measure mRNA expression as an implicit proxy for protein expression levels. As a justification for this approach, we typically point to the fact that after accounting for technical considerations, the correlation between mRNA levels and protein abundance is quite high genome-wide, specifically, across genes (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Buccitelli and Selbach, 2020</xref>). This suggests that a number of molecular mechanisms decouple mRNA and protein expression levels post-transcriptionally. Clearly, we do not yet fully understand the post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms that shape the proteome (

0: In order to get a better understanding of the mechanism of nitrogen source utilization, comparative transcriptome studies are carried out under three different culture conditions on  S.  pasteurii in this paper.
1: We aimed to investigate the expression pattern of urease gene of  S.  pasteurii and the necessary nutrients for the growth, metabolism, and mineralization of  S.  pasteurii.
2: The results presented in the paper can help to reduce the cost of MICP and realize the flexible regulation of mineralization reaction in large-scale engineering applications by the utilization of proper nitrogen sources.

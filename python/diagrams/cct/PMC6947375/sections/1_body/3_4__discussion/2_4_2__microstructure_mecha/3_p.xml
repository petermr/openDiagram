<p>SEM images of the fracture surface of the cold rolled and cold drawn specimens after tensile tests are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f012">Figure 12</xref>a,b, respectively. One could see that there were numerous undissolved cementite particles and dimples in the fractured region. Undissolved cementite particles were found in a few dimples. It could be deduced that the larger number and the smaller size of dimples were responsible for the larger elongation of the 33.6% cold rolled specimen and the 25.8% cold drawn specimen. During tension, the fine particles (spherical or nearly spherical) promoted the nucleation of dimples through microvoid coalescence. The presence of dimples supported that a microporous-aggregation-related failure mode occurred during tensile tests. In contrast, strip-like carbides were against toughness compared to spherical ones because the strip-like carbides located at ferritic grain boundaries might reduce the boundary cohesion [

When the material was subjected to external stress, the dislocations accumulated around strip-like carbides, resulting in stress concentration. However, irregular thin plate-like particles generally had a larger contact area and a higher volume ratio with the matrix, while dislocation movement via cutting cementite particles inevitably generated new surfaces, leading to the increasing system energy and thus the more significant strengthening effect [

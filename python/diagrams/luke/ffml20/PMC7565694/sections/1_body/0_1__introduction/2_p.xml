<p>In this regard, polyimides (PIs) have been considered as one of the best choices for flexible AMOLED substrates because of their excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties [

 <xref rid="B15-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the insufficient barrier performances of PIs affect their application in AMOLED substrates. To improve the barrier performances of PIs, inorganic barrier layers such as aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide or inorganic/organic alternating layers are usually fabricated on PIs by sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [

 <xref rid="B17-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the deposition methods are usually complicated, and require large-scale equipment, thus lead to fairly high fabrication costs. Apparently, these deposition processes are on the basis of intrinsic PI matrix. Hence, enhancing the barrier performances of intrinsic PIs can reduce the thickness of surface barrier layers [

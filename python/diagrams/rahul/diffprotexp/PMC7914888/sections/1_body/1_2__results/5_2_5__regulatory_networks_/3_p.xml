<p>We reviewed the gene regulation network constructed for the miRNAs differentially expressed in cells exposed to 5-Brd-2â€²-dU concerning L-Tyr. The network contained a total of 255 KEGG routes, 1671 hits, and 903 nodes; of which, 21 routes with 337 hits passed the hypergeometric test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). In this case, we observed other pathways involved, such as cell cycle, Wnt, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The data reported so far show the existence of a specific miRNA expression profile for each induced phenotype. This profile, seen from a network gene regulation model, would be associated with controlling different cellular programs through their target genes.

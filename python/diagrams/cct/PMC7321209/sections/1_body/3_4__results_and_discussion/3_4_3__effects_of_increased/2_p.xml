<p>The diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f010">Figure 10</xref>a shows increasing values for layer height with increasing CTWD. A rise of approximately 25% was observed independently from the parameter set. The examination of the layer width (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f010">Figure 10</xref>b) exhibited an inverse dependence. Herein, layer width decreased to approximately 83% (CTWD = 44 mm) of the initial value (CTWD = 12 mm).

<p>This concern seems to be based on some misunderstanding of our approach to identify and characterize MIA transcriptional signatures. We fully agree that MIA-associated differential expression signatures will not be adequately captured by PCA and WGCNA. While PCA and WGCNA are powerful approaches, they are not used as primary methods for differential expression analysis. Indeed, we use these tools as secondary in the context of contextualizing MIA-associated differential expression (DE) signatures at a systems level. For primary DE analysis and identification of DE genes, we used a well-established method that maximizes power via controlling for co-variates, the generalized linear model framework implemented in edgeR. We have added text to clarify this strategy:</p>

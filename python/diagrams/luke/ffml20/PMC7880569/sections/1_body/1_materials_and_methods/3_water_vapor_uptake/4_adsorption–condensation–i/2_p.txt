0: Water loadings ( wtot) obtained by microgravimetry were predicted using our composite  adsorptioncondensationintercalation model, 38 which was implemented in a MATLAB R2019b (The Mathworks, Inc.) code.
1: The model accounts for coexisting water populations (i) on the external basal faces (adsorption;  wads), (ii) condensed between particle (condensation;  wcond) water, and (ii) on the internal basal face (intercalation;  wint), such that 1

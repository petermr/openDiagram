<p>By comparing the two variants of Al10Si0.3Mg, it can be seen that the die-cast alloy has a higher concentration of Si, while the concentration of Mg is slightly higher in the LBM version, see 
 <xref rid="materials-12-04083-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref> in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-04083">Appendix A</xref>. A further difference is that the LBM version contains almost no Mn, while the die-cast variant contains a mass fraction of â‰ˆ0.4%. It is found that the LBM variant of Al10Si0.3Mg generally produces higher values of specific precipitation enthalpy, and that the loss in hardness potential (i.e., the quench sensitivity) is also higher in this alloy. Since the laser-beam-melting process involves extremely fast cooling rates for solidification, the eutectic like structure of the LBM material is much finer compared to that of the die-cast eutectic (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f070">Figure 70</xref>). This much finer eutectic structure is considered to increase the number of available nucleation sites, thus promoting quench-induced precipitation. In line with this, the peak temperature of the LRT is shifted to higher temperatures in the LBM alloy.

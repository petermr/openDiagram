<p id="Par22">The network/canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes/proteins revealed mostly signalling and metabolic pathways. The major network pathways associated with the tail tissue regeneration are Cell morphology, embryonic development and skin development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) involving DSC1, DSC2, GPI, DSP, NEDD8, CD63 and keratin as major genes/proteins. NEDD8, a ubiquitin like protein involved in cell cycle progression was found to be associated with the regeneration from 2-dpa onwards through upregulation. CD63, a cell surface receptor plays a key role in activation of AKT (Serin/threonine protein kinase) and integrin leading to cellular signalling cascades was found to be upregulated from day 1 of amputation having an important role in regeneration initiation. Keratinisation, cellular differentiation and epithelial cell proliferation were found to be upregulated for the initiation of regeneration from 2-dpa onwards. FERMT2 (Fermitin family member 2)

 </sup> and MYO16 were found correlated in cell–cell adhesion, cell junction assembly and regulation of cell cycle progression based on network pathway analysis. These pathways were found associated with epithelial cell differentiation, cellular morphology, proliferation and development, controlling the cell cycle progression, actin-filament binding for structural integrity, cytoskeleton organization and cellular signalling during the tail regeneration.

<p id="Par43">GO information of significantly different proteins was obtained using UniProt [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The program provides annotations to proteins in the UniProt Knowledgebase that are controlled vocabulary terms used to describe molecular function, biological process and location of action of a protein in a cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, to observe networks of differentially expressed proteins, their biological processes, and associated diseases, we used the IPA tool (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.qiagen.com/ingenuity</ext-link>). A right-tailed Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to compare the number of proteins that participate in a given function or pathway relative to the total number of occurrences of these proteins in all biological functions and pathway annotations stored in the IPA knowledge base. The IPA tool also generates a score for each network. The score is derived from a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value and scores of 2 or higher have at least a 99% confidence of not being generated by random chance alone. IPA identifies the most significant diseases and biological functions of the differentially expressed proteins and the top five are categorized and reported based on their 
 <italic>p</italic>-values.

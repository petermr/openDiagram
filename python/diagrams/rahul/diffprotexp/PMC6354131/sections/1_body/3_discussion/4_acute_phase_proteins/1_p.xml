<p id="p0105">SSA1 (serum amyloid A-1 protein) is a major acute phase protein that is highly expressed in response to inflammation and tissue injury. This protein also plays an important role in HDL metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. Apolipoprotein A is a major apoprotein (45%) constituting HDL in the early phase of sepsis, and slowly replaced by apolipoproteinA-1 during recovery. In severe sepsis, HDL is shifted to acute phase HDL, which is enriched in serum amyloid A and depleted of cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1.

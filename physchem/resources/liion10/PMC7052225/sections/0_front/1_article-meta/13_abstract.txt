0: This work presents an alternative method for fabricating Li-ion electrodes in which the use of aluminum/copper current collectors and expensive binders is avoided.
1: Low-cost natural cellulose fibers with a 2-mm length are employed as binder and support for the electrode.
2: The objective of this method is to eliminate the use of heavy and inactive current collector foils as substrates and to replace conventional costly binders with cellulose fibers.
3: Moreover, no harmful solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone, are employed for film fabrication.
4: Water-soluble carbons are also utilized to reduce the preparation time and to achieve a better repartition of carbon in the electrode, thus improving the electrochemical performance.
5: Flexible and resistant LiFePO  4 (LFP), Li  4Ti  5O  12 (LTO), organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), and graphite electrodes are obtained with active mass loadings similar to those obtained by the current casting method.
6: The initial discharge capacity of approximately 130 mAhg  1 at 2 C is obtained for an LFP/LTO paper battery with an approximately 91.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.
7: An all-organic prelithiated PTCDA/graphite cell without a transition metal is prepared and electrochemically tested.
8: It is one of the first self-standing batteries that is composed of organic redox active molecules and biodegradable components reported in literature.

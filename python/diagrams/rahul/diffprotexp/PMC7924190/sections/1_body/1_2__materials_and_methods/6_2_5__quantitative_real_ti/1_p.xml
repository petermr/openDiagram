<p>Total RNA was isolated from cultured hTCEpi cells after 24 h treatment with AC EFs using the NucleoSpin
 <sup>®</sup> RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Single-stranded cDNA was prepared with 1 µg of total RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Intron–exon spanning primers were designed from the respective GenBank sequences using VectorNTI software (ThermoFisher Scientific) based on the minimal hairpin, duplex formation, and guanine cytosine composition. A list of primers used in this study is given in

<p id="Par23">Simultaneously, the cytoplasmic male Sterility also occurs mainly in mitochondria, and mitochondria are also used as a place for energy conversion in plant development. Therefore, we speculate that the occurrence of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS may be related to the production and conversion of energy, thereby regulating the degradation of tapetum and triggering the development of anthers abnormal.” We performed GO analysis to determine the functional group of DAPs. The 140 DAPs between the CMS and the maintenance lines were divided into 17 functional groups, of which biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions accounted for 7, 4, and 6 GO terms, respectively. For biological processes, there are 30 proteins in protein-rich cellular processes, 56 proteins in metabolic processes, 26 proteins related to a single biological process, four responses to stimulus, eight proteins for localization, and three proteins for regulation of the biological process. Besides, genes were restored in cytoplasmic male sterility in transport activation and further aspects of the existing changes. Related proteins involved in the cell cycle and restorer processes showed different 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS lines (Table S

The cell components are disturbed; there are 18 cell component proteins, 11 organelles, 13 biological macromolecular complexes, and 10 Membrane-associated proteins. In the molecular functional group, proteins with catalytic and binding activities accounted for 54 and 49 proteins, respectively, four proteins had transporter active, eight structural molecular active proteins, three antioxidant proteins, and three other characteristic proteins (Fig.

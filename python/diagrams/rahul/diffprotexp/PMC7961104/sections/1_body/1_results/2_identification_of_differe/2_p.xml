<p id="p0070">We measured the expression of 13,795 genes in the liver and 14,301 genes in skeletal muscle from fasted WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B; 
 <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). We defined genes that were significantly different in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We identified 4,253 upregulated DEGs and 3,611 downregulated DEGs in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice and 3,721 upregulated DEGs and 3,869 downregulated DEGs in skeletal muscle (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). In both the liver and skeletal muscle, we observed the upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism (
 <italic>Acaca</italic>). In contrast, the DEGs encoding proteins involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (
 <italic>Gck</italic>, 
 <italic>Gapdh</italic>, 
 <italic>Pgk1</italic>, 
 <italic>Pklr</italic>) were upregulated in the liver, whereas the DEG encoding proteins involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (
 <italic>Gapdh</italic>) were downregulated in skeletal muscle.

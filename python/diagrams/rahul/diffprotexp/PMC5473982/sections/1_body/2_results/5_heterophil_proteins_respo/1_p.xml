<p>Altogether, 153 proteins were present in different abundance in the heterophils before and after 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis infection. Of these, 109 proteins increased and 44 proteins decreased in abundance (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> for all quantified heterophil proteins). Proteins belonging to 2 KEGG categories were enriched in heterophils following 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis infection. These included the category translation with 39 proteins (
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.58E−62) and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (12 proteins, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.74E−11). Twenty proteins with the highest increase in abundance, except for those belonging to the category translation, are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Among others, these included AVD, F13A, ANXA2, ANXA7 or CTSC.

<p id="Par5">The knowledge of molecular dynamics by computational studies have advanced experimental work. For enhanced envision and insight of dendrimers and their interactions, computational designs provide sustenance to ameliorate efficiency. This investigational approach is converged on the optimization and application of molecular modeling to analyze the layout of dendrimers. The emphasis has been made to improve the efficacy of this class of molecules. In this paper, dendrimer molecular models were parameterized using the UFF forcefield and molecular dynamic atomistic simulation approaches have been employed. Simultaneously, the dendritic polymers were optimized at laboratory scale. To meet the augmenting requirement of dendrimers for multiple applications, the co-application of computational and experimental approach can significantly enhance the clinical application of dendrimers.</p>

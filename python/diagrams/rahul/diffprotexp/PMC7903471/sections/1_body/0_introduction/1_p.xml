<p>Knee osteoarthritis is the most common chronic degenerative bone and joint disease in middle-aged and elderly individuals worldwide (

 <xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and results from a multifactorial imbalance in the synthesis and degradation of knee chondrocytes subchondral bone and extracellular matrix (

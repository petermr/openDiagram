0: Cysticerci produce and secrete several molecules as a result of their metabolism, including digestive enzymes, extracellular proteinases, cytokine-like, chemokine-like, and hormone-like proteins, and others.
1: Secreted proteins (ESPs) could provide us with important information on the host-parasite relationship [ 4 6].
2: ESPs have also been involved in key biological processes like adhesion, migration, cell-cell communication, differentiation, proliferation, morphogenesis, survival, defense, virulence, and immune response [ 7].

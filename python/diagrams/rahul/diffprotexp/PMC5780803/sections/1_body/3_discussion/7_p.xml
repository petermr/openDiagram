<p>ER stress is not conducive to cell survival. Hypoxia activates the unfolded protein response, which adapts tumor cells to stress conditions, thereby increasing the malignancy of the cancer (

Therefore, we hypothesized that XIAP serves a critical role in the regulation of programmed cell death in RCC cells.

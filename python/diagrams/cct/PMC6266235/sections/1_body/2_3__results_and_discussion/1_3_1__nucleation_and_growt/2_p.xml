<p>After completion of reversed austenite transformation on heating, austenite started to grow, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The austenite grain size at different temperatures was measured on the CLSM samples using the circular-intercept method. The austenite growth rate was plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It reveals that the grain size growth rate was small below the temperature of 1100 °C on continuous heating. There was a sharp increase in austenite growth from 1100 °C up to 1250 °C. When the peak temperature of 1308 °C was attained, the maximum grain size of ~52 μm was observed and almost no growth was found during the following continuous cooling until it reached austenite decomposition temperature.

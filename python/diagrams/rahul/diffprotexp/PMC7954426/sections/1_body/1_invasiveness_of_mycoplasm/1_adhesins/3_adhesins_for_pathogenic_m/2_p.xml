<p>The hemotropic 
 <italic>M. suis</italic> also expresses immunodominant adhesin MGS1 (now named GAPDH), which shares a high homology within GAPDH in 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic> and can interact with Band3 and glycophorin A in erythrocytes [

 <xref rid="cit0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Likewise, the adhesion characteristics of erythrocyte-binding adhesin O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (OSGEP) of 
 <italic>M. suis</italic> is similar to that of GAPDH [

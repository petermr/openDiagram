0: GCase activity was determined using a fluorometric assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl -D-glucopyranoside (4-MU--Glc) as a substrate, as previously described, with certain modifications ( 22).
1: All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck KGaA).
2: After cell thawing, the fibroblasts were mixed with 200 l 0.9% NaCl containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and were homogenized with an ultrasonic homogenizer (U200H; IKA Labortechnik) at 30% amplitude and 0.2% cycle.
3: The protein concentrations of the fibroblast lysates were measured using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with BSA as a standard (Bio-Rad Protein assay standard II; cat.
4: no.
5: 5000007, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).
6: For the enzyme assay, 10 l homogenized cell lysate was incubated with 90 l 5 mM 4-MU--Glc in 10 mM sodium taurocholate at 37 C for 1 h. After incubation, 200 l 0.5 M NaHCO 3/Na 2CO 3 (pH 10.7) was added to stop the reaction.
7: The clear reaction was transferred into a 96-well microplate, and the fluorescence emission was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M2/M2e Multi-Mode microplate reader; Molecular Devices, LLC) with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm.
8: The GCase activity was calculated as the release of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) per time divided by the quantity of protein used.
9: One unit was defined as the release of 1 mole 4-MU in 1 h per 1 mg protein.

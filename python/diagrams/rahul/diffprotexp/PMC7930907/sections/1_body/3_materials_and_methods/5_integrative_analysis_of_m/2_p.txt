0: The DEGs and differential metabolites were subjected to KEGG Mapper 4 to get the common pathway.
1: KGML file, a subset in the KEGG database, contains the relationships of the graph objects and information about lineal homologous genes in the KEGG genes database.
2: The differences in genes and metabolites in our study were subjected to the database, and the matched network relationships were set as a basic network.
3: Metabolome and transcriptome relationships were visualized and interpreted using Cytoscape (version 3.4.0), and hub genes were calculated by CytoHubba (a Cytoscape plug-in for identifying hub nodes) through MCC (the top 10 nodes ranked by MCC) and degree (degree >6) algorithm.

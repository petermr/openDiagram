<p>Nevertheless, individual cells could be sorted manually or using mechanical sorters according to the composition of the batteries. This classification is very important to avoid any cross-contamination of the downstream metallurgical processes, particularly for the bulk delivery of spent batteries where alkaline batteries, Li primary cells, LIBs, and NiMH are mixed together in various proportions. Sorting is easier for large battery packs because they only contain single chemistry batteries. Because the state-of-charge and state-of-health of these accumulators are unknown, safety measures should be implemented to protect operators performing this task.</p>

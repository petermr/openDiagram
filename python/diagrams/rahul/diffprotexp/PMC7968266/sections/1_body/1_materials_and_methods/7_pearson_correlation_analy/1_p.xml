<p id="Par29">Through the ROC and survival analysis, we screened the top 5 core genes with better diagnostic efficiency and higher prognostic value for EOC. We further analyzed whether 5 core genesâ€™ expression is related to the level of different immune checkpoint proteins through the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database (

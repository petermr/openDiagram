<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The relative amounts of the SoEO individual constituents were estimated using a Hewlett Packard 5890 II GC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and HP-5 MS capillary column (5 % phenyl/95 % dimethylpolysiloxane: 30 m &#215; 0.25 mm, <italic>i.d.,</italic> 0.25 &#956;m film thickness). Injector and detector temperature were set at 250 &#176;C and 280 &#176;C, respectively. The oven temperature was kept at 50 &#176;C for 1 min, then gradually raised to 230 &#176;C at 10 &#176;C/min and subsequently, held isothermal for 5 min. Nitrogen was the carrier gas at a constant linear velocity of 38.5 cm/ sec and a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The sample was diluted in hexane and 1 &#181;L was injected manually into the system. Quantitative data acquisition of the individual components was electronically obtained from FID area percent data.</p>

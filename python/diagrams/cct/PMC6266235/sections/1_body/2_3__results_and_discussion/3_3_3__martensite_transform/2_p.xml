<p>Apart from martensite transformation, some austenite was retained in FGHAZ because of the fast continuous cooling transformation (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f004">Figure 4</xref>), as well as the shorter transformation temperature range. The volume fraction of retained austenite in FGHAZ was measured to be 9~11% by XRD, while only 0.5~1.2% retained austenite in CGHAZ (

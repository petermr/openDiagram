0: Raw reads were de-multiplexed and checked for quality using the FastQC software ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
1: Adaptors, duplicated sequences, ambiguous reads, and low-quality reads were removed by using Trim Galore ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/).
2: The high-quality reads (QC > 30) were used for assembling the transcriptomes with Trinity v2.0.2 [ 60,  61].
3: The available Roche 454/FLX +  P. notatum reproductive transcriptome generated by Ortiz et al.
4: [ 31] was initially used for a reference-guided assembly with the parameters:--SS_lib_type RF --normalize_by_read_set --min_contig_length 400, and --genome_guided_bam.
5: Then, a second de novo assembly (without a reference) was carried out using the default parameters.
6: The four assemblies (apo_over reference, sex_over reference, apo_without reference and sex_without reference) were combined in one file and the non-redundant transcripts were selected using CD-HIT [ 85].
7: The quality of the assemblies was measured using QUAST [ 86].
8: The raw reads were mapped to the global assembly using Bowtie2 (v 2.3.2.0) [ 87] and TopHat (v2.1.1) [ 88].
9: The transcriptome coverage was evaluated using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO, version 3.0.2) [ 89,  90] with the following commands: Python run_BUSCO.py i sequence_file o output_name l lineage m tran, Python generate_plot.py wd working directory and the liliopsida_odb10 dataset.
10: The coding competence for all expressed transcript sequences was predicted using the TransDecoder software ( https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder.wiki.git) with the default parameters (m 100).
11: For differential expression analysis, RNA-seq reads were analyzed with the Kallisto v.0.44.0 software to determine transcript counts and abundances.
12: The libraries were normalized by size and low-count transcripts were filtered out (< 3 in the three replicas of each library).
13: Differential expression analysis and the corresponding  p-values were estimated using the Bioconductor software package DESeq2 [ 91].
14: The  p-values attained by the Wald test were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
15: The adjusted  p-values (DESeq2 padj or FDR) thresholds for considering transcripts as DETs/DEATs were < 0.001 and < 0.05 for sense and antisense transcripts, respectively.
16: Moreover, analyses of DETs were restricted to those showing an absolute value of Log 2FC > |3|.
17: Comparisons of gene expression between modes of reproduction were carried out considering all stages of development (global comparison) or each developmental stage (stage-specific comparison).
18: Venn diagrams were created by using the jvenn online tool/software ( http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/example.html) [ 92].
19: The transcriptome dynamics was analyzed with R: normalized counts were used to execute a hierarchical clustering using a simple euclidean distance metric and a complete linkage method.

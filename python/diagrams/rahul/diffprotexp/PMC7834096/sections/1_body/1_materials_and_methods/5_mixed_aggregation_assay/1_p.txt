0: EAEC 55989  agg3  cells containing either pBAD24 or the plasmids encoding the different AAF gene clusters, as well as pPS1 or pPS2 (encoding  cfp and  yfp, respectively) were inoculated in 2 ml LB medium with glucose (0.4% w/v) from a previously plated glycerol stock and grown overnight at 37C and 180 rpm.
1: For this culture, we used LB medium with glucose in order to avoid premature aggregation of bacteria encoding the same fimbriae.
2: The following day 5 ml of fresh LB medium were inoculated with 12.5 l of two different overnight cultures (overall dilution factor of 1:200).
3: The OD 600 was determined in regular time intervals until an OD 600 of 0.40.6 had been reached, 150 l of a 10% arabinose solution was added, incubation continued for another 60 min and afterward samples were kept static at room temperature to allow the cells to sediment before microscopic inspection.
4: Samples for microscopy using the inverted microscope Leica DMi8 were taken from the bottom of the tubes.
5: The Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) was used to take and pre-process the images.
6: For further processing, we used ImageJ 1.51 n.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f063">Figure 63</xref> the obtained CCP diagram for alloy 7050 taken from Ref. [
 <xref rid="B88-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. A comparison of the evaluation in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f062">Figure 62</xref> with the DSC cooling results seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f049">Figure 49</xref> indicates that DSC generates much more convincing results, particularly in terms of reaction identification. However, highly similar results were obtained in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B88-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] for 7050 as for 7150, which has a similar chemical composition. Using electrical resistivity measurements, the authors of Ref. [
 <xref rid="B88-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] identified three distinct reactions at high, medium and low temperatures. The temperature ranges were relatively similar, and complete suppression of the HTR was identified within a similar range of cooling rates as in the CCP diagram for 7150 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f061">Figure 61</xref>. The in situ electrical resistivity measurements were obtained during nonlinear cooling, which might be an advantage in terms of comparability with technological applications. The cooling time range covered is relatively large, although it is still narrower than that of the DSC work.

<p>Clinical presentations of hospitalized patients with the D34 variants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were classified as asymptomatic for one patient, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) for 2 patients, and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI, pneumonia) for 3 patients. To evaluate disease severity in relation to the D34 deletion, mild (asymptomatic and URTI, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) versus severe COVID-19 (LRTI, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) was compared by Fisher’s exact test. No significant difference in clinical presentation could be observed between hospitalized patients harbouring or not the ORF6 deletion (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.99).

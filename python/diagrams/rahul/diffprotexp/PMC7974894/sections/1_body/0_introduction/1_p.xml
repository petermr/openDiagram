<p>Tongue cancer is the most frequent type of malignancy in the oral cavity, and is characterized by remarkable aggressive biological behavior 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. This is partly due to that tongue cancer is comparatively silent and progresses fast from a premalignant state into invasive carcinoma. This feature causes delay in diagnosis and thus leading to poor prognosis

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Thus, even the currently understanding of cancer development and progression is rapidly increasing, tongue cancer is still a serious health issue in many counties with significantly lower 5-year survival rate in patients

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Hence, expanding our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism to develop effective methods for early screening and diagnosis and identification of new therapeutic targets are urgently required for tongue cancer.

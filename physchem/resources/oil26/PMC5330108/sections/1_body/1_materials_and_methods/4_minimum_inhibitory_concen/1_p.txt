0: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination was performed using 96-well microtiter plates.
1: The  F. sporotrichioides fungal inocula in 96-well microtiter plates were treated with MPE at different concentrations and incubated for 24 h; then, absorbance was measured at 575 nm.
2: Fluconazole was used as the standard and also to compare the cell viability under inverted microscope.
3: The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was regarded as the lowest concentration that prevented growth of the fungus following 72 h incubation at 28C in a fresh potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate, indicating more than 99.5% killing of the original inocula.

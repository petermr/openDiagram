0: Rhaponticum carthamoides (Willd.)
1: Iljin (Asteraceae) has been used for centuries in traditional Siberian medicine in the case of overstrain and weakness after illness [ 8].
2: The plant has demonstrated several biological activities, including adaptogenic, antioxidant, anticancer, and antimicrobial effects [ 8 10].
3: The raw material of  R. carthamoides comprises roots and rhizomes of three- to four-year-old plants which are used in various dietary supplements or nutraceutical preparations.
4: The collection of raw material from natural habitat or cultivation is not effective because it requires the destruction of the whole plants [ 11].
5: An alternative may be the biotechnological approaches such as the hairy root cultures obtained by  Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation.
6: Hairy root cultures are characterized by rapid increase of biomass in a short time (46 weeks) and genetic stability.
7: The level of secondary metabolites in these cultures may be comparable to or higher than in roots of plants growing naturally [ 12].
8: In our previous study we obtained hairy roots of  R. carthamoides and evaluated their phytochemical profile in methanol extract [ 11].

<p>To correlate the pattern of inflammatory pathology observed in infected mice with the production of chemokines and cytokines known to be associated with the TREM1 inflammatory pathway, the chemokine CXCL1/KC, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 as well as IL-10 and INF-γ, were measured in lung homogenates of

 <sup>−/−</sup> and 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>+/+</sup> mice. In line with our previous results, an induction of inflammatory cytokines was observed with maximum amounts at 2 dpi that decreased between 3 and 5 dpi (

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice for CXCL1 and TNF-α. Of interest, differences for IL-1β were also maintained at 3 dpi and no induction and differences between groups were obtained for IL-10 and IFN-γ (

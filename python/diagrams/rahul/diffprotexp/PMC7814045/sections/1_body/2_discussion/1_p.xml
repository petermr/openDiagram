 </sup>. Here we show that transcriptomic changes extensively involve genes associated with ribosome biogenesis and rRNA maturation, also inducing mRNA decapping and affecting translation accuracy, indicating a reprogramming of the cell translational apparatus during the exposure. Indeed, the upregulation of EDC1 (YGL222C), a gene involved in mRNA decapping, highlights the possible role of this mechanism in response to exposure to acetic acid, a phenomena associated also to the yeast response to heat stress

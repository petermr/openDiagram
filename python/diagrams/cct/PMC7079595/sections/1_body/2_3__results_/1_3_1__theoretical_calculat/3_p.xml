<p>For ferrite formation, during coiling simulation, a longer time is necessary in comparison to bainite formation. The ferrite formation at both 700 and 600 Â°C should start after 2000 s. According to the isothermal TTT diagram, a very long time is necessary to complete the transformation. This means that the coiling could be a good approach to stabilize some austenite during very slow cooling typical for coiling conditions. These calculations were used to determine possible heat treatments, which are presented in

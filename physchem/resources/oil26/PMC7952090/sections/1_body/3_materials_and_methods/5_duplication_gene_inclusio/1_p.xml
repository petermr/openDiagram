<p>In order to condense transcript-level hits into single gene loci, and to resolve many-to-one genome mappings, we removed exons where transcripts from different genes overlapped, and merged overlapping transcripts of the same gene into a single gene locus call. The resulting gene-level copy number table was then combined with the maximum ECNC values observed for each gene in order to call gene duplications. We called a gene duplicated if its copy number was two or more, and if the maximum ECNC value of all the gene transcripts searched was 1.5 or greater; previous studies have shown that incomplete duplications can encode functional genes (

 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez et al., 2018</xref>), therefore partial gene duplications were included provided they passed additional inclusion criteria (see below). The ECNC cut-off of 1.5 was selected empirically, as this value minimized the number of false positives seen in a test set of genes and genomes. The results of our initial search are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Overall, we identified 13,880 genes across all species, or 77.1% of our starting query genes.

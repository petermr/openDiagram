<p id="Par24">Signatures for each comparison were generated by filtering the results for statistical significance (
 <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) and a linear fold change of at least 1.5×. Volcano plots and a Circos plot for these signatures illustrate that patients that develop LCOS have an overall greater fold change in gene expression pre-operative versus post-operative (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); concordantly, the LCOS group shows stronger significance of the gene differences pre-operatively and post-operatively and a larger number of significantly changed genes. In addition, these signatures show no preferential distribution across the human genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The deconvolution of the whole blood patient transcriptome and quantification of the relative abundances for 22 different immune cell types was performed to determine if the differences in gene expression could be attributed to differences in the proportion of immune cell types. No significant differences were detected (Supplemental Fig.

<p>The mucosal lining of the bronchi also experiences changes in pH during different pathological conditions. For example, in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) a drop of pH 0.5 occurs [

 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Respiratory pH can also be measured through taking breath condensate pH readings and compared to control individuals relative acidosis has been measured in asthma (∆ pH 0.11), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, ∆ pH 0.27), bronchiectasis (∆ pH 0.30) [
 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and acute lung injury (∆ pH 1.61) [
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. There are other conditions in which acidosis has been measured in rodent models of human disease, e.g. in cardiac ischemia pH drops from pH 7.15 to pH 6.84 [
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and in stroke from pH 7.3 to pH 6.3 [
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

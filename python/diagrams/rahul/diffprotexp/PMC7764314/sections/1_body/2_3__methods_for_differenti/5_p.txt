0: An intriguing approach consists in using co-expression to identify clusters of samples, e.g., subsets of tumours differing in the co-expression of TF targets, leading to the identification of modulators of differential co-expression [ 62, 98, 99, 100] ( Table 6).
1: Most of the algorithms are implemented in R and freely available, to facilitate their usage, together with network visualisation tools (e.g., Cytoscape and Gephi [ 101, 102]).

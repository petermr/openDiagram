0: The disease-associated increased K V1.3 expression seems to translate to humans since strong K V1.3 expression has also been found in postmortem human brains on microglia in infarcted areas following ischemic stroke [ 5, 12], on microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in Alzheimers disease [ 7, 13], and on microglia in the prefrontal cortex and substantia nigra in Parkinsons disease [ 8].
1: Taken together, these encouraging findings in humans and animal models strongly suggest microglial K V1.3 channels as a therapeutic target for reducing detrimental inflammatory responses in the brain.
2: But how do K V1.3 blockers work?
3: How does blocking a voltage-gated potassium channel in microglia, and presumably also brain infiltrating monocyte derived macrophages reduce inflammatory cytokine production and inflammation mediated tissue damage?

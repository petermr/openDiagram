<p>Cell cycle analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>e) showed changes in the DNA content of cells exposed to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU. Indeed; statistically, significant changes occurred in the transition of the G0/G1 phase (from 50 ± 3.0% to 66.6 ± 2.8%) and G2/M (from 15.7 ± 1.6% to 2.4 ± 1.2%) for 5-Brd-2′-dU and in the S phase for L-Tyr (from 24.4 ± 0.7% to 15.8 ± 3.6%). The cells exposed to L-Tyr significantly increased in the G0/G1 phase (55.5 ± 3.8%,

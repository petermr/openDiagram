0: The total RNA transcripts of each time point tissues were obtained based on next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis involving Illumina HiSeq 2000 35.
1: All the transcripts obtained commonly from all the tissues were further assembled for De novo transcriptome analysis and functional annotation against non-redundant reptilian database using blastx 35.
2: Both the known and unknown gene sequences obtained from the NGS analysis were tabulated and submitted to NCBI and obtained accession number.
3: Also, the genes were translated for obtaining protein database.

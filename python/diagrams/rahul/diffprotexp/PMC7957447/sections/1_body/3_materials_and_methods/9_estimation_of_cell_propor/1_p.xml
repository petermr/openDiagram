<p id="Par36">Cell heterogeneity and abundance were estimated from bulk mRNA profiles using CIBERSORTx and xCell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Cell types identified in more than half of samples were retained. Then, cell types that were significantly different in different status were retained.

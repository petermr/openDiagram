 <caption> Temperature dependence of cell power performance. ( A and B) DCRs of discharge and charge, respectively, at 50% SOC for SEB cells versus the baseline LIB cell. ( C) Relative discharge power (DCR baseline@RT/DCR) of a SEB cell versus the baseline LIB cell. ( D) Relative reactivity ( R ct,baseline@RT/ R ct) of a SEB cell versus the baseline LIB cell, showing that SEB cells operated at appropriate elevated temperatures, e.g., SEB-3 at 50°C, can deliver sufficient power at all ambient temperatures (labeled as line a), that SEB cells are 5× safer and less aging at room temperature (labeled as line b), and that SEB cells are 2.6× less prone to thermal runaway at 60°C (labeled as line c). </caption>

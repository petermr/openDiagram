<p>Among the divergently regulated proteins by I.T. and I.P. LPS (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03401-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), Cxcl15 (also known as lungkine) is of particular interest. Cxcl15 was up-regulated by I.T. LPS but down-regulated by I.P. LPS, further supporting the suppression of lung innate immunity by LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Cxcl15/lungkine was first identified in lung bronchoepithelial cells and was shown to be a neutrophil chemoattractant up-regulated in various lung inflammation models [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The differential regulation of Cxcl15 by LPS-induced direct and indirect lung injury is intriguing. We thus performed Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to validate this proteomic finding. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, Cxcl15 protein expression in lung tissue extracts was reduced by I.P. LPS challenge but enhanced following I.T. LPS administration, consistent with the proteomic data. Immunohistochemistry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) showed that Cxcl15 was constitutively expressed by both bronchial and type II alveolar epithelial cells in the control mice, and the expression of Cxcl15 was suppressed by I.P. LPS treatment but greatly enhanced by I.T. LPS. The negative controls used were sections incubated in the absence of primary antibody (monoclonal rabbit anti-mouse Cxcl15) or incubated with non-immune rabbit IgG, and both controls gave negative staining.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Because we believe this reviewer concern is a serious one, we have expanded our Caveats and limitations section to include a discussion of this concern and our rationale for including all duplicate genes in our analyses. In this expanded Caveats and limitations section we include a discussion of the evolutionary fates of duplicate genes, including a discussion of genes that encode functional transcripts and proteins but appear to be non-functional based on sequence characteristics. We also discuss the limitations of our approach.</p>

0: Heart tissue was embedded in paraffin.
1: Samples were then sectioned into 5-m-thick slices and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
2: Each heart was cut into an average of three slices, and each slice was used to observe three visual fields.
3: Two independent observers blind to the experimental conditions assigned pathological scores based on the following semi-quantitative scale: 0 = no lesion; 1 = lesion involving<25% of the myocardium; 2 = lesions involving 25% to 50%; 3 = lesions involving 50% to 75%; and 4 = lesions involving 75% to 100%, as previously described [ 22].
4: The scores for every section were averaged.

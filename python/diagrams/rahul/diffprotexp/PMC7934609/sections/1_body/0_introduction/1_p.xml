<p>Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a severe parasitic zoonosis caused by infection with the larval stage of 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato</italic> [
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], resulting in the development of CE cysts in domestic animals and humans [
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The life cycle of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> is complex and involves two hosts: definitive and intermediate. Infection with 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> occurs after oral ingestion of infective eggs (an oncosphere containing invasive hexacanths [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). The parasite then hatches in the small intestine of the intermediate host, penetrates the mucosal tissue, enters the blood circulation system, and then migrates to various organs (e.g. liver, lungs, etc.), where it develop cysts filled with fluid and protoscoleces. However, in definitive hosts like dogs, adult parasites develop from the protoscolex in the intestine [
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Oncosphere, adult and protoscolex are, therefore, the three consecutive stages in the life history of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>.

<p>Then, we analyzed the number of m6A methylation modifications in different gene structures. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3C</xref> the differentially expressed genes were mainly distributed in 3ʹ-UTR (31%), with similar percentages in CDS (18%), promoter (18%), 5ʹ-UTR (17%) and terminator (16%). In addition, we also analyzed the distribution of genes with differential m6A methylation genes in chromosomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3D</xref>). We found that most chromosomes had more than one differentially methylated gene, including 27 on chromosome 1, 17 genes were on chromosome 5 and 16 genes were on chromosomes 6 and 8. Based on interactions with combined scores ≥ 0.4,
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the PPI network analysis constructed interaction networks for genes with differential m6A modification, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3E</xref>.

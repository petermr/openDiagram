<p>We next explored the connections between lncRNAs and immune-related biological processes in prostate cancer. Totally, 38 immune-related processes were found to be significantly enriched by multiple lncRNAs in PRAD samples, such as “Regulation of immune response,” “Regulation of immune system process,” and “Immune system development” (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). The most parts of differential lncRNAs potentially regulate immune response and immune system. In addition, differential lncRNAs were also found to be connected with cellular immunity, such as “Regulation of lymphocyte mediated immunity,” “leukocyte mediated immunity,” and “lymphocyte mediated immunity.” Prostate cancer samples with low level of CTD-2521M24.9 showed significantly lower activity level of immune response (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). For example, AC006273.5 was found to regulate “Immune response” by modulating CD40 and TMEM173, whereas A1BG-AS1 could potentially regulate “Immune response” through CD40, ELF4, NLRP1, MR1, and TMEM173. Furthermore, some lncRNAs exclusively regulate individual immune processes though the same genes. For example, LINC00654 were found to regulate “Immunological synapse formation” through DLG1, CORO1A, DOCK2, PRF1, and EPHB1. In summary, these observations demonstrated that lncRNAs were frequently connected with immune-related biological processes in prostate cancer.

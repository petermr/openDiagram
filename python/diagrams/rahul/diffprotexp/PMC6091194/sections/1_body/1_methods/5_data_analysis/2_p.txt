0: GO information of significantly different proteins was obtained using UniProt [ 30].
1: The program provides annotations to proteins in the UniProt Knowledgebase that are controlled vocabulary terms used to describe molecular function, biological process and location of action of a protein in a cell [ 31].
2: Furthermore, to observe networks of differentially expressed proteins, their biological processes, and associated diseases, we used the IPA tool (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA,  www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).
3: A right-tailed Fishers exact test was used to compare the number of proteins that participate in a given function or pathway relative to the total number of occurrences of these proteins in all biological functions and pathway annotations stored in the IPA knowledge base.
4: The IPA tool also generates a score for each network.
5: The score is derived from a  p-value and scores of 2 or higher have at least a 99% confidence of not being generated by random chance alone.
6: IPA identifies the most significant diseases and biological functions of the differentially expressed proteins and the top five are categorized and reported based on their  p-values.

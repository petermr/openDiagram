  <title>Gene ontology (GO) enrichment results.</title>
  <p>Regulatory processes, components, and functions identified through GOrilla as enriched at 5% FDR. Table includes the species-specific PAS genes (species-specific PAS), genes differentially translated with at least one differentially used PAS (TranslationandAPA), and the genes differentially expressed in protein but not mRNA that also have at least one differentially used PAS (APA and protein, no expression difference). GO term, description, p-value, and FDR q-value from GOrilla.</p>

<p>The dog-bone specimens were cut from the middle of as-annealed steels along the longitudinal direction using an electron discharge machine and mechanically polished using silica paper to the gage dimensions of 6 × 3 × 1.5 mm
 <sup>3</sup>. The uniaxial tensile test was performed to determine the mechanical properties of the samples under each processing condition at room temperature. The tests were carried out using an AG-X plus electronic universal testing machine at a strain rate of 3 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Microhardness measurements were performed on a 401MVD hardness testing machine (Wolpert measuring instruments Ltd.) with a load of 300 g and a loading time of 20 s. The hardness value was averaged from 12 duplicated tests for each specimen.

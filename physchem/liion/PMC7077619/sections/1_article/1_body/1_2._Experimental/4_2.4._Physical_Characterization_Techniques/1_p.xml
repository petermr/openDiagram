<p>X-ray diffraction analysis for pure PVdF, SiO<sub>2</sub> and prepared samples carried out by using PANalytical X&#8217;pertpro diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical, Leyweg, EA Almelo, The Netherlands) with Cu K&#945; (1.54 &#197;) radiation in the range 2&#952; = 10&#176;&#8211;70&#176;. A Thermo Scientific Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer was used for analyzing the functional groups in the prepared membrane in the wavenumber range 400 to 4000 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The surface morphology of the porous membrane examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (EVO18 (CARL ZEISS) Jena, Germany). The pore size and thickness of separator membrane estimated using ImageJ software (Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, LOCI, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA). The mechanical stability of membrane was determined using Methact Generic Tensile stress vs. strain measurement system (National Test House (SR), Chennai, India).</p>

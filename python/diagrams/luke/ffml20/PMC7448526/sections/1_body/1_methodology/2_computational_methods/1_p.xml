<p>Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) embedded calculations were employed to model zeolite H-ZSM-5. The ChemShell software
 <xref rid="cit37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> was used to optimise zeolite geometries and determine vibrational frequencies of adsorbed species. For H-ZSM-5 models, the tetrahedral T12 site of the siliceous MFI was substituted with, Al which is located at the intersection of the sinusoidal channel. To form the Br√∏nsted acidic site, a charge-compensating proton is bonded to the framework oxygen atom adjacent to T12 site
 <xref rid="cit38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and oriented towards the center of the super cage; this configuration presents the highest deprotonation energy 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> most stable.

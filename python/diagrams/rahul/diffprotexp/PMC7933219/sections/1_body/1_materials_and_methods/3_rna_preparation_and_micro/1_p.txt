0: For Affymetrix microarray profiling, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Canada) and purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), including a DNase digestion treatment.
1: RNA concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm, and the quality control standards were A260/A280 = 1.82.1, using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo, America).
2: The cDNA of PC-3M-adhered HUVECs (TC-EC) or from HUVEC controls (EC) was hybridized to Human Gene 2.0 ST GeneChip  arrays (Affymetrix, America) according to the user manuals.
3: Affymetrix  Expression Console software (version 1.2.1) was used for the microarray analysis.

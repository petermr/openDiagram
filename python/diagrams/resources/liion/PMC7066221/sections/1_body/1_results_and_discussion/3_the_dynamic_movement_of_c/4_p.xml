<p id="p0165">It is worth mentioning that apart from the facilitating effect from cobalt components, the overall capacity recovery rate of the Mn-based cathode is also limited by many other factors, e.g., (1) limited conductive cathode surface, (2) decreased Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration in the electrolyte after many discharging-charging cycles, (3) the ionic conductivity and pH of the electrolyte, and (4) deterioration of the Zn anode (

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Selvakumaran et al., 2019</xref>). From the consideration of the first factor, the increment of the capacity for a battery with the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode (as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G) gradually slowed down during the 50–100 cycles. In addition, a comparison of the morphologies of cathode surface before cycling and after 100
 <sup>th</sup> charge provides clear evidence that most of the conductive surface (e.g., current collector and conductive carbon) was heavily covered with dense, newly deposited active Mn compound (

0: In this manuscript, we use single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) RNA sequencing to explore regulated alternative mRNA processing in a human small-airway epithelial cell (hSAEC) model in response to RSV replication.
1: SMRT sequencing data were subjected to a pre-processing informatics pipeline, yielding high-confidence long-read transcripts that characterize the composition of the full-length transcriptome.
2: Differentially expressed isoforms were identified using an expression matrix from short-read RNA sequencing data, resulting in the identification of 905 genes undergoing APA and 355 genes expressing differential isoform utilization (DIU).
3: DIU isoforms represent a switch in the major mRNA isoform encoded by a gene.
4: We found that DIU genes are enriched in cell cycle control and IIR pathways.
5: We focused on validating master transcriptional regulators of the IIR, RelA, and the inducible IRF isoform, IRF7, critical in the control of the type I and III IFN response.
6: Differential processing was confirmed in primary cultures of human small-airway cells.
7: We concluded that the IIR is regulated extensively by AS.

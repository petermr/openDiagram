<p id="Par38">Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 h at room temperature (RT) or at 4 °C overnight, washed 3 × 10 min in PBS. Embryos were transferred into 30% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4 °C prior to 3 × 10 min washes in OCT before final embedding of OCT in dry ice. Cryosectioning was performed at 15 μm thickness. Sections were washed in 3 × 15 min PBS and 1 × 15 min in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 prior to blocking in 5% goat serum and 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. Incubation with primary antibody for rabbit anti-GFP (1:200, Torrey Pines Biolabs Cat no. TP401) at 4 °C overnight, followed by 3 × 10 min washes in PBS and incubation with secondary antibody AlexaFluor-568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Thermo Fisher Cat no. A21206) for 1 h at RT. Sections were washed 3 × 10 min in PBS and 1x wash with PBS and DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.1 mg/ml in PBS.</p>

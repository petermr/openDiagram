 <sub>3</sub>COOH biphasic system relies on the formation of neutral or anionic chlorometallate complexes and their subsequent extraction to the IL-rich phase via an ion-pairing or anion-exchange mechanism. Metal cations known not to form the required anionic complexes with chloride ligands such as Ni(II) and the lanthanides La(III) and Ce(III) are not extracted, resulting in a high Co(II) selectivity relative to these metals,

Conversely, the system presents moderate to no selectivity for Co(II) against the metals Zn(II), Cu(II) and Mn(II) as these form anionic complexes at lower (Zn(II) and Cu(II)) or similar (Mn(II)) chloride concentrations as Co(II) [

 <sub>3</sub>COOH presents an interesting selectivity towards Co(II) with S
 <sub>Co/Fe</sub> = 27.1 most likely due to the competing complexation of acetic acid with chloride ligands. The [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system can selectively recover Co(II) from Ni(II), Fe(III) and the lanthanides from a complex waste matrix. Co(II) was enriched from 15.5 wt.% of the total metal content in the initial leachate to 54.7% in the IL-rich phase after phase separation through water addition. Zn(II) was the major impurity in the IL-rich phase, accounting for 23.6% of the extracted metal content.

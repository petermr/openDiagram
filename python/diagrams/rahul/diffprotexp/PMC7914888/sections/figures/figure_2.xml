  <p>B16F1 cells exposed for 72 h to 5-Brd-2′-dU reveal changes in markers associated with senescence. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Representative photographs of B16F1 cells after the chromogenic assay for senescence-associated β-Galactosidase activity (S.A. β-Gal). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Quantification by spectrophotometry of the S.A. β-Gal activity at pH 6.0. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Representative photographs of immunofluorescence (IF) in B16F1 cells labeled against histone H3K9me3 (green) and nucleus staining with DAPI (blue). (
   <bold>d</bold>) Measurement of the apparent cell area in µm2 from bright-field photographs of 100 B16F1 cells (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). (
   <bold>e</bold>) Diagram of cell complexity (SSC-A) and size (FSC-A) acquired by flow cytometry and its distribution by quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4). The significance level (*) using two-tailed multiple 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests, and the differences were considered statistically significant for a 
   <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 using the Holm–Sidak method. Significant (*) with 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, significant (***) with 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.

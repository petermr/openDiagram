0: A correlation analysis was also performed between miRNAs and mRNAs.
1: If the correlation between any two pair is > 0.9 between candidate miRNAs and the putative targets, the gene was considered as the correct target of the miRNA.
2: These links between novel miRNAs and mRNAs were further illustrated by the functional networks of the miRNA-mRNA pairs.
3: Functional enrichment analyses were performed using the Gene Ontology (GO) 76 and KEGG 24 databases.
4: In the GO analysis, genes and gene products covered by three domains are described in a controlled vocabulary: molecular function, cell component and biological process.
5: In this study, GO categories were applied to understand the potential roles of DEGs and miRNA target genes 76.
6: In the KEGG database, significant pathways were identified for the predicted target genes at the adjusted p   0.05 set as the significant threshold.

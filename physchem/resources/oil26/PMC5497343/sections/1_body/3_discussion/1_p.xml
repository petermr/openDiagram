<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par29">The colour and fragrance of the extracted essential oil of <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower obtained in this study were similar to previous report of Wanzala &amp; Ogoma, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Previous study done by Chamorro et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] on the EO from <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> flower showed that &#946;-Ocimene was reported having the highest chemical content of the EO of <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower and this agrees with our result. However, study done by Shirazi et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and Garcia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], reported the predominance of dihydrotagetone in the essential oil of <italic>T. minuta</italic> which was not found in the GC-MS result of the EO of <italic>T. minuta</italic> in our study. Several studies have shown that the chemical composition of the extracted essential oil of <italic>T. minuta</italic> varied according to the location where it was harvested, the growth stage at which it was harvested and the part of the plant used for the extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The chemical composition from the GC-MS analysis of the EO of <italic>T. minuta</italic> plant grown in Kenya do not reveal some of the compounds present in our result as reported by Kyarimpa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], as well as those grown in Argentina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>

<p>A total of 796 patients with primary HCC who underwent surgery between January 2000 and December 2010 at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC, Guangzhou, China) were included in this study. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples from these patients were re-embedded in new paraffin blocks for tissue microarrays (TMAs). Normal tissues were obtained from no less than 1 cm adjacent to tumor margin. This study was approved by the Institute Research Medical Ethics Committee of SYSUCC. All patients provided written informed consent for the use their tissues and data for research purposes. Pathological specimens and data were collected, and all samples were rendered anonymous. The overall survival (OS) follow-up period was defined as the interval from the date of surgery to the date of death or last follow-up. None of the patients received radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to surgery.</p>

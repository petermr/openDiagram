<p id="Par23">To explore the potential involvement of circRNAs in MEL-induced BMSC osteogenic differentiation, we identified the differentially expressed circRNAs in human BMSCs following MEL treatment or not using a deep RNA sequencing method. A total of 7272 and 5057 circRNAs were detected in the control (BMSC osteogenic differentiation) and MEL treatment groups (BMSC osteogenic differentiation with MEL treatment), respectively. We found that the lengths of most circRNAs identified in human BMSCs were less than 2000 bp, and the majority of circRNAs possessed a length of less than 800 bp (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Among them, 92.2% and 91.5% of the circRNAs were encoded by exon regions in the control and MEL treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Furthermore, we found that these circRNAs were distributed to almost every human chromosome, with the largest numbers of upregulated circRNAs encoded by chromosomes 1 and 2, whereas the largest numbers of downregulated circRNAs were encoded by chromosomes 2 and 8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). More importantly, we observed that the expression of 209 circRNAs was significantly altered by MEL treatment in human BMSCs, including 173 upregulated and 36 downregulated circRNAs (fold change &gt; 1.5; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, e). The significantly differentially expressed circRNAs between the control and MEL treatment groups are clearly visualized by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d) and a volcano plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). Furthermore, we validated the differential expression of nine circRNAs, which may be involved in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in MEL-treated human BMSCs by qRT-PCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). A total of seven circRNAs exhibited significant decreased expression in BMSCs following MEL treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). Circ_0003865 exhibited the greatest decrease in expression by MEL consistent with the sequencing results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). This was further investigated in subsequent experiments.

0: To improve the meaningfulness of the structure analysis, it is helpful to investigate samples using systematically varied heat treatments.
1: Two major heat treatment routes were therefore examined (see  Figure 14).
2: Firstly, the development of quench-induced precipitation during linear cooling with varying rates down to room temperature is analysed.
3: The formation of quench-induced precipitates at a certain cooling rate is also analysed via cooling to a specific temperature followed by rapid overcritical quenching, which allows us to match certain quench-induced phases to specific peaks found in the DSC curves.

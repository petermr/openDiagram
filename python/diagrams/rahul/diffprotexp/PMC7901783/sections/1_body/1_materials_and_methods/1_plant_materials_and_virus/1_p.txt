0: Seed from three  Chenopodium quinoa varieties ( Table 1 and  S1 Fig), Jessie (sweet), QQ74 (semi-sweet), and Red Head (bitter)] [ 40,  41] were surface-sterilized in 1% hypochlorite solution (v/v) for 3 minutes followed by three rinses with sterile deionized water.
1: Seed were sown in greenhouse growing media (Promix) and grown in growth chambers under controlled conditions [60% humidity; 16/8 hours (light/dark); 23C].
2: Freeze-dried CMV (strain Kaper S) infected tobacco tissues were obtained from ATCC (PV-242).
3: Nicotiana tabacum cv T.R.Madole was used as the propagation host.
4: Leaves of seven-week-old quinoa plants were mechanically inoculated with CMV-infected tobacco leaves or mock-inoculated with phosphate buffer (pH:7.0).
5: Inoculated leaves were harvested at 1 or4 days post infection (dpi).
6: The experiment was designed as a 3223 factorial [three varieties; two treatments (virus or mock); two sample times (1 or 4 dpi); three biological replicates].
7: Samples times were chosen because in preliminary studies, no symptoms were observed at 24 h and symptom development typically began by Day 4 (data not shown).
8: Excised leaf samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80C until RNA extraction.
9: To verify successful inoculation, virus- and mock-inoculated tissues were tested by CMV AgriStrips (Bioreba, Reinach, Switzerland) according to manufacturers instruction.

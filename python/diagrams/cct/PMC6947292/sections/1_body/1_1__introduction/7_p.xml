<p>With respect to the technological applications, there is another important aspect related to quenching. Rapid quenching can cause severe thermal stresses which may lead to severe distortion [

 <xref rid="B43-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This can create important additional costs due to the extra work required for stress-relief or straightening operations. In several cases, the quenching process is therefore confronted with two opposite requirements: cooling as rapidly as needed (to achieve maximum strength), and cooling as slowly as possible (to avoid residual stresses and distortion). Faster quenching may not be detrimental in all cases, since for example some extruded and rolled products are subsequently stretched anyway. Thus, in terms of detrimentally fast quenching, there is a difference between wrought products with simple shapes and cast and other net-shaped products. The alignment of these opposing demands on quenching is therefore a more important issue in the latter type. However, the alloy-specific UCCR typically represents the optimum cooling rate. The maximum achievable quench rates in the heat treatment shop for different types of products (e.g., thick vs. thin gauge) may therefore determine the alloy of choice and thus the strength level achievable.

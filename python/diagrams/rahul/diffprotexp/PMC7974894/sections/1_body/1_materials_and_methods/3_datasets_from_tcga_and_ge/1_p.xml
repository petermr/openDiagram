<p>Gene expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of tongue cancer were freely downloaded from TCGA (

To perform an unbiased analysis, all the tongue cancer patients (147 tumor tissues and 15 normal tissues) which could be searched from TCGA database with the information of gene expression, and clinical data were included. A total of 56753 genes (Ensemble ID) were transferred to gene symbols. The data had been generated by using the Illumina HiSeq 2,000 platform, and were annotated to a reference transcript set of human hg38 gene standard track. In addition, normalized expression profiles of GSE41613, another gene expression file from 97 tongue cancer patients were obtained from the GEO database. GSE41613 contains completed clinical information for the prognosis-related dysregulated gene analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S7</xref>). GSE41613 was chosen as a validation cohort because GSE41613 provided an independent group of patients compared with TCGA. GSE41613 consisted of 97 tumor samples, which were studies with the GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform. Probes were converted to the gene symbols based on a manufacturer-provided annotation file and duplicated probes for the same gene were removed by determining the median expression value of all its corresponding probes.

0: Oil-seed rape ( Brassica napus L.) is the fourth-largest oil-producing crop worldwide.
1: The cytoplasmic male sterility of  Brassica napus has also been extensively studied as a rich source of cytoplasmic male sterility promoting hybrid seed production for the desirable traits.
2: Previous studies found that there are at least nine types of CMS in rapeseed: ogu CMS [ 17], nap CMS [ 18], Tour CMS [ 19],  pol CMS [ 20],  shan2A CMS [ 21],  oxa CMS [ 22],  Nca CMS [ 23],  Moricandia arvensis CMS [ 20],  Nsa CMS [ 24],  hau CMS [ 25],  inap CMS [ 25].
3: CMS is classified into sporophytic and gametophytic sterility according to the period of anther abortion.
4: In rapeseed, the currently reported type of sterile cytoplasm is sporophytic sterility.
5: According to the cytoplasm source, CMS is branched into two types: homogeneous cytoplasm and heterogeneous cytoplasmic sterility [ 26].

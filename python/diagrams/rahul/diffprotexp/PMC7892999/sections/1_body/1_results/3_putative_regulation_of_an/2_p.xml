<p id="Par12">According to these criteria, we found 19 differentially expressed lncNATs, since the lncRNAs were located in the antisense orientation (in the opposite strand) to a target mRNA, being most of them fully overlapping pairs (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). About 79% of those lncNATs were expressed in concordance with the sense strand transcript, while five out of the 19 presented discordant expression (i.e. when the lncNAT expression increase, the sense strand transcript was repressed) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Interestingly, we detected two lncNATs (MSTRG.27767/
 <italic>asDcMyb6</italic> and MSTRG.9120/
 <italic>asDcMyb7</italic>) in antisense relationship to the critical regulators 
 <italic>DcMYB6</italic> and 
 <italic>DcMYB7</italic>, respectively, with concordant expression correlation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). 
 <italic>DcMYB6</italic> showed a log
 <sub>2</sub> fold-change of 7.6 with an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> value of 4.5 × 10
 <sup>–30</sup>, while 
 <italic>DcMYB7</italic> presented a log
 <sub>2</sub> fold-change of 11.7 with an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> value of 3.8 × 10
 <sup>–37</sup>. Accordingly, the two detected antisense lncRNAs also presented significant differential expression, where 
 <italic>asDcMYB6</italic> displayed a log
 <sub>2</sub> fold-change of 6.5 with an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> value of 2.1 × 10
 <sup>–13</sup> and 
 <italic>asDcMYB7</italic> presented a log
 <sub>2</sub> fold-change of 6.1 with an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> value of 1.3 × 10
 <sup>–04</sup> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Finally, the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the expression levels of each sense/antisense pair were ≥ 0.79 and 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.01 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). On the other hand, as also detailed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>, two out of the four lncNATs showing discordant expression were found in the antisense relationship with disease resistance related genes (a predicted Catalase, and probable disease resistance protein At5g63020).

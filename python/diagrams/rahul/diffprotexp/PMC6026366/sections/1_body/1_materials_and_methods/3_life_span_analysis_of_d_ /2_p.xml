 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Oregon K) was a gift from Jilin Agricultural University and was used throughout the experiment. Single populations (200 flies each) of males were housed in a biochemical incubator with 12-h dark/light cycle at 25°C, 60% humidity, and with free access to basal food (water, 1.2% agar, 2.2% sucrose, 1.8% yeast extra powder, 8% corn extract, and 6.25 μL/L propionic acid). For RGE treatment, basal food was supplemented with RGE at a final w/v concentration of 1 mg/mL optimized by our previous study (unpublished). The food was changed every 2–3 d.

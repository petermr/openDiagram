<p>The identified candidate proteins that may be related to DM are confirmed differential protein expression with Western blotting. Each peritoneal dialysate sample, containing 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of protein, was applied into a precast gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4</xref> shows the representation of the Western blotting analysis results of APOA1, APOA4, EIF4G1, and AZGP1 in the peritoneal dialysate samples. Compared with Western blotting of the 
 <italic>β</italic>-actin standard, the concentrations of candidate proteins in peritoneal dialysate samples were detected and analyzed by using the quantitative analysis software ImageQuant-TL-7.0. The 
 <italic>P</italic> values between CGN and DM were less than 0.05 (

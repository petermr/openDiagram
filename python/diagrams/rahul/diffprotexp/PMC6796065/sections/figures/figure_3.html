 <caption> The correlation of the expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN of control group and patients with schizophrenia. The expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN in PFC ( a) and NAc ( c) of control group (closed circles) and patients with schizophrenia (open circles) are shown by scatter plots. The ratio of DARPP-32 and CaN expression of each sample were compared between diagnostic groups in PFC ( b) and NAc ( d). The p values between controls and schizophrenia were calculated using Welchâ€™s t-test. Error bars indicate SEM. </caption>

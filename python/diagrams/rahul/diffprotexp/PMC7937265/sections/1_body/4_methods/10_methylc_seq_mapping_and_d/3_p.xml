<p id="Par58">We next looked for DMRs within 2 Kb of a gene body using the methylpy DMRfind function, as these were the DMRs we could confidently associate with genes. We filtered DMRs of low confidence (&lt; 3 cytosines) and low coverage (missing data in ≥1 sample). We used a conservative significance cut-off of FDR ≤ 0.01 with minimally 20% methylation difference between the treatment groups for mCG and 1.3% for mCH. These treatment difference cut-offs are 1 SD from the mean for overall mCG and mCH. DEGs containing DMRs were identified and a GO enrichment analysis was performed on these genes.</p>

<p>The proteins discussed below are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-14-04912">Table 1</xref>. From a Venn diagram representation, we can see how many spots are common when comparing the treatments in the same species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-14-04912">Figure 4a</xref>) and also how many spots are common when comparing both species in the same treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-14-04912">Figure 4b</xref>). This made a final total of 47 identified spots for 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> sucrose (14 up and 33 down), 31 for Désirée sucrose (one up and 30 down), 43 for 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> sorbitol (13 up and 30 down), 45 for Désirée sorbitol (14 up and 31 down), 29 for 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> cold (four up and 25 down) and 37 for Désirée cold (10 up and 27 down) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-14-04912">Figure 5</xref>).

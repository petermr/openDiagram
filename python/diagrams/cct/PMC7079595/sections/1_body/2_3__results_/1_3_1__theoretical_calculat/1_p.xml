<p>As already mentioned, in the first approach, a set of theoretical calculations allowed the determination of the optimal parameters for the pursued treatments in this work, and for that means, JMatPro software was used. Thus, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f002">Figure 2</xref>a presents the phase evolution diagram of the analyzed steel in equilibrium conditions. According to this diagram, the γ phase is present from 900 °C up to ca. 1430 °C. Below 900 °C, the formation of ferrite takes place. This transformation occurs up to 520 °C. According to this, the A
 <sub>c1</sub> temperature is equal to 520 °C and the A
 <sub>c3</sub> ~900 °C (this is the intercritical region). Moreover, it can be seen that according to the equilibrium calculations, below 700 °C, the formation of some carbides can take place. These carbides may decrease the stability of austenite. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows that M
 <sub>7</sub>C
 <sub>3</sub> can precipitate below 660 °C. At 450 °C, the carbides start to dissolve whereas M
 <sub>23</sub>C
 <sub>6</sub> carbides can be formed. A very small fraction of M
 <sub>6</sub>C is also possible at the lowest temperature range. The theoretical calculations show that the austenitization temperature of 1100 °C, which is similar to industrial processing, is enough for this steel. Yet, this represents the phase evolution during cooling in equilibrium conditions.

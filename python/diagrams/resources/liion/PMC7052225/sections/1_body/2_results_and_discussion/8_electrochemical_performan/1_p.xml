<p id="Par45">An all-organic prototype PTCDA/graphite battery without transition metal is prepared and electrochemically tested. It is among the first self-standing batteries that is composed of organic redox molecules and biodegradable components reported in literature. The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the concept of a battery that is both inexpensive and biodegradable. First, a prelithiation step is necessary, however, because the PTCDA molecule is in its oxidized form. To this end, the PTCDA self-standing film is assembled with a lithium counter electrode in a coin cell. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17a</xref> shows the initial discharges of up to 1.5 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> of three PTCDA/Li batteries made of 50 and 60 mg of organic cathode material. To achieve the complete lithiation of PTCDA, the potential is maintained at 1.5 V for 3 h (chronoamperometry experiment in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17b</xref>). The coin cell is disassembled, thereafter, and the prelithiated PTCDA cathode is recovered to be assembled with a graphite anode.

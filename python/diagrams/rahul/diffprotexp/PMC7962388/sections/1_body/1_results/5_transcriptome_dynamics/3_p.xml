<p id="Par64">Interestingly, the analysis of the common DETs (transcripts that were differentially expressed at all developmental stages) revealed a striking contrast between sample types (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Clusters 1, 3 and 4, showed up-regulation in apomictic samples across the four developmental stages, while the same transcripts were consistently repressed in sexual ones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). The opposite occurred in Clusters 2, 5 and 6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). In the case of common DEATs, Cluster 1 showed high expression increasing in the course of development in apomictic samples, but low modulated expression in sexual ones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). The opposite occurred in Cluster 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d).

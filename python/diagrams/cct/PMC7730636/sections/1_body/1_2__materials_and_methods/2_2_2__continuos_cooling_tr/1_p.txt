0: The process in which homogeneous austenite decays into other structures during continuous cooling is called anisothermal decay of austenite.
1: The resulting CCT diagrams express a graphical representation of this process.
2: The cooling rate, which affects the formation of the final structure, has an analogous effect on the resulting decomposition of austenite [ 19, 20].

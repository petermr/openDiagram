<p id="p0045">To initially characterize molecular data presented here we analyzed expression levels of several mRNA molecules previously reported to be differentially regulated in thyroid tumors. For example, 
 <italic>SERPINA1</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], 
 <italic>LAMB3</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and 
 <italic>TACSTD2</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] genes are known to be overexpressed in PC, which was also the case in our dataset (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary file 3). On the other hand, in line with the overall mediocre concordance between FC expression biomarkers reported in the previous studies, we did not observe any differences between FA and FC samples for two out of four marker genes proposed in a recent meta-analysis paper [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]: 
 <italic>CPQ</italic> and 
 <italic>TFF3</italic>. However, the other two other marker genes 
 <italic>ACVRL1</italic> and 
 <italic>PLVAP</italic> demonstrated upregulated trends in FA versus other tumors (

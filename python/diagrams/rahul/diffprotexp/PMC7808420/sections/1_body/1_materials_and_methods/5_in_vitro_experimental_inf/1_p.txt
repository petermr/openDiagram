0: Primary mixed glia cultures were obtained by collecting the brains of newborn mice (12 days old).
1: Brains were minced and digested in 0.1% w/v trypsin (Gibco) for 15 minutes under agitation.
2: Brain homogenates were washed in DMEM twice and plated in cell culture flasks containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
3: Mixed glial cell cultures were harvested after 914 days.
4: Briefly, cell cultures were infected with SLEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h, washed in DMEM and incubated at 37C 5% CO2 until sample collection (24120 h post-infection).
5: Collected samples included cell culture supernatants for measurement of cytokine levels and viral load.

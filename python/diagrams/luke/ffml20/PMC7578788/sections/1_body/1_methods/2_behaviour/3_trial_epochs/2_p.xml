<p id="Par16">For the cat behaviour, ‘Hits’ made prior to the prism perturbation were taken as equivalent to the baseline condition in the human experiments. The ‘Miss’ category is taken as equivalent to the Early Adaptation period when errors are largest in magnitude and the rate of adaptation is greatest, while ‘Hits’ made during prism perturbation (when adaptation had occurred) were taken as equivalent to the human Late Adaptation trials. Analysis of aftereffect trials was not possible in the animal experiments because of the limited number of available trials.</p>

0: Total RNA was extracted from queen and worker larvae at 72 and 120 hours using TRIzol regent (Takara bio).
1: Reverse transcription was performed using a RNA PCR Kit (Takara bio), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2: Nine differentially expressed proteins were examined to detect the corresponding mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR, based on the sequences in honeybee cDNA library.
3: Gene names, accession number, forward and reverse primer sequence and amplification size were listed and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as the reference gene ( Table S1).
4: Real-time PCR amplification was conducted on iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
5: Every sample was analyzed individually and processed in triplicate.
6: Each reaction volume was performed in a total of 25 l containing 1 l of cDNA template and 5 pmol of primer, 12.5 l SYBR Green Supermix (dNTPs, iTaq DNA polymerase, 6 mM MgCl 2 , SYBR Green and 6.5 l double distilled water, fluorescent and stabilizers, RNase-free water) (Bio-Rad).
7: The real-time PCR was performed as 1 cycle of denaturation at 95C/10 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95C/30s, 60C/30s, 72C/45s) where the fluorescence was automatically measured during PCR.
8: The specificity of the amplified product was monitored using its melting curve.
9: Gene expression data was normalized by GAPDH.
10: After verifying amplification efficiency of the selected genes and GAPDH in approximately equal level, the difference in gene expression levels were calculated using the   method (22).

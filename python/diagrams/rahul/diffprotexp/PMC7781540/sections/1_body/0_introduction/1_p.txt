0: The voltage-gated potassium channel K V1.3 was originally described in T cells [ 1] and subsequently pursued as a target for treating T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis [ 24].
1: More recently K V1.3 has emerged as an attractive pharmacological target for reducing so-called neuroinflammation by modulating microglia activation.
2: In both mouse and rat models of ischemic stroke K V1.3 blockers have been shown by us and others to reduce infarct area and improve neurological deficit [ 5, 6].
3: In transgenic mouse models of Alzheimers disease K V1.3 blockade decreased cerebral amyloid load, enhanced hippocampal neuronal plasticity, and improved behavioral deficits [ 7].
4: Similarly, in multiple animal models of Parkinsons disease administration of the small molecule K V1.3 blocker PAP-1 inhibited degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and improved behavioral outcomes [ 8].
5: K V1.3 inhibition or genetic deletion has further been shown to ameliorate white matter pathology after traumatic brain injury [ 9], postoperative cognitive decline [ 10], and radiation induced brain injury [ 11].
6: In all these animal models of neurological disease increased K V1.3 expression was observed on pathology-associated microglia and treatment with K V1.3 blockers resulted in reduced microglia activation and reduced inflammatory cytokine levels in the brains of the animals.

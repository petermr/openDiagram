<p>The proteins of HBMEC infected by EV71 extracts were prepared and explored the 2-DE analysis. Analysis of 2D images from protein lysates of EV71-infected and mock- infected HBMEC identified 1435 matching protein spots. There were 43 spots showing changes of at least 2.5 fold up- or downregulated expressions in EV71-infected samples at different time when comparing to control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Among the proteins with significant expression changes, 28 proteins could be successfully identified by MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry analysis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) and 15 proteins could not be successfully identified. The reason that 15/43 spots were not identified might be that (1) the proteins might have characteristics of low abundance and (2) the differential protein spots might contain a variety of proteins. Of these 28 differentially expressed protein spots, 4 proteins were significantly upregulated, and 6 proteins were downregulated, and another 18 proteins were different expression at different incubation time. The four upregulated proteins were identified as protein expression at 1 hpi, 16 hpi, and 24 hpi upregulated after EV71 infection, which included splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 2, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core I protein, glutathione synthetase, and actin cytoplasmic 1. The six downregulated proteins were identified as protein expression at 1 hpi, 16 hpi, and 24 hpi downregulated after EV71 infection, which included L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain OS, protein DJ-1, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit isoform b, spermidine synthase, Vimentin, and thymosin beta-10.

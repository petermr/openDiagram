<p>The non-destructive tests carried out did not show welding defects. Based on the non-destructive tests carried out, the welded joints were classified as meeting the quality level B in accordance with ISO 13919-1 [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-13-01312" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, macroscopic metallographic tests did not show the presence of welding defects in the weld and HAZ areas (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-01312-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Microscopic tests revealed the bainitic-ferritic structure in the weld area. The grains in the HAZ area of individual joints did not differ significantly in size, which can be attributed to the similar linear welding energy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-01312-f010">Figure 10</xref>). MAG microscopic tests of joints showed changes in the microstructure of the weld and HAZ areas compared to the base material. Both the weld and HAZ eliminated the effect of plastic deformation in the form of grains elongated in the direction of rolling, obtained during the production of plates. The weld area structure was dendritic and consisted of bainite and ferrite lamellas formed from retained austenite grains. HAZ contained a fine-grained microstructure clearly dominated by ferrite (

<p id="Par13">To compare the relative expression patterns and differentially expressed miRNAs, differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was carried out using DESeq8 tool. The variations in the reads were normalized by the library normalization method opted from DESeq library. Mean normalised read counts of the samples in a given condition were used for DGE calculation and heat map generation. Details on differential expression analysis were made according to Anders and Huber

 </sup>. DESeq was used to calculate size factor where the read counts were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). Normalization was done using following formula:

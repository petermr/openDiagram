<p>Since a CCP diagram involves the kinetic behaviour of precipitation during cooling from solution treatment, the time-temperature profiles of the varied linear (i.e., constant) cooling rates form the basis of the diagram. These are plotted on a temperature-time diagram with logarithmic scaling of the time axis. To allow construction of a CCP diagram for a specific alloy, three distinct aspects of quench-induced precipitation need to be analysed for each specific alloy using different experimental methods, as schematically illustrated in

 <caption> Heat map analysis of proteins expressed in fibroblasts of patients with PD harbouring heterozygous GBA and PARK2 variants as well as in the healthy controls. (A) Heat map of the 122 differentially expressed proteins in the fibroblasts of the two patients with PD with different heterozygous GBA variants compared with the pooled healthy controls. (B) Heat map of the 119 differentially expressed proteins in the fibroblasts of the two patients with PD with different heterozygous PARK2 variants compared with the pooled healthy controls. (C and D) Top 25 differentially expressed proteins in fibroblasts of patients with PD carrying (C) GBA and (D) PARK2 variants. Each sample was run and analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The heat map was constructed using R, and the expression levels of each protein were normalized to the mean expression level of that protein in the healthy control from triplicate runs. Abbreviated protein names correspond to the full protein names shown in Table II. PD, Parkinson's disease; GBA, acid-Î² glucosidase; PARK2, parkin. </caption>

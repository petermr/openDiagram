<p id="Par27">The study explored whether circRAB11FIP1 promoted autophagy dependent on DSC1. LC3-II expression decreased in LV2-1-transfected SKOV3 cells. This phenomenon was reversed after DSC1 ectopic expression. LC3-II expression elevated in A2780 cells infected with LV6. This phenomenon was partially blocked when silencing DSC1 (Figs.

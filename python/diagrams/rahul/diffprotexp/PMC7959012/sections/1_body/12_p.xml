<p>Further analysis of INSIG1, PABPC1, PSMD11, SCD1, and other genes is helpful in further understanding the effect of myopia on the injury of the RPE cells in mice. In the current study, the expressions of INSIG1, SCD1, and PABPC1 were up-regulated in the eyes of the mice in the myopic model group. The RNA sequencing revealed that PABPC1, the substrate of caspase, was up-regulated in the mice in the myopic model group (RNA degradation is one of the markers of apoptosis). Our previous study found that c-Jun, an autophagy inhibitor protein, is the upstream trigger signal of apoptosis and autophagy. Bcl-2 is the homologous domain protein of the apoptosis inhibitor Beclin-1, which can induce autophagy. However, the results of the present study show that these two factors were decreased in the RPE cells of the mice in the myopic model group by Western Blot (WB) and PCR. Bcl-2 and caspase are bidirectional regulators of autophagic apoptosis. Caspase is the main driving force of apoptosis, and activated caspase can degrade autophagy proteins (namely Beclin-1, ATG5, and ATG7) to prevent autophagy. Caspase can also change an autophagy protein into a pro-apoptotic protein, thus triggering the apoptotic death of cells.</p>

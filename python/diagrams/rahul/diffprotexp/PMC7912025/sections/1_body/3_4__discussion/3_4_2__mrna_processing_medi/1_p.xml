<p>This systematic analysis of host mRNA processing in response to virus infection is the first in our knowledge. We note previous work that has shown alternative mRNA processing is implicated in diverse cellular processes, including differentiation [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], so it is not surprising that RSV induces mRNA processing. These earlier studies involving nutrient deprivation found that AS mediates rapid and specific changes in ribosomal subunit splicing and polyadenylation site selection in response to environmental stress responses in yeast [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In these systems, alternative mRNA processing impacts gene expression through noncoding RNA interference and altering miRNA regulation. In addition, AS influences protein translation rates and produces proteoforms with acceptors for post-translational modification and/or distinct degradation properties. Our differential polyadenylation analysis indicates that RSV infection induces substantial differential polyadenylation site utilization of ribosomal subunits and proteins important in the dynamics of mRNA processing, protein secretion, and translation. The full biological effects of alternative polyadenylation utilization will require further experimentation.

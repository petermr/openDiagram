<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The gas chromatography (GC) mass selective (MS) analysis of the essential oils was performed using a Hewlett&#8211;Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph, fitted with a fused silica HP &#8211; 5MS capillary column (30&#160;m&#8201;&#215;&#8201;0.25&#160;mm, in thickness 0.25&#160;&#956;m). The oven temperature varied from 40&#8211;250&#160;&#176;C with the scanning rate of 3&#160;&#176;C/min. Helium (purity 5.6) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1&#160;mL/min. The GC was equipped with Hewlett&#8211;Packard 5972 Series MS detector. The MS operating parameters were ionization voltage 70&#160;eV and ion source temperature 250&#160;&#176;C. The diluted samples of essential oils (1/100, v/v in HPLC methanol) of 1&#160;&#956;L had been injected manually. To avoid overloading the GC column, the essential oils were diluted 1:100 (v/v) in methanol. The identification of peaks was tentatively carried out based on library search using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-2013. Relative Retention Index (RRI) was calculated for HP-5MS column. For RRI calculation a mixture of homologues <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C9-C18) was used under the same chromatographic conditions as for analysis of the essential oils.</p>

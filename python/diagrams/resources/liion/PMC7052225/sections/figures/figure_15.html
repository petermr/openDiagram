 <caption> Long cycling experiments performed at a constant charge/discharge current of C/10 between 1.5 and 3.5 V versus Li/Li +. Two PTCDA electrodes (40 mg), one composed of VGCF–COOH (□), and the other of a mixture of VGCF–SO 3H and CNT–SO 3H ( ), are compared. Full and empty characters represent the Coulombic efficiency (%) and discharge capacity, respectively. Before the long cycling experiment, a formation rapidly occurs at 5 C. </caption>

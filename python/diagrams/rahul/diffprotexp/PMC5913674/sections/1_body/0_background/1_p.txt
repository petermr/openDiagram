0: Nitroheterocyclics (e.g., metronidazole [Mtz], nitazoxanide, and furazolidone) include redox-active pro-drugs that cross the cell membrane via passive diffusion and are enzymatically reduced to cytotoxic intermediates that oxidize biomolecules.
1: This occurs specifically within highly reducing intracellular environments of microaerophilic protists ( Giardia duodenalis, Trichomononas vaginalis, and  Entameoba histolytica) as well as anaerobic bacteria ( Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile, and  Bacteroides fragilis) [ 1,  2].
2: By contrast, Mtz has low toxicity in aerobic cells, where dO 2 re-oxidizes reduced Mtz to the pro-drug form, termed futile cycling.
3: The specificity of nitroheterocyclic toxicity for low dissolved oxygen biochemistry makes this drug class the chemotherapeutic backbone against multiple bacterial and protozoan pathogens.
4: However, drug resistance within this compound class is collectively widespread across species [ 24].

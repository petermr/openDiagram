<p>We screened a battery of eleven detergents to solubilize BAD-PcATP2 and the co-expressed Cdc50 proteins from both, P2 and P3 membranes. PcATP2 and Cdc50 proteins in P2 membranes could not be solubilized under any of the tested experimental conditions, with the exception of the rather denaturing n-dodecylphosphocholine (Fos-Choline-12). In contrast, a fraction of PcATP2 and PcCdc50B from P3 membranes was solubilized in N-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) and, with less efficiency, in Lauryl maltose neopentyl-glycol (LMNG) or Octaethylene glycol monodecyl ether (C12E8) (Figure supplement 3). The fact that only the PcATP2 and PcCdc50B fractions present in P3 could be solubilized in DDM strongly suggests a folding defect of the P2-containing proteins because DDM is know to be poorly efficient fo solubilize unfolded or partially folded integral membrane proteins[

Importantly, the solubilization efficiency of these detergents was greatly improved by the presence of the cholesterol derivative, cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) (Figure supplement 3). Due to the low amount of BAD-PcATP2 co-expressed with PcCdc50A in P3 (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), the immunodetection of the DDM/CHS solubilized fraction of BAD-PcATP2 from P3 membranes was always challenging (Figure supplement 3, panel E). Interestingly, we found that the lower band of PcCdc50A (identified in the next section as the non-glycosylated form of PcCdc50A, 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) was the only one co-solubilized with PcATP2 (Figure supplement 3, panel F or 
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, right panel, lanes 1, 4 and 5). This suggests that glycosylation of PcCdc50A (see next section) might affect the folding and/or membrane trafficking during biogenesis, explaining (at least, in part) the preferential localization of PcCdc50A together with its co-expressed PcATP2 partner in P2 membranes (

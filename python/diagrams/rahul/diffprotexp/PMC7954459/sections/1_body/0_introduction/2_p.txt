0: Seed development ensures the continuation of next generation, which is initiated after fertilization and terminates with breakage of seed dormancy or germination (Huijser & Schmid,  2011; Le et al.,  2007).
1: Seed provides the primary source of dietary intake in humans and livestock (Nambara & Nonogaki,  2012; Sabelli & Larkins,  2015).
2: To fulfill the requirements of the exponentially increasing population, crop yield needs to be increased proportionately.
3: Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying seed development (Jones & Vodkin,  2013; Kurdyukov et al.,  2014; Le et al.,  2010; Rangan et al.,  2017; Xu et al.,  2012).

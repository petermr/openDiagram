<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The present investigation revealed that Gram-positive bacteria tested were more sensitive to all three essential oils than Gram-negative bacteria (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Such tendency is also observed by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The essential oil of <italic>O.</italic> x <italic>citriodorum</italic> was quite active against <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>St. aureus, with the</italic> MIC of 3.125&#160;&#956;L/mL. The same MIC was recorded for the essential oil of <italic>O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> against <italic>St. aureus</italic>, and O<italic>. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> essential oil against <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. The MIC of <italic>O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> essential oil against <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and MIC of <italic>O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> against <italic>St. aureus</italic> were twice as high, 6.25&#160;&#956;L/mL. The ampicillin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria also displayed sensitivity against the essential oils tested: thus the MIC values of <italic>O.</italic> x <italic>citriodorum</italic> and <italic>O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> against those bacteria were 6.25&#160;&#956;L/mL, while <italic>O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> displayed MIC of 12.5&#160;&#956;L/mL. The action of the essential oils on the all bacteria in this study was evaluated as bactericidal.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of <italic>O. citriodorum</italic>, <italic>O. basilicum</italic> var. <italic>thyrsiflora</italic> and <italic>O. basilicum</italic> var. <italic>purpureum</italic> essential oils on selected Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.

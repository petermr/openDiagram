0: Over a 3.5 year period, 12 individual aardvarks were darted and implanted with data loggers (see below) to record their body temperature and activity.
1: At different timepoints throughout the study, our sample size ranged between one and five individuals for body temperature and one and four individuals for activity, as a result of aardvark deaths and failure of biologging devices (see  Supplementary Table S1 for details).
2: In July 2012, we instrumented six aardvarks; five of these aardvarks died in March 2013 during the summer drought ( Rey et al., 2017) and we retrieved biologgers from four of their carcasses ( A01,  A02,  A04, and  A05).
3: In July 2013, we recaptured the surviving aardvark ( A06), and instrumented six additional aardvarks (aardvarks  A07 A12).
4: One aardvark ( A10) died during the winter of 2013.
5: One aardvark ( A11) died in the early summer of 2014, nearly 17 months after implantation, with no prior signs of body condition deterioration or weakness.
6: In July 2014, we removed and reimplanted biologgers into two aardvarks ( A07 and  A08), and one aardvark ( A12) was added to the study in July 2014 for the third study year (July 2014 to September 2015; see  Supplementary Table S1 for details).
7: Another died in winter 2015 ( A09), after its body condition deteriorated.
8: Aardvark body mass during capture averaged 35 kg (range 26.543.0 kg).
9: Determination of sex was not done for the aardvarks captured before 2013.
10: All aardvarks captured after 2013 ( A06 A12) were females, as classified based on a published description of aardvark genitalia ( Pocock, 1924).

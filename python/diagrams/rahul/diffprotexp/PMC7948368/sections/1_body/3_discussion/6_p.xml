<p id="Par47">We recognise that the initial discovery cohort contained more responders than non-responders, which may contribute towards a lack of power for finding significant changes between baseline and 3â€‰months in non-responders. However, in order to maximise power and mimic a case-control approach, the replication phase examined an equal number of responders and non-responders. Furthermore, significant changes were identified only in the good-responder group, in keeping with findings in the discovery cohort. Whilst there was no statistically significant difference in concurrent DMARD use at baseline, we recognise that confounding could still occur and so adjusted for this during differential expression analysis.</p>

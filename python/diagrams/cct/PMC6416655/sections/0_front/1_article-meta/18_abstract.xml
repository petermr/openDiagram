 <p>Based on our innovative application of using thick continuous casting slab 0.4C1.5Mn2Cr0.35Mo1.5Ni (high alloy) for the production of high-quality mould steel, the present study investigated the high cracking susceptibility of high-alloy steel and segregation in continuous casting slab. The thermal expansion and the continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curve measurement, together with a high temperature in situ observation, confirmed the martensite phase transition happening at approximately 583 K that would result in an increase in the hardenability and cracking susceptibility. The cracking susceptibility zone was determined by high-temperature mechanical properties measurement. The high-alloy mould steel has no II brittle zone, and III brittle zone is 973â€“1148 K. As a conclusion, the straightening temperature should be above 1148 K to avoid the cracking during the continuous casting. Moreover, the elemental segregation of carbon, sulfur, chromium, and molybdenum along the cracking was examined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) quantitative analysis that might be another reason for the steel crack formation. It shows that Martensite phase transition happened at approximately 583 K that would result in an increase in the hardenability and cracking susceptibility.</p>

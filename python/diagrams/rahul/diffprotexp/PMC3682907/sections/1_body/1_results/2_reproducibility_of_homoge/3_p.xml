<p>The cytosolic fraction was spotted as four replicates onto NP20 chips. Examples of SELDI mass spectra for the cytosolic Q1 fraction from each trial obtained with the two homogenization methods are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Fourteen peaks with S/N &gt;5 were found to be common to all mass spectra analyzed across the two homogenization protocols and represent proteins with mass/charge ratios from 7,492 Da to 42,764 Da. The coefficients of variation for each peak are listed in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and varied from 8.2% to as much as 60.7%. Overall, homogenization method M1, in which tissue was thinly sliced prior to homogenization with a rotor homogenizer, shows better reproducibility than method M2, in which blocks of brain tissue were cut and homogenized with a mechanical homogenizer.

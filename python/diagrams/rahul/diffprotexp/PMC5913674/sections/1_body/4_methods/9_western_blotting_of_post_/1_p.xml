<p>Adhered trophozoites grown to confluence from all MtzR and MtzS isogenic isolates, as well as 106-MtzR and 713-MtzR P0, P8, and P16 revertant cultures, had protein extracted in 2.5% SDS in 100 mM Tris containing 5 mM Trichostatin A (BioAustralis) and HALT
 <sup>®</sup> protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies). The protein concentration was determined via BCA assay (Pierce), and then samples were reduced with 15 mM dithiothreitol at 90°C. A total of 15 μg of proteins were resolved on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen) in 1 × 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid running buffer (Invitrogen) and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma). All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signalling Technologies and included antibodies were directed to KAc, K-MMe, phosphorylated tyrosine (pY), the 14–3-3 binding motif (including phosphorylated serine) (14–3-3), and ubiquitin. Anti-H3 and anti-H4 antibodies were obtained from Abcam. Consistent protein loading was verified after transfer using Ponceau S staining (Sigma). Protein–antibody interaction was detected with an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated immunoglobulin G secondary antibody using enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (LumiGLO
 <sup>®</sup>, Cell Signalling Technologies) on a BioRad ChemiDoc MP imaging system with exposure times optimized for each antibody; images were collected up to 200 seconds and selected based on resolution and absence of oversaturation.

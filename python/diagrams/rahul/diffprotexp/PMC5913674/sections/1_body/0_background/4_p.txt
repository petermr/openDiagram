0: Collectively, evidence suggests that Mtz resistance is a complex polygenic phenotype (reviewed by Ansell et al.
1: [ 2]).
2: Namely, divergent changes in transcript abundance between genetically similar Mtz-resistant  Giardia [ 10,  19] and laboratory lines [ 15,  18] suggest multiple Mtz-resistant molecular phenotypes.
3: Further, the interactions of transcriptional expression, enzyme activity, and, recently, nonsynonymous mutations [ 18] remain to be understood in key enzymes.
4: Phenotypic aspects including infectivity and fitness also differ in lines of different genetic background selected for Mtz resistance  in vivo and  in vitro [ 14].
5: Plasticity in the resistance phenotype during encystation [ 19] or when drug selection is discontinued [ 21] further suggests reversible or inducible transcriptional regulation.
6: Transcriptional plasticity has been linked to Sir2 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent protein deacetylases (sirtuins) [ 2,  19] and may indicate a role for reversible protein modifications in resistance phenotypes.
7: RNA transcription and control of gene expression in  Giardia [ 2224] suggest an important role for post-transcriptional and post-translation regulation, and a global description of protein expression is a key, missing link in Mtz-resistance research.
8: In light of this, we undertook detailed, quantitative proteomic analyses in Mtz-resistant and -susceptible  Giardia lines to identify differentially expressed proteins.
9: To our knowledge, this marks the first such analysis of Mtz resistance in any parasitic pathogen.
10: This work was conducted in 3 genetically distinct  Giardia cell culture isolates that each have been heavily characterized in the literature [ 2527] and have shaped the foundational understanding of Mtz resistance in the genus [ 10,  14,  28].
11: Moreover, we examined dynamic changes in a wide range of post-translational protein modifications in Mtz-resistant and -susceptible and isogenic isolates and, in the latter, after several months of drug-free passage.

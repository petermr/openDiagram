<p>All experiments were performed with twice PBS washed cells at a density of about 1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well (1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml), in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l complete medium per well. Then 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of complete culture medium containing different concentrations of the tested essential oils (dissolved in DMSO) was added to each well. After 48 h exposure of cells to these concentrations of tested essential oils at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of medium was carefully aspirated from each well and replaced with 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of MTT solution (5 mg/ml of PBS). After incubation in the same conditions for 4 hours, the plates were treated with 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of an HCl/isopropanol (24 : 1) solution to dissolve the blue intracellular formazan produced by living cells. One hour later, the absorbance (optical density OD) of the plates was determined by a Multiskan EX spectrophotometer reader at two wavelengths (540 and 630 nm). DMSO (0.5%) was used as the negative control and methotrexate (MTX) as the positive one.

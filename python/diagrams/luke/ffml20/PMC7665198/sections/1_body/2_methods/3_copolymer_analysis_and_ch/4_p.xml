<p id="Par16">Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a TA Instrument Hi-Res TGA 2950. Prior to analysis, copolymer films were cut into 3 × 3-mm squares with a thickness of 200–300 μm and immersed in deionized (D)I H¬2 O for 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 1440 min (24 h). A typical TGA experiment was carried out from 25 to 150 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The resulting data were processed using TA Universal Analysis vs. 5.4 software.</p>

0: The increases in K V1.3 expression following stimulation of microglia with LPS, AO or Syn Agg seem to involve many of the same signaling cascades that are affected by K V1.3 inhibition, and K V1.3 blockers typically prevent increases in Kv1.3 expression.
1: The K V1.3 promoter contains multiple NF-B and SP1 binding sites and inhibitors of NF-B or p38MAPK independently reduce Syn Agg stimulated Kv1.3 up-regulation in microglia [ 8], demonstrating that both the p38MAPK and the classical NF-B pathways mediate the transcriptional regulation of K V1.3 ( Figure 1).
2: The Src family kinase Fyn works upstream of the NF-B transcription factor by regulating the nuclear translocation of its component p65 [ 34] and by phosphorylating the PKC isoform PKC.

4: reported that Fyn knockout reduces both LPS and Syn Agg induced increases in K V1.3 current density in cultured microglia, an effect that can be mimicked by treatment of microglia with the Fyn inhibitor saracatinib or by deficiency for PKC, suggesting that the Fyn/PKC kinase signaling cascade is involved in mediating K V1.3 upregulation in response to inflammatory stimuli [ 8].
5: As demonstrated in a Duolink proximity ligation assay, Fyn is directly interacting with Kv1.3 and is phosphorylating the channel at Y135 to increase its activity.

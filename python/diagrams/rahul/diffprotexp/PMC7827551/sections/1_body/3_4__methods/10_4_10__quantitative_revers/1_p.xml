<p>ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) were used, following the manufacturer’s recommendations for the synthesis of the cDNA. The reaction was carried out using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The same primers used in the traditional PCR were used together with these primers as internal standards; 5′-CGTTCCTCGACCTCATCCA-3′ and 5′-GCCCTTGGTGTAGTCGAACTTC-3′ (for

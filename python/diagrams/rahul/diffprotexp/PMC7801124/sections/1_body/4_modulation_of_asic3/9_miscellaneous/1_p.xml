<p>A variety of cations are present endogenously within the body, as well as used as experimental tools, and thus it is important to understand how ASIC3 is modulated by cations, for example, the inhibitory effects of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> have already been discussed. In addition, the following cations have also been shown to inhibit ASIC3 (and/or ASIC3-like currents): Gd
 <sup>3+</sup> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ∼2.5 mM [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.7 µM [
 <xref rid="cit0223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>], high concentration (1 mM) Cd
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> [
 <xref rid="cit0224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>], Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 14.4 µM [
 <xref rid="cit0225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>], and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 61 µM [
 <xref rid="cit0226" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Obviously, many of these cations will also modulate the function of other ion channels expressed by sensory neurones and thus interpreting any in vivo activity is complex.

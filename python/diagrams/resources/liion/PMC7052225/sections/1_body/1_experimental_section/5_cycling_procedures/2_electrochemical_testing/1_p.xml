<p id="Par18">Cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical behaviors of bare electrode (stainless steel spacer only), paper electrode (composed only of FB), and self-standing electrode films made of LFP, PTCDA, and LTO are compared through cyclic voltammetry experiments. A scan rate of 0.03 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup> is employed among the various potential windows.

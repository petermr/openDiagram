 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The carbides in martensite are relatively small and dispersed in a short rod (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), whereas the carbides in bainite are relatively coarse (Fig.

 <sub>6</sub> carbides. Changing the cooling rate during quenching has no effect on the type of carbide formed, but only on its morphology. Previous studies have reported a linear dependence of the carbide size on the critical distance between a crack tip and a cleavage initiation site. Therefore, the coarse carbides are detrimental to the impact toughness of the material

  <p>Estrogen, tamoxifen and raloxifene alters gene expression in the spinal cord differently in males and females. (A) Western blot of the ERÎ± in the spinal cord of males (n = 4) and females (n = 4) C57BL mice. (B) Quantification of the Western blot in A. (C) Schematic representation of the experimental design and scheduling of injections. (D) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in females treated with estrogen relative to females treated with vehicle control. (E) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in males treated with estrogen relative to males treated with vehicle control. (F) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in females treated with estrogen relative to males treated with estrogen. (G) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in females treated with tamoxifen relative to females treated with vehicle control. (H) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in males treated with tamoxifen relative to males treated with vehicle control. (I) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in females treated with tamoxifen relative to males treated with tamoxifen. (J) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in females treated with raloxifene relative to females treated with vehicle control. (K) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in males treated with raloxifene relative to males treated with vehicle control. (L) Volcano plot of up- or downregulated genes in females treated with raloxifene relative to males treated with raloxifene.</p>

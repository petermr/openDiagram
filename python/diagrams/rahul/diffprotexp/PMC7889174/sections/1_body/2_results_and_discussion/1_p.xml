 <italic>Documenting nuclear envelope evolution and understanding eukaryogenesis</italic>. In the earliest stages of eukaryotic evolution, the nucleus may have served as a simple membranous structure enclosing the chromatin. The double lipid bilayer and composition of the NE are direct consequences of the NE being an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). With several nuclear and NE proteomes published [

 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60â€“62</xref>], data suggest retention of functional analogs, 
 <italic>albeit</italic> with divergent sequence and structure, but most information is restricted to animals and fungi. Further, protein domain shuffling [
 <xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] is also apparent among the NEA proteins, for example, the lamin B receptor is conserved but only due to the presence of a C
 <sub>14</sub>-sterol reductase domain, indicating repurposing but not a pan-eukaryotic presence for an LBR [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hence, more systematic analysis is warranted.

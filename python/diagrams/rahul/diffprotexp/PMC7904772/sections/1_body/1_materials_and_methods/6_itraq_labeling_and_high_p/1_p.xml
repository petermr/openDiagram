<p id="Par10">Peptides from the FASP-based digestion were labeled with 8-plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) reagents following the instructions of the manufacturer. Eight samples from the control and the stressed groups were labeled using the reagents 113–121. Each sample was obtained from two or three rats in each group. After peptide labeling, these samples were mixed and subsequently fractionated by offline high-pH RPLC, where the peptides were fractionated via an 80-min linear gradient elution of 5–38% high-pH buffer (10 mM ammonium formate, 90% acetonitrile, pH 10.0). The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. The acquired 16 fractions were desalted and lyophilized for the following analysis.</p>

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> B and D). Comparison of sterile-line pollen with restorer-line pollen via scanning electron microscopy revealed many abnormal developmental protrusions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> E and F), anther epidermal growth retardation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> G and H) with pollen grains present on the surface, and abnormal shrinkage rupture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> I and J). The pollen grains of sterile plants shrank markedly, bent inward, and collapsed; moreover, the outer wall development was abandoned, and the central plate was irregular.

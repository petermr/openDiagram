<p>TMT data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer 2.2. The 3 runs of 12 “super fractions” were merged and searched using SEQUEST. The Protein FASTA database was Mus musculus (NCBIAV) version 2017-05-05. Static modifications included TMT reagents on lysine and N-terminus (+229.163), carbamidomethyl on cysteines (=57.021), and dynamic modification of oxidation of methionine (=15.9949). Parent ion tolerance was 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance was 0.6 Da, and the maximum number of missed cleavages was set to 2. Only high-scoring peptides were considered utilizing a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.</p>

0: In this study, IHC and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were performed to elucidate the correlation between TUBA1C and LUAD.
1: Furthermore, we used the computational algorithms CIBERSORT and TIMER to explore the relationship between TUBA1C and TIICs in LUAD patients.
2: In addition, STRING software, GeneMANIA Analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were used to further study the function and mechanism of TUBA1C in LUAD patients.
3: The findings proved that TUBA1C played an important role in the development of LUAD.
4: Furthermore, we elucidated the potential relationship between TUBA1C and tumor-immune interaction.

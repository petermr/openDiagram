<p>Results of this analysis in the placebo group were also in agreement with the differential gene expression analysis and confirmed that the most characteristic unique difference between lung tissue with lesion and lung tissue without lesion was oxidative stress if no treatment was applied. Depressed regulation of the protein processing in this tissue may indicate greater stress and possible starvation or more significant functional suppression in cells in lesions without treatment.</p>

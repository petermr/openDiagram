<p>In conclusion, using scRNA-seq, the current study investigated the transcriptional dynamics of germ cells and PG cells following prenatal DEHP exposure during PF assembly. The results highlighted that DEHP impaired germline cyst breakdown and PF formation might be caused by oxidative stress in germ cells. Moreover, DNA damage and apoptosis were increased, as well as TGF-beta signaling being disturbed between both cell types. The current research presents a systematic understanding of DEHP damage on murine PF formation, and offers a preventive and therapeutic schedule for its biotoxicity in humans.</p>

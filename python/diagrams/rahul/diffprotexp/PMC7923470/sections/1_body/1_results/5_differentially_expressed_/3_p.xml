<p id="Par46">We also observed the relatively lower expression of genes related to starch degradation i.e. inactive beta-amylase 9 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase PLS1 which has also been reported to be involved in growth of the cucumber seedlings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and a stellacyanin, 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 4-like (

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Apart from hormones and cell-wall structural control of cell elongation, it is known that codeine 3-O-demethylases are linked to plant cell division and stem elongation via the demethylation of mono-, di-, and tri-methylated lysine-4 residues of histone subunit 3. We found that a codeine 3-O-demethylase (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb11t04180</italic>) had almost no expression in MT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). GABA accumulation is known to cause cell elongation defects. Our transcriptome data showed exactly this feature where one transmembrane amino acid transporter protein (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb01t32380</italic>; probable GABA transporter 1) had lower expression in MT (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. White-brown complex homolog protein 15 (
 <italic>Ma06_g03830</italic>) (ABC transporter) showed increased expression in MT. This gene is highly expressed in developing cotton fiber cells and is correlated with cotton fiber elongation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

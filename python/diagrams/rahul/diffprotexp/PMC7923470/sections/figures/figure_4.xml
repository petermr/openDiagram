   <bold>a</bold> Top-10 up-accumulated (shown in red bars) and top-10 down-accumulated metabolites (shown in green bars) in WT vs MT Aifen No.1 banana pseudostem. 
   <bold>b</bold> Scatter plot of 20 KEGG pathways between WT and MT Aifen No. 1 banana pseudostems to which the differentially accumulated metabolites were enriched. The degree of enrichment is shown by Rich factor,

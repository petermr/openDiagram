Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a plasticizer to which humans are exposed daily, can trigger reproductive toxicity by acting as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. In mammals, the female primordial follicle pool forms the lifetime available ovarian reserve, which does not undergo regeneration once it is established during the fetal and neonatal period. It is therefore critical to examine the toxicity of DEHP regarding the establishment of the ovarian reserve as it has not been well investigated.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The ovarian cells of postnatal pups, following maternal DEHP exposure, were prepared for single cell-RNA sequencing, and the effects of DEHP on primordial follicle formation were revealed using gene differential expression analysis and single-cell developmental trajectory. In addition, further biochemical experiments, including immunohistochemical staining, apoptosis detection, and Western blotting, were performed to verify the dataset results.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we revealed the gene expression dynamics of female germ cells and granulosa cells following exposure to DEHP in mice. Regarding germ cells: DEHP impeded the progression of follicle assembly and interfered with their developmental status, while key genes such as <italic>Lhx8</italic>, <italic>Figla,</italic> and others, strongly evidenced the reduction. As for granulosa cells: DEHP likely inhibited their proliferative activity, and activated the regulation of cell death. Furthermore, the interaction between ovarian cells mediated by transforming growth factor-beta signaling, was disrupted by DEHP exposure, since the expression of GDF9, BMPR1A, and SMAD3 was affected. In addition, DNA damage and apoptosis were elevated in germ cells and/or somatic cells.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These findings offer substantial novel insights into the reproductive toxicity of DEHP exposure during murine germ cell cyst breakdown and primordial follicle formation.

Among various pollutants, ubiquitous plastics are annually utilized in staggeringly large volumes; this has raised a public health concern. Phthalates are widely used as a plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride resin (PVC) in the production of plastics <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. As phthalates are not covalently bond to polymers <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, they can easily migrate and penetrate human and animal bodies through various routes, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Worryingly, human exposure to phthalate occurs on a daily basis <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Moreover, robust evidence has heightened a link between plasticizer exposure and some reproductive disorders <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Thus, an investigation into the reproductive toxicity of phthalates is deemed necessary to heighten awareness of the need for protection against detrimental phthalates, and to propose potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for toxicity mitigation.</p><p>In females, primordial follicle (PF) formation (or assembly) occurs perinatally in mice and around mid-gestation in humans; this results in a finite follicle reserve termed the ovarian reserve or PF pool <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. After primordial germ cells arrive at the murine gonad, they undergo mitosis to produce germ cell cysts (or nests), from which oogonia mature after sexual differentiation. Subsequently, oogonia enter meiosis around 13.5 days post coitum (dpc) to become oocytes. Shortly afterwards, germ cell cysts breakdown following the invasive activity of proliferative pre-granulosa cells from 17.5 dpc to a few days postnatally. A substantial loss of germ cells, and the surviving oocytes become enclosed within a layer of flattened granulosa cells, which signifies PF formation <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. It is known that the PF pool is non-renewable once established and that it progressively diminishes following the first-wave of follicle recruitment during puberty, and is almost exhausted at menopause in humans <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Thus, the size of the PF pool is the primary determinant of reproductive lifespan in females <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Notably, the available oocytes within PFs naturally undergo irreversible exhaustion or atresia during development; however, they are prone to damage from adverse external environmental chemicals (such as plasticizers) as well as cellular aging <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Meanwhile, the ovarian dysgenesis syndrome hypothesis proposes that an early disruption to ovarian development can potentially lead to ovarian disease and disorders in adulthood; this is particularly pertinent at times that are sensitive to disruption by exogenous chemicals, such as PF assembly <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Consequently, attention needs to be focused on the protection of female fertility from toxic materials.</p><p>Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), the most commonly used plasticizer, is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that can trigger reproductive and developmental toxicity in females <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Importantly, DEHP exposure impairs establishment of the ovarian reserve by delaying or reducing PF assembly <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Similar observations in other studies suggest the deregulation of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor expression, and attenuation of NOTCH signaling <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Furthermore, the number of apoptotic germ cells increases during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of newborn ovaries exposed to DEHP for three days <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Specifically, autophagy can be induced by DEHP exposure via activating AMPK-SKP2-CARM1 signaling, thus further reducing the PF pool and damaging female fertility <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>; these results indicate that DEHP affects oocyte survival during PF formation. From another aspect, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies both suggest that DEHP damages steroidogenesis and exerts toxicity during different stages of folliculogenesis <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. For example, plasticizer exposure could accelerate the development of PFs and therefore result in premature ovarian failure (POF) <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, and antral follicle depletion is increased as a result of estrogen deficiency, estrous cycle disorder, and impaired aromatase activity <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Meanwhile, the transgenerational inheritance of DEHP has attracted considerable attention <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Through maternal exposure, DEHP has been shown to exert adverse reproductive effects across generations: it reduces oocyte quality and follicle reserve in F1 female mice, and alters the same ovarian phenotype in F2 and F3 offspring; moreover, it accelerates follicular recruitment <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>.</p><p>The development of single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized the dissection of cellular heterogeneity and cell fate transition <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. From such studies, many novel insights have been proposed regarding reproductive system development, derived from single cell datasets in both males <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and females <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Recently, the credo of a limited ovarian reserve has been reinforced by single-cell analysis of human ovarian cortical tissue, where no oogonial stem cells were detected <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. In addition, the transcriptomic landscapes of germ cells during early murine oogenesis have been delineated, which concentrates on two vital germline events, meiotic initiation <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and PF assembly <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. Furthermore, the respective waves of PF formation in the ovarian cortex and medulla disclose two distinct pathways for pre-granulosa cell differentiation <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. To date, the effect of DEHP on PF assembly has not been thoroughly examined and deciphered.</p><p>The current study set out to characterize the molecular mechanism of the toxic effects of DEHP exposure on PF assembly, at a daily dose of 40 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight DEHP through oral administration to pregnant mice at 16.5 dpc. Subsequently, the DEHP-treated ovaries at PD0 (PD0-DEHP) and PD3 (PD3-DEHP) were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using a 10&#x000d7; Genomics platform. At a single-cell level, the toxicity of DEHP exposure to PF assembly was further investigated, and compared to previously reported normal murine developmental ovarian datasets at PD0 and PD3 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>scRNA-seq identified six main cell types in post-natal ovaries</title><p>To characterize the transcriptome dynamics of ovarian cells affected by DEHP during PF formation, pregnant mice were given DEHP daily from 16.5 dpc, and the ovaries were collected at postnatal day 0 (PD0-DEHP) and 3 (PD3-DEHP), from which single-cell suspensions were prepared for scRNA-seq (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, left panel). Following the combination of barcoded gel beads, enzyme mixtures, and oil, the nanoliter-scale droplets (termed &#x0201c;gel bead-in emulsions&#x0201d;, GEMs) were generated for library construction and sequencing (upper part of right panel). Then, single-cell datasets were conducted for cell cluster, pseudotime trajectory, and differential analysis of gene expression using Seurat and Monocle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, bottom part of right panel). In addition, after data pre-progressing and potential doublets filtration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>A), 4,558 high-quality ovarian cells were obtained at PD0-DEHP and 5,252 at PD3-DEHP, and the number of high-quality cells from collected datasets of normal ovarian tissues at PD0 was 4,270, with 5,375 at PD3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>B). The harvested high-quality cells were used for subsequent analysis.</p><p>Based on uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) technology, 19 cell clusters were generated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B), and several cell clusters were at least partially displayed in a dependent manner for the developmental stage or DEHP treatment. To determine the ovarian cell composition at an investigated period, marker genes were identified in cell clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S1</xref>); the top five marker genes in each cluster are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>C. According to their transcription characteristics, cell clusters were divided into six cell types, and the representative genes in each cell type are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C. In addition, the cell-type-specific genes are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>D; six main cell types were identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E). Moreover, germ cells and granulosa cells were examined as the major participants of PF assembly using immunohistochemistry; STAT3 for germ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>A) and AMHR2 for granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>B), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>DEHP impacted the progress of PF assembly and germ cell development</title><p>Following the cell type classification above, the germ cell population was extracted for in-depth analysis; according to the results, cell heterogeneity was not dependent on cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>A) and cells in the four groups were classified as twelve cell clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A-B). In addition, marker genes in each germ cell cluster were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S2</xref>), and the top five genes are displayed in a heatmap in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>B. Among them, several key genes involved in biological events were highlighted, including meiosis (<italic>Meioc, M1ap</italic>), PF assembly (<italic>Figla, Lhx8</italic>), and oocyte growth (<italic>Zp3, Padi6</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>C). Specifically, the representative genes, <italic>Taf7l</italic> and <italic>Figla</italic>, were capable of separating cell clusters into two developmental stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Meanwhile, based on the expression pattern of genes associated with meiosis, PF assembly, and oocyte growth in clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>C), the germ cells were divided into three developmental stages: pre-, early-, and late-stage of PF assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E). The pre-stage consisted of cells in clusters 8 and 9; the early-stage contained cells in clusters 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, and 11; and the late-stage comprised cells in clusters 0, 4, and 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E upper). Moreover, the percentage of cells at the three stages indicated a decline in cell percentage at the early-stage for PD0 and the late-stage for PD3 after DEHP treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E bottom); furthermore, the results suggested that DEHP impacted the progress of PF formation. In particular, the immunostaining of ovarian sections at PD3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F) with or without DEHP suggested that DEHP exposure indeed decreased the percentage of germ cells within follicles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G).</p><p>Furthermore, gene differential expression was carried out at the three identified stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). At the pre-stage of PF formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S3</xref>), there were 214 down- and 131 up-regulated genes for PD0-DEHP <italic>vs.</italic> PD0, and 65 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the PD3-DEHP and PD3 groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A left). For the early-stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S4</xref>) with DEHP treatment, there were 202 up- and 218 down-regulated DEGs at PD0, and 142 up- and 416 down-regulated DEGs at PD3, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A middle). At the late-stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S5</xref>), DEHP significantly increased 202 and 181 DEGs, and decreased 176 and 374 genes at PD0 and PD3, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A right). Furthermore, the representative genes involved in PF assembly and oocyte growth dramatically declined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>D). These results implied that DEHP tended to influence the transcription of germ cells during PF assembly. In addition, 13, 191, and 223 key DEGs (this refers to the common genes in Venn diagrams that were both affected by DEHP at PD0 and PD3) were produced at the pre-, early-, and late-stages of PF formation, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Enrichment analysis demonstrated that key genes at the pre-stage were related to &#x0201c;Ribosome&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;DNA repair&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Regulation of cellular response to stress&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>E); 191 key DEGs at the early-stage were mostly enriched in the biological processes of &#x0201c;oxidative phosphorylation&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton transport&#x0201d; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Meanwhile, at the late-stage, DEHP largely affected &#x0201c;regulation of protein stability&#x0201d; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D), as well as &#x0201c;energy coupled proton transport&#x0201d;. Moreover, both were enriched in &#x0201c;cytoplasmic translation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;mitochondrial transmembrane transport&#x0201d;.</p><p>In a separate analysis, the DEG lists at PD0 and PD3, that were associated with the DEHP effect, were examined. Results showed that at the pre-stage, the biological process of DEG lists at PD0 and PD3 varied massively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>A), and the difference at the early- and late-stages of PF formation were not distinct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>B-C). Furthermore, DEHP always impacted the processes of &#x0201c;cellular responses to stress&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chromatin organization&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;oxidative phosphorylation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cytoplasmic translation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cellular response to DNA damage stimulus&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;transcriptional regulation by TP53&#x0201d; throughout both PD0 and PD3 stages. At the same time, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signal, cell cycle, and mRNA processing were all likely associated with DEHP effect on germ cell development.</p></sec><sec><title>DEHP disordered germ cell fate revealed by single cell trajectory</title><p>To further dissect the fate transition of germ cells during PF formation, the pseudotime trajectory of germ cells was established to reveal five developmental States and two branching cell fates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). According to the distribution of germ cells in States, the differentiated status of DEHP-treated germ cells at PD3 underwent a remarkable change, with an apparent increase of cells at State 5 being observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B-C). Gene expression along with cell trajectory showed at State 1 that the <italic>Taf7l</italic> gene was actively expressed at the pre-stage of PF formation, while the <italic>Figla</italic> gene was expressed at all investigated stages, while at State 3 the <italic>Zp3</italic> and <italic>Padi6</italic> genes were specifically and actively expressed in follicular oocytes (late-stage; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S5</xref>A). This evidence implied that PF assembly was impeded by DEHP.</p><p>To investigate the inherent mechanism, gene expression patterns at two branches was performed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). Four gene sets regarding two cell fates were generated: set 1 consisted of 282 genes, mostly and highly expressed in cell fate 1, partly expressed at cell fate 2, and slightly expressed at pre-branch (State 1); furthermore, the GO terms of the top 100 genes in the set were mostly enriched in biological processes such as &#x0201c;Translation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Ribosomal small subunit biogenesis&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Regulation of translation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Negative regulation of ubiquitin protein ligase activity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;rRNA processing&#x0201d;. Set 2 contained 643 genes that were mainly expressed in pre-branch and fate 1 cells, and hugely decreased in fate 2, which acted on &#x0201c;Translation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Ribosome assembly&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Oxidative phosphorylation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Ribosome biogenesis&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway by p53 class mediator&#x0201d;. For the 396 genes in set 3, they were mainly expressed at pre-branch, showing a slight decline at fate 2 and were dramatically down-regulated at fate 1, but largely enriched in &#x0201c;Synapsis&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Protein-DNA complex subunit organization&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Mitochondrial genome maintenance&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Protein refolding&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Negative regulation of mRNA metabolic process&#x0201d;. The 1,371 genes in set 4 seemed to be elevated by DEHP at fate 2 and were related to the processes of &#x0201c;ATP synthesis coupled electron transport&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Histone H3-K4 monomethylation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Cellular response to steroid hormone stimulus&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Supramolecular fiber organization&#x0201d; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E). Therefore, following DEHP exposure during PF formation, these results suggest that some biological consequences (such as &#x0201c;organization cell cycle&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;sexual reproduction&#x0201d;) persisted from pre-branch (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>F, set 3), the &#x0201c;process metabolic biosynthetic&#x0201d; decreased (set 2), and &#x0201c;process regulation metabolic&#x0201d; increased (set 4). Moreover, the representative genes in each gene set are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S5</xref>B; for set 4, with enrichment analysis of protein-protein interaction, the genes seemed to be involved in &#x0201c;chromatin organization&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;covalent chromatin modification&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;histone modification&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S5</xref>C).</p><p>Another noteworthy branch point existed in germ cell trajectory. In the comparative analysis, the heatmap of gene expression dynamics from State 4 to State 3 or 1 comprised two large gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S5</xref>D): one of known meiosis-related genes that were highly marked and expressed in State 1, such as <italic>Taf7l</italic>,<italic> Sycp1</italic>,<italic> Sycp3,</italic> and <italic>Smc1b</italic>; while the other included more key genes (<italic>Dppa3, Zp3,</italic> and<italic> Padi6</italic>) critical to PF assembly. Importantly, the gene expression level along with pseudotime indicated that State 4 was almost equidistant between States 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S5</xref>E), therefore, the cells at State 4 appeared to be a transitional stage of female germ cells between cyst and follicle.</p></sec><sec><title>DEHP impacted the development of pre-granulosa cells at the prenatal stage</title><p>It is already known that pre-granulosa (PG) cells are required for PF formation. PG cells were clustered based on UMAP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A).

Further, the clustering of BPG and EPG cells were separated, and six cell clusters for BPG and five for EPG were produced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C-D); their expression patterns were consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S6</xref>A-B) <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>.</p><p>Gene differential expression analysis was applied to uncover the effects of DEHP exposure to PG cells. In BPG cells, exposure to DEHP significantly increased 186 genes and decreased 159 genes at PD0, while the number of DEGs up-regulated by DEHP at PD3 reached 279 and with 571 down-regulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S6</xref>). Similarly, for EPG cells, 149 and 474 genes were up-regulated by DEHP at PD0 and PD3, respectively, and 236 and 313 genes were down-regulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>F, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S7</xref>). In addition, 192 key DEGs in BPG and 248 key DEGs in EPG were affected by DEHP both at PD0 and PD3, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S6</xref>C-D). GO enrichment analysis indicated that the key DEGs of BPG cells were involved in the processes of &#x0201c;ribosome assembly&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;catabolic process&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;positive regulation of cell death&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;reproductive system development&#x0201d; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>G). Meanwhile, genes of EPG cells were enriched in &#x0201c;cytoplasmic translation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;regulation of transition&#x0201d;, as well as &#x0201c;positive regulation of cell death&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;reproductive system development&#x0201d; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>H). Furthermore, Metascape enrichment analysis of protein-protein interaction revealed that the key DEGs of BPG were enriched in terms of &#x0201c;regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;positive regulation of cell cycle&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S6</xref>E); while those of EPG were associated with &#x0201c;regulation of binding&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;protein localization to cell surface&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;cellular response to cadmium ion&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S6</xref>F). Notably, TRRUST analysis in Metascape indicated both DEGs of BPG and EPG were under the regulation of transcriptional factor <italic>Stat3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S6</xref>E-F, bottom panel).</p></sec><sec><title>DEHP impaired the interaction of female germ cells and pre-granulosa cells during PF formation</title><p>The two datasets of female germ cells and pre-granulosa cells during PF formation, were integrated to investigate the interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>A-B). Using the gene differential expression analysis above, the key DEGs affected by DEHP produced 194 genes in germ cells (DEGs detected by at least two strategies) and 138 genes in granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>C-D). Enrichment of germ cells in the processes of &#x0201c;oxidative phosphorylation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cytoplasmic translation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;cellular responses to stress&#x0201d;, and mTORC1 signaling were also included (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>E). For granulosa cells, the terms of &#x0201c;ribosome assembly&#x0201d;, regulation of catabolic process and cell death, as well as WNT signaling and reactive oxygen species were also enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S7</xref>F). It is noteworthy that the &#x0201c;Downregulation of SMAD2/3: SMAD4 transcriptional activity&#x0201d; term was enriched in both cell types. Thus, components of the TGF-beta pathway were highlighted in subsequent analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). In the results, most known elements regarding TGF-beta signaling were expressed by both or either of germ cells or granulosa cells. Results suggested that<italic> Gdf9</italic> and <italic>Bmp2</italic> were slightly expressed by germ cells and granulosa cells, respectively, while the receptors were mostly expressed by granulosa cells, and the target genes and effectors were highly expressed by germ cells.

The staining of ovarian sections showed that the double-positive of MVH and &#x003b3;H2AX (phosphorylated histone H2AX, served as a marker of DSB) in germ cells was raised by DEHP at PD3, as well as PD5 and PD7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). In addition, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay detected that germ cells and ovarian somatic cells both underwent apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B), and the numbers of TUNEL positive cells in these cell types increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). These results suggested that DEHP exposure of pregnant mothers would trigger the apoptosis of pup ovarian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>DEHP effects on immune cells and stromal cells during PF assembly</title><p>Further, the effects of DEHP on ovarian somatic cells were investigated. For immune cells, eight clusters were produced, and DEHP-treated cells at PD3 seemed to be more distinct from others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>A). Gene differential expression revealed that DEHP up- and down-regulated 10 genes respectively at PD0, and 26 genes were reduced but 88 genes were increased at PD3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>B). GO terms of DEGs at PD0 enriched the biological processes of &#x0201c;multi-organism&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;immune system&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;localization&#x0201d;, while the top terms at PD3 were &#x0201c;immune system process&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cell proliferation&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;response to stimulus&#x0201d;. In terms of stromal cells, six clusters were generated, and the expression pattern of cells in the PD3-DEHP group was largely different from others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>D). Particularly, DEHP hardly affected stromal cells at PD0, with only one DEG (<italic>Birc5</italic>) being detected; at PD3, there were 12 down- and 75 up-regulated genes as a result of DEHP exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>E). Functional enrichment of DEGs at PD3 suggested the greatest enrichment of &#x0201c;cell proliferation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;reproductive process&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;cellular component organization or biogenesis&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S8</xref>F).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>DEHP is widely used as a plasticizer and is ubiquitous in every-day products; its toxicity has been well demonstrated by numerous studies <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, including multiple human body systems, such as neural, endocrine, cardiotoxic, and reproductive <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. Meanwhile, during PF assembly in mammals, the multicellular regulatory networks make the parsing of its mechanism tough and many biological enigmas remain unknown. In the current study, using a maternal perinatal exposure of DEHP from 16.5 dpc to postnatal day 3, scRNA-seq was used to investigate the alteration of transcriptome programs in pup ovaries to explore how the gene regulation networks and cell interaction were affected by DEHP during PF formation in mice.</p><p>Great progress has been made since single-cell transcriptomics has been applied to studies of the female reproductive system <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. Specifically, the transcriptome landscape of the whole process of folliculogenesis in humans has been described, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of monkey ovaries have identified ovarian aging associated dysregulation of antioxidative pathways <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. The current study identified six types of ovarian cells, which was similar to previous scRNA-seq reports using the same timeline in murine ovaries <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. Subsequently, the biological toxicity of DEHP on germ cells was highlighted. Firstly, from a single-cell perspective, DEHP decreased the expression levels of genes essential for PF assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, right panel for germ cell), especially at PD3, such as <italic>Figla</italic> and <italic>Lhx8</italic>. Similarly, it is reported that DEHP exposure also decreased the levels of oocyte-specific genes, such as <italic>Lhx8, Figla, Sohlh1,</italic> and <italic>Nobox</italic>
<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Furthermore, DEHP inhibited germline cyst breakdown and impaired PF assembly <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>. Nevertheless, the current study displayed an impeded progression of PF assembly through a decline of the cell percentages of early-stage follicles in PD0-DEHP and late-stage in the PD3-DEHP group. Further, the ovarian sections revealed that DEHP treatment significantly reduced the cell percentage of germ cells within follicles.</p><p>Moreover, the process of cellular response to stress and DNA damage stimulus, as well as oxidative phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation by TP53, were all enriched after DEHP exposure. All these changes seemed to be associated with cellular stress, because TP53 (also termed tumor protein p53) is a DNA sequence-specific transcriptional regulator responsive to various forms of cellular stress and is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. Moreover, oxidative phosphorylation is the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial activity were also observed in pseudotime analysis, which were largely affected by DEHP. The <italic>in vitro</italic> study demonstrated that the oxidative stress-related gene <italic>Xdh</italic> (xanthine dehydrogenase) may serve as the downstream target of DEHP, whose reduction (through <italic>Xdh</italic> RNAi or melatonin supplement) can inhibit the increasing levels of ROS and mitigate the damage to PF assembly caused by DEHP <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>. Thus, DEHP, as one EDC member, might impair PF assembly through oxidative stress. In terms of molecular mechanisms, previous research suggests that ERs, particularly ER-beta, participate in the DEHP-mediated effect on ovarian tissue <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>. In addition, the alteration of DNA methylation and transgenerational actions by EDCs in germ cells has been well documented <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>-<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>. In fact, H3K4 mono-methylation was likely affected by DEHP in the present study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E). A recent study of<italic> Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> reports that DEHP exposure alters the expression of the reproduction-related gene <italic>spr-5</italic>, which encodes H3K4me2 demethylase <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>; however, a similar effect of DEHP on H3K4 mono-methylation in the mouse still needs to be studied.</p><p>The effect of DEHP on PG cells and its interaction with germ cells during PF formation was also explored. It is known that DEHP impairs the interaction of germ cells and PG cells via decreasing NOTCH2 signaling and impeding the proliferation of PG cells during PF assembly <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, which seemed to be evidenced, at least partially, by the enriched process of the regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity in the current study, as well as a positive regulation of the cell cycle in BPG. In addition, the death of both EPG and BPG cells was potentially affected by DEHP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>G-H). Previous research shows that DEHP exposure increases apoptosis of granulosa cells in adults, which leads to an increase in the number of atretic follicles <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>. Similarly, during the perinatal period, TUNEL tests previously suggested that DEHP exposure <italic>in vitro</italic> increases apoptosis in oocytes of neonatal ovaries <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, which is consistent with this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). Meanwhile, the components of the TGF-beta pathway in germ cells and PG cells were disturbed by DEHP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, right panel for PG cells). For instance, <italic>Gdf9</italic> on germ cells, and BMP receptors (<italic>Bmpr1a</italic> and<italic> Bmpr2</italic>) on PG cells, as well as targets (<italic>Id2</italic> and<italic> Id3</italic> on germ cells) and effectors (<italic>Smd2, Smd3</italic> and<italic> Smad4</italic> both on germ cells and PG cells), were all influenced by DEHP exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B-C). Furthermore, GDF9 protein level was more lowly expressed, whilst BMPR1A and SMAD3 were up more highly expressed following DEHP exposure. Growing evidence indicates that TGF-beta signaling is important in the regulation of cyst breakdown and PF assembly <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>. Despite some available connections between DEHP and TGF-beta signaling <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, DEHP toxicity mediated by TGF-beta signaling is still poorly understood, and needs to be further explored.</p><p>In conclusion, using scRNA-seq, the current study investigated the transcriptional dynamics of germ cells and PG cells following prenatal DEHP exposure during PF assembly. The results highlighted that DEHP impaired germline cyst breakdown and PF formation might be caused by oxidative stress in germ cells. Moreover, DNA damage and apoptosis were increased, as well as TGF-beta signaling being disturbed between both cell types. The current research presents a systematic understanding of DEHP damage on murine PF formation, and offers a preventive and therapeutic schedule for its biotoxicity in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals, reagents, and preparation for cell suspension</title><p>C57BL/6J strain mice, used only for single-cell sequencing, were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co.

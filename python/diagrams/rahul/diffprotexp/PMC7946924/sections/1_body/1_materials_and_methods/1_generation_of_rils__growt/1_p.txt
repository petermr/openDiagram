0: The recombinant inbred lines (RIL) of rice  Oryza sativa L .
1: used in this experiment were generated by cross breed of IR73963-86-1-5-2-2 and CR 2324-1 as parents and subsequent development of a mapping population.
2: Of the two cultivars, the first one was selected from a lot of tropical japonica derived NPT line, with high general combining ability, whereas the second was a potential aromatic culture from ICAR-National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), Cuttack.
3: Moderately large number of F2 population was generated from the cross and these lines were maintained using Single Seed Descent (SSD) up to F9 population.
4: At this population level RIL genotypes were selected for the study viz., CR 3856-62-11-3-1-1-1-1-11 (SR 157) and CR 3856-63-1-1-11-1-1-1 (SR 159) (Photo  1) with contrasting grain filling patterns, i.e., high percentage of spikelet fertility in the former and low fertility in the latter.
5: The RIL cultivars were grown in the irrigated field conditions of NRRI during the wet season of 2017 with recommended agronomic practices.

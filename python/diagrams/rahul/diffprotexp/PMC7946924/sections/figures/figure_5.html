 <caption> Differential gene expression (DGE) of miRNAs of apical and basal spikelets in V2 (SR-157) over V1 (SR-159) during post-anthesis (0, 5 and 10 days) using DESeq8 tool ( a). DGE of miRNAs of V2 (SR-157) over V1 (SR-159) based on read length showing UP-regulation or DOWN-regulation after anthesis on 0 day in apical spikelets ( b), 0 day in basal spikelets ( c), 5 days in apical spikelets ( d), 5 days in basal spikelets ( e), 10 days in apical spikelets ( f), 10 days in basal spikelets ( g). Heat map showing DGE analysis of selected miRNAs in apical and basal spikelets of V1 (SR-159) and V2 (SR-157) on days 0, 5 and 10 after anthesis. Here, Log 2 fold change of 1 was used as cut off, miRNAs &gt; 1 were considered “UP- (red colour code)” regulated, miRNAs &lt; -1 considered “DOWN- (green colour code)” regulated and those between 1 and  − 1 were considered as “NEUTRAL (black colour code)” ( h). </caption>

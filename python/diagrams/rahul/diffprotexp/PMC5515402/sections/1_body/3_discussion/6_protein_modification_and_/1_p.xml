<p>PEBP1 (RKIP), a protease inhibitor, and also a protein related to nucleotide binding [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], was found underexpressed after exposure to 17Î±-meT. PEBP1 has been associated with suppression of metastasis [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Specifically, reduced expression of PEBP1 is highly associated to metastatic cancers, such as prostate metaplasia. Therefore, although a physiological dose of DHT (10 nM) increased PEBP1 expression in prostate epithelial cells [

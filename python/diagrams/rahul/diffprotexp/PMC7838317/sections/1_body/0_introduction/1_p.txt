0: Freshwater mussels (family Unionidae) are among the most imperiled groups of animals in the world 1  3.
1: Over the past 200 years, these animals have suffered from habitat destruction and alteration such as river channelization and impoundment, overharvesting, pollution, invasive species, and the more recent enigmatic declines 4  7.
2: Approximately two thirds of the 300 species found in the United States and Canada are now classified as endangered, threatened, or vulnerable, and 10% have become extinct 6.
3: As numbers of freshwater mussels continue to decline, conservation efforts have increased in order to protect existing populations 6,  8.
4: Many of these efforts involve translocating mussels to other habitats or into captivity in propagation and research facilities.
5: In the United States, over a dozen federal and state facilities, zoos, and aquariums specialize in freshwater mussel propagation as recommended in species recovery and conservation plans 8,  9.

 <caption> Micrographs of the transition zone: ( a) shows the entire composite image detailing the changing microstructure in a depth of 4400 μm to 5300 μm from the surface. The first 200 μm are presented in Fig.  3d, with a noticeable overlap of ~20 μm with ( b), at 4700 μm depth, where untransformed pearlite becomes more pronounced. The amount of martensite is considerably decreasing towards ( c) with its last traces circled in ( d), at 5000 μm depth; the vast majority of the microstructure being the original ferritic-pearlitic structure signifies that Ac 1b was barely reached. At 5200 μm, shown in ( e), the microstructure consists entirely of pearlite and ferrite, being consistent with the unaustenitised base metal. </caption>

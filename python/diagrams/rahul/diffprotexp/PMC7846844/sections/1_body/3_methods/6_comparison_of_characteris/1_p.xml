<p id="Par22">We selected 45,788 "gene_biotype = protein_coding" transcripts from the pig's genome annotation file (SusScrofa 11.1) to define them as transcripts of protein coding genes. In addition, we use the "blastn" instruction to divide lincRNA into known lincRNA and novel lincRNA. We then identified and compared the transcript lengths, exon lengths, exon numbers, and FPKM averages for these three categories.</p>

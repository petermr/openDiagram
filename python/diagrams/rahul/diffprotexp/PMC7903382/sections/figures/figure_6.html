 <caption> RT-qPCR confirmation of mRNA and lncRNA expression from the microarray. (A) mRNA expression levels in spinal cord tissue of MIRI rats. (B) lncRNA expression levels in spinal cord tissue of MIRI rats. The expression of mRNAs and lncRNAs in the spinal cord of rats with MIRI was consistent with the results of transcriptome sequencing, indicating the reliability of the microarray data. lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; Frs3, fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 3; Zfp523, zinc finger protein 76; Dnajc6, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C6; Nedd4l, NEDD4 like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; Tep1, telomerase associated protein 1; Myef2, myelin expression factor 2; Tgfbr1, transforming growth factor Î² receptor 1; Fgf12, fibroblast growth factor 12; Mef2c, myocyte enhancer factor 2C; Tfdp1, transcription factor Dp-1; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; seq, sequencing; MIRI, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. </caption>

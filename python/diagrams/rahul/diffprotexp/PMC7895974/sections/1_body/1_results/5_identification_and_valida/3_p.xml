<p id="Par19">We identified two CREs upstream of 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). These sequences are chick specific and the fluorescent enhancer reporters showed spatially restricted activities. For the first element, 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-1 (1500 bp) we observed activity in the PSM, in all somites and in the notochord (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The second element, 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-2 (700 bp), showed activity mainly in PSM and somites, as well as some activity in LPM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, e</xref>). In situ hybridisation showed that expression of 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> was restricted to PSM and somites (Fig.

 </sup> and it is not clear at present why 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-1 and 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-2 drive ectopic reporter expression also in the notochord and LPM. To address the possibility that repressive elements that limit enhancer activity were missing, we combined 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-1 and 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-2. This reporter led to Citrine expression in PSM and LPM, however not in the notochord (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>) suggesting that the region comprising 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-2 may include elements that suppress ectopic expression in the notochord. It is possible that the TCF15 Enh-2 drives another gene in LPM cells, alternatively accumulation of Citrine in LPM may reveal sites of 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> expression that cannot be detected by in situ hybridisation. Time-lapse movies for 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> Enh-2 show Citrine fluorescence was first detected in a HH6 embryo in prospective paraxial mesoderm cells as they converge towards the midline (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5i</xref> and Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Strong signal was seen in the first somite at HH7 and subsequently in all newly formed somites, as well as the PSM and prospective paraxial mesoderm cells.

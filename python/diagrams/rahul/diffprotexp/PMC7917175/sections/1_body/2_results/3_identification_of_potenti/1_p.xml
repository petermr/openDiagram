<p id="Par45">Immunotyping can be used to mirror the immune status in tumors and their microenvironment, and thus help identify suitable patients for vaccination. Therefore, we analyzed the expression profiles of 1997 immune-related genes in 239 PAAD samples from ICGC database to construct consensus clustering. Based on their cumulative distribution function and function delta area, we chose k = 5 where immune-related genes appeared to be stably clustered

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and b
 <bold>)</bold>, and obtained 5 immune subtypes designated as IS1-IS5 
 <bold>(</bold>Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c
 <bold>)</bold>. IS1 and IS2 were associated with better prognosis, whereas IS3 had the poorest survival probability

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d
 <bold>)</bold>. Subtype distribution across different tumor stages and grades indicated that patients diagnosed as differential stage were irregularly clustered

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e
 <bold>)</bold>, whereas both grades 1 and 4 were significantly associated with IS1

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f
 <bold>)</bold>. Consistent with the results obtained with the ICGC cohort, the immune subtype was prognostically relevant in TCGA cohort as well

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g
 <bold>)</bold>, and significantly altered in different stages 
 <bold>(</bold>Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h
 <bold>)</bold>, as well as both grades 1 and 4 showed a great correlation with IS1 
 <bold>(</bold>Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i
 <bold>)</bold>. Taken together, the immunotyping can be used to predict prognosis of PAAD patients and its accuracy is superior to traditional grading and staging, which is consistent across different cohorts.

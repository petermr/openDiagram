<p>For potato, frost is the abiotic constraint that causes the most severe yield losses. However, there are several potato species, such as 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic>, that are able to cold acclimate and increase their frost tolerance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-14-04912">6</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> does not have a commercial value, this species has been studied for its resistance traits. The conservation of this and other potato species with low commercial value is thus important. The best method to date for the long-term conservation of vegetatively propagated plants is cryopreservation. Indeed, during cryopreservation, cell division, metabolic and biochemical processes are arrested, and thus, the plant material can be stored for a long period of time [

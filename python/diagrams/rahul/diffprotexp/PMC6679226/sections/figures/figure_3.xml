   <bold>B</bold>) Immunostaining of Cxcl15 on lung tissue sections. Cxcl15 was expressed by both the bronchial and type II alveolar epithelial cells (brown staining). The identity of the type II alveolar epithelial cells was confirmed by immunostaining with pro-surfactant protein C, a type II cell marker, on consecutive lung tissue sections (not shown); (
   <bold>C</bold>) Expression of Cxcl15 in BALF and lung tissues following I.P. saline (48 h) and I.P. LPS treatment at different time points (24, 48 and 72 h) by Western blotting.

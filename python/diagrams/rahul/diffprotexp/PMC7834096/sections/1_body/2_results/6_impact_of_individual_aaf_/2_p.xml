<p>Interestingly, EAEC strain 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <sup>−</sup> expressing AAF/I was not able to form biofilms at any tested temperature. AAF/IV-expressing EAEC strain 55989

 <sup>−</sup> produced the most biofilm at 37°C, followed by AAF/V- and AAF/III-expressing strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>, black bars). Biofilm formation by AAF/III and AAF/V was generally reduced at lower temperature (compare light gray bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>). Expression of AAF/IV fimbriae resulted in the highest levels of biofilm formation at all tested conditions.

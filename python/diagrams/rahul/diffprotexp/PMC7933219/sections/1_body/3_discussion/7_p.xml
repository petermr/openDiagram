<p>Meanwhile, the analysis of lncRNAs in this study is also of great significance. LncRNAs were previously considered to be “transcriptional noise” and thus have no biological function because they do not encode proteins. However, recent studies have shown that lncRNAs are widely involved in the regulation of gene expression and play a significant role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumor progression. Based on the analysis of the differential mRNA–lncRNA expression correlation network, we found several lncRNAs that may be closely related to the tumor–endothelium interaction. LncRNA n339695, n378130, and n410438 were upregulated lncRNAs in EC with TC interaction and ranked in the top 10 in the mRNA–lncRNA co-expression network.</p>

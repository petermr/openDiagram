<p>The most significantly differentially expressed genes between the different groups were identified using volcano plot and heatmap filtering (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003 f0004">Figures 3 and 4</xref>). Seven days and 15Â days after transplantation volcano plots and heat maps identified the genes Sirpb1a, Adam8, Spp1, and Mmp12 being the most significantly differentially upregulated genes and the genes Me1, Acaca, Elovl6, and Thrsp being most significantly downregulated when comparing both groups after transplantation to the group of the non-transplanted tissue (

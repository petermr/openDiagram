<p>Metaproteomics can also provide information on microbiome composition by quantifying biomass contributions of individual species. Since protein comprises the majority of cellular material in most microorganisms, proteins identified and quantified with metaproteomics can be used to estimate biomass of species if data are correctly analyzed [

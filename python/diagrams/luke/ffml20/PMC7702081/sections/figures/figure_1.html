 <caption> Water reorientation dynamics from ab initio MD trajectories and determination of hydration numbers of aqueous electrolytes. The procedure involves generating the time evolution of aqueous electrolyte solution using ab initio MD ( A), from which the water hydration status is determined using the position of H 2O in the radially varying spherical coordination shell of cations and anions ( B). The characteristic reorientation time ( τ reor) of each water subpopulation is computed from the bi‐exponential fit of the first‐order Legendre polynomial time correlation function of water dipole vectors ( C). The hydration number is determined as the number of water molecules, per dissolved salt units, that no longer participate in bulk‐like reorientation dynamics ( D). </caption>

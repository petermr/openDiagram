<p id="Par48">The comparative transcriptomic data presented in this investigation (Graphic summary depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) open new scenarios in understanding FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> mediate regulation of cell signaling, and illustrate: (i) that FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> can act to modulate important aGCT oncogenic pathways, including chromatin remodeling (SMARCA4, BAZ2A) and ECM regulation (HSPG2, COL4A2); (ii) the role of TGFB2, as upregulated effector and target gene in the aGCTs molecular occurrences; (iii) a potential molecular basis of emerging approaches targeting FOXO1 via AKT/PI3K pathway [

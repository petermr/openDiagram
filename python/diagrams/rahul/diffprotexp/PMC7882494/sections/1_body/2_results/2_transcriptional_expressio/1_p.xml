<p>The expression of COL11A1 in colon adenocarcinoma was analyzed based on the different clinicopathological parameters like sample type, individual cancer stage, patientâ€™s sex and age, histological subtype, nodal metastasis status, and TP53 mutation status using the UALCAN server (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The results support the inference depicted in the earlier section by demonstrating that COL11A1 expression is higher in the colorectal cancer tissue at different clinical stages than in normal tissue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). It tends to increase the expression of COL11A1 at advanced stages of cancer (Stage 3 &gt; Stage 2 &gt; Stage 1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and decrease along with the increase in the age group of patients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). It was also found that the expression of the COL11A1 gene increases along with the nodal metastasis status (N2 &gt; N1 &gt; N0) (

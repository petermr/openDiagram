0: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in hypertrophy and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and have been used as new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of heart failure [ 3, 4].
1: In recent years, there are rapidly growing attentions paid on a way of intercellular communication, namely microvesicle (MV) [ 5, 6].
2: Cells can produce little MVs under the normal physiological conditions, while the production of MVs is significantly increased under the pathophysiological conditions.
3: In 2007, Valadi has found that MV contains miRNA [ 7].
4: It has been found that a large number of the most basic processes of cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and death in physiological and pathological states are regulated by miRNAs [ 8].
5: The role of MV containing miRNA for intercellular communication has become a new research hotspot.
6: Moreover, MiRNA-21 (miR-21) has been shown to play an important regulatory role in the progression of chronic cardiac and renal diseases.
7: It is interesting to note that MVs containing miR-21 are significantly increased during myocardial hypertrophy, and most of MVs are contained in the fluid around the heart [ 9].
8: However, the origin of these MVs still remains largely unknown.
9: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-21-containing MVs from tubular epithelial cells in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with CKD.

<p>To assess the effect of STCH on NKCC2 biogenesis in OKP cells, we used again cycloheximide assay. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>D, STCH overexpression decreased the stability of immature NKCC2 protein which is in agreement with the data described above in HEK cells. Again, the decrease in immature NKCC2 stability in cells overexpressing STCH was associated with a striking alteration in the conversion of the immature to the mature protein form. STCH-induced decrease in the maturation efficiency of NKCC2 was accentuated during the chase period to reach âˆ’81% at 4 h (

 <bold>lower right panel</bold>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that, similar to HEK cells, STCH targets the immature form of NKCC2 to the ER associated degradation pathway in OKP cells, clearly indicating that STCH effects on the co-transporter expression are independent of the expression system. It is of great interest to note that, under identical experimental conditions, the overexpression of SCAMP2 or aldolase B, two others NKCC2 binding partner, had no effect on total NKCC2 protein abundance in OKP cells [

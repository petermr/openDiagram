<p>Hemocyte proteins with significantly different expression patterns were categorized into the following functional groups: 1) enzymatic activity, 2) immune response, 3) structural and motor, 4) oxidoreductase, 5) transport, 6) miscellaneous and 7) unknown, and plotted in a hierarchical clustered heatmap (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005104.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The highest number of proteins with a significantly differential expression pattern was found at 48 hpi (86 proteins), followed by 24 hpi (79 proteins). Interestingly, the expression of only 28 proteins was significantly regulated at 96 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005104.s008">S2 Fig</xref>). The majority of proteins assigned to immune response had an up-regulated expression pattern, particularly proteins related to hemocyanin, while proteins belonging to the structural and motor group were mostly down-regulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005104.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of several proteins assigned to enzymatic and oxidoreductase activity was up-regulated at 24 hpi but down-regulated at 48 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005104.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Similarly, plasma proteins with a significantly regulated expression profile were grouped into the same annotation categories and clustered into a heatmap (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005104.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The highest number of proteins with a significantly different expression pattern was found at 24 hpi (73 proteins), followed by 48 hpi (63 proteins) and 96 hpi (54 proteins), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005104.s008">S2 Fig</xref>). The expression of proteins with an immune response profile and structural and motor proteins was generally up-regulated in the plasma of infected snails, whereas the expression of proteins with an enzymatic activity was significantly down-regulated after

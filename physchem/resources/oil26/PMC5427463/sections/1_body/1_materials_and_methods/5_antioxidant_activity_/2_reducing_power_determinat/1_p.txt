0: The reducing power of SoEO was determined on the basis of the method of Oyaizu (1986[ 39]).
1: 500 L of different concentrations of SoEO (1 to 20 mg/mL) were added to 1.25 mL of phosphate buffer (200 M, pH 6.6) and 1.25 mL of potassium hexacyanoferrate [K 3Fe (CN) 6] (10 %).
2: After 20 min at 50 C, trichloroacetic acid (1.25 mL, 10 %) was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000   g for 10 minutes.
3: Finally, 1.25 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 1.25 mL of distilled water and 0.25 mL of ferric chloride [FeCl 3] (0.1 %).
4: A blank was prepared under the same conditions.
5: BHT was used as the positive control and reading was measured at 700 nm.
6: The experiment was done in triplicate and repeated twice.

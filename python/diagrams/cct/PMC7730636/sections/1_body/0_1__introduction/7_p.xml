<p>The first goal of this paper is to investigate phase transformations of AISI 4340 high strength steel depending on the different cooling conditions. Subsequently, the creation of a CCT diagram for a given steel based on the achieved experimental data. The second goal is to investigate the deformation behavior of the steel at high temperatures and then to create corresponding True Stressâ€“True Strain diagrams and investigate the relation between deformation parameters and deformation resistance. The contribution of the work is a complex evaluation of the investigated material AISI4340 from the point of view of thermo-mechanical processing and determination of the influence of selected parameters on the change of the experimental material structure in the monitored processes. It is also beneficial to create a corrected constitutive model in terms of friction during compression.</p>

<p id="Par43">Among these downregulated mitochondrial proteins, the heat shock 70-kDa protein 1-like, malate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase, and stomatin-like 2 proteins are located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, while the peroxiredoxin 5 and 60-kDa heat shock proteins are located in the mitochondrial matrix. HSPA1L indirectly affects body metabolism and biological function by regulating iron-sulfur protein maturation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; ATP synthase is involved in energy production and permeability transition pores (PTP, key players in cell death); stomatin-like protein 2 is involved in T cell activation, calcium homeostasis, and the stress response [

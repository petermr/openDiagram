0: Skin fibroblasts from patients with PD with  GBA and  PARK2 variants as well as from healthy subjects were grown in three independent passages, and all fibroblast passages were harvested as pelleted cells and stored at -80 C. After thawing, the packed fibroblasts were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA), and were sonicated 3-4 times at 0.3 cycle and 30% amplitude, and then incubated at 4 C for 30 min.
1: The cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 x g at 4 C for 10 min.
2: The protein concentrations of fibroblast lysates were determined using a Bradford protein assay.
3: After protein determination, equal quantities of protein (10 g) from each cell passage were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate using a Micro Bio-Spin Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc).

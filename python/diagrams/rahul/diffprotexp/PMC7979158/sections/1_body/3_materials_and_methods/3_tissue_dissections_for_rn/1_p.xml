<p>Dissections of dorsal telencephalon/pallium or developing cortex were performed at E12.5 + 6 hr, E14.5, E17.5, and P0 from control (saline) and poly(I:C)-exposed MIA litters. At E12.5, due to the smaller embryo size, dissections were made via a diagonal cut that maximized collection of dorsal telencephalon, but could have also included some subpallium/ventral telencephalon and superficial tissues. For later time-points, dissection was of pallium/developing cortex. Potential variance in the individual dissections should be mitigated by the inclusion of multiple replicates across both groups. Dissections included both hemispheres from males and females, with exact numbers and sample details reported in

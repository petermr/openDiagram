0: The full-length cDNAs of the recovery gene  Rfp and the sterility gene  orf224 were amplified and cloned into the bait vector pGBKT7, while the candidate genes were cloned into the prey vector pGADT7, respectively.
1: The vectors constructed by bait vector pGBKT7 and prey vector pGADT7 were then co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 receptor cells [ 64].

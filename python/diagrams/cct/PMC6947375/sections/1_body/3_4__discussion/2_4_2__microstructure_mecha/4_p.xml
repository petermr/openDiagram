<p>During the tensile test, microcracks nucleated at the interfaces between the coarse cementite and the ferritic matrix. With the propagation of deformation, the microcracks aggregated to form microvoids. A few microvoids were related to the fallen off of undissolved cementite particles. Furthermore, the dissolution of partial cementite particles during cold deformation increased carbon content in the ferritic matrix and thus increased the strength of ferrite. As a result, the interfacial strength of some ferrite-cementite was lower than that of the ferritic matrix. The coarsening of cementite particles increased the stress concentration at the interface between the ferritic matrix and cementite during deformation, resulting in an increasing tendency of microcrack nucleation. It has been shown that during the cold rolling of the spheroidized bearing steel, microcracks nucleate at the interfaces between the larger cementite particles and the ferritic matrix [

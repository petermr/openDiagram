 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Mittleman et al., 2020</xref> . to extract whole-cell and nuclear mRNA. Briefly, we collected 30 million cells in two 15 million cell aliquots. We extracted nuclei from one aliquot per line using the nuclear isolation protocol outlined by 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Mayer and Churchman, 2016</xref>. We extracted mRNA in two fraction- and species-matched batches, using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions, including the DNase step to remove genomic DNA. We quantified mRNA and tested quality using a nanodrop. Details of mRNA processing for each line, including concentrations and quality, can be found in

0: MDA-MB-231 cells in logarithmic growth phase were inoculated into 6-well plates at 5  104 cells/well.
1: After 12 h of culturing, POLD1 over-expressing recombinant lentivirus (pCMV-EGFP-POLD1) was added.
2: In addition, a control group and no-load negative control group without viruses were established, and 2 ug/L virus enhancement solution was added at the same time.
3: After 12 h, the medium was changed to a fresh complete medium, and following 72 h, puromycin (2 mg/L) was added for screening.
4: After 1 week, the concentration of puromycin was observed to be reduced by half, and the screening was continued for 1 week.
5: MDA-MB-231/POLD1- Overexpression (OE) and MDA-MB-231/POLD1- Normal control (NC) cell lines were obtained for the subsequent experiments.
6: Transfection efficiency was determined by fluorescence, WB and qPT-PCR.

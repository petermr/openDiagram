<p>The networking analysis suggested five genes, namely, 
 <italic>PF4</italic>, 
 <italic>PPBP</italic>, 
 <italic>ITGA2B</italic>, 
 <italic>FERMT3</italic> and 
 <italic>SELP</italic>, as the central hub nodes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01399-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The platelet factor 4 (
 <italic>PF4</italic>) is an endocrine factor with overexpression, associated with low survival of patients with lung cancer [
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The Pro-Platelet Basic Protein (
 <italic>PPBP</italic>) is a member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines. 
 <italic>PPBP</italic> was reported as an enhancer of the invasive ability of breast cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Integrin alpha 2b (
 <italic>ITGA2B</italic>) is a member of the integrin family that regulates a diverse set of cellular processes and is crucial to the initiation, progression and metastasis of solid tumors, including breast cancer. The over-expression of 
 <italic>ITGA2B</italic> promotes proliferation and invasion in breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The 
 <italic>FERMT3</italic> gene encodes a protein involved in integrin activation. 
 <italic>FERMT3</italic> is known to enhance breast cancer progression and metastasis [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Selectin-P (
 <italic>SELP</italic>) was found to be important in organ-specific metastatic dissemination of breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

<p>Next, to confirm that BLF blocks viral attachment to target cells, a viral attachment assay was carried out in the presence of different combinations of LF and/or heparin, and the attached HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-NL63 on the surface of RD cells or Vero E6 cells were quantified by immunofluorescence staining (

 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(B,C)</xref>). Fluorescent signals were detected on the surface of RD cells that were treated with H
 <sub>2</sub>O control (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(A)</xref>, #1), indicating the binding of HCoV-OC43 virus to the host cell surface. BLF-treated samples showed dose-dependent decrease of fluorescent signals on the cell surface (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(A)</xref>, #2–#3), suggesting BLF inhibited viral attachment. Heparin treatment alone had no significant effect on viral attachment (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(A)</xref>, #4–#5) as shown by the immunofluorescence intensity. In contrast, pretreatment of BLF with heparin before adding the mixture to the viral attachment assay abolished the inhibition of viral attachment as the fluorescence signals were restored (19% at 10 µg/ml and 86% at 30 µg/ml of heparin) (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(A)</xref>, #6–#7). No specific antibody against HCoV-NL63 was available, so the immunofluorescence assay was not performed for HCoV-NL63. Instead, we quantified the amount of cell surface-attached viruses by RT-qPCR. Both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 viral RNA levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner with BLF treatment alone: ∼15% and ∼5% of HCoV-OC43 viral RNA were detected with 500 and 1000 µg/ml BLF treatment; ∼0.5% and ∼0% of HCoV-NL63 viral RNA were detected with 500 and 1000 µg/ml BLF treatment (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(B,C)</xref>). Heparin itself had no obvious effect on viral RNA levels at the indicated concentrations (10 and 30 µg/ml) (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(B,C)</xref>). However, BLF lost partial potency in the presence of 10 or 30 µg/ml heparin: ∼45% or ∼75% of HCoV-OC43 viral RNA and ∼25% or 60% HCoV-NL63 viral RNA were detected under these conditions (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6(B,C)</xref>). Collectively, the results suggest that BLF interferes viral attachment through its interaction with cell surface HSPGs.

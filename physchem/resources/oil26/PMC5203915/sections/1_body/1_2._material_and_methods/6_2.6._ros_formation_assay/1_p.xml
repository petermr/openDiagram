<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were evaluated using 2&#8242;,7&#8242;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA). The procedure was performed according to the previous study [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The astrocytes were seeded in 96-well plate, incubated only with LPS (1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) or stimulated with LPS (1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL), and treated with HR and SGR essential oils (100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) for 24 hours. Then, the cells were lysed, centrifuged at 10,000&#8201;&#215;g for 10&#8201;min, and incubated with 5&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>M H<sub>2</sub>DCF-DA at 37&#176;C for 30&#8201;min. ROS fluorescence (DCF) was measured in microplate reader with excitation at 485&#8201;nm and emission at 520&#8201;nm. The experiments were repeated three times.</p>

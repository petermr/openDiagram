 <p>5) Variation in APA and differences in protein expression â€“ This section of the manuscript compares the APA data with published data of protein translation and expression in human and chimpanzee. While the enrichments and correlations reported in the first 2 paragraphs (and Figure 5) are of potential interest, the protein data are limited to a few thousand genes. How many of these genes can also be annotated in the APA data generated in this study? In other words, without the actual number of overlaps, it is difficult to assess whether the reported results are robust and widespread as opposed to limited to a few hundred genes. What are these genes functions? What can we learn about the evolution of human and chimpanzee-specific traits? Are these genes expected to show differential regulation between species? For the correlation analysis that considers intronic and 3'UTR PAS locations, please see my comment to the similar analysis done for differentially expressed genes. I recommend using Spearman's correlation and a logistic model.</p>

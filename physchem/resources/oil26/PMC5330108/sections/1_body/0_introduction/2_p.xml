Essential oils and their principle compounds, such as menthol, eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, carvacrol, terpineol, and citral, have been considered to be effective against many filamentous fungi. The several studies on essential oils cinnamon, citral, <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, clove, eucalyptus, anise, peppermint, spearmint, and camphor oils show inhibitory activity against pathogenic microorganisms. cinnamon essential oil showed potent antifungal activity against mycotoxigenic fungi <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] citral, octanal, and a-terpineol volatile oils against <italic>Geotrichum citri-aurantii</italic>[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and clove and Cinnamon oils were found to be effective against <italic>A. flavus</italic> which is responsible for aflatoxin production in maize under favorable conditions.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Growth inhibition and morphological alterations of <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> and inhibition of fumonisin B1 by <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L., cinnamon essential oil reported by Xing <italic>et al</italic>., 2014,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Yamamoto-Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2013[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] da Silva Bomfim <italic>et al</italic>., 2015.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p>

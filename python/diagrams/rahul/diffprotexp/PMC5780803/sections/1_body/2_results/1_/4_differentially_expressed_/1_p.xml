<p>In order to further understand the role of XIAP in cell death and to screen for currently unknown biological behaviors of XIAP, the differentially expressed proteins were dynamically analyzed at 0, 0.5, 3 and 12 h. At the 12-h stage of apoptosis, no differential proteins were observed (under the conditions of a ratio &gt;1.5 or &lt;0.5; P&lt;0.05). Therefore, the focus was on the early stage of apoptosis between 0 and 3 h. As demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>, the ratio (Caki-1/shRNA-XIAP-1) of 22 proteins was significantly altered at 0, 0.5 and 3 h in response to etoposide treatment. Subsequently, 22 differentially expressed proteins associated with XIAP were classified using the Protein Analysis through Evolutionary Relationships classification system (
 <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.pantherdb.org</uri>) to obtain a better understanding of their molecular and functional characteristics. The results revealed the distribution of differentially expressed proteins in pathways, biological processes and molecular functions (

These results indicate that the differentially expressed proteins are involved in a number of pathways and biological processes, suggesting that XIAP has a number of potential physiological functions. The relevant literature and the existing data were then combined to screen out the biological behaviors associated with the onset and progression of cancer. In general, differentially expressed proteins were implicated in the p53 pathway, cytoskeletal regulation, histone regulation, the Wnt signaling pathway, glucose metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Representative MS/MS spectra of select peptides with their reporter ions are presented as the 6 proteins, reticulocalbin 3 (RCN3), lactate dehydrogenase A, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH), histone H3.3, S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) and collagen, type 1, Î±-1 (COL1A1) (

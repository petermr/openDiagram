<p>Search results of this data was downloaded from ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD006122 associated with a previous study (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The mean intensity of two internal references (TMT tag 126 and 131) was used as denominator to calculate peptide ratios, the median of peptide ratios was taken as protein ratios. Protein ratios were then log2 transformed. PSMs and proteins were filtered at 1% PSMs and protein level FDR. The minimum number of quantified PSMs across multiple TMT sets was used in DEqMS. The cohort included samples from 8 Parkinson's disease dementia patients, 7 dementia with Lewy bodies patients, 9 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 8 elderly non-neurological controls.

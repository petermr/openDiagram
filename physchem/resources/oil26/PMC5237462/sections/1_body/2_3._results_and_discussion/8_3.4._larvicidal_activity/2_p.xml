Some studies detect the effects of the chemical composition of monoterpenes, as well as, some sesquiterpenes, which serve as repellents at toxicity significant to insects but negligible toxicity to mammals. Mixtures of these volatile low molecular weight compounds provide plants, such as<italic> Mentha piperita</italic>,<italic> Citrus limon</italic>,<italic> Ocimum basilicum</italic>, and<italic> Salvia officinalis,</italic> with their distinctive odor, which are commercially available, produced, and important ingredients for fragrance and flavor creation because of their specific sensory characteristics [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>

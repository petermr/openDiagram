 <caption>
  <p>Replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 deletion variants on BGM and CaLu-3 cell lines. SARS-CoV-2 variants were inoculated on confluent BGM and CaLu-3 cells at an MOI of 10
   <sup>−3</sup> and then incubated at 36°C with 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> for 7 days. Supernatant samples were collected at regular intervals, for which viral particle quantification was performed by qRT-PCR. Each data point is the average of three replicates, with standard deviation as error bars. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons between both factors of comparison (virus variant and cell line) on GraphPad Prism (software version 8.4.3).

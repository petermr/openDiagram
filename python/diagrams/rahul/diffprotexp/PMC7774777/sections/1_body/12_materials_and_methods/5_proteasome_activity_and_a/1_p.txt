0: Proteasome activity was assessed as has been described ( 2).
1: Ten micrograms of protein lysate was added to proteasome activity assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) along with (Ac-RLR-AMC) (Boston Biochem, cat.
2: no.
3: s290) fluorogenic proteasome substrate.
4: Reactions were allowed to incubate at 37C protected from light for 3 hours.
5: Following incubation, samples were transferred to black walled 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, cat No.
6: 655097).
7: Release of free 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin was determined using a SpectraMax M5e microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation at 380 nm and emission recorded at 460 nm.
8: Reported values are the fold increase over a no-protein control that was incubated along with every experiment.

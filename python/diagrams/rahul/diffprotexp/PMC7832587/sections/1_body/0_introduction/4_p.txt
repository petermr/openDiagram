0: ATP2 and the rest of  Plasmodium-encoded P4-ATPases still remain as putative transporters waiting for functional annotation.
1: In addition, and despite the importance of the P4-ATPase/Cdc50 association, to date, the identity of the Cdc50-interacting partners of ATP2 have not been revealed, neither in the parasite nor  in vitro using recombinant proteins.
2: Moreover, the biological role of such possible association is still unknown.
3: Here, using recombinantly-produced proteins, we demonstrate that the  Plasmodium chabaudi ATP2 (PcATP2) forms heterodimers with two of the three  Plasmodium-encoded Cdc50 proteins: PcCdc50B and PcCdc50A.
4: Moreover, PcATP2/PcCdc50B displayed lipid-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of two putative phospholipid substrates, and this activity was slighly upregulated by the presence of PI4P.
5: We provide the first study of the function and structural organization of a  Plasmodium lipid flippase, an emerging antimalarial target candidate.

0: For reverse transcription, oligodeoxythymide (0.5 g) and total RNA (2 g) were mixed in a total volume of 5 L, and incubated at 70 C for 10 min, then cooled at 4 C for 2 min.
1: 1 L single strand buffer, 0.5 L each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.5 g oligo-deoxythymidine, and 100U moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were then added to the reaction mix in a total volume of 10L.
2: Reverse transcription (RT) was performed at 42 C for 90 min.
3: The total reaction mix containing the first-strand cDNA was diluted ten times by the addition of 90 L Milli-Q water and stored  20 C freezer for downstream application.

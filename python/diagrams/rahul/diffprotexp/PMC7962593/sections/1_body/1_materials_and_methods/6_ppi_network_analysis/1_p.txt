0: The common genes were analyzed using the online tool STRING ( https://string-db.org), and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network based on the criterion of a combined score > 900 was constructed and displayed using Cytoscape software.
1: Genes were ranked based on their degree of connectivity with other genes.
2: The pROC package in R 25 was used to calculate the the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the top 100 genes showing the greatest connectivity in the PPI network.

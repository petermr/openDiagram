<p>Protein bands corresponding to the molecular weights of differentially expressed proteins of interest were excised and the proteins in the gel plugs were treated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide to reduce any disulfide bonds and alkylate the resulting thiol groups. The proteins were digested with trypsin and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing with a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer at the Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University. The resulting peak list files were used to interrogate the indexed IPI mouse database with the Mascot algorithm. The list of identified proteins is given in TableÂ 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and is dominated by components of the electron transport chain including cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6b1 (COX6b1), subunit 6C (COX6C), and subunit 4 (COX4i1); NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 3 (Ndufv3), alpha subcomplex subunit 2 (Ndufa2), Fe-S protein 4 (Ndufs4), and Fe-S protein 6 (Ndufs6); and ATP synthase subunit e (Atp5k); as well as myelin basic protein isoforms. Other proteins include ubiquitin A-52 protein (Uba52), a protein involved in ion homeostasis; CPN10-like protein Hspe-rs1 (Cpn10-rs1), which is a member of the GroES chaperonin family; beta2 microglobulin (B2m); cofilin 1 (Cfl1); V-type proton ATPase subunit G2 (Atp6v1g2), a vacuolar ATPase which mediates the acidification of intracellular compartments; basic transcription factor 3 (btf3) and the 40S ribosomal protein S13 (Rps13). Because the protein bands in fraction Q3 each consist of a single identified protein, the identity of the differentially expressed proteins as myelin basic protein (MBP) isoforms is unambiguous. However, we have not confirmed which of the other proteins identified in gel bands represents the differentially expressed protein peaks observed in SELDI mass spectra. Recent studies have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible mechanism in the development of neuropathology in MS (13, 14, 21, 22, 31, and 58) and increased levels of nitration among proteins of the electron transport chain result in reduced mitochondrial activity in EAE [

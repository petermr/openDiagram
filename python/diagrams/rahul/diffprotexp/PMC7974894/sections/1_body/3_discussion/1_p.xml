<p>The abnormal expression of RBPs have been reported in various malignant tumor, and their expression correlates with patient prognosis 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. However, RBPs have not been thoroughly and systematically studied in tongue cancer. Global analysis of the functional impact of RBPs will provide new insights into tongue tumor therapy. In the present study, we identified 962 differently expressed RBPs between tumor and normal tissues based on TCGA retrieved tongue datasets. We systematically analyzed relevant biological pathways of these RBPs. By co-considering the WGNA results, we obtained tongue cancer highly correlated hub RBPs from the constructed co-expression network and PPI network. Moreover, we also performed univariate cox regression analysis, survival analyses, multiple stepwise cox regression analysis, and ROC analyses of the hub RBPs to further explore their biological functions and clinical significance. In addition, we constructed a risk model to predict tongue cancer prognosis based on the prognostic hub RBP genes. These findings may shed new light on developing novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with tongue cancer.

<p>Nitrification is widely used in organic reactions. In 1834, benzene was nitrated into nitrobenzene [

 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nitro is the energetic functional group of most explosives. In the energetic materials, the nitro group connects with a carbon atom like in 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), attaches to oxygen atom like in nitrocellulose and links with nitrogen atom like in cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine. The direct nitrification of graphene is hard to realize. The nitrification reagent is an overly strong oxidation agent that would produce oxygenated groups on GO instead of being attached as NO
 <sub>2</sub> group. The reagent after oxidation reaction is unable to nitrate GO afterward. Therefore, modification of GO to prepare nitrated graphene oxide (NGO) is a facile approach to make GO more energetic. NGO is a promising energetic additive in explosive systems. It can activate the reaction of the energetic system, lower the critical threshold, and release heat more quickly. Zhang [

 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] added NGO into energetic materials as catalysis with the decrease in the thermal decomposition temperature. Nevertheless, the mass content of nitrogen in NGO is only 1.45%, which prohibits energetic behavior. Thus, the research of the nitrification process is of great significance for increasing the nitro content of NGO. The analysis of hydrophilic properties, thermal stability and combustion performance could explore the application prospect of NGO as an energetic addictive.

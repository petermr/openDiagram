  <p>Neuropathological hallmarks in VD. Oligomeric proteins were determined in 
   <italic>post-mortem</italic> human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of VD patients and controls. The levels of Aβ oligomers were determined in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) SNpc; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Hippocampus and (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Densitometric analysis of the levels of Aβ oligomers. The levels of SNCA oligomers were determined in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) SNpc; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Hippocampus and (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Densitometric analysis of the levels of SNCA oligomers. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5, *p &lt; 0.05, versus SNpc control subjects).

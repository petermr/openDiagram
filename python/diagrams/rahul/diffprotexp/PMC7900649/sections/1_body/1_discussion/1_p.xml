<p id="Par30">PEDV is one of the pathogens that threatens the global swine industry. Although the pathogenicity of the virus was studied extensively, little is known about the mechanism of the virus–host interaction. Several studies tried to investigate it using proteomics analysis of Vero E6 cells infected with PEDV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, the global dynamic regulation of PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells at the transcriptional level has been analyzed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since the regulation of host genes after PEDV infection is a dynamic and complicated process, various types of transcript regulation, including alteration of mRNA quantity and alternative polyadenylation, are involved. In this study, IPEC-J2 cells were used to study the dynamic regulation after PEDV variant strain GDS01 infection. High-throughput-based IVT-SAPAS technology was applied and the differentially expressed genes were profiled.

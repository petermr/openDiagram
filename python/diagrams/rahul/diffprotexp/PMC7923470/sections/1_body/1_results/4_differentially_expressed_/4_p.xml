<p id="Par42">In terms of the role of auxin in BR synthesis and signaling, as well as hypocotyl elongation, the expression of two genes (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb10t21290</italic> and 
 <italic>Ma10_g08300</italic>) was relatively increased in MT suggesting a role of auxin in banana pseudostem elongation. One of the exclusively expressed genes in WT was BIG GRAIN 1-like, which is known to be involved in auxin transport [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The expression of a HB-HD-ZIP TF (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb09t13640</italic>) was increased in MT. Our transcriptome data showed that two genes (
 <italic>Ma06_g03830</italic> and 
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb08t08250</italic>) belonging to ABC transporter G and C families, respectively, were up-regulated in MT suggesting the involvement of polar auxin transport in stem elongation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

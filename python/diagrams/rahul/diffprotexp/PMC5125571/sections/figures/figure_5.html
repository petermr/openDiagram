 <caption> Clustered heatmap of proteins with a significantly regulated expression profile in the plasma of Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos snails after infection with Opisthorchis viverrini. The relative expression of plasma proteins at 24, 48 and 96 hpi of infected snails were compared against the control group (uninfected snails). Proteins were grouped into 7 different categories based on GO annotation and clustering was performed using Euclidean distances based on the expression patterns. Color intensity reflects the corresponding log 2 fold change and significant up-regulation shown in red, significant down-regulation is shown in blue, and no statistically significant change in abundance is shown in gray. </caption>

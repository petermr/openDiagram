<p id="Par10">The functions of DELs were further explored by performing QTL mapping analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) after the prediction of the target genes of DELs. The results indicated that approximately 37% of QTLs are associated with muscle growth and development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). We calculated the chromosome distribution of QTLs associated with muscle development were mainly distributed on chromosomes 4 and 6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Interestingly, the top 10 QTLs were associated with muscle development, and were mainly concentrated on the average back fat thickness QTL, waist muscle area QTL and body weight QTL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). This result speculates that the potential function of DELs may be related to muscle growth and development.

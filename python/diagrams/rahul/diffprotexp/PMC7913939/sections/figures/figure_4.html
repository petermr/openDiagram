 <caption> ( A– C). Differential mRNA expression of MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 in the hippocampus of WT and Prnp −/− mice. Quantification of the mRNA expression revealed a lower MCT4 expression in the hippocampus of the Prnp −/− experimental group than in control group, while at the same time levels of MCT1 and MCT2 were unaltered. Sample size of WT group: n = 5; Prnp −/− group: n = 6. Displayed are means ± SEM. A p-value &lt; 0.05 is considered as significant (*) and ≥0.05 as not significant (ns). </caption>

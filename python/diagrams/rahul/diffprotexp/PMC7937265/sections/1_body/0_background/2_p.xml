<p id="Par30">The enduring effects of perinatal experiences on gene expression can often be linked to epigenetic gene regulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. DNA methylation, for example, acts by adding methyl groups to cytosines at CpG dinucleotides, which can suppress gene expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Methylation patterns are established in early development and may be one way for hormone-induced changes to last into adulthood
 <italic>.</italic> Examples of this are evident in the methylation patterns produced by steroid-mediated sex differentiation in mammals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and fetal exposure to endocrine disrupters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus far, candidate-gene analyses suggest that variation in the maternal environment can result in altered DNA methylation patterns in juvenile birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the proposed mechanism, starting with prenatal T and leading to long-term phenotypic changes in adults, along with the potential intervening transcriptomic/epigenomic steps, has yet to be tested.

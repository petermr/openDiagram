<p>Prognostic capabilities of gene clusters were quantified through log-rank p-values and visualized by Kaplan–Meier curves (

These analyses were carried out utilizing TCGA clinical datasets (see Materials and Methods section). Gene clusters were significantly predictive in terms of patient survival risk assessment for the respective subtype (

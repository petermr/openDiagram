0: A previous study has shown the role of  bZIP StABF1 in inducing tolerance to salt, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) stress in potatoes [ 28].
1: However, a detailed identification and characterization of the  StbZIP gene family in response to abiotic and hormonal stress in potato is lacking.
2: A thorough study of the gene expression pattern of  StbZIPs under various stress conditions in the potato will help us to understand stress regulatory mechanisms.
3: Here, we identified members of the  StbZIP gene family using computational approaches, and the subfamily classification was performed based on prior annotations in  Arabidopsis [ 10].
4: The distribution and conserved domain analysis of the  StbZIP family were studied and validated using proteome sequence data and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data available in the public domain.
5: Based on this information, a few candidate  StbZIPs that are expressed under various stress conditions were identified.
6: This research will be valuable in further functional validation of the  StbZIPs and developing stress-tolerant elite varieties either using trans/cis-genic route or via molecular breeding programs.

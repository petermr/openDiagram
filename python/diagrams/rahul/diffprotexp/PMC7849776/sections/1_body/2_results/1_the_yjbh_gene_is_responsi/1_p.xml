<p>Recently, we identified 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tn to have reduced pathogenicity, pigment, and protease productions [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We also reported that the introduction of the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> gene did not restore pathogenicity in 
 <italic>yjbI</italic>::Tn, while the introduction of the operon consisting of the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> gene and the downstream gene 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(a</xref>)) restored the pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This result, together with a previous report where survival of Î”
 <italic>yjbH</italic> in whole blood assay was reduced [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], indicated that YjbH might have roles in pathogenicity. Therefore, we examined the role of the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene in pathogenicity to silkworms. We observed that the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn mutant had reduced silkworms-killing ability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(b</xref>)), and the pathogenicity to silkworms was restored when the 
 <italic>yjbIH</italic> operon or only the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene were introduced to 
 <italic>yjb</italic>
 <italic>H</italic>::Tn and 
 <italic>yjb</italic>
 <italic>I</italic>::Tn (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(b,c)</xref>).

 <caption> (a, b) Potential-dependent changes in the local structure of dendrimer-encapsulated Pt NPs immobilized on a carbon-paper electrode under ORR conditions in a 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte saturated either with N 2 or O 2. (a) Fourier transformed Pt L 3-edge EXAFS spectra. (b) Corresponding changes in the Pt–Pt ( C Pt–Pt) and Pt–O ( C Pt–O) coordination numbers in O 2 and N 2-saturated electrolyte. Reproduced with permission from ref ( 285). Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society. (c, d) Bond expansion under ORR conditions. (c) Minimum and maximum surface bond expansion in Pt NPs under ORR conditions as obtained from in situ EXAFS data analysis. The differences between Pt–Pt distances, measured in O 2 and N 2-saturated electrolyte are shown. The structure model of Pt NPs obtained from EXAFS-yielded CNs is shown in the inset. (d) Relative expansion of the interatomic distances obtained within the maximum surface bond expansion (surface-restricted expansion) model is compared with the in situ cantilever stress measurements.

<p>The retained austenite morphology in FGHAZ by TEM is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f009">Figure 9</xref>. The retained austenite was found along the martensite lath, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f009">Figure 9</xref>a. In the bright field micrograph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f009">Figure 9</xref>b), the retained austenite was found to be film-like, and thickness was around ~150 nm. The retained austenite is demonstrated by the field micrograph in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f009">Figure 9</xref>c and the diffraction pattern in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f009">Figure 9</xref>d. By using EDS line-scan, the concentration of Mn in retained austenite was measured and there was ~1.8 enrichment factor of Mn found in retained austenite, which is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f010">Figure 10</xref>.

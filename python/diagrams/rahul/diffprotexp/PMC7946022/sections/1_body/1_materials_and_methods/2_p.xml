 <bold>Strains and growth conditions</bold>. The 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> wild-type strain SC5314 [
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and the methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strain (USA300 LAC) were used in this study. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> mutant derivatives of the reference WT strain defective in cell autolysis regulation (∆lrgA and ∆lrgB) were obtained from the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (University of Nebraska, NE). 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was grown on yeast peptone dextrose broth (YPD) (Difco Laboratories) overnight at 30°C and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cultures were grown overnight in trypticase soy broth (TSB) (Difco) at 37°C. Cells were washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and resuspended in RPMI 1640-HEPES (Invitrogen) media to final cell density needed.

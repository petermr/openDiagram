0: Mouse spleens were aseptically removed from animals in each group, washed, and ground in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and filtered to form single-cell suspensions.
1: Erythrocytes were subsequently removed using a red blood cell lysis buffer.
2: Then, cell suspension was centrifugated for 5 min at 300 g. Supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended.
3: After cell count and viability check cells were centrifugated.
4: Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of 1  106 cells/mL.
5: To analyze the percentages of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, cultures were stimulated for 6 h with leukocyte activation cocktail (BD Pharmingen, USA, #550,583) at 5% CO2, 37C in a 24-well culture plate.
6: Cells were harvested and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA, #553,046).
7: After washing, fixing, and permeabilizing, cells were stained with PerCP-Cyanine5.5-conjugated anti-mouse IFN- antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA, #560,660), APC-conjugated anti-mouse IL-4 antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA, #554,436), and PE-conjugated anti-mouse/rat IL-17A antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA, #560,436).
8: For Treg cells, suspended unstimulated CD4 + T cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 antibody, APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD25 antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA, #561,048), and PE-conjugated anti-mouse/rat Foxp3 antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA, #560,414).
9: Isotype controls were utilized to enable correct compensation and confirm antibody specificity.
10: The isotype controls we used are as followed: PerCP-CyTM5.5 Rat IgG1,  Isotype Control (BD Pharmingen, USA, #554,436), PE Rat IgG1,  Isotype Control (BD Pharmingen, USA, #554,685), and APC Rat IgG1,  Isotype Control (BD Pharmingen, USA, #554,686).
11: Cells were measured on a BD FACS-Canto TM II flow cytometer, and data were analyzed with FlowJo software.

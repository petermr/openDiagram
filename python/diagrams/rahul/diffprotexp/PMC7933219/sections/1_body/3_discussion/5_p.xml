<p>The metabolism of endothelial cells has recently been recognized as a driving force for tumor angiogenesis. Metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and glutamine metabolism, have distinct, essential roles during vessel formation (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Katerina et al., 2018</xref>). The finding of the differentially changed gene PRKAA2 in our study is important for energy sensor functions, which could influence endothelial activation when tumor cells contact with endothelial cells. As for its role in tumor cells, AMPK may exert either a positive or negative effect on cancer cell survival depending on the context of cellular stress.

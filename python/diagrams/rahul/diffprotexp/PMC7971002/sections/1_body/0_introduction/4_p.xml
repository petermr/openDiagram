 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. LncRNA and miRNAs are co-integrated and regulate all aspects of ovarian tissue development. Even though LncRNA does not encode proteins, it has been shown to have a transcriptional and post-transcriptional effect on gene functions as it is commonly involved in different physiological processes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. LncRNA and miRNAs play an important part in the regulation of ovary maturation, ovarian cells development, and hormone secretion

 </sup>. Furthermore, the integration of LncRNA and miRNAs allows a thorough study of their regulatory mechanisms in ovarian growth at the molecular level

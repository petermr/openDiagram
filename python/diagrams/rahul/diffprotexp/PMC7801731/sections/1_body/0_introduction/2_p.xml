<p id="Par3">Organisms with astonishing regenerative capacities are scattered among basal metazoan lineages and in various lophotrochozoan and deuterostome phyla. The latter encompasses a wide group of organisms that includes vertebrates along with tunicates, echinoderms, hemichordates, and cephalochordates. This phylogenetic placement makes highly regenerative groups such as tunicates and echinoderms, attractive models for studying regeneration. Their potentially shared genetic mechanisms highlight their importance for biomedical studies

<p>Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women and a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide.
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> At present, breast cancer is categorized into four intrinsic molecular subtypes clinically, based on the presence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and ki67.
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 10% to 20% of all breast cancer cases, and is characterized by the lack of ER and PR expression and the absence of HER2 amplification.
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Compared with other molecular subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC is more commonly diagnosed in young women and is more prone to relapse and metastasis.
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4â€“6</xref> Moreover, TNBC patients cannot benefit from endocrine or HER2 targeted therapy due to the absence of molecular targets, and this leads directly to poor clinical outcome. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC pathogenesis.

<p id="Par38">In summary, we discovered that MEL enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs and suppressed OP development by inhibiting the expression of circ_0003865, which sponges miR-3653-3p to activate 
 <italic>GAS1</italic> gene expression and repress the expression of osteogenic marker genes. These investigations bring new perspectives for the molecular mechanisms of MEL-induced BMSC osteogenic differentiation and OP inhibition. They will serve as a basis for the clinical use of MEL in treating OP and may reveal new biomarkers for OP diagnosis and treatment.

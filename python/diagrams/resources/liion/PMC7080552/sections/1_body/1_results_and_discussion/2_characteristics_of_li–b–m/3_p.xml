<p>The properties of the obtained Li–B–Mg composite have been further characterized. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows that the Li–B–Mg composite plate has a yellowish metallic sheen color while the pure Li has a silver color.

 </xref>a shows the X‐ray powder diffraction (XRD) results of the Li–B–Mg composite, from which three main peaks located at 25.53°, 45.02°, and 52.48° can be assigned to LiB phase (PDF#52‐1033, note that the disappearance of the peak at 40.77° of LiB phase is caused by the rolling process, which is in agreement with previous report.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>). Peaks at 25.53° and 29.36° can be assigned to the tape used for the sample preparation. The remaining three peaks (at 36.16°, 52.08°, and 65.05°) belong to Li(Mg) solid solution (approximately Li
 <sub>0.98</sub>Mg
 <sub>0.02</sub>, for details of the calculation see the Supporting Information). The composite is thus confirmed to be composed of two phases, i.e., the LiB compound and Li(Mg) solid solution. In addition, the mass percent of the LiB in the composite is calculated to be 42.693 wt% (see details in the Supporting Information). Overall, the structure of the obtained Li(Mg) solid solution filled in LiB fibers skeleton is similar to that of pure Li (PDF#15‐0401) which possesses a body‐centered cubic phase. The similarities of the structure between the Li(Mg) solid solution and Li could in theory avoid phase transformation during Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition, which facilitates the structural stability of the obtained Li–B–Mg composite.

<p>To explore the relationship between gene clusters found by differential expression between disease groups and their commonly cited pathways in the literature, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). Analysis of cluster 1 (CLE-associated genes) revealed significant associations with pathways involved in communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, 
 <italic>TREM1</italic> signalling and granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis (

Analysis of cluster 3 (IFN dominant) revealed associations between genes in the IFN-signalling pathway and the role of hypercytokinaemia/hyperchemokinaemia in the pathogenesis of influenza and pathways associated with pattern recognition receptors that detect bacteria and viruses (

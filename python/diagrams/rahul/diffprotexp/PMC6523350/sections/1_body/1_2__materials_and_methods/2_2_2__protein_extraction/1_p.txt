0: Total protein was extracted from rice grain samples.
1: 5 g of grains powder was dissolved using 200 L of TEAB dissolution buffer.
2: The dissolution process was boosted up by 15 min ultrasonication (WD-9415B, LiuYi Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).
3: The dissolved mixture was then centrifuged (12,000 r/min, 20 min, at 4 C) and the supernatant was subsided by adding 4-volume dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 mM) in cold acetone for 2 h. The suspension was centrifuged (12,000 r/min, 20 min, at 4 C).
4: The precipitate was collected and mixed with cold acetone (800 L, at 56 C) to break the proteins disulfide bond.
5: The mixture was then centrifuged again (12,000 r/min, 20 min, at 4 C) and the pellet dried.
6: Finally, the dried pellet was collected and dissolved in dissolution buffer (100 L Triethylamine borane) and stored at 80 C for later use.

<p>Concentrated stock solutions of SWCNT and MWCNT were prepared by sonication in FBS at a concentration of 5 mg/mL using a Branson Sonicater 450 at a duty cycle of 30% and an output control of 3 for 20 s. After sonication, the samples were autoclaved and diluted to the final concentrations of nanoparticles in the cell culture media. For the control samples, FBS without nanoparticles was treated in an identical manner. Additional CNT-free FBS was added to obtain a final concentration of 15% FBS in culture media in all cases. Only 2% of the total FBS was autoclaved with CNTs.</p>

The extracellular pH of <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> was determined by eutech pH meter. The fungal suspension 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL were added to 20 mL PDB and incubated in a moist chamber at 28&#176;C &#177; 2&#176;C for 2 days. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was collected, washed for 2&#8211;3 times with sterilized double-distilled water, and resuspended in 20 mL sterilized double-distilled water. After the addition of the MPE, the extracellular pH was determined.</p>

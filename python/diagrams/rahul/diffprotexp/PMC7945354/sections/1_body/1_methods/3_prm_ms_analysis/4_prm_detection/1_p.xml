<p id="Par35">Each sample (2 μg) was separated by nano-LC and analyzed by online electrospray tandem MS. The complete liquid-mass tandem system was composed of a liquid system (Easy nLC system; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and an MS system (Q-Exactive; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Buffer A was composed of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution, and buffer B was composed of 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile aqueous solution (acetonitrile was 80%). The sample was separated by an analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA; Acclaim PepMap RSLC 50 μm × 15 cm, nano viper, P/N164943) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min using the following nonlinear increasing gradient: 0–1 min, 2% B to 8% B; 1–46 min, 8% B to 28% B; 46–56 min, 28% B to 40% B; 56–57 min, 40% B to 90% B; and 57–60 min, 90% B.</p>

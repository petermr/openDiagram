<p id="Par44">High expression of type I interferon genes has previously been associated with improved response to TNFi therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and, more recently, non-response to methotrexate therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, whilst expression of a number of interferon genes was initially associated with good-response in this study (
 <italic>IFNG</italic>, 
 <italic>IFNG-AS1</italic>, 
 <italic>LY6E</italic>, 
 <italic>MX2</italic>, 
 <italic>SERPING1</italic>, 
 <italic>OAS2</italic>), only an association with 
 <italic>IFNG-AS1</italic> was retained following adjustment for baseline DAS28 score and none were validated by RT-qPCR. Overall, this study identified many immune-related genes with increased expression in the whole blood of good-responders, whilst seemingly paradoxical, this may represent migration of RA-associated inflammatory factors out of the affected joint and into the peripheral blood in a positive response to TNFi therapy.

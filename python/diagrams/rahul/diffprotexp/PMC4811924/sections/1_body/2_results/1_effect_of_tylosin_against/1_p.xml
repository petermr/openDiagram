<p>We evaluated the action of tylosin on biofilm growth 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The MIC against 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> was 0.5 μg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Tylosin at 1/2 MIC and 1/4 MIC caused a significantly higher reduction in the biofilm-forming ability of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> compared with positive control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, there was no pronounced effect for 1/16 MIC and 1/8 MIC of tylosin on biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Figure

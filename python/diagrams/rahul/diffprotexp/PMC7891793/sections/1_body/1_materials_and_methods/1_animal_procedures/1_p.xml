<p>The study was performed using bovine calves (
 <italic>Bos taurus</italic>) and approved by the University of California Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (authorization number 19313). Detailed description of the study design, randomization, interventions, outcomes, handing and detection of the virus has been provided elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, 36 healthy five to six-week-old outbred pre-ruminant bottle-fed Holstein bull calves were randomly split into 6 treatment groups. All animals were infected with BRSV by aerosolization of 5 ml of infected bovine turbinate cell culture supernatant, using individual nebulizers, connected to a tightly fitted face respirator mask. Infection dose of the virus was 3.9×10
 <sup>5</sup>–9.7×10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU. The following treatment groups were created as follows: Group 1 –ibuprofen, starting on day 3 post infection; Group 2 –ibuprofen, starting on day 5 post infection; Group– 3, placebo; Group 4 –the antiviral fusion protein inhibitor (FPI), starting on day 3 post infection; Group 5 –FPI and ibuprofen starting on day 5 post infection; Group 6 –FPI and ibuprofen starting on day 3 post infection. GS-561937 (FPI) was administered 600mg per animal in 30 ml of a mixture of propylene glycol and First Street Snow Cone Syrup (Amerifoods Inc, Los Angeles, CA) once daily. Ibuprofen was administered at 10 mg/kg, three times daily, in the form of Advil suspension for children (100 mg/5ml—Pfizer inc, Madison, NJ). The First Street Snow Cone Syrup without ibuprofen was administered as an ibuprofen placebo, as well as its 50:50 mix with propylene glycol without FPI for those groups that did not receive FPI (placebo). All therapeutics, including placebo, were given orally, using catheter tipped syringes.

<p>Previous study reported that LF blocks SARS-CoV pseudovirus infection in HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells by binding to HSPGs on the cell surface [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, HCoV-NL63 was shown to utilize HSPGs as adhesion receptor for viral attachment to target cells through its interaction with the membrane (M) protein [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recently, cell surface HSPGs were discovered as the co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and facilitate the subsequent binding to ACE2 receptor [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on these findings and our results listed above, we hypothesize that LF exerts its broad-spectrum antiviral activity against coronaviruses by binding to HSPGs, therefore indirectly blocking the interaction between viral spike protein and ACE2. To test this hypothesis, we chose heparin (Sigma Cat.# H3393) as a mimetic of HSPGs, and performed the differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to determine the direct binding of heparin to BLF and HLF. Specific binding of a ligand to a protein typically stabilizes the target protein, resulting in an increased melting temperature (

 <sub>m</sub> of both BLF and HLF in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), indicating the direct binding of BLF and HLF to heparin. In addition, BLF displayed higher binding affinity than HLF to heparin as shown by the larger Î”T
 <sub>m</sub>, and this result agrees with the more potent antiviral activity of BLF compared to HLF.

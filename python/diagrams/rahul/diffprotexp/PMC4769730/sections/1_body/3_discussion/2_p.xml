<p>Since any effort in the characterization of POAG-associated protein profile will be of great importance in understanding the mechanisms underlying POAG progression, a nonbiased chip-based microarray approach was carried out to discriminate 60 antibodies for potential proteins/factors relevant to pathological TM. The selected potential candidates are all known to be involved in chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling [

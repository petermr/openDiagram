<p>The overall analysis of the entire dataset with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering methods did not show a clear separation between the groups of tumor samples stratified according to the mutation status, which indicates that the differences are not as pronounced as previously observed differences in gene expression profiles of 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Principal components 1 and 2 are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jcm-10-00375">Figure S1a</xref>, while a dendrogram showing similarity of miRNA expression between the samples is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jcm-10-00375">Figure S1b</xref>. Forty-six tumor samples were used for identification miRNAs differentially expressed in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors. Two samples with 
 <italic>USP48</italic> mutations were excluded from differential analysis to avoid bias resulting from possibly different molecular features of these tumors. A total of 250 differentially expressed miRNAs were found (adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05), including 68 miRNAs that met the criterion of |FC| &gt; 2, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-10-00375-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b. Most of them (57/68) were miRNAs with the expression higher in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut than in wild-type tumors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-10-00375-f001">Figure 1</xref>b).

<p>Our study identified six hub genes and various signalling pathways that were strongly associated with T-cell immunity. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that immuno-biomarkers are of prognostic significance in many tumor types, including breast cancer.
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Unlike other intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC is characterized by a higher degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs),
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and multiple series of investigations have shown that higher TILs are associated with improved overall survival and higher response rate.
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31â€“34</xref> In combination with the existing studies, our findings further indicated the important role of immune-related factors in TNBC.

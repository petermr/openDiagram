 </sup> we here resolved the humidity-dependent loadings of water achieved on birnessite nanoparticles, alongside their resulting vibrational spectral profiles and the interlayer expansion they generate. We predict the microscopic hydration states of birnessite using a composite 
 <italic>adsorption–condensation–intercalation</italic> model that we recently developed for layered minerals. Our model accounts for water intercalated in the internal and external basal faces of birnessite (

 </sup> We also provide additional insight into the structure and dynamics of the intercalated water by molecular dynamics simulations of a representative form of birnessite. This work should facilitate future studies following the solvent-driven chemistry of this important nanolayered manganese oxide when exposed to moist air.

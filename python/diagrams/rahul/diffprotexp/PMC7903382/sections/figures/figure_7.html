 <caption> Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR validation of the mRNAs in the T1-T4 spinal cord. The expression levels of mRNA Frs3, Nedd4l and Tep1 were significantly downregulated in model group, whereas the expression of mRNA Myef2 was significantly upregulated. The expression levels of mRNA Zfp523, Dnajc6 and Myef2 were not statistically different between the two groups. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n=6). *P&lt;0.05 vs. control. Frs3, fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 3; Zfp523, zinc finger protein 76; Dnajc6, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C6; Nedd4l, NEDD4 like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; Tep1, telomerase associated protein 1; Myef2, myelin expression factor 2; Tgfbr1, transforming growth factor β receptor 1; Fgf12, fibroblast growth factor 12; Mef2c, myocyte enhancer factor 2C; Tfdp1, transcription factor Dp-1; MIRI, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. </caption>

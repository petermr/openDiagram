<p id="Par46">Prior to imputation, all genotypes were combined into a single dataset containing 111 patients and 504,235 overlapping variants. Further QC was performed to exclude any variants with strand, position and allele frequency differences compared to the HRC panel

The resulting dataset contained 111 patients and 389,511 variants. We imputed up to HRC panel (v1.1 2016) using the Michigan imputation server (

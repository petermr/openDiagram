0: Serum samples (40 l, including QC samples) were added to new Eppendorf tubes with ice-cold methanol (120 l), vortex mixed for 1 min, placed in holding for 30 min at  20 C, and centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min at 4 C. 25 l of supernatant and 225 l 50% methanol were mixed.
1: Then 20 l of mixture from each sample were mixed as quality control samples, 60 l of mixture was conducted as samples.
2: All samples were stored at  80 C (ten biological replicates for each group).

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The main compounds found in the present investigation were different quantitatively and qualitatively from those reported in the literature. The average rate of limonene and geranial was 17% and 9%, respectively, in different essential oils distilled from<italic> A. citriodora</italic> grown in Morocco (leaves of<italic> A. citriodora</italic> harvested in May period), whereas the amount of the monoterpene (limonene) is only 0.52% and the terpene aldehyde (geranial) is not detected in the present study. However, the rates of sesquiterpenes (<italic>&#946;</italic>-caryophyllene, Ar-curcumene, <italic>&#946;</italic>-elemene, etc.), terpene oxides (caryophyllene oxide), some monoterpene alcohols (cis-verbenol), and sesquiterpene alcohols (spathulenol) were higher in the present studied essential oils [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is interesting to note that limonene, <italic>&#946;</italic>-caryophyllene, p-cymene, linalool, citral, <italic>&#945;</italic>-pinene, and 1.8-cineole are common compounds of essential oils of<italic> Lippia</italic> sp. and thought to be responsible for specific biological effects and properties attributed to the genus<italic> Aloysia</italic> [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>

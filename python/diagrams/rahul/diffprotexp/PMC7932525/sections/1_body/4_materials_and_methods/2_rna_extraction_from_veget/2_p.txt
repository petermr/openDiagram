0: RNA was extracted from NDVs and NVs as described by Golden et al [ 42] with some modifications: 500 mL NDVs and NVs was sedimented at 500  g for 5 min at 4C.
1: To ensure that only vegetative cells were broken down, the concentration of lysozyme was low and enzymolysis time was short.
2: The precipitate was resuspended in 1 mL lysozyme solution (1 mg/mL lysozyme in TE buffer) at 30C for 5 min, shaking each tube for 15 s at 1-min intervals.
3: Next, 5 mL of guanidine isothiocyanate cell lysis solution (mixed solution in the EASYspin Plus Bacteria RNA kit, Aidlab, Beijing, China) was added to terminate the reaction as quickly as possible.
4: This solution was centrifuged to remove the precipitate, and the supernatants were used for RNA isolation according to the instructions of the EASYspin Plus Bacteria RNA kit (Aidlab).
5: The sediment obtained after this treatment contained vegetative cells and heterocysts ( Fig 1C1 and 1C2).

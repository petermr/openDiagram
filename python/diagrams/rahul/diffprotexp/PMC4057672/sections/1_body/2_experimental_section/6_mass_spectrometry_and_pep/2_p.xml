<p>Protein spots were cut from the gels, then destained and washed. The spots were kept in 0.2 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>3</sub> for 20 min and then lyophilized. Each spot was digested overnight with 12.5 ng/mL trypsin in 0.1 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>3</sub>, and the digested proteins were extracted three times with 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA solution. All mass spectra date were acquired on an AutoFlex MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer with LIFT technology (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). MS/MS data were acquired with a N
 <sub>2</sub> laser at a 25-Hz sampling rate [

 <xref rid="b35-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] for protein identification. The MASCOT result is a Probability-based Mowse Score [
 <xref rid="b36-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] which is expressed as −10 × log(
 <italic>p</italic>), where 
 <italic>p</italic> is the probability. Protein scores greater than 63 are considered statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The above process was repeated three times. The criteria for selecting protein spots were (i) spots showing greater than twofold expression changes between control group and experimental group; (ii) reproducible spots which were detected in all three replicate experiments; and (iii) successful identification of spots using MALDI-TOF analysis.

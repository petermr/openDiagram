<p>Exposure for 72 h to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU generates a statistically significant decrease in the number of B16F1 cells (79% and 64%, respectively (

The increase from 19.6 ± 3.94 h to 48.67 ± 6.25 h and 27.03 ± 3.0 h induced by 72-h exposure to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU, respectively, indicates that reduction of the number of cells would be mainly a consequence of variations in the cell cycle control.

The cells exposed to L-Tyr significantly increase the G0/G1 phase (55.5 ± 3.8%

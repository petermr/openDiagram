<p id="p0065">The increment of the capacity could be highly associated with the oxidation of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte, which was evidenced by the analysis of Coulumbic efficiency and the differential capacity (dQ/dV). All the cathodes showed high Coulumbic efficiency close to 100%, whereas the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> showed slightly lower Coulumbic efficiencies during the recharging cycles (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Without the MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> additive, the Coulumbic efficiency of all samples is similar and near 100% (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B, capacity data shown in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). This indicates that the additional Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte was actually involved in the redox process on the cathode. To further investigate this issue, the first five discharge-charge profiles of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C. Two conventional plateaus at potentials of 1.4 and 1.3 V versus Zn/Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> reflect the H
 <sup>+</sup> intercalation process and the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> intercalation process, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). In each subsequent charging process, an additional plateau/slope was observed at potential around 1.6–1.8 V, besides the two conventional plateaus that represent the reverse process of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and H
 <sup>+</sup> intercalation. In 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, differential capacity (dQ/dV) analysis more clearly shows this additional oxidation process happening at a voltage range of 1.62–1.80 V. This could be ascribed to the oxidation of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> to Mn
 <sup>3+</sup>, as will be discussed in the following sections. In a mild aqueous electrolyte environment, subsequent hydrolysis of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> could result in the deposition of Mn compound on the cathode (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>). These compounds were involved in the subsequent discharge, thus providing additional capacity.

At the papillary muscle level, short-axis views of M-mode tracings were recorded through the anterior and posterior left ventricular walls to measure LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd), LV end-systolic dimension (LVESd), and LV fraction shortening (LVFS). LV ejection fraction (LVEF) values were obtained according to the Simpson approach.

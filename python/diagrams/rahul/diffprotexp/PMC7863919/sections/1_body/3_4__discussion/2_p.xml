<p>The clinical relevance of

 <xref rid="B25-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and more frequently in younger patients according to some reports [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We found mutations nearly exceptionally in women (with only one male patient); however, due to a high overrepresentation of female patients in the study group, we cannot conclude that there is a sex-related difference. We also did not observe a relationship between mutation and age of onset.

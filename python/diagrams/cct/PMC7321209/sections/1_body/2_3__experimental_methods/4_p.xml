<p>Low-alloyed steel S355 J2 + N (1.0570) was used as substrate material with a thickness of 20 mm. A solid wire of low-alloyed steel G4Si1/SG3 (1.5130, Ã˜ = 1.0 mm) was used as filler material in the GMAW process. Herein, the silicon percentage was increased by 0.3% by the manufacturer to enhance the binding of oxygen and reduce the formation of porosity in the weld bead. Prospectively, the chosen filler material is of high interest for industrial sectors such as construction engineering and architecture. The following

1: To obtain  Xenopus laevis embryos, females were primed with 100 units of PMSG and induced with 500 units of human chorionic gonadotrophin.
2: Eggs were collected manually and fertilised in vitro.
3: Embryos were de-jellied in 2% L-cysteine, incubated at 18 C and microinjected in 3% Ficoll into 1 cell at the 2 cell stage in the animal pole with 5 nl of enhancer reporter plasmid at 400 ng/l or GFP capped RNA as control.
4: Embryos were left to develop at 23 C. Embryo stageing is according to Nieuwkoop and Faber normal table of Xenopus development.
5: GFP capped RNA for injections was prepared using the SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit, 5 ng was injected per embryo.

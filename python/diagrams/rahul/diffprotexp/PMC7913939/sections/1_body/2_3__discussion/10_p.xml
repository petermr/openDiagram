<p>Investigating the expression levels of MCTs and other genes important for the optimal execution of neuroenergetic processes in WT vs.

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice after exposure to hypoxia (stress condition) appears to be a proper approach to verifying if the increased infarction volumes observed in 
 <italic>Prnp
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice may be a consequence of the disturbed expression of MCTs and glycolysis. As such, PrP
 <sup>c</sup> emerges as a novel protein that may prove importantance for the regulation of MCT1 and MCT4 expression, and its lack or loss of function may thereby accelerate the process of neurodegeneration.

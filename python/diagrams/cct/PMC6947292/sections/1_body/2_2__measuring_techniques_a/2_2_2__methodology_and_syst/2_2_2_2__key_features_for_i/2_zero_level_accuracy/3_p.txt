0: In any case, the sample must be packed properly, for instance using high-purity aluminium pans.
1: If this aspect is disregarded, an incorrect measurement might result (see  Figure 8).
2: The reason for this is that the colour of the sample surface, which influences the heat exchange by radiation between sample and furnace, needs to be kept constant [ 121].
3: A purge with inert gas is also required to prevent oxidation and keep heat transfer conditions constant.
4: Nitrogen gas is therefore preferable to helium, as nitrogen purging results in the best baseline stability of the DSC instrument.
5: Helium may be suitable for increasing the achievable cooling rates [ 78].

<p>The 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene was amplified using primers SAUSA300_0903_Bam_F: CGCGGATCCATGGCT GGAGAATTACGAATAAT and SAUSA300_0903_Sal_R: ACGCGTCGACTTATTTTGATTTGATTTTAGGCATT, ligated to the BamHI/SalI-digestedpND50-pfbaA vector [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> HST08. Bacteriophage 80Î±-mediated complementation of the plasmids was performed into the respective mutants as previously described [

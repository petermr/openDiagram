<p>In the process of gene transcription and translation, lncRNAs and miRNAs play important roles. The interaction between lncRNA and miRNA is called competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNAs).

 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In glioma, some lncRNAs play the function of an endogenous “sponge” for miRNAs to influence malignant progression of glioma. Li and his partners found NEAT1 could regulate miR-152-3p/CCT6A axis to promote the progression of glioma.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> LINC00294 has also been found negatively modulated the activity of glioma cells via influence the expression of miR-1278.
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In this work, LINC00466 overexpression influenced the proliferation, migration, invasion of glioma and cell resistance to TMZ treatment. Another fundamental finding was that LINC00466 had the ability to bind to miR-137. Some researchers have reported miR-137 might inhibited tumorigenesis and this miRNA could be regulated by lncRNA-XIST and NCK1-AS1.

 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The results of our study also showed the expression of miR-137 was obviously decreased in tissues of glioma compared with the tissues of normal non-tumor. Up-regulation of LINC00466 inhibited miR-137 expression and regulated the biological function that played by miR-137. These results showed miR-137 as a negative regulator in glioma and it could also be regulated by LINC00466.

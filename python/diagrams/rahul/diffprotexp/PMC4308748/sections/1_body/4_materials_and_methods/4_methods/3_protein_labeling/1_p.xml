<p>The protein sample was adjusted to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL and adjusted to pH 8.0–9.0. Each sample (50 μg, 10 μL) was used for analysis. The gel electrophoresis dye was mixed for 30 seconds, centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 30 seconds and left in place at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then, 0.4 μL dye and 0.6 μL dimethylformamide were mixed together. Subsequently, 50 μg protein sample was added. Following addition of sample buffer, the mixture was fully mixed and a hydration solution was added till the final volume was 450 μL.</p>

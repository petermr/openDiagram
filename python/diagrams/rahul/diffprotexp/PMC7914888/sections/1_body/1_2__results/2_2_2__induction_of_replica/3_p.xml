Overall, the results of exposure to 5-Brd-2′-dU suggest a phenotype associated with senescence and agree with that previously reported in 5-Brd-2′-dU-induced senescence models, where an increase in lysosomal organelles would explain the more significant S.A. β-Gal activity and increase in messenger RNA [

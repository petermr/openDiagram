0: Ribosomal protein is an important component of ribosomes.
1: Abnormal expression of ribosomal protein gene will seriously affect cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.
2: It has been found that the ribosomal proteins synthesis is closely related to the growth and proliferation of tumor cells during tumorigenesis [ 13,  14].
3: Recently, studies have found that ribosomes and immune-related genes are associated with systemic vasculitis [ 15].
4: However, studies on ribosomal proteins, immune-related genes and VTE are rarely reported.
5: This study enriched the function of genes with different expression in VTE through bioinformatics, and obtained important pathways and molecules involved in the development process of VTE, which provided bioinformatics basis for the research on the mechanism of VTE occurrence and development, and also provided new potential targets for the research on the treatment of VTE.

<p>The main chemical compounds of essential oil were trans-anethole (89.24%), γ-himachalene (2.89%), and methyl chavicol (2.72%). Samojlik 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed the major constituents of anise essential oil were trans-anethole (87.96%) followed by γ-himachalene (3.17%), cis-isoeugenol (2.21%), and linalool (1.78%).[
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In another study on chemical composition of essential oil, anethole accounted for 88.1% of identified constituents, followed by pseudo-iso-eugenyl-2-methyl butyrate (4.15%), and γ-himachalene (4.15%).[
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Trans-anethole showed hepatoprotective activities in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice with reduction of serum ALT, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 6 levels. Increased in nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), release of high-mobility group box-1 into the extracellular milieu, and the interactions between IRF-1 and histone acetyltransferase p300 after ischemia/reperfusion were attenuated by trans-anethole. Moreover, trans-anethole suppressed increases in toll-like receptor-4.[

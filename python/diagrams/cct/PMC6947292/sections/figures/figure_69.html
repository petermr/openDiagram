 <caption> Comparison of three different AlSiMg cast alloys: ( A) cooling DSC curves for permanent mould-cast Al7Si0.3Mg, [ 214]; ( B) cooling DSC curves for two variants of Al10Si0.3Mgâ€”one of the variants was produced by high-pressure die-casting, the second by laser beam melting, [ 131, 215]; ( C, D) values of specific precipitation enthalpy and hardness after ageing for the three cast alloys. </caption>

 <italic>MAP2K3 </italic>was previously identified as a candidate imprinted gene in the context of NF1 deficiency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but the roles of its upstream DMRs are not well characterized. DMR1 is generally thought to regulate gene expression of an alternative coding region with sequence homology to exon 1, whereas DMR 2 regulates exon 1 expression directly. The importance of alternative exon expression in cancer is increasingly being recognized as it has been used to identify breast cancer subtypes using RNAseq data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) cohort [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. DNA methylation status was also shown to affect expression of alternative exons in the sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPHK1) gene in gastroesophageal cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Apart from these studies, the impact of alternative exon expression on tumorigenesis has not been well described, nor has the role of methylation in defining which 
 <italic>MAP2K3</italic> exon is preferentially expressed.

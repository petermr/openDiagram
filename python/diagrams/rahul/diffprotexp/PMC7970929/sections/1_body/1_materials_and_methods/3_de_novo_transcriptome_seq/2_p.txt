0: Processed reads were assembled using graph-based approach by Trinity program.
1: The characteristic properties, including N50 length, average length, maximum length, and minimum length of the assembled contigs were calculated (Table  1).
2: Clustering of the assembled transcripts based on sequence similarity was performed using CD-HIT-EST 16 with 95% similarity between the sequences, reducing the redundancy without exclusion of sequence diversity and was used for further annotation and differential expression analysis.
3: Processed reads were aligned back to the final assembly using Bowtie 17 with end to end parameters.

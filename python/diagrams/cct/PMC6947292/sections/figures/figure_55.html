 <caption> Measured values and model predictions for hardness after ageing and specific precipitation enthalpies of six AlZnMg(Cu) alloys [ 119]. Values for the total specific precipitation enthalpy were obtained by in situ cooling DSC as outlined above. For 7049A, chip-sensor based differential fast scanning calorimetry was applied [ 130, 162]. </caption>

<p id="Par3">It is clear that in vertebrates, such as in mammals, each ovarian follicle has a complex structure. The oocyte is encircled by granulosa cells (GC) and theca cells. The oocyte growth depends on these cells for nutrients transportation and mechanical support. Theca cells do not undergo obvious change in their morphology and function during follicular development. In the early stage, GC undergo dramatic morphological change, transiting from a squamous cell shape into a cuboidal one

 </sup>. In the later stages (eg antral follicles and preovulatory follicles), GC can be further divided into mural GC which are distal to the oocyte and cumulus GC which surround the oocyte. GC seems to play key roles in orchestrating oocyte-somatic cell crosstalk and the secretion of steroids and peptide hormones (e.g. progesterone, and inhibins)

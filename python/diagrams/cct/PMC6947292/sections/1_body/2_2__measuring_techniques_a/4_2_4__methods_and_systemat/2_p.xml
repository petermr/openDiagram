<p>The presence of crystal structures with volume fractions of above â‰ˆ1 % and large precipitates can be detected by common X-ray diffraction (XRD) [

 <xref rid="B138-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Hence, this technique is again limited to relatively slow cooling rates, which produce corresponding volume fractions and particle dimensions of the phase of interest. In addition, the wide and small-angle X-ray scattering techniques briefly discussed above can generate information on quench-induced precipitation [

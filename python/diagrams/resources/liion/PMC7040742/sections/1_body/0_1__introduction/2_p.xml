<p>The estimated recycling rates reported in the literature fluctuate significantly; although they are highly variable from one geographical region to the other, they have still been low [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, Call2Recycle, the main organization responsible for the collection of end-of-life LIBs in Canada, reported collecting less than 200 tons of LIBs in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While Gies et al. determined that this quantity corresponded to a collection rate of 25% [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we believe that their assessment was an overestimation considering the sale volumes of electronics and electric vehicles (EV). As bench marking, based on electronic device sales statistics, Wang et al. estimated the North American recycling rate was lower than 10% in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As another comparison, the collection rate reported by Eucobat in Europe in 2016 was slightly higher than 15% [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Considering these data and the inability of the current pyrometallurgical processes to recover Li, Li recycling from spent LIBs is estimated to be lower than 1% [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is obviously not in agreement with the principles of sustainable development. Therefore, it is imperative to increase both the collection and recycling rates of LIBs.

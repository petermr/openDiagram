0: Our research group has a model to study the effects of H 2O 2 in plant stress responses: a transgenic  Nicotiana tabacum cv.
1: Xanthi line overproducing H 2O 2 constitutively.
2: This is due to the expression of the transgene  CchGLP of  Capsicum chinense Jacq, which encodes for an Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD).
3: The  CchGLP gene is involved in the natural resistance to geminivirus in accession BG-3821 of  C. chinense from Yucatan, Mexico [ 40].
4: The expression of CchGLP in  Nicotiana tabacum xanthi nc resulted in several transgenic lines, of which two lines stood out: Line 8 (L8) with a high gene expression and high H 2O 2 production; and Line 1 (L1) with low gene expression and low H 2O 2 production, which is considered as azygous control.
5: Both transgenic lines presented a characteristic phenotype against biotic and abiotic stress of resistance and susceptibility, respectively, to geminivirus infection [ 41], drought [ 42], and heavy metals [ 43].
6: In previous works, different omic profiles were determined to elucidate the molecular elements involved in the resistance phenotype of the transgenic line at different molecular levels: proteomic [ 44], metabolomic [ 44], transcriptomic [ 42], and miRNAs profiles [ 43].
7: The L8 has shown a higher occurrence of metabolism and cell growth and differentiation-related proteins, and metabolites related to phenylpropanoid metabolism, osmotic process, and amino acid metabolisms [ 42].
8: Likewise, the differential transcriptomic between these two lines displayed genes associated with primary metabolism and cellular functions as cell wall reinforcement and secondary metabolism as phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and steroid hormone biosynthesis [ 44, 45].
9: In the case of the miRNAs differential profile, the results were associated mainly with the structural molecular activity and proton-transporting type ATPase [ 43].

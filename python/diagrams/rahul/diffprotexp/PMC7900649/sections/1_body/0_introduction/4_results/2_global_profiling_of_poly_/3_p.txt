0: We arranged the annotated 3 UTR APA sites in tandem APA based on the stop codon and combined these data with poly(A) site profiling as previously described [ 18].
1: All 10,971 genes were identified to have at least one tandem poly(A) sites, among which 8,080 genes (73.65%) had two or more (Fig.
2: 2c).
3: The average distance between single poly(A) sites and stop codon was about 527 bp (median: 312 bp).
4: The median values of the distance from the stop codon to the proximal or distal poly(A) sites were 259 bp (average: 417 bp) and 1283 bp (average: 1604 bp), respectively (Fig.
5: 2d).
6: The poly(A) signals (PAS) are six-nucleotide  cis-acting elements important in 3 end processing that are located 1030 nt upstream of the cleavage sites.
7: To date, 12 variants of PAS have been identified, and the canonical types were AAUAAA and its main variant AUUAAA [ 13].
8: According to our database, the frequency of canonical PAS was around 46%.
9: About 22% PAS were not identified (Fig.
10: 2e).
11: These results reveal the detailed landscape of poly(A) site usage in IPEC-J2 cells.

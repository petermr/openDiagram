  <title>Principles and advantages of a SEB versus a conventional LIB.</title>
  <p>DCR is shown to vary with the inverse of temperature for both batteries, where the upper curve for the passivated SEB is always safer due to higher DCR. The SEB can, however, achieve a similar power output to the LIB by thermal stimulation before operation, shown as going from point b to c.</p>

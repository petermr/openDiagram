0: The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the essential oils was determined by the agar diffusion method [ 13].
1: This method was preferred over the dilution method because of low solubility of essential oils in water and in meat peptone broth.
2: The following concentrations of essential oils were used: 150; 100; 50; 25; 12.5; 6.25 L/mL; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the solvent.
3: The 100 L of each oil solution was introduced to the wells in the agar with test microorganisms.
4: Different Gram-positive ( Bacillus subtilis WT-A, isolated from metal polluted soils of Kajaran, Armenia;  Staphylococcus aureus MDC 5233 (Microbial Depository Center, Armbiotechnology Scientific and Production Center, Armenia; laboratory control strain) and Gram-negative ( E. coli VKPM-M17 (Russian National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms at the Institute of Genetics and Selection of Industrial Microorganisms, Russia; laboratory control strain),  Pseudomonas aeruginosa GRP3 (Soil and Water Research Institute, Iran) bacteria and ampicillin-resistant  E. coli dhp-pUC18 were used.
5: Bacterial cultures were grown on Mueller-Hinton agar.
6: Ampicillin (25 g/mL) as a positive control and DMSO as a negative control were used.
7: The yeasts ( Candida albicans WT-174 isolated from infected vaginal microbiota of hospitalized patients (clinical strain) and  Debariomyces hansenii WT (French National Institute for Agricultural Research, France; laboratory control strain) were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 h at room temperature.
8: As the positive control fluconazole (25 g/mL) was used.
9: Data were expressed in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values.

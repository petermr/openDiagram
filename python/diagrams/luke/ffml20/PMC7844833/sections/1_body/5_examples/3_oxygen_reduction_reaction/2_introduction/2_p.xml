<p>Fuel cells transform the chemical energy stored in hydrogen or organic fuels into electrical energy and have been widely explored as an alternative to internal combustion engines. They are thus considered to be a key transformative technology in the transportation sector. Operation of a fuel cell involves two electrochemical processes: oxidation of hydrogen (or other fuels) at the anode, and the oxygen reduction reaction that takes place at the cathode. Currently, platinum is commonly used as a catalyst for both of these processes. However, while the oxidation reaction at the anode occurs relatively easily and at low overpotentials, the ORR at the cathode is much more sluggish and requires higher overpotentials and much higher loadings of the expensive platinum catalyst.

 </sup> The ORR step is currently the limiting factor for the widespread practical applications of fuel cells. It is therefore not surprising that major efforts in the advancement of fuel cell technology have been focused on the improvement of the ORR catalysts.

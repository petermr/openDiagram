<p>The gene cluster coding for AAF/IV (
 <italic>hdaDCBA</italic>) was amplified by PCR using primer pair hda_for/hda_rev and plasmid DNA of EAEC isolate 13â€“00093 (O73:H18) as template. The PCR product was digested with 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I and 
 <italic>Hind</italic>III and cloned the 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I/
 <italic>Hind</italic>III-digested pBAD24.

0: Several lines of evidence suggest that  GBA homozygous or heterozygous variants are associated with an increased risk of developing PD.
1: A study on brain samples from 57 subjects clinically diagnosed with PD demonstrated that  GBA variants were present in 12 cases (21%), and these were more frequent amongst younger subjects ( 11).
2: Another study on blood samples from 99 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with PD showed that 6  GBA variants were identified in 31 cases (31%), and that patients carrying the  GBA variants were younger than those who were not carriers ( 12).
3: Furthermore, a multicentre analysis from 16 centres reported that, amongst the  GBA variants of >5,000 patients with PD, 2 known  GBA variants, L444P and N370S, were commonly associated with PD in all ethnic groups ( 13).
4: However, each population also had unique variants ( 10, 12, 14, 15).
5: In Thailand, heterozygous  GBA variants were reported in 24 out of 480 patients with PD (5%), including L444P (c.1448T>C), IVS10-9_10GT>AG, P428S (c.1399C>T), N386K (c.1275C>A), V398fsX404 (c.1309delG), IVS2+1G>A and IVS9+3G>C ( 10).
6: Previous studies on various populations suggested that 5-10% of patients with PD had  GBA variants, although the percentage was much greater in the Ashkenazi population, whereas the frequency of GBA variants in the control (non-PD) population was as low as 0.5% ( 10, 16).

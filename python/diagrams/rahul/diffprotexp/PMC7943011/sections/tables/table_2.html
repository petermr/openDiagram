   <p>A total of 44 proteins were differentially expressed between metformin and insulin-treated groups, of which only 12 proteins were regulated in the same way. The remaining 32 proteins were regulated in different ways by metformin and insulin, of which 8 proteins were significantly higher expressed after metformin administration, whereas 24 proteins were significantly more prominent during hyperinsulinemia. A total of 8 proteins were differentially expressed between both treatments groups without notable changes compared to the respective untreated control samples.</p>

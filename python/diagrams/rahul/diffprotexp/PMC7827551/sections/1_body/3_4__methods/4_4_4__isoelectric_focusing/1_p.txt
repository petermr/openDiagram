0: First dimensional IEF was performed using Ettan IPGphor 3TM (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) with 7 cm ImmobilineTM DryStrip Non-Linear both pH 310 and pH 47 (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK).
1: Rehydration of the gel strips was done according to the manufacturers instructions.
2: Protein extracts were further diluted in Destreak rehydration buffer and were focused up to 9400 Vh at a maximum voltage of 5000 V (step and hold).
3: Following IEF, proteins were reduced and alkylated by soaking the Immobiline Drystrips in 5 mL equilibration solution (6 M urea, 50 mM Tris HCl; pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.004% bromophenol blue) containing 50 mg dithiothreitol for 15 min at room temperature and then in 5 mL equilibration solution containing 125 mg iodoacetamide with the same conditions [ 40].
4: Equilibrated strips were directly used for the second dimensional SDS-PAGE, as described by OFarrell [ 41].
5: Strips were sealed on top of the SDS-PAGE gel (12.5% polyacrylamide) with 0.5% agarose.
6: Tris glycine SDS (25 mM Tris, 198 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS) was used as electrode buffer.
7: Gels were run at 20 mA/gel until the dye front reached the bottom edge of each gel.
8: The 2-DE was run in duplicate for each sample.

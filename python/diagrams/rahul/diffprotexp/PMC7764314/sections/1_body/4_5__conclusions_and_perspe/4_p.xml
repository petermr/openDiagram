<p>Through these means, groups of genes changing their association across cancer stages have been identified, and, despite a lack of a consensus on the most altered pathways due to differences in methods and specific comparisons, immune-related modules seem to be recurrent across studies. This implies that the composition and function of the tumour microenvironment is a crucial feature of cancers, often showing stronger remodelling than the tumour cellsâ€™ gene networks. Thus, employing gene co-expression networks in cancer cell- or stroma-specific datasets could be a more sensitive alternative to the use of bulk tumour gene expression. In the absence of wide enough datasets for network construction, deconvolution methods [
 <xref rid="B159-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>] represent a useful means to reconstruct cell type-specific gene expression from whole tumours, which can then be fed into differential gene co-expression tools.

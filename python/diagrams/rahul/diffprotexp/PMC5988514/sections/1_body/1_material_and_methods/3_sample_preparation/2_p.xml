<p id="par0055">All samples were homogenized with solubilization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.3% SDS, 150U/ml Benzonase and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) in a Retsch Mixer Mill MM400 (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) homogenizer. The protein sample was centrifuged for 60 min at 20,000

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and protein samples were solubilized in denaturation buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0). The protein concentration of the samples was determined according to Bradford 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The proteins were reduced by adding 350 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and alkylated by 55 mM iodoacetamide. The protein samples were then treated with 0.5 μg/μl lysyl-endopeptidase (Lys-C) (Wako Chemicals) and 0.5 μg/μl Trypsin (Promega). The protein samples were prepared for LC–MS/MS analysis using Stage tips according to Rappsilber et al.

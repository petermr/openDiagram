<p>In addition to inducing lymphocyte activation, MAM also induces macrophage activation through TLR2 and TLR4 but does not require CD14 as a coreceptor [
 <xref rid="cit0290" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>]. The study by Fa´tima et al. showed that MAM-induced NO release is MHC class II-restricted, IFN-γ-, time- and concentration-dependent, and TLR4-independent in C3H/HeJ and C3H/HePas-originated macrophages [
 <xref rid="cit0296" ref-type="bibr">296</xref>]. Nevertheless, these results are contradictory to those reported by Mu et al., in which stimulation with MAM induces peritoneal or spleen macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice to produce more NO than the co-isogenic C3H/HeSnJ mice [
 <xref rid="cit0289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>], demonstrating that the TLR4 signaling pathway may play a fundamental role in initiating the differentiation of cytokine profiles in response to MAM. However, the explanation for these contradictory results is unknown. Additionally, MAM incubated with resident murine peritoneal macrophages can induce PAF production, which regulates NO production by upregulation of iNOS and by controlling the levels of prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub>, which suggests that PAF plays a significant role in the mediation of cell response to MAM [

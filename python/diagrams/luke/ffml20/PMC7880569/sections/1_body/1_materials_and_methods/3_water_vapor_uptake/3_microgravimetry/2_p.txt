0: Microgravimetric measurements of water vapor uptake by birnessite were obtained using a DVS Advantage ET 2 instrument (Surface Measurement Systems).
1: A 21-point isotherm cycle occurred between 0 and 98% relative humidity (RH) at 25 C, and we used 30 mg samples initially dried at 110 C for 3 h. The equilibrium criterion for each stepwise increase in % RH was set to a change in mass of less than 0.001 wt % per minute.
2: A complete adsorptiondesorption isotherm cycle took up to 3 days ( Figure S5).

<p>The current study aimed to explore DNA methylation and gene expression patterns in SAT and VAT during the early stages of diet-induced obesity in Wistar rats, in order to provide potential mechanisms by which these two adipose depots differ with regards to their expansion capabilities and consequently, pathophysiological roles in metabolic disease. Here we show that consumption of a high fat, high sugar CD led to significant increases in body weight, retroperitoneal fat mass, and serum insulin, triglyceride and leptin levels, as well as histological changes in adipocyte size. Furthermore, CD-exposure induced global DNA hypomethylation in both SAT and VAT, as well as VAT-specific changes in the expression of long chain fatty acid metabolism-related genes. Among these, a fatty acid transporter, 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> was significantly upregulated in VAT, whilst its expression remained unaffected by CD in SAT. We further show that 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> expression may be epigenetically upregulated in VAT, as DNA methylation at one CpG site within exon 1, proximal to the TSS, was significantly reduced in CD-fed rats compared to STD controls.

<p>SEM and TEM were used to describe the morphology of the obtained sandwich nanocomposites. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, the separated 2D ultrathin rGO nano-sheets were assembled into a remarkable 3D layered spatial structure under the linking of PEO. Supported by the PEO chains, the enlarged interlayer space can accommodate a significant number of micron-sized MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nano-flowers. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the morphology of the 3D MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich nanocomposites. The ultrathin MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets were assembled into distinct nano-flowers anchored on the surfaces of rGO hosts. The average size of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nano-flowers was about 200 nm. The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that the contents of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> in the obtained nanocomposites reached 83.3% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>). This 3D layered sandwich structure is conducive to improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. In addition, the PEO chains buffered the volume expansion of the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nano-flowers during charge/discharge processes. The TEM image of the 3D layered MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich nanocomposites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) reveals that the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nano-flowers were well-encased in the rGO interlayers without aggregation, which is consistent with SEM image. The further HR-TEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) displays that the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> petals consisted of 5â€“10 monolayers. The interlayer distance between each monolayer was about 0.62 nm, corresponding to the (002) lattice planes of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The corresponding EDX mapping of C, O, S, and Mo reveals that the C and O elements were homogeneously distributed in the specimens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), while the S and Mo elements were agglomerated with remarkable flower-liked hot spots. This further confirmed that the ultrathin MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets were assembled into nano-flowers anchored on the surfaces of rGO hosts, successfully forming a 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich architecture.

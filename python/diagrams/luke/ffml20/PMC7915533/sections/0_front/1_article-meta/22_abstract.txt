0: Two new fluorescent pteridine alkaloids, tedaniophorbasins A (  1) and B (  2), together with the known alkaloid   N-methyltryptamine, were isolated, through application of mass directed purification, from the sponge   Tedaniophorbas ceratosis collected from northern New South Wales, Australia.
1: The structures of tedaniophorbasins A and B were deduced from the analysis of 1D/2D NMR and MS data and through application of   13C NMR DFT calculations.
2: Tedaniophorbasin A possesses a novel 2-imino-1,3-dimethyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-[1,4]thiazino[3,2-g]pteridin-4(6  H)-one skeleton, while tedaniophorbasin B is its 2-oxo derivative.
3: The compounds show significant Stokes shifts (~14,000 cm  1) between excitation and emission wavelengths in their fluorescence spectra.
4: The new compounds were tested for bioactivity against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of the malaria parasite   Plasmodium falciparum, breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and the protozoan parasite   Trypanosoma brucei brucei but were inactive against all targets at 40 M.

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Free radical scavenging ability of the essential oils was tested using ethanol solution of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Catechin was used as a positive reference. Sample solution contained 125&#160;&#956;L (1&#160;mM) DPPH, 375&#160;&#956;L ethanol and 500&#160;&#956;L of test-solution (essential oils or catechin with different concentrations). In the control solution the test-solution was replaced by ethanol. The absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 514&#160;nm.</p>

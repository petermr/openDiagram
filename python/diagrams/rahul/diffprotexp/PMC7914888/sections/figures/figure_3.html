 <caption> B16F1 cells induced to differential pigmentation and decreased proliferation, show changes in miRNA expression and, together with their molecular targets, make up potential gene interaction networks. ( a) A heat map with the relative expression levels of 55 differentially expressed miRNAs, obtained by Small RNA-seq from B16F1 cells exposed to 5 mM L-Tyr or 2.5 μg.mL −1 5-Brd-2′-dU concerning non-exposed B16F1 control cells; red, expression up, blue, expression down, and white indicator of no variation. Differential expression by using the DESeq2 program. ( b– d) Analysis of functional enrichment by KEGG signaling pathways of the potential interactions between differentially expressed miRNAs and their molecular targets in a network model, for exposure of melanoma cells to L-Tyr ( b), 5-Brd-2′-dU ( c), and 5-Brd-2′-dU with relative to L-Tyr ( d). The related KEGG signaling pathways were considered statistically significant for a p-value &lt; 0.05 after applying a hypergeometric test. </caption>

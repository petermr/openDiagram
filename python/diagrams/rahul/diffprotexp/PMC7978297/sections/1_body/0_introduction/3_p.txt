0: Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), the most commonly used plasticizer, is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that can trigger reproductive and developmental toxicity in females  1,  21.
1: Importantly, DEHP exposure impairs establishment of the ovarian reserve by delaying or reducing PF assembly  24,  25.
2: Similar observations in other studies suggest the deregulation of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor expression, and attenuation of NOTCH signaling  26.
3: Furthermore, the number of apoptotic germ cells increases during  in vitro culture of newborn ovaries exposed to DEHP for three days  25.
4: Specifically, autophagy can be induced by DEHP exposure via activating AMPK-SKP2-CARM1 signaling, thus further reducing the PF pool and damaging female fertility  27; these results indicate that DEHP affects oocyte survival during PF formation.
5: From another aspect,  in vivo and  in vitro studies both suggest that DEHP damages steroidogenesis and exerts toxicity during different stages of folliculogenesis  9,  28.
6: For example, plasticizer exposure could accelerate the development of PFs and therefore result in premature ovarian failure (POF)  29, and antral follicle depletion is increased as a result of estrogen deficiency, estrous cycle disorder, and impaired aromatase activity  4,  7,  30,  31.
7: Meanwhile, the transgenerational inheritance of DEHP has attracted considerable attention  32- 34.
8: Through maternal exposure, DEHP has been shown to exert adverse reproductive effects across generations: it reduces oocyte quality and follicle reserve in F1 female mice, and alters the same ovarian phenotype in F2 and F3 offspring; moreover, it accelerates follicular recruitment  24,  35.

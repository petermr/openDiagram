<p id="Par35">In summary, the averaged human EEG data show a reduction in beta power pre-movement in Early Adaptation compared to all other epochs. In two cats motor cortical LFP exhibited a similar pattern of modulation to the human data, with a pre-movement decrease in Early Adaptation compared to baseline and Late Adaptation, whilst a third animal showed the opposite effect. The inclusion of reaction time and reach duration as covariates in the analysis suggests that the adaptation specific modulation of beta is not related to these reach kinematics, and the lack of significant modulation of EEG data during the Early Aftereffect epoch also suggests that the beta modulation is not related to error feedback signals.</p>

<p>The genome in an organism is the storage of genetic information. mRNA is the prerequisite of gene expression, and the protein level is the executive of the gene function. In order to verify whether the changes at the gene level are consistent with the protein level, qPCR verification was employed for the selected proteins. OsAPx02, CatC, riPHGPX, CYS and metE proteins were selected for qPCR verification (

 <italic>metE</italic> genes were consistent with the protein levels. In addition, the

 <italic>CatC</italic> and 
 <italic>CYS</italic> genes, which were down-regulated by S727 protein, disclosed an alternative insight at the mRNA level relative to S3057. Many studies have reported unrelated or negative correlations between proteomics and transcriptomes. The main reason behind it is probably the post-translational modification (phosphorylation, glycosylation, etc.) of proteins, affecting protein secretion and degradation [

Post-regulatory effects greatly influence the expression of different gene levels, while certain inconsistency in them leads to abnormal expression. The stability of mRNA after genetic transcription could be related to specific nucleotides and corresponding binding proteins [

0: Aging, a spontaneous and complex process with the passage of time, is one of the most important risk factors for increasing susceptibility to multiple diseases  [1].
1: It involves much morphological and functional deterioration in biological systems, which are associated with various molecular, cellular, and organic changes  [2].
2: Aging features a progressive accumulation of oxidative agents associated with decreased efficiency of antioxidant defense mechanisms.
3: Related to this is a progressive decrease in immune activity or immune senescence.
4: As animals age, their mitochondrial function and thus cellular metabolism systematically decline, leading to a loss of cellular homeostasis and the occurrence of multiple disorders  [3],  [4].
5: Thus, a number of efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms of the processes of aging and to discover new compounds that retain antiaging activities.

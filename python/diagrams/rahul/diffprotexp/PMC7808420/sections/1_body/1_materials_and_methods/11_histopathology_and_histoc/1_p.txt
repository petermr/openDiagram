0: Mice were euthanized and perfused with 15 mL of PBS and 15 mL of buffered 4% v/v formaldehyde, for the collection of brains.
1: Sections (5 m thick) were made in a rostral to caudal fashion, mounted and stained in H&E.
2: Regarding the histochemical staining, brain sections were incubated in borate buffer, washed and blocked in 10% w/v casein (Vector Laboratories).
3: Sections were incubated with either rabbit anti-IBA-1 (1:500; Wako Chemicals) or rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibodies (1:300; Merck Millipore) following incubation with a biotinylated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories).
4: After peroxidase inactivation, sections were incubated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes (ABC solution, Vector Laboratories, USA) and revealed in a diaminobenzidine/nickel/glucose oxidase solution.
5: Staining specificity was confirmed by comparison brain sections without primary antibody.

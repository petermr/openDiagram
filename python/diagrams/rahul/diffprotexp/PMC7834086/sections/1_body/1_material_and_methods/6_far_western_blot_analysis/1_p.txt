0: Far-Western blot analysis, as previously described [ 20], was also used to ascertain the interaction between PirB and histone H4.
1: First, 1 g of the purified proteins (i.e.
2: rGST, rGST-PirB or rPiB) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes.
3: Next, membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk dissolved in TBST before being incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the supernatant from the pET-32a- Pvhistone H4 lysate extracted from  E. coli BL21.
4: Membranes were then incubated with mouse anti-His antibody (1:3000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China) followed by HRP-linked goat anti-mouse antibody (1:3000, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) as described in subsection 2.2.

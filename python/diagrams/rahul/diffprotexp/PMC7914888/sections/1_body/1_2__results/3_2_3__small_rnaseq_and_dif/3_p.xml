<p>Similarities and differences in the expression of the miRNAs obtained in cells exposed to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU concerning the control were shown with heat maps. We exclusively included the list of differentially expressed miRNAs (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01591">Figure S2g,h</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f003">Figure 3</xref>a the patterns obtained were common in overexpression for miR-30d-5p, miR-129-5p, miR-99b-5p, and miR-191-5p and of under-expression for members of the 
 <italic>let</italic>-7 family (a-5p, d-5p), and the miRNAs, miR-23a-3p and miR-361-5p. The miR-211-5p was the only miRNA that presented overexpression in cells exposed to L-Tyr and under-expression with 5-Brd-2′-dU. However, the comparison of miRNAs differentially expressed in cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU concerning L-Tyr yielded another set of miRNAs with orders in differential expression not visualized under the previous comparison exposure model the control (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01591">Figure S2f,i</xref>). Since this case’s expression level was not the same, the exposure to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU may generate changes in some miRNAs’ expression in a differential way. (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01591">Figure S2i</xref>). Overall, the miRNAs’ expression revealed a different expression profile in B16 cells in response to exposure to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU. This profile was related to the observed differential pigmentation, proliferation, and senescence changes induced in this cellular model.

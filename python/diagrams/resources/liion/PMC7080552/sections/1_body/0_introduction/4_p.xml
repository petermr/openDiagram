<p>Herein a new smelting reaction generated 3D Mg doped Li–LiB alloy (hereinafter called Li–B–Mg composite), which is mainly composed of LiB skeleton and free Li with a few dissolved Mg, is presented as a promising alternative anode for LMBs. The unique 3D composite microstructure endows the Li–B–Mg composite with several advantages. First, the 3D LiB compound fiber skeleton which is in situ formed acts as a host for Li plating/stripping, so significant volume variation could be reduced during the Li electrochemical dissolution/deposition process. Second, the superlithiophilic conductive 3D skeleton also plays an important role in retarding Li dendrites growth owing to the reduced local current density and the homogeneous regulation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> deposition. Third, the addition of Mg element to the 3D LiB skeleton fundamentally enhances the adsorption energy of Li according to the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. It has been reported that the Li(Mg) alloy could not only produce a lower interfacial resistance, but also maintain the structural integrity of the 3D Li–B–Mg composite architecture.

 <sub>2</sub> cathode performed a longer cycle lifespan than that of the pure Li metal. It is also worth mentioning that large‐scale fabrication of Li–B–Mg composite with a tailored structure can be achieved, providing a favorable support for its potential industrialization.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, MCODE plugin from Cytoscape software (version 3.8.0) was performed to detect clusters of DEGs. Then, functional analysis of the genes in the hub module 1 were performed through the DAVID. Meanwhile, the top 20 hub genes were screened by the topological algorithm Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) using the CytoHubba [

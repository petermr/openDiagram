<p>Water vapor binding to birnessite was also monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. All FTIR spectra were collected with a Bruker Vertex 70/V FTIR spectrometer, equipped with a DLaTGS detector. The spectra were collected in the 600–4000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> range at a resolution of 4.0 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> and at a forward/reverse scanning rate of 10 kHz. Each spectrum was an average of 500 scans.

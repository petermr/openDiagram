 <caption> (a) Side view of the birnessite structure with an idealized 1-layer (1 W) interlayer hydration state of 1.33 H 2O (red/pink) per unit cell. Sheets of Mn octahedra (brown/beige) are connected through edge-sharing basal oxygens (red). Charge imbalance caused by Mn III and Mn II is compensated by interlayer countercations (purple) and/or vacancies (not shown). (b) Basal face view of a single water layer, also partially hydrating interlayer countercations, in this case, K +. These images were generated by a snapshot of a molecular dynamics simulations and then edited for illustration purposes. </caption>

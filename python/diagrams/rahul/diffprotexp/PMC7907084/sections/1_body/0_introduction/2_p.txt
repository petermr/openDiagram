0: It is clear that in vertebrates, such as in mammals, each ovarian follicle has a complex structure.
1: The oocyte is encircled by granulosa cells (GC) and theca cells.
2: The oocyte growth depends on these cells for nutrients transportation and mechanical support.
3: Theca cells do not undergo obvious change in their morphology and function during follicular development.
4: In the early stage, GC undergo dramatic morphological change, transiting from a squamous cell shape into a cuboidal one 1.
5: In the later stages (eg antral follicles and preovulatory follicles), GC can be further divided into mural GC which are distal to the oocyte and cumulus GC which surround the oocyte.
6: GC seems to play key roles in orchestrating oocyte-somatic cell crosstalk and the secretion of steroids and peptide hormones (e.g.
7: progesterone, and inhibins) 4,  5, thus coordinating oocyte development and the release of pituitary gonadotropins (eg FSH/LH).

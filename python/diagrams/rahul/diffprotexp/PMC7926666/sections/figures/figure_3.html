 <caption> Diagnostic and prognostic performance analysis results for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) subtypes. ( A) Principal component analyses (PCA) plots, visualized by considering s-DIPs, indicating the individual differences in the gene expression profiles in tumor samples among the subtypes. ( B) Kaplan–Meier curves estimating patients’ survival for three subtypes based on categorization of patients into high- and low-risk groups via prognostic index. ccRCC: Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma; pRCC: Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma; chRCC: Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma; HR: Hazard Ratio; PC: Principal component. </caption>

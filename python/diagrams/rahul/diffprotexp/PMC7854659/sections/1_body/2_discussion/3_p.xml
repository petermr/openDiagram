<p id="Par21">To provide an overview of the gene expression relationship across the fetal tissues studied, we prioritized informative genes from TS, TF, and DEG analyses. This integrative framework allowed us to dissect the geneâ€“gene interactions within and across tissues, uncovering new insights into how these relationships may be rewired due to maternal nutrition

 <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18a</xref>. For the PTCDA, the first charge is higher than the theoretical capacity of 137 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>. It reaches 160 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> because of the formation of SEI at the graphite anode surface. In fact, anodes in general

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>
 </sup>, especially graphite anodes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>
 </sup>, sustain high first-cycle active lithium losses (ALL), which results from lithium-consuming parasitic reactions, such as the formation of an SEI
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>
 </sup>. In particular, carbons and graphites with high surface areas result in more SEI formations and thus higher ALL
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>
 </sup>. In general, the loss of active lithium resulting from its consumption in the positive electrode material permanently reduces the available energy. When the PTCDA/graphite battery is discharged, a small quantity of lithium is irreversibly consumed by the anode, and only 104 and 108 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> are obtained when the cathode is made of 50 and 60 mg of PTCDA, respectively. The long-term cycling experiments at C/10 for these batteries are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18b</xref>. As observed in graphite electrodes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI12</xref>), a continuous capacity loss upon cycling occurs in complete PTCDA/graphite batteries mainly because of the graphite anode’s consumption of lithium. A slight improvement is observed when the mass of prelithiated PTCDA increases because of the higher amount of available lithium. For this reason, future works will focus on the optimization of cathode/anode active mass ratios. Additional tests (e.g., prelithiation of anode) that could lead to the realization of a full organic battery with a stable capacity of approximately 120 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> should be planned.

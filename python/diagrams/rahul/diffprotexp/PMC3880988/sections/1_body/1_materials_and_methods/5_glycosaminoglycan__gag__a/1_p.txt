0: GAG content of the culture supernatant of MSC, cMSC and AC groups was performed using Blyscan glycosaminoglycan assay kit (Biocolor Ltd, Co Antrim, UK).
1: Briefly, the aliquot of each sample was mixed with DMMB dye and reagents (Biocolor) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2: The absorbance was measured at 656 nm using nanophotometer (Implen, Munchen, Germany).
3: Values from GAG analysis were normalized to the protein content (ng GAG/g protein).

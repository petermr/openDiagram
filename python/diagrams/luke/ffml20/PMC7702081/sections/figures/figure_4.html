 <caption> Vibrational density of states (VDOS) from ab initio MD. (A) VDOS of pure water showing the vibrational (HB stretch) and librational bands. (B) Comparison of the VDOS of pure water and of the water molecules in the first hydration shell of Mg 2+ and Ca 2+. The first shells were defined by the position of the first minimum of the Mg−O (3.0 Å) and Ca−O (3.2 Å) RDFs. </caption>

 <caption> Differential gene expression in key signaling pathways shaping MN differentiation. Gene transcript levels were determined by global RNA-seq analysis of ( a) TGFβ, ( b) Notch, and ( c) Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathways and ( d) Calcium signaling. Fold change was calculated relative to RNA reads in iPSC (D0). The statistics (average value and standard error) were derived from three independent biological replicas with p &lt; 0.001 determined by R-statistical analysis package </caption>

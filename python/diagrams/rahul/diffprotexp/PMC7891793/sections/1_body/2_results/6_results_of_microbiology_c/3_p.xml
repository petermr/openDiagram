<p>As previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] viral shedding from nasal swab qRT-PCR measurements showed the highest levels of virus particles shed for group 1 followed by group 2 and placebo with peak shedding on days 5â€“6, and a return to baseline by day 10 when necropsy was performed and tissues were sampled for pathology and RNA sequence analysis. Group 6 had significantly less viral shedding than any other group.

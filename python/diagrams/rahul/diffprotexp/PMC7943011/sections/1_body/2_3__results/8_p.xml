<p>A more detailed pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins distinguished between effects caused by either metformin or insulin compared to untreated HEC-1A control cells (metformin vs. control: 47 proteins; insulin vs. control: 40 proteins) and was carried out with the DAVID database (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). GO and KEGG annotations were considered relevant, if the following criteria were met: protein counts ≥ 10% (metformin vs. control: ≥ 5 counts; insulin vs. control: ≥ 4 counts) and 
 <italic>p</italic> values ≤ 0.001 (from DAVID analysis).

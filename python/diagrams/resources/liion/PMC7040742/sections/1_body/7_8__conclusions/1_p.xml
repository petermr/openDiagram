<p>The exponential growth of the LIB market has put pressure on environment and natural resources. Introducing secondary resources from recycling will reduce the environmental footprint of LIB manufacturing. The quantity of spent batteries available for recycling is increasing, especially with the arrival of the first generation of electric cars. However, significantly low collection rates have been achieved owing to safety issues, bad chain public information, deficient regulation/enforcement, low recycling process efficiencies, high transportation costs, and high recycling cost. Accordingly, actors in LIB supply chain have not yet adopted the circular economy principles. </p>

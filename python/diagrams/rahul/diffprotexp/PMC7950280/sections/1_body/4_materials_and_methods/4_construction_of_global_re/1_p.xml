<p>The scatter diagram of the module membership (MM) and gene significance (GS), respectively representing intramodular connectivity and genetic phenotype, was plotted using the verboseScatterplot function [
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We selected the modules with the strongest positive or negative correlation with phenotypes to construct the global regulatory network in the STRING database (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes,

<p>Ricin aerosol particles ranged from 0.7 to 1 μm (in diameters). The average weight of the mice in Group E (experimental group, ricin exposure) increased gradually during the first 24 h post-exposure, but the growth rate was lower than that of Group C (

After 24 h, the average weight of the mice in Group E began to drop. 24–48 h after the exposure, more than half of the mice in Group E showed malaise, lower mobility, somnolence, and dark eyes. 48–60 h after the exposure, the mice in Group E stopped eating, exhibited even lower mobility, had messy hair on their back, and showed shortness of breath accompanied with murmurs. Their eye color deepened and tail veins turned purple. Then the mice started to die one after another, with the survival rate falling rapidly. 62 h after the exposure, 97% of the mice died from difficulty in breathing and transient mania (

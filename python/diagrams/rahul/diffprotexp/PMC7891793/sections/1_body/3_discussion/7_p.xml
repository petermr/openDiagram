<p>Another gene that deserves special attention is “purine nucleoside phosphorylase” or PNP. Changes in the expression of this gene may have potential clinical implications. Expression of this gene was lower in lung tissue with lesion. It may have had a protective antiviral effect to reduce viral replication by slowing down purine metabolism, or it may have had a negative effect on kinetics of antiviral drugs such as ribavirin. This antiviral has an effect on many RNA viruses including RSV, by inhibition of RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The antiviral used in this study has a different mechanism of action than ribavirin but some mechanisms by which the host responds to this antiviral may be in common. PNP is a key enzyme required for bioavailability of ribavirin [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Lower PNP levels in lung tissue with lesion may reduce phosphorylation of ribavirin and impair the antiviral effect of this drug. However, reduced expression of PNP is most likely a part of the cellular intrinsic virus- or stress-induced protection mechanism. Additionally, expression of ADA (adenosine deaminase), which is also responsible for the purine metabolism, was significantly lower in lung tissue with lesion in all treatment groups. It has been demonstrated that adenosine deaminase enzyme acting on RNA 1 (ADAR-1) is responsible for interactions with some RNA viruses and supports their replication [

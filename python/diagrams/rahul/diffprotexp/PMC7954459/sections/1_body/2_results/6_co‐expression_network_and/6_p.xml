<p>Further, we analyzed the enrichment of GO terms among target genes of miRNAs showing opposite expression pattern between JGK 3 and Himchana 1 at the S5 stage (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). Targets of miRNAs in these modules showed the enrichment of organ growth and cell proliferation terms, suggesting that growth/proliferation may be negatively regulated by miRNAs in Himchana 1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). Our previous study suggested higher level of endoreduplication, grain filling, and cell expansion at the S5 stage as the probable reasons for larger seed size/weight in JGK 3 (Garg et al.,

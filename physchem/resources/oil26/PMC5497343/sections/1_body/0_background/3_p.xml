 <italic>T. minuta</italic> is commonly called nnkayo by the Xkosa people, a tribe in the Easter Cape Province, South Africa. 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> has been reported to have a long record of human use for insect repellent, treatment of stomach and intestinal diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There has been heightened interest of late in plant-based natural products that have the ability to reduce free radicals formation and treating infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms. There is however scarce information on antibacterial and antioxidant properties as well as the chemical constituents of the essential oil flower of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> grown in Cala community, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa that is claimed to be potent against many infections. This study therefore aimed to evaluate antibacterial, antioxidant properties and the chemical constituents of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower grown in Cala community South Africa.

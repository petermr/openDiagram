<p id="Par17">After the treatment period, each explant was transferred to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, lysed in QIAzol reagent and homogenized in a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen) for 5 min at 50 Hz, using one 3.2 mm stainless steel bead per tube. mRNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. RNA was eluted in RNase-free water. RNA concentrations were determined with a Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at − 80 °C. RNA was transported on dry ice to the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core for further processing. Each treatment group within a given experiment (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5) was performed in triplicate (3 separate villous explants from the same placenta). RNA from triplicates were pooled according to the treatment group within the experiment. In total, RNA was analyzed from 10 explant samples (5 placentas and with 2 treatment groups).

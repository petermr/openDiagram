0: Besides the 3 UTR, APA sites are also found in the coding region, thus affecting translation.
1: As described before, if the usage of coding region APA sites is increased, it is referred as CDS-prefer, or UTR-prefer otherwise [ 16].
2: A total of 149 genes (FDR < 0.01) showed switching events between coding region and 3 UTR, and 27 genes showed different tendencies at different time points after infection (Fig.
3: 6a).
4: As the results suggest, genes tend to use more APA sites in 3 UTR at 110 hpi After 10 hpi, the usage of APA sites in coding region prevails (Fig.
5: 6b).
6: APA sites located in the coding region could affect translation and cause premature translation termination.
7: Thus, we explored the function of these CDS-preferred APA genes and found that CDS-preferred genes mainly participate in cellular process and metabolic process (Fig.
8: 6c).

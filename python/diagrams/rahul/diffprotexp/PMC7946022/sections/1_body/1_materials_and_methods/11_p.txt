0: Effect of biofilm DNAse treatment on vancomycin susceptibility of lrgA and lrgB   S. aureus mutants .
1: Effect of biofilm DNAse I treatment on vancomycin susceptibility was evaluated as previously described [ 33], with modifications.
2: 24 hr-preformed biofilms of the WT, lrgA and lrgB strains were grown as described above; following removal of non-biofilm cells, DNAse I (0.625 mg/ml), vancomycin (200, 100, 50 and 25 g/ml) or a combination of both were added to appropriate wells.
3: Following 24 hrs incubation at 37C, metabolic activity of biofilm cells was measured using MTS-assay.
4: Control wells with no treatment were included; DNAse I optimal activity concentration was pre-determined in a doseresponse assay (data not shown).

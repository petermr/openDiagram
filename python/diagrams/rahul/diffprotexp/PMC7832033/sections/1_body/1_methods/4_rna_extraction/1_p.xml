<p>Total RNA was extracted from Tempus-stabilized blood using the MagMAXâ„¢ for Stabilized Blood Tubes RNA Isolation Kit (Life technologies). Total RNA concentration and its purity were assessed by determining the A260/280 and A260/230 ratios, respectively on the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA integrity number (RIN) was assessed with the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit on 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Genomic DNA contamination was checked by RT-qPCR using primers for the Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (

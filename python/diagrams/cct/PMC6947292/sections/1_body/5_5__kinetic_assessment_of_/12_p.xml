<p>The main model outputs that are directly amenable to comparison with available data are the predictions for the total specific precipitation enthalpy after cooling and hardness after additional ageing. These comparisons are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f040">Figure 40</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f041">Figure 41</xref> for AlMgSi alloys and in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f055">Figure 55</xref> for AlZnMg(Cu) alloys. It is clear that the model works well for a wide range of alloys.

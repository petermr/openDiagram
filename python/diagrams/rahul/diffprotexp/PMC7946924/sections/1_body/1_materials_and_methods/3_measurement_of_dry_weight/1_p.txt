0: The apical and basal spikelet samples of the panicle from the main shoot of the plants were collected at 5 day intervals from day of anthesis (0 day) up to 30 days post-anthesis period and dried inside an oven at 80 C for 1 h and kept as such at 37 C for 72 h till constant weight.
1: The dry weight was recorded in an electronic balance and the results were presented in the form of a logistic growth curve \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ {\text{W}}\left( {\text{t}} \right)= {\text{ Wo M }}/ [{\text{Wo }} + \left( {{\text{M }} - {\text{ Wo}}} \right)^{{{-}{\text{kt}}}} ], $$\end{document}Wt=Wo M/[Wo+M-Wo-kt],where W (t), grain weight at a particular time t; Wo, initial grain weight; M, maximum grain weight; k, growth rate constant calculated from Microsoft Excel solver, 2007; t, time.
2: The k values in apical and basal spikelets of SR-157 are 0.196397 and 0.170065 whereas the values in apical and basal spikelets of SR-159 are 0.209456 and 0.197954, respectively (Fig.
3: 1).
4: The dried samples were subsequently converted into powder form and boiled in aqueous methanol for 10 min and the extract was collected in a volumetric flask.
5: The residue was boiled for second time in 50% methanol and both the extracts were pooled together and volume was adjusted to mark with distilled water.
6: Aliquot of the extract was used for estimation of soluble sugars using PhenolSulfuric acid reagent measuring absorbance at 490 nm 24.
7: The residue after methanolic extraction was boiled with 3% HCl for 3 h in a water bath to convert the starch into glucose and the glucose released was measured quantitatively 24.
8: The results were expressed in terms of starch by multiplying a factor of 0.9 (Fig.
9: 2).

0: Adhesive tape sampling is a non-invasive method that allows recovery of cells comprising and associated with the epidermal stratum corneum and granulosum.
1: 2834 Studies in atopic dermatitis (AD), contact dermatitis, psoriasis and melanoma have used non-invasive tape sampling to investigate disease-specific gene profiles and identify genomic tumour phenotypes and disease-associated transcriptomic endotypes.
2: 28 29 3337 Despite the basal epidermal, junctional and dermal anatomic locations of morphological changes in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and DLE, as keratinocytes express increased levels of IFN-I and IFN-III genes and IFN-inducible genes within CLE lesions 13 19 38 39 and local IFN may invoke a hypersensitive response in lupus keratinocytes, 40 we hypothesised that expression of specific gene signatures in the epidermis would be detected at the site of skin lesions, and perhaps also in non-adjacent unaffected skin in participants with CLE.

<p>Seeds at different stages of development (S1–S7) in a small‐seeded (Himchana 1) and a large‐seeded (JGK 3) chickpea (
 <italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> L.) cultivar were collected from the field‐grown plants as described in the previous study (Garg et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Seeds from 5 to 40 days after pollination (DAP), representing S1–S7 stages, along with mature leaves were collected from both cultivars. These stages of seed development represent, early embryogenesis (S1), mid‐embryogenesis (S2), late‐embryogenesis (S3) early maturation (S4), mid‐maturation (S5), late‐maturation (S6), and just before dry (S7) as described previously (Garg et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Total RNA was extracted from two biological replicates of these tissues/samples using TRI reagent (Sigma Life Science) as described (Garg et al.,

0: Early routine genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the National Reference Center (NRC) of Respiratory Viruses is based on daily random selection of samples with SARS-CoV-2 detected with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct)<20 [ 6], which were then sequenced using an RNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) method previously described [ 19].
1: Briefly, viral genetic material contained in nasopharyngeal and stool samples was extracted by the EMAG platform (bioMerieux, Lyon, FR).
2: After DNAse treatment (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), samples underwent random amplification using Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA2 kit, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, DE) before sequencing on an Illumina NextSeqTM 550 with mid-output 2  150 flow cell.
3: Importantly, the variants displaying an ORF6 deletion were confirmed by 3 other techniques, including capture- and amplicon-based strategies [ 23].
4: Sequencing of patient samples began on February 8th and is ongoing.
5: For the stool sample, an amplicon-based approach developed by the ARTIC network ( https://artic.network/ncov-2019) combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing was used.

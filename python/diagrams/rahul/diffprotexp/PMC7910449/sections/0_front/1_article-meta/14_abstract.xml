 <p id="Par1">At present, no systematic and in-depth study is available on the function and potential mechanisms of circular RNA in autophagy. This study aimed to screen the expression profiles of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA of ovarian cancer cells induced by Torin 1 (10 µM). The expression profiles of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA were analyzed with next-generation sequencing technology. CircRAB11FIP1 expression was elevated in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues than in normal ovarian tissues. Silencing circRAB11FIP1 inhibited the autophagic flux of ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells. However, circRAB11FIP1 overexpression activated the autophagic flux of ovarian cancer A2780 cells. CircRAB11FIP1-induced autophagy accelerated EOC proliferation and invasion. Also, circRAB11FIP1 directly bound to miR-129 and regulated its targets ATG7 and ATG14. CircRAB11FIP1 bound to desmocollin 1to facilitate its interaction with ATG101. Also, circRAB11FIP1 directly bound to the mRNA of fat mass and obesity-associated protein and promoted its expression. Then, circRAB11FIP1 mediated mRNA expression levels of ATG5 and ATG7 depending on m6A. In general, this study demonstrated that circRAB11FIP1 regulated ATG7 and ATG14 by sponging miR-129. The data suggested that circRAB11FIP1 might serve as a candidate biomarker for EOC diagnosis and treatment.</p>

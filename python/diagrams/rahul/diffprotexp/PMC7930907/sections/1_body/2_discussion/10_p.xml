 <italic>Gla</italic> is widely found in 27 different tissues in the human body, including the adrenal gland, bone marrow, brain, adipose tissue, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, uterus, placenta, spleen, stomach, and other tissues. 
 <italic>Gla</italic> gene inactivity or deficiency will lead to Fabry disease, mainly affecting the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, skin, lung, and nervous system, ultimately leading to multiple organ damage. Patients showed nerve injury in the early stage of Fabry disease, with the main symptoms of paroxysmal burning pain in the extremities in childhood and then relief in adulthood. With the increase of age, the severity of kidney injury increases. Some patients present with renal failure at approximately 30 years old (

 <italic>Gla</italic> gene expression in PAT may lead to renal failure and some cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal parenchymal injury.

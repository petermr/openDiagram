0: The biofilm-forming capabilities of  E. coli strains DH5 and 55989  agg3  expressing the different AAF variants were tested as described by Reisner and colleagues [ 29] with the following modifications: the bacterial strains plated on LB agar containing the suitable antibiotics and incubated overnight at 37C.
1: A single colony was inoculated in 2 ml LB medium containing the suitable antibiotics and grown overnight at 37C and 180 rpm for 7 h. Afterward, the starter cultures were diluted 1:100 in 3 ml LB medium containing the suitable antibiotics and incubated at 37C and 180 rpm for 16 h. The cultures were diluted to OD 600 0.05 using fresh medium supplemented with arabinose 1% (w/v).
2: Per 96-well plate (clear U-bottom, PVC; Corning, New York, USA), eight wells per strain were filled with 140 l each, and plates were kept static at 37C (or 30C or 20C, respectively) for 48 h. In order to minimize evaporation, plates were kept in a metal box lined with moist paper towels.
3: Afterward, the wells were washed three times with 200 l PBS and the plate was dried at 80C for 1 h. Staining of biofilm was done by incubation with 175 l crystal violet (CV) (0.1%) per well for 1 h at room temperature.
4: The CV solution was removed, and the wells were washed three times with double distilled H 2O (ddH2O) and dried for 1 h. For the quantification of biofilm production, each well was treated with 200 l destaining solution (80% ethanol, 20% acetone) for 30 min.
5: Afterward, 100 l were transferred to a new 96-well plate and the OD was measured using a Tecan Infinite F200 plate reader at 595 nm.
6: For each strain and condition, we tested three independent biological replicates with six technical repeats each.
7: Data evaluation was done as described by Stepanovic and colleagues.
8: The cutoff OD (ODc) was defined as three standard deviations above the mean OD of the negative control values [ 30].
9: Therefore, all tested samples shown in  Figure 6, except for the bacteria expressing AAF/III and AAF/V, produced significantly more biofilm than the negative control.

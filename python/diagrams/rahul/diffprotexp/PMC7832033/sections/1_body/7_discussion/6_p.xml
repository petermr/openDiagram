<p>Strengths of our study were the multi-center design, prospective subject enrolment and sample collection, serial sampling over time in a subset of patients, and validation of selected findings. Some limitations are the relatively small number of samples in the discovery cohort, enrolment into our study only after the diagnosis of melioidosis was confirmed (rather than at the time of admission to hospital), and validation of only a subset of genes.</p>

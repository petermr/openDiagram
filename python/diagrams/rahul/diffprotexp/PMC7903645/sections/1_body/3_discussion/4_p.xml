<p id="Par49">Infection, mainly due to malaria, HIV, and parasites, is known to be a major etiological factor for PTB globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Consistently, we found that the malaria and African trypanosomiasis pathways were enriched in genes in the CI group. These findings indicate the presence of many underestimated infections in CI that are unidentified by traditional microorganism culture, and current culture techniques are extremely limited as diagnostic tests for infection at the amniotic fluid and systemic levels. Moreover, the pathways we identified as being enriched in genes with the maintenance of pregnancy were NOD-like receptor and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways, which are associated with the innate immune response. Therefore, our findings suggest that immunological responses at the maternalâ€“fetal interface and systemic levels play an important role in prolonging pregnancy by modulating inflammatory responses and preventing infection in CI.

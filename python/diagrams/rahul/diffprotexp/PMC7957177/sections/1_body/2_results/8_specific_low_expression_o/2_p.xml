<p>CRISP2, previously known as testis‐specific protein 1, belongs to a family of cysteine‐rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) and is strongly expressed in male reproductive tissues, including the testis, prostate and epididymis.

 </xref> CRISP2 mediates spermatogenesis, modulation of flagellar motility, acrosome reaction and gamete fusion.

 </xref> CRISP2 is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of the lesion but is localized around the nucleus. As indicated in Figure 
 <xref rid="cam43799-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, CRISP2 was significantly highly expressed in LSIL but less expressed in HSIL, which corresponds to the results of gene expression analysis. In contrast to its expression in other histological grades, CRISP2 is a specific lowly expressed biomarker for HSIL.

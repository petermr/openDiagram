<p id="Par9">We also observed a significant fivefold change in some of the genes associated with developmental process; anatomical structural development/morphogenesis and molecular functions. Erythrocyte membrane protein (EPB41), retinoic acid receptor responder protein 1 (RARRES1), alpha-actinin-3 (ACTN3), ETS-related transcription factor (Elf-3), fatty acid desaturase 1-like (FADS1), Prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta polypeptide (P4HB), NADH dehydrogenase subunitÂ 5 (NDUFV2), Pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPFL), PCNA-associated factor(PCLAF) and few uncharacterized genes were found to be upregulated for having more than 5 log fold upregulation of gene expression. Similarly, RYR1, MYO1B, MYL2, MYL6, CD63, MYLPF, PCLAF, MYO16, GRIP2, BIN1, LUC7L3, FGB, ANXA2, MYOZ3 and among other genes were found to be regulated austerely in all time points (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Most of the genes involved were associated with supramolecular assembly, muscle cells regulation/contraction and multiprotein signalling complex. This in turn relates to crucial involvement and regulation of genes in initiating process for haemostasis &amp; wound healing phase.

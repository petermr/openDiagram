<p id="p0085">SERPINC1 (antithrombin-III) inhibits thrombin and other serine proteases of the coagulation system, and regulates the blood coagulation cascade. The related pathways encompass platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, as well as the clotting cascade. Postoperative hemostatic disorders manifest as both hypo- and hyper-coagulation, with thrombinemia in most cases. Patients with urosepsis show latent hyper-coagulation phase of DIC. There is insufficient evidence to support SERPINC1substitution in any category of critically ill participants, including those with sepsis and DIC. SERPINC1 does not impact mortality, but increases the risk of bleeding.

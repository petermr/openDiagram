<p>To investigate the role of E-selectin in endothelia–monocyte interactions in KD, we performed cell adhesion assays. HCAECs were pretreated with specific siRNA of E-selectin (sense: 5′-GGUUGAAUGCACCACUCAATT-3′ and antisense: 5′-UUGAGUGGUGCAUUCAACCTT-3′) or negative control siRNA (sense: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ and antisense: 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′) for 72 h before culturing with sera of KD subjects with CAL or without CAL for another 4 h, incubating with BCECF-AM-labeled THP-1 cells for 1 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A–C</xref>, the adhesion of THP-1 cells was significantly increased in the CAL+ group compared with the CAL– group, while this process was significantly rescued by siRNA of E-selectin.

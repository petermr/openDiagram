<p>Since the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrite could be ascribed to the inhomogeneous Li‐ion flux and deposition, it is of great significance to develop SCEs with uniform Li ion transportation channels for a homogeneous Li deposition. Zhang co‐workers

Since the anions are immobilized, it is much easier for Li ions to diffuse from the bulk electrolyte to the anode surface that establishes a relative stable and uniform interface for Li ion deposition, which can effectively suppress the lithium dendrite growth. The Li/Li symmetrical cell can steadily cycle for more than 400 h with a constant voltage polarization of 15 mV at 60 °C and a current density of 0.10 mA cm

<p>Co–Fe oxides have been also proposed in several studies. However, the role of Fe and whether it really improves the catalytic properties of cobalt oxides remain under discussion.

 </sup> The majority of the existing studies on Co–Fe systems highlight the role of edge-sharing CoO

 </sup> Amorphization and the formation of edge-sharing CoO
 <sub>6</sub> units under OER conditions were observed also in Ca
 <sub>2</sub>FeCoO
 <sub>5</sub> perovskite-type catalysts.

 </sup> Good agreement between Co K-edge XANES and EXAFS, and those for a CoOOH reference was observed also in the study of Pb–Co–Fe catalysts.

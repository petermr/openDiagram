0: Figure 16(   a) First charge () and discharge (   ) obtained at a constant current of C/24 between 2 and 4 V versus graphite in an LFP/graphite battery.
1: A paper Kodoshi separator is used, and an excess of the anode capacity is employed.
2: (   b) The corresponding long cycling experiment is performed at a 1 C rate.
3: The full and empty characters represent the Coulombic efficiency (%) and discharge capacity, respectively.

<p>Apart from the control group, LPS-induced HK-2 cells were accordingly divided into the following groups: LPS group, LPS + inhibitor group (transfected with 30 nM miR-34b-5p inhibitor), LPS + inhibitor NC group (transfected with the negative control of miR-34b-5p inhibitor), LPS + mimic group (transfected with 30 nM miR-34b-5p mimic), LPS + mimic NC group (transfected with the negative control of miR-34b-5p mimic), LPS + pcDNA3.1 group (transfected with empty pcDNA3.1), LPS + pcDNA3.1-AQP2 group (transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1-AQP2), LPS + si-AQP2 group (transfected with 2 μg of si-AQP2), LPS + si-NC group (transfected with the negative control of si-AQP2), LPS + inhibitor NC + si-NC group (co-transfected with the negative controls of miR-34b-5p inhibitor and si-AQP2), LPS + inhibitor + si-NC group (co-transfected with miR-34b-5p inhibitor and the negative control of si-AQP2), and LPS + inhibitor + si-AQP2 group (co-transfected with miR-34b-5p inhibitor and si-AQP2). All plasmids were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, China) and transfected into the cells

 </sup>. In India, salt-affected soils occupy an area of about 6.73 million ha of which saline and sodic soils constitute roughly 40% and 60%, respectively. Soil salinity is an increasing problem for agriculture, affecting the most productive crop areas of the world. The agricultural production is, therefore, threatened by unavailability of more agricultural land and few salt-resistant varieties. This makes it imperative to develop salt stress resistant crop plants.

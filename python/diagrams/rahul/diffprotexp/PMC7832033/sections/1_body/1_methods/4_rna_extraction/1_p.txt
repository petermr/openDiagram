0: Total RNA was extracted from Tempus-stabilized blood using the MagMAXTM for Stabilized Blood Tubes RNA Isolation Kit (Life technologies).
1: Total RNA concentration and its purity were assessed by determining the A260/280 and A260/230 ratios, respectively on the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
2: RNA integrity number (RIN) was assessed with the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit on 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
3: Genomic DNA contamination was checked by RT-qPCR using primers for the Peptidylprolyl isomerase A ( PPIA) gene [ 16].

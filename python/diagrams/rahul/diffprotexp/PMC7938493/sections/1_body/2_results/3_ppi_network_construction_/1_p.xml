<p id="Par52">To further explore the roles of differential RBPs in BLCA, Cytoscape was used to establish a PPI network comprising 373 nodes and 4063 edges based on the STRING database (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Furthermore, the lines between the top 10 interacting proteins bolded according to the interaction scores. Subsequently, we used the MODE tool to analyse the co-expression network to identify the potential key modules. The most important modules comprised 104 nodes and 1151 edges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). KEGG pathway analysis showed that the RBPs in these key modules were enriched for ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, spliceosomes, mRNA surveillance pathways, RNA polymerases, Huntington disease, cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways, RNA transport, RNA degradation, ribosomes, and legionellosis.

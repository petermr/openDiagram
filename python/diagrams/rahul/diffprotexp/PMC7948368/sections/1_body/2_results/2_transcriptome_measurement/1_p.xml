<p id="Par39">PCA of the dataset revealed one principal component contributing significantly to sample variance (&gt; 10%) which was adjusted for during downstream differential expression analysis. There was no correlation between this principal component and age, gender, DMARD use, baseline DAS28, DAS28 components, RIN, or RNA extraction batch. Differentially expressed transcripts between response groups and time-points were defined by a fold change &gt; 1.2 and a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05. No significant differential expression was observed between good- and non-responders at either pre-treatment or 3 months and no significant changes were observed in non-responders between pre-treatment and 3 months. However, 813 transcripts were differentially expressed between time-points in good-responders, mapping to 491 unique genes. This comprised 202 transcripts that were more- and 611 transcripts that were less-abundant at 3 months, compared with the pre-treatment sample (Additional file

Testing was performed to identify whether adjusting for RIN in the analysis was important, but this adjustment did not qualitatively change the results. RIN was not included in the final analysis because it was not available for all samples (

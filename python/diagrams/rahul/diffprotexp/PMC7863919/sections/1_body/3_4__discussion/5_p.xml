<p>The generalization of our results should be done cautiously, and we have to emphasize an important limitation of our clinical data analysis. The numbers of patients included in the analysis are probably too low to draw a firm conclusion and the group is not representative of the general population, especially in the case of patients suffering from Cushingâ€™s disease. Since the primary aim of our study was molecular profiling of tumor tissue, we intentionally preselected large tumors, which allowed us to have enough tissue for DNA/RNA isolation and successful molecular procedures.</p>

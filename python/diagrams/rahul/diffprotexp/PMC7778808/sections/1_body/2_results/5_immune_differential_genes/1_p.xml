<p id="Par37">To further clarify the relationship between VTE and immune genes, we combined the selected DEGs and the immune genes of the IMMPORT database to obtain a total of 3 immune differential genes S100A12, NR1D2 and CD3G. Compared with the control group, S100A12, NR1D2 and CD3G were significantly overexpressed in the VTE group. The results are shown in Fig.

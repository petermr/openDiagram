<p id="Par66">We have identified, for the first time, 447 differentially expressed proteins related to the development of P3, P14, and P30 mouse cochlear sensory epithelia by using MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics. Our results show that upregulated proteins increase with age, suggesting they may have a direct involvement in development. During the onset of hearing, at P12â€“14, proteins related to epithelial and nervous system development, and tissue morphology are the most represented upregulated proteins, suggesting continued development at this age. We also focused on proteins exclusively present in the cochlear sensory epithelium; nine expressed exclusively on P30 relative to P3 and 200 expressed exclusively on P3 relative to P14. Additionally, we reported three proteins expressed exclusively on P3 that were recently identified in the cochlea for the first time. Our bioinformatics approach provided insights on biological functions and interacting partners for select putative biomarkers found on P3, which were verified using immunoblotting and coIP. This study provides the first differentially expressed proteome in the mammalian cochlea at significant developmental stages; before hearing, during the onset of hearing, and when hearing is fully developed. These results provide insights into the function of proteins that are differentially expressed during development and to potential protein biomarkers related to auditory development and loss.</p>

  <p>Catalytic Effect of Cobalt Components in the Deposition Process of Active Mn Compound</p>
  <p>(A) Comparison of CVs (0.1 mV s
   <sup>−1</sup>) of coin-type batteries using δ-MnO
   <sub>2</sub> cathodes with or without cobalt modification.
  </p>
  <p>(B) Comparison of LSV profiles (positive sweep, 1 mV s
   <sup>−1</sup>) of stainless steel (SS) and SS covered with pre-electrodeposited Co(OH)
   <sub>2</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>(C and D) (C) Mn 2p
   <sub>3/2</sub> XPS profiles and (D) digital photographs of the samples after the LSV positive sweep to specific potentials.
  </p>
  <p>(E) First two CV cycles (1 mV s
   <sup>−1</sup>) of SS with pre-electrodeposited Co(OH)
   <sub>2</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>(F) Illustration of mechanism of the catalysis effect via Mn self-catalysis (Route 1) and via cobalt-induced catalysis (Route 2).</p>
  <p>Note that results in (B–E) are obtained based on a home-made electrochemical cell (See 
   <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S9</xref>A).

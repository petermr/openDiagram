 <caption> The expression of LINC00466 is highly in tissues and cell lines of glioma. ( A) Volcano plots of the DElncRNAs in TCGA-LGG/GBM database (up-regulated genes were defined as red and down-regulated genes were defined as green); ( B) Differential expression of LINC00466 in Tumor and Normal of TCGA-GBM/LGG; ( C) Differential expression of LINC00466 among Normal, LGG and GBM of the data in TCGA and GTEx database; ( D) The expression level of LINC00466 in the tissue of glioma and adjacent normal tissues was detected by qRT-PCR; ( E) The expression of LINC00466 in glioma of WHO grade (I–II) and WHO grade (III–IV); ( F) The expression of LINC00466 in three glioma cell lines and one astroglia cell line was detected by qRT-PCR; ( G) The location of LINC00466 in glioma tissues was identified by FISH experiments; ( H) the expression levels of GAPDH (cytoplasmic marker), U6 (nuclear marker) and LINC00466 after the separation of cell nucleus and cytoplasm in A172 cells were examined. </caption>

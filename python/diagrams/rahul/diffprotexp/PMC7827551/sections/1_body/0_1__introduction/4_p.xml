<p>Little is known about the protein expression in MAH 104 during exponential and stationary growth phases and how this change contributes to pathogenesis. Here, we harness the proteomics technology to analyze the whole proteome of MAH 104 in these two growth phases. This will aid in better understanding the MAH 104 infection course and will help in its treatment. Particularly when the MAH 104 infection treatment period is long to very long, it is associated with mediocre to good outcomes. Therefore, basic knowledge of the cell biology is needed to develop new treatment strategies. Knowing the exact protein expression pattern might help to identify potential drugs targets.</p>

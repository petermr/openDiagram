<p>This pilot study was designed to assess if a tape device (

 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> could identify gene signatures relevant to CLE pathogenesis and be used as a tool to monitor CLE biomarkers and potentially replace punch biopsy in the clinical research setting. Using skin tape mRNA collection, two gene clusters were identified with differential expression in CLE-A versus CLE-U and HV skin. Gene expression in these two clusters, IFN-associated and CLE-associated, correlated with MXA, CD45 and CD303, and with MXA and CD45, respectively, protein in punch biopsies by immunoreactive tissue area.

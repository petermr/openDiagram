<p id="Par19">The 249 differentially expressed genes in G1p and G1d cells were then subjected to GO analyses (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). They were significantly enriched in biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. 67 GO terms were categorized into different biological processes. For instance, 20 genes associated with mitosis (GO: 0007067), 20 genes associated with cell division (GO: 0051301), 11 genes associated with steroid biosynthesis (GO: 0006694), 16 genes associated with DNA replication (GO: 0006260), 17 genes associated with cell cycle phase transition (GO: 0044770) and 19 genes associated with lipid biosynthetic process (GO: 0008610). In addition, 16 GO terms identified fell under the category of cellular components including 19 genes associated with microtubule (GO: 0005874), 21 genes associated with extracellular matrix (GO: 0031012), 79 genes associated with extracellular region (GO: 0005576) and 49 genes associated with cytoskeleton (GO: 0005856). 7 GO terms identified were related to molecular function including 12 genes associated with microtubule binding (GO: 0008017) and 13 genes associated with tubulin binding (GO: 0015631). Statistical differences were observed in each of the above GO terms identified between G1p and G1d cells.

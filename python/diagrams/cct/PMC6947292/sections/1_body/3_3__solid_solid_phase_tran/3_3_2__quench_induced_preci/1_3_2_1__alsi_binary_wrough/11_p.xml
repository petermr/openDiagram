<p>The results obtained for quench-induced precipitation of the binary Al0.72Si alloy are summarised in the CCP diagram shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f029">Figure 29</xref>. As this binary Al-Si alloy is not an age-hardening alloy, no hardness values are shown. Instead, the measured mass fraction of Si remaining in (supersaturated) solid solution after cooling is stated.

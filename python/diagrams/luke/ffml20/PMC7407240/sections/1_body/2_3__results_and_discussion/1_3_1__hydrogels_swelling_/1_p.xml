<p>The swelling kinetics of the hydrogels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-01544-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, for distilled water as swelling medium) consists of two interdependent steps, namely water diffusion into the crosslinked polymer matrix, respectively, relaxation-induced swelling. Water diffusion occurs to a great extent until a swelling degree of ~23¨C47%, having as result a large-scale relative segmental motion of the PVA and/or ι-carrageenan macromolecular chains. After this purely diffusional step threshold, solvent penetration is accompanied to a large extent by dissipation of the strain induced on the physically crosslinked network (viscoelastic relaxation-induced swelling regime) [

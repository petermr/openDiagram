0: SF3B1 mutations causing alternative splicing are common in hematological malignancies, especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where they are mutated at a rate of 5-18% and 30%, respectively.
1: 11-14 Mutation in  SF3B1 has also been shown to result in alternative splicing in uveal melanoma and breast cancer.
2: 15,  16 In MM,  SF3B1 is a driver gene and is mutated in 1.7% of patients.
3: Hotspot mutations in  SF3B1 at codons K700 and K666 result in a change-of-function, altering the preference for a cryptic 3 splice site selection over the canonical 3 splice site.
4: 17,  18 The potential downstream effects include the production of transcripts that are either translated to abnormal proteins or undergo nonsense-mediated decay resulting in downregulation of the canonical transcript.
5: In this work, we investigate the spectrum of mutations in SF3B1, their downstream impact, and the greater role alternative splicing plays in the pathogenesis of MM.

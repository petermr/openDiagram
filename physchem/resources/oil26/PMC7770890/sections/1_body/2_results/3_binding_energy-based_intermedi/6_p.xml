site analysis, 96 nonhuman ACE2 proteins were suggested to be effectively
utilized by SARS-CoV-2; half of them have been confirmed by experiments

half are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref>. Therefore, compared with the original list of 285 animals,
our method considerably narrowed the host range. The predicted potential
zoonotic animals are distributed widely, including pets, domestic,
agricultural, and zoological animals that may have close contact with
humans (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Tables <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>).</p>

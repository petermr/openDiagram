<p>The free volume was determined by a grid scanning method using the Connolly task. The void distribution was estimated by a method previously used for micro-crystalline materials [

The void size at a grid was determined as the diameter of the maximum cavity that encloses the grid and additionally has no overlap with any polymer atom.

<p id="Par11">Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) using the AM panel were undertaken using the Efficient Mixed-Model Association algorithm (Kang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>) using a compressed mixed linear model that includes both fixed and random effects (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2010</xref>), implemented with the Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT) package (Lipka et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Genetic stratification in the population was corrected for using a kinship matrix constructed in GAPIT derived from a subset of SNPs skimmed from the complete set using an

0: The cell adhesion assay was done as described by [ 31], variations summarized by [ 32], with the following alterations: HEp-2 cells were grown for 48 h at 37C and 5% CO 2 until 7090% confluence in EMEM (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) in 4-well glass chamber slides (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).
1: On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml fetal calf serum-free EMEM (FCS-free) and incubated for 3 h at 37C and 5% CO 2 with infection mixture.
2: The infection mixture was produced as follows: five fresh colonies per strain were incubated at 37C for 16 h under static conditions in EMEM, supplemented with arabinose (final concentration 1%) for induction of AAF expression.
3: OD 600 was measured the following day and the infection mixture was prepared consisting of 50 l of 10% mannose (final concentration 0.5%) for blocking type 1 fimbriae [ 31], the calculated amount of bacterial cells (final concentration 10 8 cfu/ml) and cell culture medium up to 1 ml.
4: After incubation of HEp-2 cells for 3 h with the infection mixture, the cells were washed thrice with PBS and fixed for 1 min with 1 ml methanol.
5: The methanol was replaced with 1 ml of Giemsa staining solution (freshly diluted 1:20 in ddH 2O) per well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
6: The staining solution was discarded, and the cells were washed carefully with ddH 2O until the water was clear.
7: The slides were dried at room temperature and cell adherence was evaluated using 40x and 100x oil-immersion light microscopy (Zeiss Axiostar, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
8: Classification of adherence patterns was done as described in other publications [ 33, 34].

<p id="Par49">To identify a small group of proteins that were differentially expressed in the T2DM + LAC group, we compared the three protein lists (T2DM + LAC vs. normal, T2DM vs. normal and LAC vs. normal) and identified 13 proteins that were unique in patients with T2DM + LAC. Among these proteins, 7 candidates exhibited differential expression between the T2DM + LAC and T2DM groups. To identify useful diagnostic indicators from these 7 proteins, we conducted further validation by PRM-MS. The results showed that 4 proteins were detected by PRM-MS and that significant differential expression of 2 of these candidate proteins was confirmed, namely, PZP and IGFBP3. As a first step toward clinical implementation, the diagnostic biomarker was assessed by ELISA. Immunoassays continue to be the preferred method for clinical validation and further application in clinical practice [

  <p>Heat map analysis of proteins expressed in fibroblasts of patients with PD harbouring heterozygous 
   <italic>GBA</italic> and 
   <italic>PARK2</italic> variants as well as in the healthy controls. (A) Heat map of the 122 differentially expressed proteins in the fibroblasts of the two patients with PD with different heterozygous 
   <italic>GBA</italic> variants compared with the pooled healthy controls. (B) Heat map of the 119 differentially expressed proteins in the fibroblasts of the two patients with PD with different heterozygous 
   <italic>PARK2</italic> variants compared with the pooled healthy controls. (C and D) Top 25 differentially expressed proteins in fibroblasts of patients with PD carrying (C) 
   <italic>GBA</italic> and (D) 
   <italic>PARK2</italic> variants. Each sample was run and analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The heat map was constructed using R, and the expression levels of each protein were normalized to the mean expression level of that protein in the healthy control from triplicate runs. Abbreviated protein names correspond to the full protein names shown in 
   <xref rid="tII-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>. PD, Parkinson's disease; 
   <italic>GBA</italic>, acid-Î² glucosidase; 
   <italic>PARK2</italic>, parkin.

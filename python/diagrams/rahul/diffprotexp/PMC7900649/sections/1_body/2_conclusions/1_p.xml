<p id="Par35">Our results reveal a dynamic regulation of gene expression in IPEC-J2 cells after PEDV infection, in which both APA sites switching events and DEGs are involved. About 20% of the significantly changed genes were identified as both APA switching genes and DEGs. These genes tended to act as a “focus genes” in function networks, which may have greater research value in the future. Our results could provide a relatively comprehensive insight into dynamic interaction between host and PEDV virus, which would contribute to future research on PEDV pathogenesis.</p>

<p>The SARSCOVIDB (available at: 
 <uri xlink:href="https://sarscovidb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://sarscovidb.org/</uri>) comprises differential gene expression measurements, at mRNA and protein levels, built through four main steps (

 </xref>). The first step was a manual search by manual text mining to find all articles available in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases containing the terms “SARS-CoV-2” and “COVID-19”. Only accepted/published manuscripts were used as the source of DEGs in SARS-CoV2 infection. This search retrieved 5554 articles, from December 2019 to date. The second step comprised a manual check of abstracts to select articles containing only differential gene expression measurements after SARS-CoV-2 infection. All references were double-checked by two independent individuals, resulting in the selection of 24 articles.

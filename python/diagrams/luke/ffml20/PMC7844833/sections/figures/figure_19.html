 <caption> (a) Co K-edge EXAFS data of nanosized CoWO 4 and the accompanying fits with the RMC method and (b) four different candidate structure models: only the models with edge-sharing CoO 6 octahedra can fit the contribution of the distant coordination shells.

(c, d) Fe K-edge XANES data of Fe–N–C catalysts for ORR and fits with two different candidate structure models: additional axial Fe–O bonds are necessary to fit the experimental data.

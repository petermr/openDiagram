<p>From the five hospitalized patients harbouring D34 deletion, 2 died from COVID-19 infection, all presenting LRTI and comorbidities. One patient (#25) died at day 5 after diagnosis, but their death was not related to COVID-19 infection but to septicemia. To evaluate disease outcome in relation to the D34 deletion, death from COVID-19 versus favorable outcome (including non-COVID-19 death) was compared by Fisher’s exact test. No significant difference in disease outcome could be observed between hospitalized patients harbouring or not the D34 deletion (

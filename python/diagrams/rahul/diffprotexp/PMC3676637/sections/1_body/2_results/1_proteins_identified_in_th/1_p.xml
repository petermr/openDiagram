<p>Raw files of LC–MS/MS data were searched by both Mascot and X!Tandem for identification of proteins. To generate a statistically valid protein list, Scaffold was used to accommodate differences of algorithm and score calculation between the two search engines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A total of 129 proteins were identified (76 in the primary tumors and 101 in the metastatic tumors) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Comparison of the primary and metastatic tumors revealed the differential expression of 81 proteins (28 in the solely primary tumors and 53 in the solely metastatic tumors) and the shared expression of 48 other proteins (Fig.

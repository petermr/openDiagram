<p>MACS was used to select CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells positively from the spleen of CVB3-induced myocarditis mice on d 7, according to manufacturer’s instructions. The day of cells separation was defined as d 0. Cells were cultured in twelve-well plates and randomly divided into seven groups: (1) PBS group, (2) Pnu group (30 μM), (3) Pnu (30 μM) + pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC, a selective NF-κB inhibitor, Sigma, USA, 50 μM) group, (4) Pnu (30 μM) + nsc74859 (NSC, a STAT3 inhibitor, MedChem Express, USA, 100 μM) group, (5) methyllycaconitine (MLA, a selective α7nAChR antagonist, Sigma, USA, 10 μM) group, (6) MLA (10 μM) + PDTC (50 μM) group, (7) MLA (10 μM) + NSC (100 μM) group. All drugs were administered once daily on d 1 to 5. Finally, cells were harvested and used for Western blot and flow cytometry analyses.

 <italic>S</italic>-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-
 <sc>l</sc>-cysteine (DCVC) induces cytotoxicity in HTR-8/SVneo, a placental cell line that models first-trimester extravillous trophoblasts (Elkin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020a</xref>; Hassan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). However, prior mechanistic studies of DCVC-induced cytotoxicity in placental cells have focused on specific molecular signaling pathways and biological responses, including reactive oxygen species generation, lipid peroxidation, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic signaling (Elkin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>; Hassan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). Application of comprehensive discovery approaches such as genome-wide gene expression profiling allows for the unbiased characterization of toxicity mechanisms without relying on individual pre-selected pathways and/or processes.

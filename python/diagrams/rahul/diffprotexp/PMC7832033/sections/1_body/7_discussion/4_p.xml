<p>Enrichment analysis demonstrated a number of GO terms, including the up-regulation of myeloid leukocyte activation and down-regulation of lymphocyte activation in non-survivors compared with survivors. KEGG pathway analysis revealed many up-regulated genes involved in signal transduction pathways associated with severe melioidosis. Among these, TLRs are known to recognize 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> LPS and initiate inflammation [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33–36</xref>] and acute septic melioidosis patients had increased expression of many TLRs in leukocytes [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The activation of MAPK signaling and Th17 pathway in melioidosis patients have also been demonstrated in previous studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37–40</xref>]. Multiple signaling pathways were down-regulated in severe melioidosis suggesting that prolonged bacterial persistence exacerbates inflammatory responses that may lead to immune exhaustion, immune suppression, and poor outcome of the disease.

0: There are many different patterns to normalize the gene expression level.
1: In this search, we used the  RPKM method [ 36] (Reads per kilobase transcriptome per million mapped reads), because it is able to eliminate the influence of different gene lengths and sequencing discrepancy on the calculation of gene expression.
2: Therefore, the calculated results can be directly used to compare the differences in gene expression between samples.

<p>To try and further determine how amiloride interacts with ASICs, Gouaux and colleagues saturated cASIC1a with mitotoxin A (MitTx, PDB 4NTX, see 
 <italic>Toxins and peptides</italic> section) and identified two different locations for amiloride binding: the acidic pocket of the extracellular domain and the fenestration between adjacent subunits, partially occluding the pore region [
 <xref rid="cit0184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. These sites are conserved between ASIC1a and ASIC3 and are likely to represent the binding sites for amiloride on ASIC3 too. Interestingly, attenuation of ASIC3 currents was observed with a high amiloride concentration (200 μM) at highly acidic pH (pH 4) [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but the same concentration paradoxically enhanced currents at neutral pH (pH 7) [
 <xref rid="cit0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The structural basis of such enhancement of ASIC3 current by amiloride remains unclear but Xu and Colleges have suggested, using site-directed mutagenesis, that the observed effect was dependent on the integrity of the non-proton ligand-sensing domain in ASIC3 [

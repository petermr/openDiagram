0: Proteomics is the science of studying protein composition and alterations in cells, tissues, and organisms.
1: Proteomics is widely used in basic and clinical medical research [ 7] for the identification of biomarkers [ 8,  9], posttranslational protein modifications [ 10], and the regulation of signaling pathways [ 11].
2: Proteomics research of lung cancer has focused on the classification of lung cancer [ 12], the correlation between protein and gene expressions [ 13,  14], identification of new molecular targets [ 15,  16], and the development of new drugs [ 17,  18].
3: Early diagnostic markers for lung cancer [ 19,  20] have been identified, but the markers still lack accuracy and sensitivity.
4: Therefore, exploration and discovery of reliable and sensitive markers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer are a research priority.

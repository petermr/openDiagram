<p>The second approach aims to regenerate high-quality precursors for the synthesis of fresh active material for LIBs using hydrometallurgy. The products thus obtained meet the battery manufacturing specifications, and this approach follows the principles of circular economy. Most hydrometallurgical processes described in the literature follow this approach. Although no quality loss should occur during such a process, the amounts of reagents and associated energy consumption remain high. The implementation of complex purification lines to meet battery-grade specifications increase the capital and operating cost of such recycling processes. Umicore combines pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes to obtain high quality Co, Mn, and Ni salts intended for manufacturing batteries [

<p>Paramyosin, also known as tropomyosin A, is the muscle constituent protein of invertebrates such as molluscs and annelids [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Studies have shown that paramyosin is expressed in the epidermis, subcutaneous tissues and organs of many parasites, and can also be secreted 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Pearce et al. [
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] obtained paramyosin from soluble adult worm antigen of 
 <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> by affinity chromatography, and preliminarily elucidated the cellular immune mechanism of this protein. Nanduri and Kazura [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] found that the protein can enhance the ability of mice to remove the microfilaria of 
 <italic>Brugia malayi</italic>. It has been demonstrated that paramyosin is distributed throughout the base layer in the oncosphere and adult of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> [
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and it can also be used as an important antigen for parasites to trigger the host immune response [
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Paramyosin can cause a strong immune response, and has been selected as a parasite candidate antigen [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, studies on paramyosin in 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> have rarely been reported.

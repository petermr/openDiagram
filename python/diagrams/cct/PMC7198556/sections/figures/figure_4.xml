  <p>Micrographs of the transition zone: (
   <bold>a</bold>) shows the entire composite image detailing the changing microstructure in a depth of 4400 μm to 5300 μm from the surface. The first 200 μm are presented in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, with a noticeable overlap of ~20 μm with (
   <bold>b</bold>), at 4700 μm depth, where untransformed pearlite becomes more pronounced. The amount of martensite is considerably decreasing towards (
   <bold>c</bold>) with its last traces circled in (
   <bold>d</bold>), at 5000 μm depth; the vast majority of the microstructure being the original ferritic-pearlitic structure signifies that Ac
   <sub>1b</sub> was barely reached. At 5200 μm, shown in (
   <bold>e</bold>), the microstructure consists entirely of pearlite and ferrite, being consistent with the unaustenitised base metal.

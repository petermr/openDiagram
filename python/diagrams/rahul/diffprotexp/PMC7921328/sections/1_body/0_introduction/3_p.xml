<p>In the present study, we dissected the dysregulation of lncRNAs in prostate cancer and their clinical relevance. To comprehensively characterize lncRNA-immune interactions in prostate cancer, we assessed the associations between lncRNA expression and various immune features, including immune-related hallmarks, tumor immunogenomic signatures, immune-related biological processes, tumor infiltrated immune cells, and immune checkpoints. Our analysis revealed close connections between prostate cancer (PRAD) differential lncRNAs and these immune features in prostate cancer and suggested the potential clinical utility of lncRNAs in immunotherapy for patients with prostate cancer.</p>

<p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have less information compared to the classical mycobacterial pathogens such as 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) and 
 <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The incidence of NTM diseases shows a dramatic rising over the past several years, especially in developed countries. In the United States, particularly among women and older age groups, the incidence has increased from 3.13 to 4.73 per 100,000 person-years from 2008 to 2015 [

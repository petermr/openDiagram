<p>The identified proteins with significant changes in response to TNFα treatment were highly linked to the cytoskeleton and cell cycle regulation. Among the identified proteins, HSP70 expression changes have been reported to play an important role in mediating migration and apoptosis of various tumors 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Thus, we further investigated the role of upregulated HSP70 in promoted cell migration and inhibited apoptosis of HepG2 cell. We silenced the HSP70 expression by specific siRNA against HSP70 (siHSP70) and monitored the cell migration using wound healing assay. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, we observed that the protein level was significantly decreased by siHSP70, and the TNFα-promoted migration was inhibited by siHSP70 pretreatment (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). In addition, we also found that pretreatment of siHSP70 following TNFα treatment significantly increased sub-G1 phase as compared to TNFα treatment alone (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). Taken together, we proposed that upregulation of HSP70 involved in TNFα-promoted cell migration and TNFα-suppressed apoptosis of HepG2 cell.

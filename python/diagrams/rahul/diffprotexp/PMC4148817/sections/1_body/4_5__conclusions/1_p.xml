<p>Bioinformatic analysis of proteomic changes that occur in Calu-3 in response to exposure to carbon nanotubes shows there are many proteins and cellular functions that change in response to low, but not high, levels of exposure to CNTs. The overlap in the nature of the proteins that are altered in response to low levels exposure of both types of carbon nanotubes is surprising and underscores the validity of the analyses as to which proteins play important roles in the cell response to carbon nanotubes. These studies help to highlight the potential toxic effects of nanomaterials to human health.</p>

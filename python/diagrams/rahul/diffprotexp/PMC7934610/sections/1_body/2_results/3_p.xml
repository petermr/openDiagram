<p>Results showed that 16,346 genes were detected in CE-R group samples, while 16,038 were detected in the CE-NR group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of DEGs showed 3835 genes which were different in the CE-R group compared with CE-NR group, of which 2229 were upregulated and 1606 were downregulated. The Venn diagrams of DEGs between groups are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>. Scatter charts of detected genes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, where the 
 <italic>X</italic>-axis and 
 <italic>Y</italic>-axis present two samples log2 value of expression, red (up) and green (down) dots mean the gene has significant differences (FDR ≤ 0.001, two fold difference), and the blue dot means no significant difference. A heatmap highlights the patterns of expression for many DEGs between two sample groups (

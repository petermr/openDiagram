 <caption> DEHP influenced the developmental status of germ cells during PF formation. (A) The pseudotime trajectory of germ cell populations colored by five States. Three branches were identified with two developmental fates. (B) The pseudotime trajectory of germ cell population colored by four sample groups. (C) Cell percentages of five States among four sample groups. (D) Pseudotime ordered heatmap of four differentially expressed gene sets between two obvious fates at branch point one. Several representative genes of each gene set are listed in the right panel. (E) The enrichment of GO terms of the top 100 genes in each gene set. (F) Enrichmentmap illustrated that DEHP exposure disturbed multiple processes in germ cells. </caption>

0: To compare the effects of DCVC across time (6 vs. 12 h), dose (10 M vs. 20 M DCVC), or model system (villous explants vs. HTR-8/SVneo), differential gene expression patterns were tested for correlation.
1: Across all genes tested, Pearsons correlation coefficients were calculated and linear regression models were fitted.
2: Comparisons were tested within each time point between non-treated controls and 10 or 20 M DCVC using logFC values for 12,855 genes.
3: Likewise, comparisons were tested between non-treated controls and each DCVC concentration for 6 or 12 h of exposure, also using log FC values for 12,855 genes.
4: Lastly, comparisons were tested between placental villous explants and HTR-8/SVneo cells each exposed to 20 M DCVC for 12 h using logFC values for 11,912 commonly expressed genes.

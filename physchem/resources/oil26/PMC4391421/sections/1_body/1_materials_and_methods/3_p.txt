0: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
1: Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography using a HP6890 instrument coupled with a HP 5973 mass spectrometer.
2: The gas chromatograph is equipped with a split-splitless injector and a Factor FourTM VF-35ms 5% fenil-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness capillary column.
3: Gas chromatography conditions include a temperature range of 50 to 250C at 40C/min, with a solvent delay of 5 min.
4: The injector was maintained at a temperature of 250C.
5: The inert gas was helium at a flow of 1.0 mL/min, and the injected volume in the splitless mode was 1 L. The MS conditions were the following: ionization energy, 70 eV; quadrupole temperature, 100C; scanning velocity, 1.6 scan/s; weight range, 40-500 amu.

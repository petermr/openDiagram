<p>Bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD) caused by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the most important bovine infectious diseases and is found in many cattle-producing countries worldwide. BVDV is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 12.3 to 12.5 kb, similar to classical swine fever virus and border disease virus, belonging to the genus

 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. BVDV infection seriously affects respiratory system and digestive system of cattle, thereby compromising the production performance of the herd. The most serious hazard of this disease is the formation of persistent infection (PI) in fetal cattle infected with BVDV during pregnancy, which can cause immune tolerance in cattle [

Moreover, PI cattle continuously excrete large amounts of viruses throughout their life process, causing BVDV to spread among the herd for a long time, making it extremely difficult to eliminate, which has resulted in large economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide [

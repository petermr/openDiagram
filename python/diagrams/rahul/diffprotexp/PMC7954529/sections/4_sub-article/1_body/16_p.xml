<p>The bias toward chimpanzee in the supplemental figure shows that PAS usage is spread more evenly across human PAS than chimpanzee PAS. Before calculating PAS usage for PAS, we needed to assign sites to genes. Because the human annotation is more sophisticated than the chimpanzee annotation, we annotated all of the PAS to the human annotation. We acknowledge that if many PAS in chimpanzee fall outside of the human annotated genic regions, we would have lost those sites and the bias could result in the structure seen in the supplement. This would occur because included chimpanzee PAS would have inflated usage ratios. However, in reality we lost more of the sites originally discovered in human because they fell outside of the annotation than chimpanzee (22,278 in human vs. 18,954 in chimpanzee).</p>

<p>In summary, this work has demonstrated a novel SSY-based yarn-shaped LIB with high flexibility and wearability. In addition, the gel electrolyte rather than the liquid electrolyte was employed to avoid common safety issues of the LIB such as high flammablility, explosivity, and leakage during use. Even at different deformation conditions (i.e., bending or knotting), the specific capacity of the yarn-shaped LIB (7 cm long, &lt;2 mm in diameter), assembled from graphite and lithium iron phosphate electrodes, is maintained &gt;85%. After charged treatment, it can successfully power up an electronic watch (36.2 h) and an electronic thermo-hygrometer (4.7 h). Thanks to the simple preparation process, low cost in raw materials, and good safety performance, and this work can promote the commercialization of wearable energy storage devices.</p>

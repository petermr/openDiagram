<p id="Par25">Additionally, our treatment analysis suggests transiently increased expression of viral entry genes during radiotherapy based on two datasets (GSE103412, GSE15781). In the radiotherapy alone dataset (GSE103412), samples were taken after day 7 of radiotherapy and 20 days post-radiotherapy. There was an early rise in gene expression (as early as day 7) and resolution of gene expression (as early as 20 days post-radiotherapy for 
 <italic>ACE2/TMPRSS2</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the chemoradiotherapy dataset (GSE15781), samples were obtained prior to treatment and 4–6 weeks post-treatment. The non-elevated levels of the 
 <italic>ACE2/TMPRSS2</italic> at 4–6 weeks post-treatment were consistent with the radiotherapy dataset as was the sustained elevation of 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Together, from these two datasets, it appears that 
 <italic>ACE2/TMPRSS2</italic> have transient elevation with cancer treatments that resolve in less than 20 days post-treatment, while 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> exhibits a prolonged elevation at for at least 4–6 weeks post-treatment.

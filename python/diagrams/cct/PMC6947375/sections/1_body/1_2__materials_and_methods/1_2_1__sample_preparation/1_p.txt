0: Typical 1.0C-1.5Cr steel was used in this study.
1: The alloy was melted in a vacuum induction furnace, and an ingot was cast (300   50 mm 3).
2: The alloys chemical composition, measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, is listed in  Table 1.
3: The calculation using JMatPro software showed that the austenite-starting temperature ( Ac1) and austenite-finishing temperature ( Ac3) were 751 C and 817 C for the investigated steel.
4: Using various cooling rates from 0.1 C/s to 100 C/s, the measured phase transformation diagram for the studied steel indicated ( Figure 1a) that the bainite-start temperature ( Bs) and bainite-finish ( Bf) temperature were 320 C and 480 C, while those for pearlite were 520 C and 730 C at a cooling rate of 40 C/s.

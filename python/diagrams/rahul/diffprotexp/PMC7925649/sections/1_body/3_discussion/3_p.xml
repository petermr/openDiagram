<p id="Par31">In our cohort we found differential regulation of metabolic pathways both at pre-operative and post-operative phases. There was dysregulation in protein metabolism including amino acid and its derivatives, fatty acid metabolism and respiratory electron transport chain. We hypothesize the altered metabolic response is the result of low cardiac output state leading to hypoperfusion compounded with anerobic metabolism that our patient population experiences due to baseline low blood oxygen saturation. Metabolomic studies in neonates suffering from hypoxemic ischemic insult have demonstrated distinct alteration in protein and fatty acid metabolism

 </sup>. Chu et al. found that neonates with poor outcomes after hypoxemic insult have altered metabolic profile related to oxidative stress pathways and tissue damage including increased concentration of glutarate, methylmalonate, 3-hydroxy-butyrate and orotate compared to neonates with good outcome. Similarly Walsh et al. has found altered metabolic profiles involving amino acids, acylcarnitines and glycerophospholipids in neonates with poor outcomes after hypoxemic ischemic insult

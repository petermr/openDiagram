<p>The oxidation state of the catalytically active species is one of the important parameters that determines the reactivity of a catalyst. It is also one of the parameters that most often changes under reaction conditions. Frequently, information about the oxidation state can be easily extracted from the examination of the absorption edge position since a higher oxidation state is associated with a shift of the absorption edge toward larger energies. For example, a nearly linear relationship between the Co K-edge position and the Co oxidation state has been reported (

 </sup> Using XAS spectra for reference materials with known oxidation state, the relationship between the oxidation state and the edge position can be established and used to find the oxidation state of the new material of interest. It should be however noted that instead of a nominal oxidation state, in some cases the absorption edge position rather characterizes the so-called coordination charge, which accounts for charge redistribution due to chemical bonding.

<p id="p0130">This study firstly provided an overview of serum proteomics changes between patients with urosepsis (non-shock group) and severe urosepsis (shock group). Interestingly, 9 differentially expressed proteins were found in the serum of severe urosepsis cases compared with the urosepsis group, and mainly involved in platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, acute phase protein pathway, lipid homeostasis, and iron ion transport. This study revealed molecular markers of early diagnosis and prognosis of urosepsis, and the differentially expressed proteins might be new therapeutic targets for urosepsis treatment.</p>

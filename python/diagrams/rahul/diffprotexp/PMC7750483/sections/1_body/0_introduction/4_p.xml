<p>Currently, there is little research progress in the biological function and mechanism of m
 <sup>5</sup>C in GI cancer. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression level, alteration frequency, and association with survival of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators in GI cancer. Meanwhile, we also studied their related pathways and key target, for which a druggable compound was found in the hope of providing new treatment for patients with GI cancer.

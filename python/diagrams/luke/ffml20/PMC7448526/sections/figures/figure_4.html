 <caption> The evolution of methoxy species reflected by the band at 1180 cm â€“1 (A), rate of methoxy formation (B), water formation (C) and rate of water formation (D) as a function of time. First 100 s of the reaction is considered for the rates. Methanol loading of 8 ( ), 4 ( ), 2 ( ) and 1 ( ) molecules per acidic site. Inset in (C) compares the area under the MS profile as a function of methanol loading. </caption>

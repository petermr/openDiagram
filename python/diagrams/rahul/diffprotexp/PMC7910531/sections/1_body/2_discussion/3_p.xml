<p id="Par19">The strong correlation between RNA and protein level signatures within cell type and disease state and the contrast between disease states provides both strong internal consistency and with previous observations of ECM remodelling by chondrocytes in an inflammatory environment as a key modifiable molecular signature in the degeneration process

 </sup>. We further demonstrate the external validity of these hallmark signatures by showing good concordance with publically-available RNA-seq data from a smaller, independent, human osteoarthritis cohort

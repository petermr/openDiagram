<p>Chicken macrophages differed from heterophils in 3 specific features. First, macrophages specifically expressed receptors such as MRC1L, LRP1, LGALS1, LRPAP1 and DMBT1L. Second, macrophages exhibited higher mitochondrial activity including fatty acid degradation, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. And third, macrophages specifically expressed enzymes involved in arginine and proline metabolism (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Receptors specifically expressed by macrophages indicate their potential to sense signals from the external environment which allows them to modulate immune response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] including their own polarization [

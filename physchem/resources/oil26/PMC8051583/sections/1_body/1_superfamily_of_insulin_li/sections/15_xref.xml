<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). While the relationships among these genes cannot be fully resolved by phylogenetic analysis, due to their short protein lengths, information derived from their locations within the genome has helped to largely resolve the order and timing of the gene duplication events that generated this gene family (

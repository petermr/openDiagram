<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, secreted level of BDNF in 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs increased from 0.1 to 0.55 fg/cell after neural induction for 5 days. If the ERK inhibitor was present in the induction medium, the amount of BDNF was decreased to 0.33 fg/cell. Similar behavior was observed in the differentiation of intact MSCs. The secreted BDNF level increased from 0.045 to 0.23 fg/cell after induction for 7 days and decreased to 0.19 fg/cell when the ERK pathway was blocked. In summary, the differentiated cells secreted a significant level of BDNF for survival.

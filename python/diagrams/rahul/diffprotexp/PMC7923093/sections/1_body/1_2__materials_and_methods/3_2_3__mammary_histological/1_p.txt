0: The paraffin-fixed blocks were serially sectioned into 67 m coronal slices and stored at 20 C. For routine histological studies, paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin [ 18].
1: Hematoxylineosin stained sections were analyzed by light microscopy using an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
2: For each rat, we randomly made three HE-staining images.
3: Mammary acinar areas were measured using digital imaging system software MC30 (Mingmei, Guangzhou, China) and all acinar areas were recorded from each rat (1200 acinar areas in total).
4: One-way ANOVA in SPSS 16.0 was conducted to determine differences from the control group.
5: Significant difference was declared at  p< 0.05.

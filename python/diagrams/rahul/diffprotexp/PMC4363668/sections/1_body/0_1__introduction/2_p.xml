<p>Many data show that EV71 infection has a complex pathogenesis and that the central nervous system (CNS) is likely the main target of the EV71 virus [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The well-established murine and cynomolgus monkey models have demonstrated that EV71 infection may cause neurological lesions in the CNS [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; recently, EV71 Virus infected rhesus monkeys through four route can result in lesion in the CNS [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the mechanism that underlies EV71 infections to induce severe neural complications in patients still remains unknown. Therefore, it is very important to elucidate pathogenic mechanism of EV71 CNS infection.

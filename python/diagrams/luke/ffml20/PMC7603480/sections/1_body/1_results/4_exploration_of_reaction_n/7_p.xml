<p id="Par36">Indeed, the generation of reference databases is also to an extent domain specific. The reaction networks considered herein are quite universal and could be applied to atmospheric chemistry, combustion or catalysis. However, these fields have distinct requirements with respect to the first-principles reference data. Clearly, catalysis can only be studied if the effect of the catalyst is accounted for. Meanwhile, thermal contributions to the free-energy will be large and important for a realistic description of combustion, and the role of different spin-states must be considered in both combustion and atmospheric chemistry. Nevertheless, the ML framework presented herein can easily be transferred to accommodate these situations.</p>

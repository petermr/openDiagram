<p>The snails (N = 900) were exposed to

 <italic>viverrini</italic> mature eggs according to previously described procedures [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Three replicates (100 snails per replicate) were used for each of the time points of the experimental infection. Briefly, infection was performed by placing each snail individually with 50 embryonated 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> eggs into plastic containers containing 5 ml of de-chlorinated tap water for 24h. Uninfected snails were treated in a similar way but no eggs were present in the containers. After infection, the snails were maintained in plastic 50 L containers (38 cm wide x 52 cm long x 31 cm high) at 100 snails per container in de-chlorinated tap water to a height of 10 cm with soil base. Snails were provided with boiled gourd leaves and artificial snail food as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. One hundred individual snails were randomly collected at 24, 48 and 96 h post-infection (hpi), and uninfected snails (N = 300) were used as controls. Snail infection was determined by examination of egg hatching in snail faeces (as determined by opening of the operculum) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, after collection of hemolymph, whole soft bodies of all snails were subsequently employed to screen for trematode infection by PCR designed to amplify the ITS regions as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. PCR products were amplified and visualized on a 3% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The presence of bands of approximately 380 bp in size was considered diagnostic for 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> infection.

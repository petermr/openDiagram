<p id="par0135">We identified âˆ¼23,000 differentially expressed (DE) unigenes in wheat under HS through de novo transcriptomic approach. The cured data (BioProject: PRJNA171754) were functionally annotated and further classified into different groups according to their putative functions generated by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis. Domain based homology search showed the presence of 21 novel transcripts having close resemblance with MAPK gene reported from different plant sources (Table S1).</p>

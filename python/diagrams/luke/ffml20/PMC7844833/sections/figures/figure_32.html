 <caption> (a) Potential-dependent Pt L 3-edge HERFD-XANES for 1.2 nm Pt NPs on a carbon support. (b) Evolution of the metallic and oxide-like phases in the catalyst as a function of the applied potential in 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte obtained by fitting the HERFD XANES spectra with a combination of arctangent functions and two pseudo-Voigt peaks, corresponding to metallic (blue triangles) and oxidic (red squares) components, and integration of the peak areas. The evolution of the total area is also shown (black circles). Reproduced with permission from ref ( 362). Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society. </caption>

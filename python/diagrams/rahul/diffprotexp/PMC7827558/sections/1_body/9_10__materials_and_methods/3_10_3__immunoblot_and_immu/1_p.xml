<p>Cell lysates were prepared by a freeze–thaw, followed by incubation in RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice, and the supernatants were analyzed by immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitation. For immunoblot analysis, 20 to 50 μg protein samples were denatured in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), separated by 4% to 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with a primary antibody (1:1000 or at concentrations recommended by the manufacturers) against p53 (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), PARP (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), p21 (BD Pharmingen San Diego, CA, USA), SMG5, SMG7, CARF and RBM25 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA), and CASP8 (Abcam Cambridge, UK). Primary antibody binding was detected by incubating with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA, USA) followed by enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) visualization (Amersham Biosciences Little Chalfont, UK).</p>

<p id="Par17">To determine why ErmCL’s maximum pulling force is higher than that of H-NS’s we first calculated the average force acting on each residue along the nascent chain when 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> occurs in the individual trajectories, because at this point there is the greatest opposition to protein movement through the tunnel. We find that for both peptides, their N-terminal residues have larger forces acting on them than their C-terminal residues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). And that ErmCL’s first two N-terminal residues experience around a 70% greater force than in H-NS (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). This suggests that the differential behavior of ErmCL and H-NS in the presence of ERY originates at their N-terminal residues.

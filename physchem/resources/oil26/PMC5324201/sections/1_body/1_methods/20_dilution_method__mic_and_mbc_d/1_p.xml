<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) assays were carried out on the essential oil by the macro-dilution method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The essential oil was dissolved in 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain 10% (w/v) solution. For MIC test of the selected bacteria, the essential oil was first diluted in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth in screw capped tubes containing broth medium in the concentration of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.25&#160;&#956;g/mL. Bacterial suspensions of the test organism were prepared in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth. 1&#160;mL of the dilution was added to each sterilized screw capped tube containing 1&#160;mL of sample suitably diluted in the sterilized broth medium to give a final volume of 2&#160;mL. A culture medium without sample (solvent DMSO) was used as a negative control. Ciprofloxacin (100&#8211;0.191&#160;&#956;g/mL.) was used as positive control. Tubes were incubated aerobically at 37&#160;&#176;C for 18&#160;h and the growth was indicated by turbidity. The lowest concentration (preventing visible growth indicated by no turbidity) was identified as the MIC and expressed in &#956;g/mL. The complete absence of growth was considered as the MBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To confirm the results of MBC, 10&#160;&#956;L of the experimental suspensions (withdrawn from the tubes with no growth) were subcultured on TSA (Tryptone Soy Agar) plates. The Plates were incubated at 37&#160;&#176;C for 24&#160;h. It showed no bacterial growth, which was taken as the MBC. Values were recorded as &#956;g/mL.</p>

0: Bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD) caused by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the most important bovine infectious diseases and is found in many cattle-producing countries worldwide.
1: BVDV is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 12.3 to 12.5 kb, similar to classical swine fever virus and border disease virus, belonging to the genus  Pestivirus, family  Flaviviridae [ 1, 2].
2: BVDV infection seriously affects respiratory system and digestive system of cattle, thereby compromising the production performance of the herd.
3: The most serious hazard of this disease is the formation of persistent infection (PI) in fetal cattle infected with BVDV during pregnancy, which can cause immune tolerance in cattle [ 3].
4: Moreover, PI cattle continuously excrete large amounts of viruses throughout their life process, causing BVDV to spread among the herd for a long time, making it extremely difficult to eliminate, which has resulted in large economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide [ 4].

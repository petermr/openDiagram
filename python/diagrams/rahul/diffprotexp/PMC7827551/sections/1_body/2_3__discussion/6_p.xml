<p>A recent study has sequenced highly transformable virulent MAH approving novel genes that are essential for infection establishment. From these genes, some were involved in the growth and others in the virulence of the bacteria [

 <italic>katG</italic> and 
 <italic>pfkA</italic> were of the genes that encodes for catalase peroxidase and phosphofructokinase, respectively, which were down and up-regulated in the stationary phase in our proteomic analysis, respectively. Catalase peroxidase has a critical role in mycobacterial pathogenesis, it is countering the phagocyte oxidative burst and it has been shown to protect 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> against the reactive oxygen intermediates in macrophage since catalase and peroxidase activities are associated with survival inside macrophages [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, phosphofructokinase is implicated in the first committing step of glycolysis, which irreversibly catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Phong et al. demonstrated that phosphofructokinase is essential for mycobacterial growth on glucose as a sole carbon source, and is responsible for the total phosphofructokinase activity in 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> [

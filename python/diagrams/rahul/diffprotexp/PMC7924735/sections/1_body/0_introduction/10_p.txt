0: Considering this, we designed a new strategy to characterize the individual protein profile of different cysticercus culture supernatants.
1: First, a proteomic profile was determined for each culture by 2D-PAGE; then, secretome data were used to predict protein sequences [ 12].
2: This strategy allowed us to identify conserved and differential proteins between cultures, as well as to elucidate functions of secreted proteins and their possible therapeutic and/or diagnostic applications.

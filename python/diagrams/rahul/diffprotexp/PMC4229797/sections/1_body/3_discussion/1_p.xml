<p>Male infertility is generally diagnosed in terms of concentration, motility, and morphology of spermatozoa. Often, these parameters do not accurately reflect the real capacity of the semen for fecundation.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] We found decreased progressive motility and sperm count in semen samples from infertile males. However, all further semen parameters were classified as normal following the reference values of the WHO 2010.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The application of proteomic techniques in seminal evaluation might be useful to classify such individuals, whose spermatozoa fulfill the current parameters of normality but have fertility problems, and eventually further define the etiology of infertility. The advantage of SELDI-TOF-MS is its ability to provide rapid protein expression profiles from complex biological samples like seminal plasma, with a minimal requirement for purification and separation of protein prior to mass spectrometry. The method is not applicable for routine diagnostics because of low accessibility to SELDI-TOF spectrometers for IVF centers.

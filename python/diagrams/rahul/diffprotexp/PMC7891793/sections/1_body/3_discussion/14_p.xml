<p>KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using the whole transcriptome, demonstrated that most of the enriched pathways were specific to group 6 (FPI and ibuprofen day 3–10), where we can see suppression of immune functions, including response to pathogens. It is important to mention that the “Fc epsilon RI signaling” pathway was suppressed in group 6. This mechanism is responsible for IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and is very characteristic of respiratory syncytial virus infection as reviewed [

Switching the immune response to Th2 and IgE is considered to be a mechanism the RSV/BRSV evasion of the innate and cellular immune mechanisms. In our study, suppression of Fc epsilon signaling reduces consequences related to activation and degranulation of mast cells and basophils. There is a direct connection between Fc epsilon signaling and “Prostaglandin biosynthesis process” pathway, which was not enriched in group 6, but it was enriched in treatment groups 1 and 4. Prostaglandin E synthase was increased in lesions within the interval of 1.5–1.8 logFC in these 2 treatment groups but this difference was not statistically significant. It is important to note that group 5 differs from group 4 (monotherapy with FPI only, but initiated on the same day). The clinical outcome of this study showed a significantly lower score for group 5 in comparison to placebo. In contrast group 4 failed to show a significantly lower clinical score [

This observation is not unexpected because depression of viral replication beginning on day 3 by the FPI antiviral diminished the stimulus for inflammatory functions.

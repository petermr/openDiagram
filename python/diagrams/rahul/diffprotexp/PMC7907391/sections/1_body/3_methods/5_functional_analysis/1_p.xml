 </sup> datasets. 135 upregulated and 112 genes downregulated were uploaded separately to ClueGO. The software uses Kappa statistics to link terms within a network, two-sided hypergeometric tests were used to define enrichment, the Bonferroni step down p value correction method was also implemented with a q-value threshold of ≤ 0.05.

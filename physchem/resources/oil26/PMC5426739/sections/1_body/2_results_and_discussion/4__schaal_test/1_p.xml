PV results of the oil blends stored at 65&#176;C for 10 days showed that olive oil is more stable than sesame and flaxseed oils. Flaxseed oil had the lowest stability which has also been previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Oil blends had a significant differences in PV obtained using the Schaal test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As the amount of flaxseed oil was increased in the oil blends the oxidation stability of the oil blends decreased.</p>

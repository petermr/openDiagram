<p>Given the increasing identification of various adhesins in mycoplasmas and their associated functions functions, it remains challenging to reasonably classify these adhesins. In fact, many adhesins, such as some glycolytic molecules, have multiple properties and are also matrix-binding proteins. Even for the same adhesin, ectodomain shedding can occur under certain conditions, which results in functional diversity. For example, the P1 adhesin of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> can be subjected to post-translational processing, creating 22 proteoforms, each of which retains the ability to bind a variety of host molecules such as Fn, Plg, fibrinogen, vitronectin, and sialic acid; thus, the probability of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection is greatly increased [

Typically, there is more than one type of adhesin on the surface of mycoplasmas and a single adhesin may be insufficient for efficient adhesion; therefore, the cooperation of multiple molecules (including accessory proteins) is required to accomplish effective adhesion.

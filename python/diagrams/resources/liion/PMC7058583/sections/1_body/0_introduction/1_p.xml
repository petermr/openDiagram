<p>Lithium-ion batteries have become the main power source of portable electronic products because of their high energy density, long cycle life, and eco-friendliness (Dunn et al.,

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). With the rapid development of mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles, the market has put forward higher requirements on the energy storage density and stability of batteries. Therefore, more attentions have been paid to the exploration of electrode materials with high capacity and advanced performance (Ding et al.,

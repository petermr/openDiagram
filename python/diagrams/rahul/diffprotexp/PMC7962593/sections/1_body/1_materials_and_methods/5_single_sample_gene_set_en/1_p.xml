<p>The marker gene sets for immune cell types were obtained from Bindea et al
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The gene signatures expressed by the immune cell populations were quantified using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) function in GSVA. Differences in immune cell infiltration between sepsis patients and healthy controls were then calculated, and a significance criterion of 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was applied. Correlations between levels of infiltration by different types of immune cells were calculated using Pearsonâ€™s correlation, based on ssGSEA scores for the immune cell types.

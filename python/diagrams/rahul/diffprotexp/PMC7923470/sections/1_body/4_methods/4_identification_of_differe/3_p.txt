0: After analyzing the expression of genes, we selected five DEGs (Additional Table  7) that showed varied expression in WT and MT pseudostems and performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on a Rotor-Gene 6000 machine (Qiagen, Shanghai, China) as following.
1: cDNAs were synthesized from RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem, MA, US).
2: Two constitutively expressed genes i.e.
3: Actin (F:CTCCTATGTTGCTCGCTTATG, R:GGCTACTACTTCGGTTCTTTC) and Histone  H3.3 (F:GCGGTAATAGGAGTGAAGTC, R: TCAGCCTCAGCCAATGGCAC) were used as reference [ 89 91].
4: The temperature profiles, reagents, and volumes for PCR reactions were similar to previously described conditions [ 76,  92].

 </xref>. Batteries of both types were cycled at 0.5, 1, and 2 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with a fixed capacity of 0.5 mA h cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. As displayed in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, the symmetrical battery of Li–B–Mg composite experiences an activation process at first with a large overpotential due to a few contaminants on the surface, but it quickly tends to be stable with a smaller voltage overpotential of less than 50 mV. The duration of cycle life for the Li–B–Mg symmetrical battery exceeds 500 h, whereas pure Li foil assembled battery exhibits an increasing voltage overpotential and short‐circuited after 170 hours cycling. The cycle lives of both types of batteries reduce when the current density is increased to 1 and 2 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b,c. Nevertheless, the Li–B–Mg composite assembled symmetrical batteries show superior cycle lifespan compared with the pure Li assembled symmetrical batteries (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b,c), illustrating a stable interface and impedance formed by the Li–B–Mg composite anode.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Detailed comparisons of the overpotentials are depicted in the right column of Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. It has been reported that the poor performance of Li symmetrical battery results from the large volume change and formation of dendritic Li.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> On the contrary, the currently proposed 3D Li–B–Mg composite anode could not only reduce the local current density and mitigate the large volume change, but also regulate the uniformity of electric field (the electric field distribution is simulated hereinafter) and induce the homogeneous Li
 <sup>+</sup> deposition. All these merits contribute tremendously to the long and stable cycling lifespan of Li–B–Mg composite assembled symmetrical batteries.

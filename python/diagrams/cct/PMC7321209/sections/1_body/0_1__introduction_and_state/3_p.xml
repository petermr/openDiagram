 <xref rid="B11-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have gained increasing interest in the last years. The development of cost efficient production systems [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with high deposition rates makes this technology accessible for industries such as architecture or construction engineering. Moreover, the freedom of design for complex 3D-structures surpasses the limits of fabrication with conventional methods. Thereby, wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) of steel parts is mainly addressed. Recent investigations on low-alloyed steel [

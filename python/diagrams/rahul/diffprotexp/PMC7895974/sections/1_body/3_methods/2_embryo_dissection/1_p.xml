<p id="Par31">HH14 embryos were dissected into Ringers solution in silicon lined petri dishes and pinned down using the extra-embryonic membranes. Ringers solution was replaced with Dispase (1.5 mg/ml) in DMEM 10 mM HEPES pH7.5 at 37 °C for 7 min prior to treatment with Trypsin (0.05%) at 37 °C for 7 min. The reaction was stopped with Ringers solution with 0.25% BSA. The PSM, ES, MS and DS were carefully dissected away from neural and lateral mesoderm tissue using sharp tungsten needles.</p>

0: The RNA-seq data generated earlier for the identification of SAGs in wheat under HS ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject: PRJNA171754) was used for the identification of novel MAPK genes in wheat.
1: We identified 21 putative transcripts showing homology with MAPK reported from different plants (Table S1).
2: Even, the identified DEPs (as mentioned earlier) were characterized for their fold expression by calculating the ratio of pixilation of the protein spot in HS-treated upon the control.
3: MAPK, being prominent DEPs, were further targeted for the identification of specific MAPK gene using reverse genetics approach.

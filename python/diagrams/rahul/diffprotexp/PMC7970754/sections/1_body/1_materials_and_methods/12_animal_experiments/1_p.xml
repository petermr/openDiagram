<p>Nine nude mice were divided into three groups (n = 3) by random grouping into the blank control (Ctrl), RSV, and RSV + POLD1-OE groups. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/POLD-OE cells in logarithmic growth-phase were prepared as a suspension of 1 × 107 cells per ml, and 0.1 ml was inoculated subcutaneously into the right lateral axillae of the nude mice. After pinching, the pinholes were clamped with tweezers to prevent cell fluid from leaking. The injection site was observed for ulceration and swelling daily and was ready for use after about 1 week of subcutaneous inoculation. The solvent in the control group was intraperitoneally injected with a 100 µl mixture of PEG400: DMSO: sterile deionized water [1: 1: 3]. The RSV group and the RSV + POLD1-OE group were then injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg RSV containing PEG400: DMSO: sterile deionized water [1: 1: 3] mixed solution (

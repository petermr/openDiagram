<p id="Par27">In the human joystick task, the un-cued introduction, and later removal, of a 30° rotation to visual feedback of endpoint performance led to classical motor adaptation behaviour (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Specifically, after an initial perceived endpoint error of 38.45° ± 1.1, there was a rapid decay of endpoint error until an asymptote of around 5.38° ± 0.83. After the removal of the rotation, the participants exhibited a negative aftereffect (− 27.84° ± 0.86), which rapidly decayed to near baseline performance (final 10 trials mean: − 0.85° ± 0.55). In line with previous studies we observed a movement related suppression of beta activity 200–300 ms after target presentation that persisted beyond the end of the outbound reach (Fig.

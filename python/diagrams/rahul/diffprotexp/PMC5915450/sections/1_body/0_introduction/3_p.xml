<p id="Par4">Although macrolides do not directly contact the PTC, the interaction between the peptide and macrolide can alter the PTC’s structure. By hindering the movement of the peptide through the exit tunnel, the nascent chain can compress and push back on the P-site, altering the structure of nucleotides within the PTC and thereby suppress catalysis of peptide bond formation. For example, in the presence of ERY, rRNA nucleotide U2585’s position is shifted within the tunnel, which could sterically conflict with the ErmCL nascent chain

 </sup> demonstrated that the presence of ERY and ErmAL1 peptide in the exit tunnel alters the properties of the A-site, preventing particular tRNA’s from binding. The binding of macrolides in the exit tunnel can even alter the conformation of the PTC before the sequence of peptide has reached the macrolide through an allosteric mechanism

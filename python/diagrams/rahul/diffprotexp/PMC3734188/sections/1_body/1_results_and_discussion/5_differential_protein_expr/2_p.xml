<p>SignalP software is routinely used to predict secretory proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. SignalP can predict the N-terminal signal peptide contained in classically secreted proteins. Among the 86 differentially expressed proteins, 27 (31.4%) were predicted to be secreted, and 59 (68.6%) were considered non-secretory (intracellular or membrane proteins).

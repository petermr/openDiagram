    "<h4>Purpose</h4>The work aimed to develop a co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride nasal nanoemulsion for allergic rhinitis management.<h4>Methods</h4>Compatibility studies were conducted adopting differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Nanoemulsion formulations were prepared using soybean lecithin, olive oil and tween 80. Sodium cholate and glycerol were employed as co-surfactants. Nanoemulsions were assessed for viscosity, pH, droplet size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, electrical conductivity, entrapment, <i>In vitro</i> drug release and corresponding kinetics. Stability of the selected formulation was investigated. The biological effectiveness was evaluated in rabbit models of ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis by measuring TNF-α, TGF-β and IL-1.<h4>Results</h4>Compatibility studies revealed absence of drug/drug interactions. Nanoemulsions exhibited > 90% entrapment efficiency. The selected nanoemulsion demonstrated small droplet size (85.2<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.2<b> </b>nm), low PDI (0.35<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.0) and appropriate Zeta Potential (-23.3<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.2) and stability. It also displayed enhanced in vitro drug release following the Higuashi Diffusion and Baker-Lonsdale models. The mean relative mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1 and TGF-β significantly decreased from 9.59<b> </b>±<b> </b>1.06, 4.15<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.02 and 4.15<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.02 to 1.28<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.02, 1.93<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.06 and 1.56<b> </b>±<b> </b>0.02 respectively after treatment with the selected nanoemulsion formulation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results reflected a promising potent effect of the combined loratadine and sulpiride nasal nanoemulsion in managing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis."

0: Kundmannia is a typical genus of the Apiaceae and are well represented in Spain, France, Italy, Turkey, Syria and North Africa.
1: The genus  Kundmannia consists of five species;  K. anatolica, K. syriaca, K. insulana, K. pastinacifolia and  K. sicula (Djarri et al., 2008).
2: The genus  Kundmannia is represented by  K. anatolica and  K. syriaca in Turkey with 100% endemism (Ozhatay et al., 2009).
3: Kundmannia anatolica Hub.-Mor.
4: is located at elevations between 550-650 m in Southeast Anatolia region of Turkey (Davis et al., 1988; Cinbilgel and Gokceoglu, 2010).
5: However, our recent field observations in the region showed the species spread at elevations between 400-1560 m in Lakes Region of Turkey in C3 Antalya, Isparta and Burdur (Karadogan et al., 2016).
6: Similar to the other taxa of the genus  Kundmannia, K. anatolica produces essential oils, which can be extracted from different parts of the plant, including the fruit, root and flower as well as stem and leafs, with significant diversity in yield and composition.
7: In general, the relative composition of essential oils varies remarkably with geographical position, climate conditions and several other factors (Arruda et al., 2012).
8: There are many studies related to the essential oils in Apiaceae species.
9: To our best knowledge, there is no study performed on the chemical composition of fruit from  K. anatolica, but essential oil compounds and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts of the specie has been recently reported by Paksoy et al.
10: (2016).
11: Some studies on the essential oil composition of fruit and aerial parts from  K. sicula growing in Algeria and Tunisia have been carried out (Djarri et al., 2008; Abderrahim et al., 2013; Faidi et al., 2014).

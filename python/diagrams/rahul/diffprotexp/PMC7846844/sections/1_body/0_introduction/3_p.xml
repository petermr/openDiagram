 </sup>. found that Linc-YY1 can promote myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration by interacting with the transcription factor YY1. However, the function of most lincRNAs in muscle is still unclear. This study focuses on key lincRNAs and explores its possible effects on pig skeletal muscle development by analyzing the regulatory pathways it may participate in.

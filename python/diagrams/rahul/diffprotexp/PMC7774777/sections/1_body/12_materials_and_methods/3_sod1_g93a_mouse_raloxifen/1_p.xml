<p>Transgenic B6SJL-TG_SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J (SOD1-G93A) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. SOD1-G93A males were bred with B6SJL NTG females also from the Jackson Laboratories and maintained according to IACUC approved methods. SOD1-G93A and NTG mice (aged 50 days) were implanted with time release pellets (Innovative Research of America) containing either a vehicle control placebo (placebo), 10 mg of raloxifene (for female mice), or 15 mg of raloxifene (for male mice). Body weight was assessed weekly starting the day prior to pellet implantation. Forepaw muscle strength was measured using a digital grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments). Animals were trained to grasp a horizontal grasping ring. During the testing phase, the average of 3 trials recorded at 5-minute intervals was recorded per mouse. The age of death or the age at which institutional guidelines required euthanasia were recorded for each animal and used to construct a Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curve. An independent cohort of SOD1-G93A and NTG mice was sacrificed at day 60 of raloxifene treatment (ie, 110 days of age), after symptom onset, for biochemical measurements.</p>

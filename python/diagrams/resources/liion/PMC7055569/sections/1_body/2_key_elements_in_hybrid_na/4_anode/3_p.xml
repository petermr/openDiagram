<p>Liang et al. reported a modified approach and uses liquid anode to tackle the Na dendritic growth issue.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> The metallic sodium was dissolved in to mixed organic solvents (biphenyl and ethers) to provide an negatively charged biphenyl balanced by sodium cation with both electronic and ionic conductivities of the order of 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. This sodium‐based liquid anode was separated from the air electrode by the solid electrolyte NASICON as shown in

 </xref>. The cell exhibited lowest overpotential gap (0.14 V), high round trip efficiency (95.3%), 39 mW cm
 <sup>−2</sup> of maximum power density, and exceptional cyclic stability. This outstanding performance of cell was attributed to the high ionic and decent electronic conductivity of the liquid anode, as well as the low interfacial resistance between the liquid anode and the solid electrolyte. Overall, the proposed system can be a potential alternate to avoid the usage of direct metal in metal‐ion or metal–air battery systems. The dissolution of the Na metal in contact with biphenyl produces a negative radical biphenyl stabilized with a sodium cation. The negatively charged biphenyl is then the reactant in the battery; thus the battery concept resembles the organic–air battery proposed recently by Cong et al.

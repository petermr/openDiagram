 <caption> Proteomic profiling of BALF from mice treated with I.T. and I.P. LPS compared to the controls. ( A) Number of up- and down-regulated proteins in BALF following I.T. ( n = 4) and I.P. ( n = 3) LPS treatment compared to the controls ( n = 3); ( B) Top-10 enriched canonical signaling pathways identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Orange, activated; blue, inhibited; grey, no activity pattern available. Z-score was placed on top of each bar. Positive z-score, activation; negative z-score, inhibition. Boxed pathways, differentially regulated pathways between I.T. and I.P. LPS groups compared to the controls. </caption>

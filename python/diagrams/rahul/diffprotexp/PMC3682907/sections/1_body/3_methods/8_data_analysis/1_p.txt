0: Univariate (Mann-Whitney test) and multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) were performed using Ciphergen Express software.
1: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to calculate the p-value.
2: SELDI-MS peak intensity differences were considered significant when p  0.05.
3: Hierarchical clustering was performed on all peaks that were present in at least 25% of spectra with SNR > 4.0 and heat maps were generated [ 49].

<p id="Par26">Through the combined analysis of proteomes, metabolomes, and transcriptomes, we found that in the sterile line and restorer line of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS near-isogenic lines, owing to differences in the restoration gene 
 <italic>Rfp</italic>, a series of genes and pathways occurred in 
 <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>. We performed KEGG enrichment analysis on the detected DEGs and metabolites. The joint analysis of proteomes and metabolomes revealed a significant difference in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and other metabolic pathways. The joint analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes disclosed significant differences in three pathways: the phenylpropane biosynthesis pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolic pathway, and pyruvate biosynthesis pathway. However, transcriptome and metabolome enrichment analysis presented substantial differences in calcium-transporting ATPase activity, epithiospecifier protein, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, phosphatase activity, and starch sucrose metabolisms (Fig. S

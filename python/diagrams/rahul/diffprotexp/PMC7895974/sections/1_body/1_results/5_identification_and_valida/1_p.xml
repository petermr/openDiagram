<p id="Par17">Next, we identified differentially accessible peaks that were open specifically in PSM or in somite samples, ES, MS or DS. We hypothesise that these could represent putative enhancers. For example, differentially accessible peaks identified flanking genes highly expressed in the PSM included a peak downstream of 
 <italic>MSGN1</italic> present in PSM and not in ES, MS or DS (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>); a peak downstream of 
 <italic>WNT8C</italic> and a peak within intron 1 present in PSM but not in somite tissues (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>); and peaks upstream and downstream of 
 <italic>FGF4</italic> present in PSM and low or absent in somite tissues (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>). For the muscle differentiation gene, 
 <italic>MYOG</italic>, a peak was identified upstream of the gene in DS, MS and interestingly also in ES, but not in PSM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5d</xref>). For 
 <italic>RDH10</italic>, which is associated with RA signalling and highly expressed in somites but less abundant in PSM, a differential peak was identified in ES, MS and DS and not in PSM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5e</xref>). Similarly for 
 <italic>GREM1</italic>, an antagonist of BMP signalling highly expressed in developing somites, a differential peak present in all somite samples but not in PSM was identified downstream of the gene (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5f</xref>). In most cases, chromatin accessibility correlated well with gene expression and in some cases it preceded transcript detection, e.g. 
 <italic>MYOG</italic>, or high level gene expression, e.g. 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> (see below). The putative enhancer activities of these differential peaks remain to be confirmed experimentally, however, we validated and further characterised some somite enhancers by embryo electroporation

 </sup>. We focussed on 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> and the homeodomain TF, 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic>, two classic markers identified in the group of genes that increased during the differentiation of paraxial mesoderm and somites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>, Cluster B). In addition, MEOX1 binding motifs were increased in accessible regions in DS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref>).

<p>We found that 5,808, 5,812, and 4,792 genes were expressed in NVs, NDVs, and NDHs, respectively. The number of expressed genes in NDHs was smaller than that in NVs and NDVs. These results suggest that more genes are necessary for the growth of vegetative cells than for the growth of heterocysts. Furthermore, the number of expressed genes in NVs and NDVs was similar. Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values were used to calculate gene expression levels; the results suggested that the average FPKM values of NDHs were lower than those of NVs and NDVs (

0: Brain tissue was preserved at  80 C, and a small fraction of tissue (1 mg) was homogenized in a glass homogenizer in 1% Triton X-100 containing hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, and a 1:1,000 dilution of a protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
1: Tissue suspensions were then frozen three times in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min.
2: The resulting supernatants were removed and stored at  80 C 70.
3: Protein content of brain homogenates was determined using PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions for plate reader.

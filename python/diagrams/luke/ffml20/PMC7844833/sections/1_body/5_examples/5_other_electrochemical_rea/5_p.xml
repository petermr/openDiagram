<p>Another approach to avoid poisoning of fuel cell catalyst is to oxidize the adsorbed CO to CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The electrochemical CO oxidation itself is an important model reaction, and has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally.

 </sup> For example, 
 <italic>in situ</italic> XAS was employed to probe the changes in the catalyst local structure during this process using size-selected Pt NPs (ca. 1.8 nm) as model catalysts. EXAFS analysis revealed no significant changes in the NP structure under working conditions. Nevertheless, the interactions with CO resulted in subtle changes in the Pt L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge white line, affecting also the surface-induced disorder.

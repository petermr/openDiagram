<p id="p0340">We used published RNA sequencing gene expression profiles of normal thyroid tissues from TCGA [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and GTEx [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] project databases, amounting to 58 and 446 profiles, correspondingly. Samples barcodes are shown in Supplementary File 6. Raw gene counts were processed as reads per million (RPM).

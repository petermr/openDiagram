0: Frozen cell-pellets from large-scale cultures were resuspended in 1 mL of TES buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 0.6 M sorbitol) per gram of cell-pellet, supplemented with PIC and 1 mM PMSF.
1: The cells were broken with 0.5 mm glass beads using the planetary mill Pulverisette 6 (Fritsch).
2: The broken crude extract was recovered and the beads were washed with 1.5 mL of ice-cold TES buffer per gram of cell-pellet.
3: The pH of the broken cells was adjusted to 7.5, and centrifuged at 1000   g for 20 min at 4C.
4: The resulting supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 20 000   g for 20 min at 4C to obtain the second pellet (P2).
5: The resulting supernatant from the previous step (S2) was then centrifuged at 125,000   g during 1 h at 4C, obtaining the third pellet (P3).
6: P3 pellet was re-suspended in 0.2 mL of HEPES-sucrose buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0,25 M sucrose) per gram of cell-pellet.
7: Aliquots of all membrane pellets were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80C.
8: An appropriate amount of membranes containing the desired total protein amount was mixed with loading buffer containing urea, heated at 30C during 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.

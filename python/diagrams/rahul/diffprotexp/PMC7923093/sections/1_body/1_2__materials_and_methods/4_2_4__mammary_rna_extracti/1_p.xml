<p>Quality inspection of total RNA extracted from rat mammary gland samples was conducted using the Qubit 2.0 fluorescent quantitative instrument and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Total RNA was purified according to the ‘TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Guide’ and ligated at the 3′ and 5′ end, respectively. After reverse transcription, amplification and cDNA purification, the sequencing library was constructed. The library was tested for concentration using Qubit
 <sup>®</sup> 2.0 Fluorometer and the Agilent 2100 was used to determine the size of the library.

<p id="p0225">To comprehensively elucidate potential regulatory mechanisms of systemic metabolic homeostasis, inter-organ metabolic cycles for additional key metabolic organs should be evaluated. Adipose tissue is an obvious choice. We analyzed the trans-omic network of insulin signaling in differentiated 3T3 adipocytes (

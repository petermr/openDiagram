0: Compared with other organs, arginine is not only a substrate for milk protein synthesis, but also is involved in the formation of mammary glands in cells.
1: As a functional amino acid, arginine can promote cell proliferation in two ways: as a semi-essential amino acid for cell growth; or through promoting the synthesis of nitric oxide [ 7, 8].
2: Arginine can regulate mammary cell growth and lactation performance through nitric oxide synthesis [ 2].
3: A low concentration of nitric oxide can regulate cell proliferation-related gene expression and promote cell growth, while high concentrations of nitric oxide can inhibit cell proliferation [ 9].
4: In a recent experiment involving arginine supply and casein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells, Chen et al.
5: [ 10] found that arginine could promote the proliferation of bovine mammary epithelial cells in vitro.
6: The study shows that enhanced supply of arginine can activate mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways to improve milk protein synthesis [ 11].

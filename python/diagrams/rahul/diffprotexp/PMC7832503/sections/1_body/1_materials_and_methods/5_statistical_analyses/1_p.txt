0: The collected demographic information was evaluated by MannWhitney U test or Fisher exact test using SPSS 17.0, and differences were considered statistically significant at  P  0.05.
1: We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) using PLINK (v1.9).
2: To determine which common SNVs were independently associated with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease, a logistics regression analysis was utilized to control for the first 5 PCs of ancestry using PLINK (v1.9).
3: To detect the joint effect of common SNVs, a chi-square test was implemented to incorporate the subgroup common SNVs within one gene or segment region using GCTA (v1.91.6beta).
4: The relationships between the rare functional SNVs in single gene or gene set and severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease were specifically assessed with SKAT-O models using KGGseq (v1.0).

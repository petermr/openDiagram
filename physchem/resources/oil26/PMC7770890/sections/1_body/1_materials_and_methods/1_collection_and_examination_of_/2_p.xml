the 321 ACE2 orthologs, 30 sequences had one or more amino acids that
were either nonstandard or incorrectly parsed, i.e., annotated as
&#8220;X&#8221;, and thus these ACE2 orthologs were excluded from
the detailed analysis (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). Moreover, sequence alignment analysis (see below) showed that
the ACE2 proteins of six species had five or more missing S-RBD binding
residues (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>), i.e., <italic>Acanthisitta chloris</italic> (protein accession ID: XP_009082150.1), <italic>Apteryx mantelli mantelli</italic> (XP_013805736.1), <italic>Salmo
salar</italic> (XP_014062928.1), <italic>Rhinopithecus bieti</italic> (XP_017744069.1), <italic>Leptonychotes weddellii</italic> (XP_030886750.1),
and <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic> (XP_032835032.1). Subsequent
binding analysis (see below) showed that these ACE2 receptors had
a much higher binding energy (and thus a lower binding capability)
than the others (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>), partly because of the incomplete binding interface. Therefore,
we cannot suggest whether these animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
based on the defective information.</p>

<p>Dissolution of LFP with HCl was demonstrated by Laucournet et al. [
 <xref rid="B164-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] and Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The process was also patented by Umicore [
 <xref rid="B165-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>] and has the advantage of its ability to treat LTO anode simultaneously with LFP. During the leaching step, either the LFP is completely dissolved while titanium is recovered as TiO
 <sub>2</sub>(s) or lithium is selectively extracted from both spent active materials. In the first option, illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00801-f011">Figure 11</xref>, Fe is precipitated as phosphate with or without a pre-oxidation step with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. In the second option, the leaching residue containing Ti and Fe is leached a second time at pH = 2â€“3 to extract Fe. Solubilized Fe is recovered in the same way as in the first option. Furthermore, among various lithium recovery methods, Laucournet et al. proposed the use of cationic ion exchange resin [
 <xref rid="B164-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. As by Laucournet et al., both Kim et al. and Shin et al. recovered Fe as amorphous phosphate after hydrochloric acid leaching [
 <xref rid="B166-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>,
 <xref rid="B167-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>,
 <xref rid="B168-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Then, the phosphate can be crystallized as strengite and used as a precursor for the LFP synthesis.

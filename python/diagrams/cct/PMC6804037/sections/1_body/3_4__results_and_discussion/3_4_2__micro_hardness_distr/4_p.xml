<p>The pulse width plays also a major role in material laser processing [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f010">Figure 10</xref>. When the pulse width increased, the micro-hardness value in the hardened layer increased as well. The micro-hardness value in sample #8 reached 665 Vickers. A high amount of energy was transferred to the surface of the sample, which caused higher hardness.

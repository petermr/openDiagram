  <p>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) of DEGs in discrimination among non-survivors, survivors and healthy controls. (A) AUROCC of 10 DEGs between non-survivors versus survivors. (B) AUROCC of 10 DEGs between non-survivors versus healthy controls. (C) AUROCC of 10 DEGs between survivors versus healthy controls. (D). Random Forest model of a combined gene signature discriminates survivors and non-survivors. The 12 genes which individually discriminated clinical groups with AUROCC &gt; 0.80 in qRT-PCR were combined to create a single model, which was used to classify the separation between survivors (S), non-survivors (NS) and healthy controls (HC) in the qRT-PCR dataset.</p>

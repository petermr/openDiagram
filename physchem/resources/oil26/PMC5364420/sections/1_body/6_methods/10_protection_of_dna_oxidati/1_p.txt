0: The ability of samples to protect supercoiled pBR322 plasmid against AAPH was measured according to the method described by Zhang and Omaye with some modifications 38.
1: Intact pBR322 plasmid (0.5 g) was mixed with various concentrations of samples and 2 L of 25 mM AAPH in PBS (pH 7.4), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Then the samples were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel containing 0.5 g/mL ethidium bromide, photos of DNA bands were taken under gel image analysis system.

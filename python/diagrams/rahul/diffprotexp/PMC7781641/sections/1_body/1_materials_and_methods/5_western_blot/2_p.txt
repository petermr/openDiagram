0: The TG for each of the four groups were pooled together (n = 3) for protein extraction and homogenized using a pestle and 500 L of 1x RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat# 89,900).
1: Samples were put on a rocking shaker for 2 h and then centrifuged, and the supernatant removed to a new tube.
2: Sample was assayed for total protein.

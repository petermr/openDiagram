<p>Compared to sepsis and bacterial pneumonia, studies evaluating the role of TREM1 in aspergillosis are relatively limited. Increased TREM1 expression is observed in monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, while reduced TREM1 expression is observed in individuals suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [

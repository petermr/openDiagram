Astrocytes were treated with LPS (1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) and then incubated with HR and SGR essential oils (100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) for 24&#8201;h. The treatment of astrocytes with LPS induced a significant increase in ROS levels in comparison with the control cells. Our results showed that treatment with HR and SGR essential oils reduced intracellular levels of ROS about 1.5-fold in LPS-stimulated astrocytes in comparison with the cells treated with only LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

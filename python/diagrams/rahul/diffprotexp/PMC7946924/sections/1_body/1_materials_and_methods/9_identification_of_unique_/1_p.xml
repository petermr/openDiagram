<p id="Par16">Unique miRNAs were present in the spikelets of only one of the genotypes (either in SR-159 or in SR-157) while comparison of respective stages of development and hence could not be used for DGE and FC calculation. The pSRNA Target Server (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) or auxin (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) signalling responses were short listed. From these lists, miRNA with high read count values were of primary interest for validation.

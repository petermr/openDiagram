0: Mandarin fish (69.9  10.2 g) were obtained from Chinese Perch Research Center of Huazhong Agricultural University (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China) and maintained in the aquarium (12 tanks, 50 fish per tank) at constant temperature (25  0.5 C).
1: Mandarin fish were and domesticated and fed with artificial diets (Table  5) and divided into two groups: fish did not eat artificial diets and fish ate artificial diets.
2: The fish did not eat artificial diets during the first domestication process was then fed with live fish prey for three days, starved for two days and fed with artificial diets for one day, and then we selected the fish did not eat artificial diets during the second domestication process and repeated the domestication process for one more time.
3: The fish ate artificial diets during the first domestication process was fed with live fish prey for one days and fed with artificial diets for three days, then we selected the fish ate artificial diets during the second domestication process and repeated the domestication process for one more time.
4: Finally, the two groups were obtained, the fish did not eat artificial diets or ate artificial diets during all of the three domestication processes, named Group W ( n = 56) or X ( n = 24), respectively.
5: Six fish were used for real-time quantitative PCR.
6: Six fish were used for western blotting.
7: Ten fish were used for metabolome , and three fish were used for transcriptome sequencing.

0: Cyperus rotundus L. (Cyperaceae) is a medicinal herb traditionally used to treat various clinical conditions at home.
1: In this study, chemical composition of   Cyperus rotundus rhizomes essential oil, and   in vitro antioxidant, DNA damage protective and cytotoxic activities as well as antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens were investigated.
2: Results showed that -cyperone (38.46%), cyperene (12.84%) and -selinene (11.66%) were the major components of the essential oil.
3: The essential oil had an excellent antioxidant activity, the protective effect against DNA damage, and cytotoxic effects on the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell, as well as antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens.
4: These biological activities were dose-dependent, increasing with higher dosage in a certain concentration range.
5: The antibacterial effects of essential oil were greater against Gram-positive bacteria as compared to Gram-negative bacteria, and the antibacterial effects were significantly influenced by incubation time and concentration.
6: These results may provide biological evidence for the practical application of the   C. rotundus rhizomes essential oil in food and pharmaceutical industries.

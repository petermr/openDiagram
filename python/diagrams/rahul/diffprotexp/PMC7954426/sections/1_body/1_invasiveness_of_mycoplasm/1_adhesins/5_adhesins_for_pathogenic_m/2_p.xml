 <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> adhesins include P40 and the familial adhesins Vpmas (VpmaUâ€“Z), with the latter functioning in invasins [
 <xref rid="cit0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The 
 <italic>M. conjunctivae</italic> adhesin LppS exhibits high homology with the adhesins in 
 <italic>M. hyopeneumoniae</italic>, such as P146, MHP1, P97, and ciliary adhesin [
 <xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. LppS contains a characteristic serine-rich region and a proline-rich region. 
 <italic>M. conjunctivae</italic> also possesses LppT, which is similar to the 
 <italic>M. hyopeneumoniae</italic> membrane proteins P76 and P110 [
 <xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The function of LppT is to assist LppS and participate in adherence to lamb cells [
 <xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The primary adhesin of 
 <italic>M. mycoids subsp. mycoids</italic> (Mmm) is P19, and its adhesion ability is significantly reduced after antibody treatment [
 <xref rid="cit0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. One adhesin-related gene (XDU01000267) and four PDH complex genes were found in the 
 <italic>M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae</italic> (Mccp) M1601 genome, but their functions need further verification [
 <xref rid="cit0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].

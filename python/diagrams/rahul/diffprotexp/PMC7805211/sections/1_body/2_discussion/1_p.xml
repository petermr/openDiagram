<p id="Par12">This study represents the most comprehensive epigenetic analysis of CNFs and PNFs to date.Â Greater than 99% of NF1 patients exhibit both CNFs and PNFs over the course of their lifetime accounting for a substantial negative impact on quality of life [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pain is a constant feature of both neurofibroma subtypes, yet how pain signaling occurs in peripheral nerve tumors is poorly understood. Despite the recent demonstration of MEK inhibitor effectiveness in PNF treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], it is unclear whether CNFs respond with equal efficacy. More therapies are needed to treat neurofibroma tumor progression and symptoms, such as pain and itching, as all of these clinical features contribute significantly to morbidity in NF1. Our findings address an unmet clinical need for neurofibroma treatment and offer significant mechanistic insight into how benign nerve tumors initiate, progress, and generate symptoms through epigenetic means. It is now conceivable that NF1-deficient neurofibromas can be treated by targeting epigenetic mechanisms that reinforce RAS signaling and its association with inflammation.

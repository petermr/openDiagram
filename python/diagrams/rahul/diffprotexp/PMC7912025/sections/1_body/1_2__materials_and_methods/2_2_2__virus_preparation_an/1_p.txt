0: The human RSV long strain was grown in Hep-2 cells and prepared, as previously described [ 24, 25].
1: The viral titer of purified RSV pools was varied from 8 to 9 log PFU/mL, determined by a methylcellulose plaque assay [ 26].
2: Viral pools were aliquoted, quick-frozen on dry iceethanol, and stored at 70 C until they were used.
3: The virus was adsorbed onto the surface of hSAECs in submerged culture for 2 h prior to washing at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.
4: Mock infected cells were used as controls.

<p id="Par36">Raw reads were uploaded to the High-Performance Computing Facility of the University of Puerto Rico. Samples for the assembly comprised 3 from normal mesentery, 3 from day 1 regenerating intestine, 5 from day 3 regenerating intestine, and 6 samples from the radial organ complex from a previous study by Mashanov et al.

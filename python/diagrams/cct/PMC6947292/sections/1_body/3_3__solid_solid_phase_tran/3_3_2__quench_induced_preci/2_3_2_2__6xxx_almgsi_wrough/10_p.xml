 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f036">Figure 36</xref>A shows BSE-SEM images of the microstructural development of 6005A observed at a constant cooling rate of 0.0016 K/s down to different temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f014">Figure 14</xref>). At 500 °C, only primary precipitates are visible. The first Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles were detected at 475 °C, immediately before the intensity maximum of the HTR was reached, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f030">Figure 30</xref>A. A high fraction of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si precipitates was observed by SEM at 450 °C after passing the peak of the HTRs. As revealed by SEM, the microstructure did not change significantly with a further decrease in temperature. It was therefore concluded that the Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si precipitation originates from the HTRs. During faster cooling of 6005A at 0.16 K/s, where the LTR dominates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f030">Figure 30</xref>A), rod-/lath-shaped precipitates could be detected for the first time at 325 °C. At temperatures below 325 °C, the rod-/lath-shaped precipitates grew only slightly, as illustrated in the TEM micrographs in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f036">Figure 36</xref>B. Hence, it was concluded that the precipitation of rod-/lath-shaped precipitates corresponds to the LTR.

 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using a metaproteomics approach, Gavin and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] identified clear signatures for new-onset type 1 diabetes in stool that can be useful in the development of therapies and diagnosis. Similarly, Tanca and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that Clostridial butyrate biosynthesis enzymes were significantly reduced in diabetic mice as compared to nondiabetic mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], adding to the evidence that the intestinal microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and that reduction of butyrate synthesis may play a role.

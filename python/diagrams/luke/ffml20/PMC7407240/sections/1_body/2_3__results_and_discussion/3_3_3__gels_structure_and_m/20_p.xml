<p>The highest drop is registered for tetracycline hydrochloride. Therefore, even if there are interactions between carrageenan and the model antibiotics, these do not lead to a crosslinking of the polymer matrix in the traditional sense (linking macromolecular chains and lowering the swelling degree of the material). Instead, this interaction (possibly coupled with hydrogen bonding) modulates the drug release patterns and leads in each case to a small “bound” amount of antibiotic embedded in the matrix (

<p>The post-edge region in XANES spectra is equally informative. Zitolo et al. have demonstrated that XANES data fitting of iron- and cobalt-based nitrogen–carbon materials acquired during ORR provides important clues about the coordination of the active site, whereas EXAFS analysis yields ambiguous results.

<p>For rheumatoid arthritis (RA), one of the most common autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, excessive synovial proliferation, joint swelling, and tenderness are the pathological characteristics.

 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> With the deepening of research and the rapid development of technology, it has been found that there is an association between m6A methylation and RA. Luo et al
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> confirmed that the expression of peripheral blood ALKBH5 and FTO was linked with autoantibody production and RA disease activity, which may be used as an indicator of activity and the inflammatory response. However, there are few studies about the effect of m6A methylation on RA FLSs.

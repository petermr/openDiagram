 <caption> Characterizing the thermotolerance linked biochemical markers in contrasting wheat cvs. exposed to differential HS at different stages of growth, (a) variations in the SOD activity in wheat cvs. HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk in response to differential HS, (b) accumulation pattern of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) in wheat cvs. HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk in response to differential HS, (c) catalase activity assay in wheat cvs. HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk in response to differential HS, (d) accumulation of osmolyte in wheat cvs. HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk in response to differential HS; C - 22 ± 3℃, T 1 - 32℃, 2 h, T 2 - 38℃, 2 h; three biological and technical replicates were used for the expression analysis, vertical bars indicate s.e (n = 3). </caption>

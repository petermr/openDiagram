<p id="Par12">The genomic distribution of accessible regions was similar in all four sample types: between 39 and 42% were in intergenic regions, ~10% were in introns, 0.5% in exons, 2–3% at the TSS and 43–46% of accessible regions were within a 50 kb region upstream of the TSS which includes the promoter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). Functional terms associated with predicted TF binding sites that were enriched in accessible peaks in DS compared to PSM included cell fate specification and terms related to morphogenesis or skeletal myogenesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). Consistent with the latter, we identified &gt;200 binding sites for myogenin (MYOG) that are located within accessible chromatin peaks within 2 kb of genes differentially expressed in DS, where skeletal muscle differentiation occurs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). The MYOG motif is well conserved across mouse and human, thus is likely to be conserved across avian species also. Other enriched TFs identified include bHLH proteins (TCF12, ASCL1, ARNT1), of which TCF12 is expressed in skeletal muscle, is part of the canonical Wnt pathway and implicated as a transcriptional repressor in colorectal cancer

 </sup>. Sp1 and Sp3 bind to GC and GT boxes and can be displaced from these sequences by KLF16, a Krüppel-like zinc finger protein for which binding sites are also enriched and increased in PSM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>). Other zinc finger TFs include ZNF384, ZNF740 and ZNF263, which are involved in the regulation of cell differentiation genes including those relevant to musculoskeletal development. For example, ZNF384 regulates extracellular matrix genes MMP1, MMP3, MMP7 and COL1A1

 </sup>; ZNF740 recruits the chromatin regulator HDAC1 to the SMAD4-DNA complex and prevents the recruitment of the transcriptional activators CREBBP and EP300
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. The binding motifs for ZNF740 are increased in PSM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>). ZNF263 is involved in adipogenesis

 </sup> are involved in tumorigenesis such as Ewing sarcoma in bones and bone connective tissues. Furthermore, the binding motif for retinoic acid receptors (RXRA) is enriched. Motif enrichment analysis of differentially accessible regions identified additional TF motifs that were increased in number in either PSM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>) or DS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref>). In PSM this included motifs for TFAP2C/TFAP2B and ZIC3/ZIC4, whose functions in axial elongation and/or musculoskeletal development are currently unknown. In DS, this included motifs for FOXO1/FOXO3 and MEOX1.

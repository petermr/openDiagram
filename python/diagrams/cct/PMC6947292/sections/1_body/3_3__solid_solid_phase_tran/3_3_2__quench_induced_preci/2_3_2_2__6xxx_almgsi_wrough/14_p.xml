 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f039">Figure 39</xref> shows detailed images of quench-induced β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles. If precipitated inside a grain, square plate particles with a thickness of about one third of their edge length (i.e., an aspect ratio of 1/3) are common. This can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f039">Figure 39</xref>A,B, as the particle in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f039">Figure 39</xref>A is in a perpendicular plane compared to that of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f039">Figure 39</xref>B. Stepwise polishing of a metallographic sample revealed this aspect ratio for several particles [

 <sub>2</sub>Si precipitates, the precipitation of β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si seems to occur only at grain boundaries [
 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles at grain boundaries have irregular and variable particle shapes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f039">Figure 39</xref>C). At either location, the nucleation of quench-induced β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles appears to occur on coarse (µm range) primary precipitates typically enriched in Fe, Si and Mn (see

<p>All the reagents (Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) were analytically pure without further treatment. Similar preparation methods could be referred to our previous work [

 <sub>4</sub> nanowires, 4 mmol cobalt acetate was dissolved in 30 mL ultrapure water. Subsequently, 4 mmol lauryl sodium sulfate, 1.2 mmol copper chloride, and the 0.8 mmol nickel chloride were added to the above cobalt acetate solution in sequence. Then, 48 mmol hexamethylenetetramine was dissolved in 30 mL ultrapure water to form a transparent solution which was dropped into the above mixed solution slowly. After stirring for 1 h, the resultant solution was poured into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. Then the autoclave was heated at 120 °C for 12 h in oven. The obtained sediment was filtered, rinsed and dried. Finally, after calcination of the powder at 600 °C for 2 h in muffle, Cu

 <sub>4</sub> was obtained. Similarly, NiCo

 <sub>4</sub> and CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> were obtained by adjusting the addition amount of copper chloride and nickel chloride.

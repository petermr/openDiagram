<p id="Par42">Finally, to assess the involvement of RNA surveillance factors in differential splicing, we compared the distribution of RNA isoform expression with and without premature translation termination codons for all the genes with differential splicing. This analysis did not reveal significant differences between the two pools of RNA molecules: about 11% of differentially spliced RNA isoforms contains premature stop codons compared to 14% of non-differential RNA isoforms (odds ratio 0.81,

<p>The top functions that were predicted with a significant activation z-score (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="proteomes-01-00219-s001">Table S5</xref>), fell into categories of cell death and survival, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cellular assembly and organization, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement, infectious disease, molecular transport and protein synthesis. Among the functional changes, only cell death increased while the others decreased. The functional changes may indicate a protective response in which the cell decreases energy requiring activities and functions to protect itself [

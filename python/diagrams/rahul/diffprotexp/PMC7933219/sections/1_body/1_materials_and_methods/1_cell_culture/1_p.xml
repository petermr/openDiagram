<p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Lifeline Cell Technology, MD, United States) were cultured in M199 (Gibco; Grand Island, NY, United States) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. The identity of the HUVECs was confirmed by their polygonal morphology and expression of factor VIII-related antigen. PC-3M cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in air at 37°C (

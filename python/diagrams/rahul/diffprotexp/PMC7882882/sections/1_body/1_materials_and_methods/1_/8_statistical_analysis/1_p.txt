0: Data are presented as the mean  standard deviation, unless otherwise shown.
1: All experiments were performed in triplicate.
2: The differentially expressed PCGs and lncRNAs were identified using an unpaired t-test.
3: The difference in mRNA and lncRNA expression level between the two groups was assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test with GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software).
4: Kaplan-Meier analysis of PFS was conducted using the log-rank or the Renyi test (when there was survival curve crossover between the observed groups) using the R packages survival and survMisc in R (3.5.1).
5: P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

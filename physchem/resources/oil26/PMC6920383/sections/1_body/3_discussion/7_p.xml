<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par31">Burrows appear to be more durable in the arid scrubland than the other sites (c. 30% of burrows had collapsed in the mesic grassland and the semi-arid savannah, but c. 10% in the arid scrubland), and this variation in burrow longevity (and the underlying differences in soils) may have contributed to the differences observed between the three habitats. The greater durability of burrows in the arid scrubland may reflect the high clay content of the soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup> (giving burrows a stronger structure) and the lower rainfall (which would slow degradation rates). In contrast, in the semi-arid savannah where burrows were created in sandy soil, burrows would probably collapse more frequently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Although the semi-arid savannah site has a relatively low annual rainfall, even a moderate rainfall event appeared to trigger burrow collapse (pers. obs.). Therefore, in the semi-arid savannah, burrows are probably not long-lasting, and both biotic and abiotic conditions potentially converge with the undisturbed surrounding environment at a faster rate than at the other study sites. This suggests that the impacts of burrowing may be mediated by both soil type and rainfall. Indeed, contrary to initial predictions, rainfall may rather play a role as a physical force in the deterioration of burrows, where the combination of burrow durability and amount and intensity of rainfall will influence burrow longevity (see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> for a similar idea about engineered structures).</p>

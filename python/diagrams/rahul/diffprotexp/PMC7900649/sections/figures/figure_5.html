 <caption> RT-qPCR analysis of the dynamic expression of selected genes. IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV GDS01 at 0.5 MOI were collected at six time points and RT-qPCRs were performed. The x-axis denotes different time points and the y-axis denotes the relative expression in infected samples comparing to uninfected samples. SAPAs represent the relative expression of genes calculated from IVT-SAPAS sequencing database </caption>

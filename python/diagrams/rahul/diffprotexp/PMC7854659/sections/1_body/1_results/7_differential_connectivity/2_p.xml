<p id="Par15">From the liver, the networks filtered for either DEG or TF genes resulted in 8,350 and 8,632 nodes and 261,099 and 231,270 edges for RES and CON groups, respectively. By contrasting the connectivity between the groups, we found 153 differentially connected (DK) genes (

Regarding the cerebrum, the CON network was composed of 6,390 nodes and 29,531 edges, whereas the RES one had 7,555 nodes and 48,662 edges. Accordingly, we identified 72 DK genes (

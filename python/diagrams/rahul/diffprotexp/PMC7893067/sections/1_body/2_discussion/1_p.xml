<p id="Par17">To date, transcriptome analysis has mainly relied on analyzing RNA sequencing data from whole cells, overlooking the impact of subcellular RNA localization and its influence on our understanding and interpretation of gene expression patterns in cells and tissues. We argue that defining gene expression patterns at the subcellular level is crucial to (1) understand the differences between the cytosolic and nuclear transcriptomes and how each fraction contributes to the global gene expression patterns, (2) investigate the dynamics of subcellular RNA localization between different cells and different developmental stages as a regulatory mechanism to control protein expression and influence RNA function, and (3) evaluate the reliability of using nuclear transcriptome in single-cell studies as a proxy for whole-cell analysis. In this study, we therefore aimed to obtain a comprehensive overview of the subcellular localization of the different RNA transcripts in the human brain.</p>

 <p>Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acquired cardiac disease with a high incidence that affects children. KD has various complications, including coronary artery dilation (CAD) and coronary artery aneurysms (CAA). The identification of differentially expressed proteins and the underlying mechanisms may be the key to understanding differences between these KD complications. In the present study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation were used to identify variations in serum proteins between KD patients with CAD and CAA. In total, 87 (37 upregulated and 50 downregulated) and 65 (33 upregulated and 32 downregulated) significantly differentially-expressed proteins were identified in comparisons between control samples (healthy individuals) and those obtained from patients with KD and with CAD or CAA. Investigation into the underlying biological process revealed that variations between the two complications were associated with the wound healing response, as well as lipoprotein- and cholesterol-associated processes. Important proteins involved in the formation of the wound healing signaling network were identified via enriched biological processes and pathway analysis using ClueGo and ReactomeFIViz software. In the present study, 5 significantly differentially-expressed proteins, including mannose binding lectin 2 (MBL2), complement factor H (CFH), kininogen 1 (KNG1), serpin family C member 1 (SERPINC1) and fibronectin 1 (FN1), were selected and confirmed by western blotting. Analysis indicated that these proteins were associated to immunity, inflammation and metabolism, serving a key role within each module, which has never been reported previously. The present study proposed that MBL2, CFH, KNG1, SERPINC1 and FN1 may be a potentially excellent indicator group for distinguishing the two major KD complications, CAD and CAA.</p>

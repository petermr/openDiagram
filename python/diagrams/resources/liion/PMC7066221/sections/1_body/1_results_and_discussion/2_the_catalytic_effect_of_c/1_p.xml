<p id="p0090">In this section, the role of cobalt components in the deposition of active Mn compound is further discussed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for a practical battery configuration and a home-made electrolyzer cell. Compared with the galvanostatic charging process where the time duration in the range of 1.6–1.8 V for each charging is very short (causing a fast voltage buildup due to the full charge of the cathode), the CV and LSV methods allow equal time at every voltage step. Therefore, well-defined peaks could be identified from a CV or an LSV curve, when compared with the dQ/dV profile extracted from a galvanostatic charging profile.</p>

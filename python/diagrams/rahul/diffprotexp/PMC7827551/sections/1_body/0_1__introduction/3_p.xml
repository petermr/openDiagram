<p>While genomic and transcriptomic data have yielded a lot of information, the actual functional molecules have not been clearly elucidated. Proteomic study could determine functional protein networks that exist in the cell. Most previous studies of 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> proteome was used to detect protein expression patterns in response to a specific stimulus like antibiotic usage [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], different environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or under conditions mimic the infectious stages [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Comparative gene expression in-between strains or even in a single strain grown under different circumstances has confirmed its usefulness in recognizing mycobacterial growth and its pathogenicity determinants [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These studies were mainly focused on the identification and characterization of the cell wall associated proteins of 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or their secreted proteome [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To our knowledge, investigation of the whole proteome of 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> under different growth phases has not been elucidated yet. It is almost established from former studies on model organisms such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> that the transition from the exponential phase to the stationary phase is associated with changes in the expression patterns of proteins [

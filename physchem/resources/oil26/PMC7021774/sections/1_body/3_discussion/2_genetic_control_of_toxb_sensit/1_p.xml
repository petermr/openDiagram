<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par28">QTL mapping using the MAGIC and AM panels found ToxB sensitivity to be predominantly controlled by <italic>Tsc2</italic>. The MAGIC proximal marker originated from a wheat gene model that also contained GWAS hits 1&#8211;5 and 10. However, analysis of haplotypes around the <italic>Tsc2</italic> region in the AM panel unambiguously positioned <italic>Tsc2</italic> distal to gene model TraesCS2B01G046400 (based on SNPs Kukri_c148_1512, Kukri_c148_1346, representing GWAS hits 7 and 8, respectively) based on recombination events in &#8216;Orbit&#8217; and &#8216;Cadogan&#8217;. The MAGIC marker immediately distal to the <italic>Tsc2</italic> QTL peak corresponded to AM hit 12 (Kukri_c63748_1453), with analysis of haplotypes in the AM panel positioning this marker distal to <italic>Tsc2,</italic> based on recombination events in four varieties: &#8216;Selkirk&#8217;, &#8216;Elka&#8217;, &#8216;Thatcher&#8217; and &#8216;Aronde&#8217; (Supplementary Tables 2 and 4). Therefore, the genomic regions defined by GWAS in the AM panel and genetic analyses in the MAGIC population combined to localise <italic>Tsc2</italic> to a 1921-kb region containing 104 gene models, based on the wheat cv. &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; reference genome.</p>

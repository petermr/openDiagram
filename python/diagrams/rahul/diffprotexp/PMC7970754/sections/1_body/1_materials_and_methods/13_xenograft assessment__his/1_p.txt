0: During the administration period, the body weight of the nude mice was measured every 4 days, and the longest diameter (a) and shortest diameter (b) of the tumor were measured with a Vernier caliper.
1: Accordingly, 48 h after the last administration, the experimental animals were euthanized, the tumor was weighed, and the tumor inhibition rate was calculated.
2: The tumor tissues were fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution for 24h and were subsequently fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.
3: Sections of the dissected biopsies were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard procedure and were examined under light microscopy.
4: Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with anti-PCNA (Abcam, USA), anti-Ki-67 (Maixin, China), and anti-Cleaved-Caspase3 monoclonal antibody (CST, USA).
5: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was added and detected according to the manufacturers protocol (Maixin, China).
6: Moreover, the imageJ software was used for image analysis.

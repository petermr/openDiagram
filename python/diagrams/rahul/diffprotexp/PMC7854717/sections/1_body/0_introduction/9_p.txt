0: A special attention was given to the expression coordination of  Ank2 (encoding Ankyrin-B), a major player in cardiac physiology, with its potential binding partners 26 in each heart chamber.
1: The coordination analysis with  Ank2 partners was extended to  Ctnnb1 (catenin (cadherin associated protein), beta 1),  Hspa5 (heat shock protein 5) and  Mapk1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 1) which together with  Ank2 were identified as hub-bottleneck genes in atrial fibrillation 27.

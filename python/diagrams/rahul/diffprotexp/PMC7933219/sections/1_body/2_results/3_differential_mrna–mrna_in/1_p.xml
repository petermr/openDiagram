<p>A differential mRNA–mRNA interaction network was constructed to identify the relationship between differentially expressed genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). By computing the betweenness centrality and degree value of each mRNA, we identified the top 10 interacted mRNAs in the mRNA signal transduction network according to their betweenness centrality (

<p>Crystal information of the samples was acquired by Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406Å). Microstructures, particle sizes and element mapping were analyzed by using a JEOL-7100F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, Japan). Interior structure was observed by a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). The elements and chemical states of the sample were analyzed by a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, VG, Manchester, UK). The molar ratios were determined with an Agilent 7800 Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectrometry (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, US). </p>

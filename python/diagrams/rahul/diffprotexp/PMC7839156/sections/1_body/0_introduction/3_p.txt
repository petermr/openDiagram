0: Understanding of the molecular aspects associated with COVID-19 and the search for understanding the complex response of the host after viral infection have been gaining space.
1: 7  9 Approaches that evaluate viral infections from the perspective of the molecular impact on the host contribute to the understanding of the disease, which is important for outlining potential antiviral strategies.
2: 10 Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which allow  in silico characterization of the molecular response and the impact of infection, can be applied.
3: Some databases contain a collection of expression data, but their results are mostly obtained by text mining with automatic and semiautomatic approaches, which may lead to nonaccurate data being deposited.
4: 11 Furthermore, the results may present redundancy and ambiguity, and a postanalysis is necessary for data conference.
5: 12 In the same way, the need for bioinformaticians to extract raw data in many of the available databases is another important limitation of its use; it can be especially limiting for medical workers without bioinformatics skills who are facing the COVID-19 impact in real time and need information promptly.
6: This scenario hampers the access of the medical community and also other nonspecialized scientists who may need this information in their research.
7: Recently, our group developed the ZIKAVID, a database based on gathering all up-to-date gene expression data generated after Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, containing different experimental approaches, hosts and strains, and other related information.

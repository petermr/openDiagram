<p>Several surface-exposed factors, such as type 1 fimbriae, long polar fimbriae, curli, and cellulose have been described to contribute to biofilm formation and adherence to eukaryotic cells of EAEC strain 55989 [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In order to be able to directly compare the properties of the AAF fimbriae in a homogeneous genetic background, we first deleted

 <italic>DCBA</italic> from the pAA plasmid of EAEC strain 55989 by Red/ET recombination and cloned the encoding gene clusters for AAF/I, III, IV, and V into the expression vector pBAD24. Afterward, we transformed the plasmids into EAEC strain 55989

 </bold> was successful. As the different AAF allelic variants were heterologously expressed in the isogenic strain background (EAEC 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3-), expression of the aforementioned bacterial factors (type 1 fimbriae, long polar fimbriae, curli and cellulose), that may be involved in bacterial adherence and biofilm formation, is unchanged.

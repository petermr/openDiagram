<p>More broadly, the proposed strategy of passivating a battery cell for safety in idle conditions and then self-heating for high power before operation has a profound impact on future directions of battery materials development. Within the SEB framework, the high reactivity of active materials and electrolytes as well as of EEIs is no longer a requirement. The only requirement is stability at elevated temperatures. Such a design strategy will lead to dormant cell performance at low temperatures or even low power at room temperature, but all these deficiencies can be circumvented by the self-heating structure (

 </xref>), which will take a SEB cell from low or room temperature to an elevated temperature suitable for high power output in tens of seconds. On the other hand, these SEB cells enjoy ultrahigh safety and ultralow degradation under all scenarios as well as robust cycling stability at elevated temperatures. We hope that this unconventional strategy will unleash a vast class of new materials for development of a disruptive generation of LIBs.

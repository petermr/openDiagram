0: GC-MS analysis was performed on QP5050 GC-MS equipped with FID detector.
1: The GC was equipped with CP-Wax 52 CB capillary column (50 m x 0.32 mm; film thickness = 0.25 m) and helium was used carrier gas with flow rate of 1 mL/min.
2: The GC oven was heated from 60C to 230C at a rate of 3C/min, the final temperature was then maintained during 20 min.
3: The injector was maintained at a temperature of 250C.
4: Injection volume 0.1 mL of 1% solution prepared in n-hexane; split ratio 20:1.
5: The mass spectrometer was operating in EI mode at 70 eV with mass scan range of 40- 450 amu.
6: Identification of constituents was done on the basis of RI (determined with reference to homologous series of n-alkanes C8-C25, under identical experimental condition), MS library search (NIST 08MS Library (Version 2.0 f) and Wiley MS 9th edition), and by comparison with MS literature data (Adams, 2007).
7: The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on GC peak area (FID response) without using correction factor.

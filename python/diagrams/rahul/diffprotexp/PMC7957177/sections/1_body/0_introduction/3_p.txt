0: In this study, to distinguish specific biomarkers among different histological grades, we first collected all datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and select the analyzed a microarray (NO:  GSE63514), and then confirmed the results by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in specimens from patients.
1: This microarray included 24 normal specimens, 14 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1) lesions, 22 CIN2 lesions, 40 CIN3 lesions and 28 cancer specimens, and found top 24 candidate biomarkers which were highly or lowly expressed in different histological grades, with KRT17 and CRISP2 being the most significant.
2: The further IHC results suggested that KRT17 was dominantly expressed in the cervical squamous cancer and barely expressed in the normal cervix; while CRISP2 was specifically lowly expressed in HSIL.
3: Combined with Ki67 is gradual upregulation with tumor progression, 7 our results indicated that KRT17 and CRISP2 are possible biomarkers for different histological stages of cervical squamous cancer, this findings that may provide new targets for mechanistic studies and adjuvant diagnosis or therapy for cervical cancer.

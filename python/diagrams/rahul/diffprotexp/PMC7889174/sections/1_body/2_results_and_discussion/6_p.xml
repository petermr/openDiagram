 <italic>Lineage-specific NEA proteins are widespread</italic>. Metazoan sequences cannot be used to identify non-orthologous lineage-specific genes in other taxa, and also have inherent bias toward metazoa-specific genes [
 <xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Hence, secondly, we searched using queries from the protozoan 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>). Overall, trypanosome Group A (55 proteins) appears to have core biological functions, with GO annotation (Biological Process) indicating involvement in inorganic and organic ion transport, protein glycosylation and lipid metabolic process (Table S3). Orthologs of some trypanosome Group A proteins were readily identified in all or nearly all other eukaryotes. For example, Tb927.5.900 is an oligosaccharyltransferase subunit, with orthologs retrieved in all genomes queried in our analysis. In other eukaryotes, these are essential for transfer of N-glycans [
 <xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and localize at least in part to the NE [
 <xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Some Group A proteins, however, were less conserved, for example, the transmembrane protein Tb927.10.12810 which contains a choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase domain. In most eukaryotes, choline phosphate cytidylyltransferases localize to the NE and regulate phosphatidylcholine levels [
 <xref rid="cit0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. However, outwith kinetoplastids, orthologs of Tb927.10.12810 were only identified in organisms representing the unicellular taxa Apusomonada, Amoebozoa, Cryptophyta, and Hemimastigophora (

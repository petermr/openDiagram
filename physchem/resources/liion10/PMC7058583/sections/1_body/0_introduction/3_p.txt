0: Herein, inspired by the structure of sandwiches, we constructed a novel 3D flower-like MoS 2-rGO sandwich nanocomposites (MoS 2-PrGO) for lithium-ion battery anode through a linking mode and  in-situ conversion.
1: Supported by the PEO chains, the enlarged interlayer space of rGO not only accommodated as many MoS 2 nano-flowers as possible, but also acted as a conductive framework.
2: The mild volume expansion of the MoS 2 nano-flowers during charge-discharge processes was effectively alleviated by the PEO chains.
3: The rGO conductive framework mad all flower-like MoS 2 stuffings electrochemically active.
4: With this unique design, the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich composites exhibited remarkable specific capacity and ultra-stable cyclic performance during the electrochemical measurements.

<p id="Par25">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, the expression of circ_0003865 was significantly reduced in human BMSCs treated with MEL. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the circ_0003865 was produced from the back-splicing of pre-mRNAs encoded by the ankyrin repeat domain 12 (ANKRD12) gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The expression of circ_0003865 in human BMSCs was validated by RT-PCR using divergent primers in BMSC cDNA samples but not in BMSC gDNA (genomic DNA) samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Furthermore, the covalently closed form of circ_0003865 was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing, which identified the splice junction of circ_0003865 amplified and purified from human BMSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). To analyze the role of circ_0003865 in BMSC osteogenic differentiation, its expression in human BMSCs was then effectively knocked down by transfection with specific siRNAs targeting circ_0003865 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). We observed that the expression of the 
 <italic>RUNX2</italic>, 
 <italic>ALP</italic>, and 
 <italic>OPN</italic> genes in human BMSCs with circ_0003865 knockdown was all significantly higher than those in the si-NC group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Consistently, the protein levels of RUNX2, ALP, and OPN in human BMSCs were all substantially elevated by circ_0003865 knockdown (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Furthermore, we observed that there was no significant effect on proliferation after circ_0003865 knockdown compared to those in si-NC group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). And the elevated expression of ALP in human BMSCs transfected with circ_0003865 siRNAs was further verified by the ALP staining method (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g). Importantly, we showed by Alizarin Red staining that circ_0003865 knockdown resulted in significant enhanced osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h). These results indicate that circ_0003865 acts as a negative regulator of BMSC osteogenic differentiation.

 </xref>. The angle of repose is an indication of adhesion between particles and thus reflect the powder flowability. The smaller the angle of repose, the better the flowability. The Carr's index reveals the flowability based on its compressibility. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA software. There was significant difference in the Carr's index between CD-MOF and SCU@CD-MOF, while there was no significant difference in angle of repose, bulk density and tapped density (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results indicated the Carr's index was potentially an indicator for the characterization of laryngeal deposition in combination with aerodynamic performance.

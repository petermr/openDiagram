<p id="Par46">As two common chronic non-communicable diseases, more and more studies have realized the correlation between lung cancer and T2DM. In a meta-analysis, Lee et al
 <italic>.</italic> systematically analyzed 34 observational studies and found that after adjusting for smoking and other variables, T2DM was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of lung cancer with a relative risk of 1.11 and a 95% CI of 1.02 to 1.20 [

 <italic>.</italic> conducted a prospective study of 244,920 T2DM patients with a 12-year follow-up and found that the LC mortality rate of T2DM patients was significantly higher [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the present research, we systematically analyzed the distribution of tumor location and subtype of lung cancer in T2DM patients. The results revealed that lung cancer was the most common malignant tumor in patients with T2DM, with LAC accounting for the majority of cases. Moreover, unlike pancreatic cancer, which has the highest increased risk in patients with T2DM, the early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer can significantly improve prognosis [

0: Proteomic techniques are increasingly applied in the search for diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer [ 11 18].
1: In thyroid cancer, protein expression patterns have been evaluated by these techniques with the aim of distinguishing benign and malignant thyroid tumors [ 11 13,  17,  19 21].
2: Despite harboring various products of the epithelial cells activity, the liquid component of a thyroid cyst is routinely discarded in FNAB workflow.
3: By contrast, in ovarian cancer and hemangioblastoma, the protein content of cyst fluids is frequently investigated regarding their protein content [ 22,  23].
4: Given the possible diagnostic utility of the thyroid cyst fluid content which could improve FNAB, this study aimed at identifying differentially expressed proteins in cPTC by applying a proteomic approach.

 <caption> Density profile data binned over a single 6 × 12 1 W birnessite layer with the composition K 36[Mn 144O 288] × (H 2O) 96, demonstrating the position of the K + counterions and water oxygens being fully centered in the interlayer region. This contrasts with water hydrogens, which are almost exclusively oriented toward the basal oxygens of the birnessite lattice. </caption>

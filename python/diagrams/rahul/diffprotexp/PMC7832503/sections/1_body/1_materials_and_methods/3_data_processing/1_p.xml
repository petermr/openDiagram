<p>The sequencing reads of the 165 samples were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.15, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). After the alignment, duplicate reads were marked using Picard (version 2.15.0, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://picard.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). Insertion/deletion (indel) realignment, base quality score recalibration, and variant calling were performed using Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK, version 3.8, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/</ext-link>) software. According to the GATK best-practices protocol, we merged individual gVCF files into a combined variant calling format (VCF) and ran variant filtering using variant quality score recalibration. Then, we selected “PASS” single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and further strictly controlled the quality of these SNVs to reach the following criteria: genotype quality &gt;10.0 and approximate read depth &gt;20.0. Finally, we used VCFtools (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) software to convert VCF format file with high quality SNVs into PLINK format files for further analyses. All subsequent analyses in this study were performed only with biallelic SNVs.

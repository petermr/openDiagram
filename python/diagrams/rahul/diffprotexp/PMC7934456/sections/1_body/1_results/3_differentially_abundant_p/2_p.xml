<p id="Par22">The label-free method was used to detect proteins at four levels. Based on -log10 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 1.5, 140 DAPs were identified. Among these proteins, 65 were up-accumulated, and 75 were down-accumulated (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>D). COG/KOG classification analysis showed that DAPs were divided into 18 functional (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). COG/KOG functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed that metabolic processes with considerable differences involved post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, and energy production and conversion (Table S

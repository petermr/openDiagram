  <p>Hierarchical illustration of differentially expressed genes in hTCEpi cells after treatment with AC EFs for 24 h. Both two-fold upregulated and downregulated genes were clustered. Untreated hTCEpi cells served as control. After 24 h of treatment with AC EFs, RNA was isolated and transcriptome-wide gene level expression profiling was performed using Clariom
   <sup>TM</sup> S arrays. Affymetrix
   <sup>Â®</sup> Transcription Analysis Console
   <sup>TM</sup> (TAC) software (v.4.0.1.36) was used for array scanning, data analysis, signal estimation, and quality control functionality for the expression arrays, which also allow statistical analysis and provide a list of differentially expressed genes. Expression level analysis was performed using the normalization method based on the processing algorithm called the robust multi-array average (RMA), which was improved by Signal Space Transformation (SST-RMA, Affymetrix). Each array was performed in triplicate. Blue indicates a relatively low expression, whereas red indicates a relatively high expression.

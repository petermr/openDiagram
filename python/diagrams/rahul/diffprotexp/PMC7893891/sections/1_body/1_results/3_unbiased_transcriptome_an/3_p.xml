<p id="Par62">LANL-developed OPaver [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] identified 12 gene signaling pathways that were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) altered during iPSC conversion to MNs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The top 5 KEGG pathways represented genes involved in cancer regulation, axon guidance, calcium signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and MAPK-signaling pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The OPaver analysis further highlighted the critical role of membrane proteins in cell-to-cell interactions for neuronal development; specifically, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and the development of cholinergic synapses.

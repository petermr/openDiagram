<p id="Par44">Of the 13 proteins identified as DEPs in patients with T2DM + LAC by SWATH-MS analysis, 7 proteins showed significant dysregulation between T2DM + LAC and T2DM, including CCD87, FHR1, FRPD2, HBB, IGFBP3, PZP, and ZN350 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). We next used targeted PRM-MS to provide high sensitivity relative peptide quantification for validation. A total of 4 proteins were detected by PRM-MS, and significant differential expression of 2 of these candidate proteins was confirmed, namely, PZP and IGFBP3 (Fig.

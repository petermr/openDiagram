<p>The preparation method of the experimental materials was similar to previous research reports [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since no studies have shown that the CE resistance of sheep is related to sex, 2-year-old Kazakh ewes with CE-resistant [
 <italic>Mva</italic>I bc-
 <italic>Sac</italic>II ab-
 <italic>Hin</italic>1I ab(R)] and CE-non-resistant [
 <italic>Mva</italic>Ibc-
 <italic>Sac</italic>IIab-
 <italic>Hin</italic>1Iab (NR)] haplotypes were selected, as described previously, and raised on the farm of Shihezi University. All animals were raised under the same conditions of free access to water and food, in natural lighting. They were divided into two groups according to their MHC haplotype: three sheep with the CE-resistant haplotype were referred to as the CE-R group, three sheep with the CE-non-resistant haplotype constituted the CE-NR group, and a single sheep with the CE-non-resistant haplotype formed the CK (Control Check) group. All the sheep were screened for the absence of hydatid cysts and were healthy prior to the experiment. In line with the previous approach, all the sheep were orally infected with 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> eggs. Since our previous research showed that there were already significant differences in miRNAs in the small intestine at 8 h after infection, we speculated that differential gene expression may occur at the same time point. As a result, all animals were sacrificed 8 h after infection. Immediately afterward, the intestinal tissue of every sheep was removed. Approximately 100-mm
 <sup>3</sup>-sized intestinal tissue blocks were collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen prior to long-term storage at −80 °C until RNA extraction.

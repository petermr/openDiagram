<p>During the temperature increases, the element diffusion coefficient became lager. The large diffusion of both carbon and Mn changed the method of grain growth from grain boundary migration to grain annexation. The sharp increase of grain growth rate was present during continuous heating from 1100 °C up to 1250 °C.</p>

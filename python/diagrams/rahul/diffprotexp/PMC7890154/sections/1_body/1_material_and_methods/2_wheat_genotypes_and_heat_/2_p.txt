0: Wheat  cvs.
1: HD3086 (thermotolerant) and BT-Schomburgk (thermosusceptible) were selected for the present investigation.
2: The seeds of both the  cvs.
3: were pre-treated with Bavistin @ 0.25% before sowing in 30 pots (15 pots per cultivar) having equal ratio of perlite, sand and farmyard manure (FYM).
4: Pots were kept inside glass house with regulated growth conditions [22  2 C (day-time) and 18  2 C (night-time), RH of 80%, PAR of 250 mol m 1 s 1 with 8 h light and dark period] at Mini Phytotron Facility, IARI, New Delhi.
5: The plants were irrigated at regular interval.
6: The plants (in group) were treated with differential HS (T 1 - 32C, 2 h and T 2 - 38C for 2 h) at flowering and grain development stages, decided based on the Feekes scale [ 19].
7: Microprocessor-regulated chambers were used to expose the plants to HS with an increment of 1 C per 10 min, till it attains the specific temperature for HS.
8: We have collected flag leaf and spikes in triplicates for further downstream applications.

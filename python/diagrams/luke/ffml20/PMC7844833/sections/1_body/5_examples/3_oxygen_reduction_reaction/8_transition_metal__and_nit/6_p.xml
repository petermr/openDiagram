 </sup> The presence of singly dispersed Ru sites was demonstrated by Ru K-edge EXAFS analysis, including wavelet transform data, as well as theoretical XANES modeling for DFT-optimized structure models. At the same time, the presence of metallic Ru clusters was observed for three control samples which exhibited lower ORR activity: a sample, prepared without graphene doping by N, a sample with increased Ru loading, and a sample with increased annealing temperature.

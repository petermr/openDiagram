0: CNTs were purchased from SES Research (Houston, TX, USA).
1: Based on the manufacturers data, SWCNT (#900-1301) (long) were purified single-walled nanotubes with an outer diameter<2 nm and lengths ranging from 515 m. The purity was reported to be >90%CNT (>50% SWCNT) containing ash (<2% wt) and amorphous carbon (<5% wt).
2: Purified MWCNT (# 900-1203) had a reported outer diameter of 4060 nm with lengths ranging from 515 m. The MWCNT were reported to be >95% nanotubes with low level amorphous carbon (<2%), and ash content (<0.2%).

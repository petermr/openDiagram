0: The aim of the present study was to examine the lncRNA expression profiles of cartilage from young patients with amputations without joint lesions, and from patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent total knee arthroplasty.
1: The lncRNA expression profiles of 13 patients were compared to identify new potential regulatory targets involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.
2: The results of the present study may aid in identifying the role of lncRNAs in the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

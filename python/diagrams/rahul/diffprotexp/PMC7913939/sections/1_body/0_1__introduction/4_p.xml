<p>Therefore, we aimed to investigate if the presence/absence of PrP

 <italic>Prnp
  <sup>−/−</sup>

 <italic>basigin</italic>, 
 <italic>LDH-A</italic> and 
 <italic>LDH-B</italic>. In particular, the former protein is of interest because it is recognized as necessary for correct MCT1 localization and functioning [

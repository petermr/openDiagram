<p>The system [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH (73.0 wt.% IL, 27.0 wt.% CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH) was subsequently used to leach and separate the metals contained in the real waste NiMH battery black mass. NiMH battery black mass was kindly provided by an industrial recycler (Recupyl, Grenoble, France) and washed with deionized water prior to use to remove residual KOH electrolyte. To 1.8 g of the IL + acid mixture was added 0.18 g of waste NiMH black mass and left under stirring at 500 rpm for 24 h at 323 K. Following leaching, the saturated [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH mixture was diluted with 0.5 g of H
 <sub>2</sub>O or a 2.0 wt.% aqueous NaCl solution until a biphasic system was obtained. The systems were centrifugated to speed up the phase separation. The phases were subsequently diluted using deionized water prior to metal concentration analysis by UVâ€“vis and TXRF. The same leaching conditions, namely 500 rpm for 24 h at 323 K and a solid-to-liquid ratio of 0.1, were employed to evaluate the leaching of metals from 0.18 g of the black mass using an aqueous solution of 27.0 wt.% CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH.

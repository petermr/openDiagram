0: Microstructure of investigated AISI 4340 steel ( Figure 1a) was analyzed with using of light microscope Neophot 32 (ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany) as well as SEM microscope Tescan Vega (Tescan, Brno, Czech Republic) ( Figure 1b).
1: The samples were etched by Nital (3% solution of nitric acid in ethanol).
2: The microstructure of the supplied material is made of tempered martensite, bainite and fine secondary carbides, which are spherical in shape.
3: The final structure is coarse-grained and relatively heterogeneous.
4: The microstructure evaluated corresponds to the state after quenching and tempering of thick-walled Cr-Ni-Mo-V steels.

0: After the treatment period, each explant was transferred to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, lysed in QIAzol reagent and homogenized in a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen) for 5 min at 50 Hz, using one 3.2 mm stainless steel bead per tube.
1: mRNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers recommended protocol.
2: RNA was eluted in RNase-free water.
3: RNA concentrations were determined with a Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at  80 C. RNA was transported on dry ice to the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core for further processing.
4: Each treatment group within a given experiment ( N = 5) was performed in triplicate (3 separate villous explants from the same placenta).
5: RNA from triplicates were pooled according to the treatment group within the experiment.
6: In total, RNA was analyzed from 10 explant samples (5 placentas and with 2 treatment groups).

 <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
 <p>The manuscript by Mittleman and co-authors investigates alternative polyadenylation (APA) as a potential mechanism underlying the genetic regulation of transcript and protein expression levels in primates. Previous studies have identified genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying inter-species differences in gene expression. This is the first study focusing specifically on APA functional conservation/divergence between humans and chimpanzees. The manuscript describes APA in lymphoblastoid cell lines from six humans and six chimpanzees. The manuscript's main finding is that APA is largely conserved in humans and chimpanzees. Genes with significantly different PAS usage between the two species are enriched among differentially expressed genes, as well as among genes that show differences in protein translation between species. However, these results are based on relatively small subsets of genes. The manuscript is mainly focused on the molecular mechanisms and features of APA between species, while missing to investigate and discuss the biological role of the genes involved. This is problematic when trying to draw broader conclusions from analyses that focus on relatively small subset of genes, without any information on their biological relevance. For example, are the genes with differential APA and gene (or protein) expression relevant for divergent traits between the two species?</p>
 <p>1) Differential PAS â€“ The manuscripts reports 2,342 PAS, in 1,705 Genes, with differential usage between species. Additional information on the function of these genes should be reported as well as on the directionality of effect relative to the pathways and biological processes involved.</p>

<p>Shannahan has reported that functionalization of MWCNTs using microwave-assisted acid treatment increases the strength of binding proteins in comparison with that of pristine material [

 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-08230" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] that oxidation of MWCNTs induced by 8 h contact with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>/HNO
 <sub>3</sub> mixture (
 <italic>v:v</italic> = 3:1) at 30 Â°C enhances the adsorption capacity of DOX. Impressively efficient adsorption result was obtained after 10 days of incubation, but the reduction of contact time to 2 h caused a significant decrease in this parameter. It is worth emphasizing that an increase in the time of incubation causes a decrease in the release rate and loss of DOX bioactivity. Farahani has reported that on the surface of MWCNTs modified with HCl, the process of adsorption is easy and maximum adsorption was archived after 7 min. On the other hand, the efficiency of the process was poor [

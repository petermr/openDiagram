<p id="Par6">Due to burrowing altering soil conditions, burrows generally support different plant communities than surrounding undisturbed areas

 </sup> and/or alien species may be found at burrows than in undisturbed surrounding areas
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, burrowing lowers plant density locally, potentially reducing competition between plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>, and facilitating their co-existence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, seed germination and seedling establishment is often enhanced relative to adjacent substrates due to altered microclimatic conditions within burrows
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. These impacts of burrowing can allow plant species that did not previously occur in the surrounding undisturbed areas to establish
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup> and may potentially increase plant species richness at a local scale
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. Burrowing mammals can therefore strongly affect plant community composition through biogeomorphological disturbances by creating new microhabitats that enhance the establishment, growth and survival of some plant species.

<p id="Par41">Gene expression values (Log2FC) obtained from RNA-seq data were verified using the QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) and SYBR Green I as the DNA intercalating agent. A total of 7 genes were used for the analysis (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref> online) among which there was the mortalin gene analyzed in a previous study using the same RT-qPCR methodology

 </sup>. Reaction volumes comprised 12 μL SYBR Green I, 0.6 μL of each primer and 1 μL of DNA, the rest of the volume was adjusted to 20 μL with nuclease-free water. The Ct values (see Supplementary Table

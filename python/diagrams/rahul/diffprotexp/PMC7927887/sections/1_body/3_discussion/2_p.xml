<p>We found that many of the genes undergoing alternative splicing in MM are genes related to mRNA processing and splicing such as 
 <italic>PPIE, SUGP1</italic> and the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, 
 <italic>SNRPN</italic> and 
 <italic>SNRPC</italic>. We also detect a large number of genes related to protein ubiquitination and RNA decay. Implying that disruption to mRNA splicing, due to the hotspot mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>, activates these genes and pathways. Similar enrichment to protein ubiquitination and RNA decay pathways have been observed in myelodysplasia with mutations in splicing factors.

 </sup> We hypothesize that in an effort to remove aberrant proteins and transcripts they themselves are aberrantly spliced perpetuating the cellular dysregulation.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-RUNX1 (1:1000; cat. #4334S, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit monoclonal anti-RPS6KA1 (1:1000; cat. #8408S, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-LIMS1 (1:1000; cat. #11890S, Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (1:10,000; cat. #AM4300, Invitrogen
 <sup>TM</sup>) antibodies were used as primary antibodies. Moreover, two different rabbit polyclonal antibodies with C-terminal epitopes were used to detect the PARL proteins: the first one (α-PARL #1; 1:500) was obtained from Thomas Langer’ laboratory

 </sup> and the second one (α-PARL #2) was from Abcam (1:1000; cat. #ab45231). In addition, goat anti-mouse (1:10,000; cat. #P0447, Agilent) or anti-rabbit (1:10,000; cat. #sc-2004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) polyclonal immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies.

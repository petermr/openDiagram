 <p>A Li–B–Mg composite with in situ formed 3D LiB fiber network shows a dendrite‐free morphology and less volume change during cycling. The symmetrical battery achieves a long and stable cycle lifespan of more than 500 h at 0.5 mA cm
  <sup>−2</sup> due to the effect of skeleton and the addition of Mg. The full battery also displays improved electrochemical performance.

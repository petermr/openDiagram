<p>Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been widely in used in the formulation of hydrogel matrices for controlled-release or environmental remediation applications since the early 1960s, due to its nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and to the availability of an extensive palette of chemical modification (functionalization) and crosslinking reactions [

 <xref rid="B2-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PVA chemical modification and crosslinking represent one of the two primary tools through which the solubility, porosity, diffusion, swelling, sorption yield, and hydrophilicity of PVA hydrogels could be tuned to match various applicative demands from both research and industry [

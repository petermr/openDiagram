<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine variability among replicates and the global effect of RSV on gene expression. Here, PCA indicated that over 80% of the variance in the data sets was as a result of the RSV Infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) and that the replicates closely grouped together. The RSV-infected replicates showed slightly more variability, accounting for 4% of the variation, indicating the dynamic effects of RSV on gene expression (

<p>The enrichment that showed the fewest significant differences in achieving the designated goal behaviors was the perfumed Boomer balls
 <sup>®</sup>. This could be because, compared to the other enrichment items, perfumed Boomer balls
 <sup>®</sup> were not as meaningful to the aardvarks. The two olfactory scents (warthog and perfume) included in these evaluations were presented on two different base items that both had functions in addition to holding scents. Due to the different motivations to use a Boomer ball
 <sup>®</sup> versus a towel, it is difficult to say that the specific scent caused the differences in goal achievement. However, one study with black-footed cats (
 <italic>Felis nigripes</italic>) showed higher use of scents, a proxy value for goal achievement, that were biologically relevant compared to other scents [

 <xref rid="B30-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, the pool included water, which is a critical resource for animals, and this may have contributed to the pools being more meaningful to the aardvarks and therefore, achieving their enrichment goal. However, we only occasionally observed the aardvarks drinking from the pool, and more research is needed to determine if the aardvarks’ interest in the pool was driven by a biological desire for water or another factor.

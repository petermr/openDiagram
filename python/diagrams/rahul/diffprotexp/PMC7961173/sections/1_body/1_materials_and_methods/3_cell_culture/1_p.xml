<p id="Par10">HTR-8/SVneo cells, a gift from Dr. Charles H. Graham (Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada), were cultured as previously described (Graham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1993</xref>; Hassan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>; Tetz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2013</xref>). Briefly, cells were cultured between passages 78–84 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium with 10% FBS and 1% P/S prior to and during experiments to ensure optimal cell growth as previously described by Graham et al. (Graham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1993</xref>). Cells were grown to 70–90% confluence at least 24 h after plating prior to use in any experiments. For gene expression experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 800,000 cells per well in 6-well cell culture plates. 24 h later, cells were treated with RPMI 1640 complete medium alone (control) or complete medium plus DCVC diluted to a final concentration of 10 or 20 µM for 6 or 12 h. Four independent biological replicate experiments were performed.

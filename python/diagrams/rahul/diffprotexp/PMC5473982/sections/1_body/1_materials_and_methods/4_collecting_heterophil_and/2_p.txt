0: In total 10 8 of cells were incubated for 20 min with anti-monocyte/macrophage:FITC (clone KUL01 from Southern Biotech) and CD45:APC (clone LT40 from Southern Biotech), followed by wash with PBS.
1: Monocytes/macrophages (CD45+KUL01+) and heterophils (identified based on FSC/SSC characteristics within CD45+ cells) were sorted using a FACSFusion flow cytometer operated by FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).
2: Only for simplicity, the monocytes/macrophages population will be called as macrophage (Ma) in the rest of this paper.
3: Sorted cells were collected in PBS and immediately processed as described below.
4: A small aliquot from each sample was subjected to immediate purity analysis.
5: The purity of macrophages was 88.6  5.3% and of heterophils 88.1  4.2% when counting cell of expected staining, and FSC and SSC parameters out of all particles.
6: When we gated at the area with live cells, the purity of macrophages and heterophils was between 97 and 98%.
7: Majority of contaminants therefore represented cellular debris and only around 2.5% of contaminants were formed by non-target cells.

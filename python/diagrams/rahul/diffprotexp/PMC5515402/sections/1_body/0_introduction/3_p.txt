0: Given the scattered concentration of GnRH neurosecretory cells within the mPOA [ 11], and the difficulty to establish an  in vivo approach to study these neurons [ 9], we used the murine immortalized cell line of GnRH-secreting hypothalamic neurons (GT1-7) [ 12].
1: Certainly, GT1-7 cells have been very useful in studying regulatory processes because they exhibit the typical characteristics of GnRH neurons, and respond to the same compounds that modulate GnRH secretion  in vivo [ 13 15].
2: Moreover, evidence reveals that GT1-7 cells express AR [ 16, 17], ER [ 18, 19], and receptors for GABA (GABA AR) [ 20], cellular properties that confer responsiveness to androgenic and estrogenic compounds.

<p>Depleted cyst fluids from cPTCs and benign cystic thyroid lesions were profiled by LC-MS/MS. In total, 1,581 proteins were identified from the cyst fluid samples using a confidence limit of one peptide at 99% (p&lt;0.01). Of these, totally 841 proteins were quantified in all 13 samples (

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). The top five enriched GO terms were “blood microparticle”, “extracellular region part”, “extracellular organelle”, “extracellular membrane-bounded organelle” and “extracellular vesicular exosome”. This indicated high similarity with plasma and/or blood samples in terms of protein content. In a comparative GO analysis with a published plasma data set [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the cyst fluid showed high similarity with plasma, strengthening this observation (

To identify signaling pathways differing between the cPTCs and benign lesions we applied pathway analysis in combination with multivariate data analysis. Using multivariate OPLS analysis a highly predictive model of 59 proteins was obtained (p = 0.0027; R2Y = 0.969 and Q2 = 0.841) for distinguishing between cPTCs and benign lesions (

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). IPA analysis of these 59 proteins identified “protein ubiquitination”, “extrinsic prothrombin activation”, “intrinsic prothrombin activation”, “the coagulation system” and “gluconeogenesis” as the top five significantly enriched pathways (p&lt;0.01). Detailed comparison of the cPTCs and benign lesions by univariate analysis revealed significantly different expression for 41/841 proteins (p-values &lt;0.05, Student’s t-test, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Of these, 10 proteins were also differently expressed between the cPTCs and benign lesions using a more stringent p-value cut-off of 0.01 (
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and 40 proteins were also included in the OPLS model (

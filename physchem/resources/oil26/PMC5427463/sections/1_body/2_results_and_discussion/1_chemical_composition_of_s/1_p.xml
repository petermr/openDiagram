<p>A total of 49 constituents, representing 97.97 % of the total oil, have been identified from the essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>. In Table 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref> the compounds of the volatile oil and their relative percentages are listed in the order of their Kovats index. The monoterpene fraction of the oil amounted to 75.93 % with oxygen containing monoterpenes as the largest group of this fraction (48.43 %). Camphor (25.14 %), α-thujone (18.83 %), 1,8-cineole (14.14 %) and β-thujone (4.46 %) were the main compounds of the monoterpenoidic fraction. Among the sesquiterpene fraction (17.4 %), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated (9.33 %) with β-caryophyllene (3.30 %) as the major component while viridiflorol (7.98 %) was identified as the main constituent of sesquiterpene alcohol fraction. Other components were present at amount lower than 3 % of the total yield. Our composition differs from that reported by other Tunisian studies, mostly due to the different geographic experimental areas. The EO contents of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> collected from north of Tunisia, were 1,8-cineole (33.27 %), β-thujone (18.40 %), α-thujone (13.45 %), borneol (7.39 %), β-elemene (4.82 %), camphor (3.31 %) and α-pinene (2.74 %) (Hayouni et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Fellah et al. (2006[
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) found that SoEO from mountainous region in the center-west of Tunisia was mainly composed by α-thujone (26.49 %), 1,8-cineole (16.96 %), viridiflorol (13,04 %), β-thujone (11.55 %) β-caryophyllene (9.04 %), β-pinene (5.19 %) and camphre (3,38 %). However, essential oil analysis of sage from south of Tunisia revealed that β-thujone (17.76 %), 1,8-cineole (16.29 %), camphor (14.19 %), α-thujone (7.41 %), trans-Caryophyllene (5.45 %) were the major components (Bouaziz et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Studies on 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> performed in Spain (Laborda et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), Italy (Marino et al., 2001[
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) and Brazil (Delamare Longaray et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) also showed a significant variation in the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> compared to our results.

<p>In order to understand the joint effect of common SNVs, we performed gene and segment based analyses between severe and mild patient groups. Because our sample size was limited, the Bonferroni correction caused very conservative results in this test. So, a less stringent significant threshold was set at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>. The gene based analysis showed that only liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (
 <italic>LEAP2</italic>) gene suggestively associated (
 <italic>P </italic>= 5.26 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease. In addition, the segment based analysis indicated that the nearby region of 
 <italic>PTBP3</italic> gene appeared to have the statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.92 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) association signal.

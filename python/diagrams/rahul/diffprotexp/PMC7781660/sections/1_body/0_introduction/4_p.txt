0: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA with a length of over 200 nucleotides (nt).
1: They are located in the cytoplasm or nucleus and play an important role in biological activities and disease development by regulating target genes, thereby affecting gene expression [ 18, 19].
2: Although a recent study reported that certain lncRNAs are able to encode small peptides [ 20], lncRNAs generally lack an efficient open reading frame, such that they do not perform a protein-coding function.
3: LncRNAs tend to fold into thermodynamically stable secondary or higher-order structures that provide multiple sites within the molecule for the binding of proteins.
4: Specific and dynamic interactions can also occur between DNA and RNA through the principle of base-complementary pairing.
5: Some lncRNAs could be cleaved into polyA tails and promoter structures similar to mRNA and are dynamically expressed during tissue organ differentiation [ 21] followed by formation of a complex and precise gene expression regulatory networks.
6: Many studies have reported the functional activities of lncRNAs in the innate immune system [ 22, 23], adaptive immunity [ 24], the tumor development process [ 25, 26], and in several human diseases [ 27].
7: Current research indicates that lncRNAs are a key regulator of viral infection and host immune responses involved in hostvirus interaction [ 28, 29].
8: However, the profiles and functional activities of lncRNAs in host cells in response to BVDV infection have not yet been elucidated.

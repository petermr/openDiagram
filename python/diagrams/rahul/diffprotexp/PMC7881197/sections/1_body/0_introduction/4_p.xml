<p id="Par24">Two inorganic arsenic compounds—arsenic trioxide and arsenic hexoxide (AS
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>; hereafter, AS6)—have already been used or developed as anticancer medications. Arsenic trioxide (AS
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) has been developed into a commercially available cancer drug to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with few and relatively mild adverse effects

 </sup>. It works by targeting diverse cellular pathways that lead to apoptosis and myeloid differentiation in APL, although its mechanisms have not been completely known
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Some studies suggest that arsenic trioxide treatment leads to apoptosis as a result of Jun N-terminal kinase suppression and collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials to activate caspase 3

 </sup>. Another study has proposed that arsenic trioxide at low concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 μM promotes cell differentiation by degrading promyelocytic leukemia protein-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARα) oncoprotein

 </sup>. It is interesting that arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid exhibit synergic effects to cure APL

 </sup>. For example, in one study, 2-year event-free survival rates were 97% for an arsenic trioxide-all-trans retinoic acid group and 86% for an all-trans retinoic acid/chemotherapy group

 </sup>. In addition, arsenic trioxide eradicates latent human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by reactivating latent provirus in CD4 + T cells and increasing immune responses in HIV-1 patients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. This study showed that arsenic trioxide treatment downregulates CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors of CD4 + T cells that can interfere with viral infection and rebound

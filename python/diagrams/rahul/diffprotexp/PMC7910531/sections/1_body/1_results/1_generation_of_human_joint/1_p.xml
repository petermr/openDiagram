<p id="Par6">We collected and characterised low-grade (intact; preserved) and high-grade (highly degraded; lesioned) cartilage, and synovial tissue from patients undergoing joint replacement for osteoarthritis (see Methods). The availability of paired low-grade and high-grade cartilage samples enables the comparison between these two disease states in affected primary tissue within the same individual, with high-grade cartilage showing more advanced cartilage degradation. All three tissues were profiled by RNA sequencing, and cartilage samples were additionally profiled by quantitative proteomics (Fig.

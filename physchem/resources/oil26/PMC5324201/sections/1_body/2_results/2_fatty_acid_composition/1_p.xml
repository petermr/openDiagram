<p>The cold and hot extracted fatty acids were semisolid, opaque, light golden colour with an unpleasant odour and a slightly bitter taste. The extracted fatty acids were found to be freely soluble in most of the common organic solvents. The fatty acid compositions are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. In all of them, 8 fatty acids were present. Amongst which, six fatty acids (1–3, 6–8) were found as saturated with a polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the cold and hot extracted part respectively. The most predominant fatty acids were palmitic acid followed by linoleic acid, behenic acid and lignoceric acid. Oleic acid was found the higher amount in hot extracted part than the cold extracted part. The nutritional quality of lipid fractions was evaluated by the different indexes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In the present study, ratio of PUFA:SFA is 0.43:0.40 in the cold and hot extracted fatty acid respectively. In the current study, TI was found higher in cold extract than the hot extracted fatty acids. On the other hand, AI was found higher in the cold extract, but the lower value was found in hot extracted fatty acids. The standard and sample fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) chromatograms are shown in additional files (Additional file

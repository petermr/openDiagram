<p>The desired protein bands were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion using a procedure employed at the Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University. Gel plugs were covered with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) at room temperature for 10 minutes. The supernatant was replaced with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mM ABC for 10 minutes. These first two steps were repeated twice. Gel plugs were then dried in a Thermo Speed Vac vacuum concentrator. 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 25 mM ABC was added and the reaction allowed to proceed at 56°C for 45 minutes. The supernatant was then replaced with 55 m M iodoacetamide and the reaction proceeded at room temperature in the dark for 45 minutes. Trypsin solution (2 ng/μL trypsin in 25 mM ABC) was added and the digestion proceeded at 37°C overnight. Formic acid was used to quench the reaction. The digest solution containing the extracted peptides was stored at -4°C.</p>

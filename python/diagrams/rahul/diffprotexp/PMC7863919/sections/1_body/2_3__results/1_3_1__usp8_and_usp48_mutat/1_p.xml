<p>The incidence of hotspot mutations in 
 <italic>USP8</italic> and 
 <italic>USP48</italic> was determined with Sanger sequencing in 48 patients. 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations were identified in 15/48 (35.4%) patients. 
 <italic>USP48</italic> mutations were identified in 2/48 (4.2%) patients; both were female patients suffering from Cushing’s disease with a diagnosis of densely granulated corticotroph tumors. One of the tumors was microadenoma while the other was macroadenoma. Both 
 <italic>USP48</italic> mutations had p.Met415Ile substitution. 
 <italic>USP8</italic> and 
 <italic>USP48</italic> mutations were mutually exclusive. Details of the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jcm-10-00375">Table S1</xref>. The possible relationship between the incidence of 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations and demographic/clinical parameters was investigated in groups of Cushing’s disease patients and SCA patients separately. Since only two patients with 
 <italic>USP48</italic> mutation were identified, they were excluded from the analysis. No difference in age of diagnosis was observed between 
 <italic>USP8</italic>-mutated (
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut) and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>-wild type (
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt) patients, both in the Cushing’s disease group and in SCA group. Except for one male patient, all 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations were identified in females; however, differences of proportions did not reach statistical significance in the Cushing’s disease group or SCA group.

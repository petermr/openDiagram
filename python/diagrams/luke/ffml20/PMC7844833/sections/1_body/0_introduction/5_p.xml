<p>Another reason for the emphasis on electrocatalysis in this Review includes the additional challenges in the XAS studies under an electrochemical environment. Factors such as the chemical composition of the catalyst, its oxidation state, relative concentration and distribution of different atomic species, the crystallographic structure, morphology (particle size, shape, exposed facets), lattice strain, surface roughness, defects, and interparticle distance can affect the performance of all heterogeneous catalysts. Nevertheless, the presence of the electrolyte, its composition, and pH pose additional difficulties for the data acquisition, interpretation, and modeling, motivating the current focus on problems and examples that are more specific to electrochemical catalytic processes. Note that most of the aforementioned properties can change under reaction conditions. Therefore,

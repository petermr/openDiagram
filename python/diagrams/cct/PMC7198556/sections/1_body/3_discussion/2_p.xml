<p id="Par18">While the transition lines shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> are based entirely on the evaluation of the microstructure of the central line of the bearing and a qualitative assessment of the overview image, it is of course possible, though work intensive, to generate an arbitrarily fine grid on the etched area, detailing the exact shape of the zones. For verifying a simulation of the heat treatment process, however, a handful of temperatures at different known points is usually sufficient.

<p id="par0225">The amylolytic activity was observed maximum (3.6 U/mg proteins) in HS-treated developing endospermic tissue of HD3086; non-significant differences were observed in the amylolytic activity of grains harvested from plants grown under control and HS-treated conditions (
 <xref rid="fig0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>a). The amylolytic activity in BT-Schomburgk was observed maximum (3.9 U/mg proteins) in HS-treated tissue of developing grains and minimum (3.0 U/mg proteins) in harvested grains under control condition. Heat stress was observed to induce the activity of amylase in the developing endosperm and harvested grains of both the cultivars.

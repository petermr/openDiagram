<p>The data reported in this study reveal the differential protein expression profile of queen and worker intended larvae at 72 and 120 hours of developmental stages. It is the first report that the two caste destined larvae show apparent differences in protein expressional levels as early as 72 hours. Molecularly, the distinctive biological requirements in queen intended larvae was driven by aldehyde reductase and enolase, imaginal disc growth factor 4, long-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase and proteasome subunit alpha type 5. Whereas, in the worker intended larvae the distinctive biological requirements was driven by ATP synthase beta subunit, aldehyde dehydrogenase, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, peroxiredoxin 2540, lethal (2) 37, 14-3-3 protein epsilon, fatty acid binding protein and translational controlled tumor protein. The divergence between the two caste intended larvae was more profound at 120 hours as evidenced by increased over-expression of important and caste unique proteins. The influences of the over-expression of these particular proteins concerning the caste direction were confirmed at the mRNA level. More specifically, the over-expression of aldehyde reductase at 72 hours, and phosphoglycerate kinase and aldehyde dehydrogenase at 120 hours, and enolase, transketolase and imaginal disc growth factor 4 at both time points in queen larvae identify them as caste specific and possible proteins for the queen intended larvae to follow a different developmental trajectory.</p>

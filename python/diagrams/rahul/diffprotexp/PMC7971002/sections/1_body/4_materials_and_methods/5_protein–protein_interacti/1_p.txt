0: The path-act-network analysis was conducted to identify the interactive network function of pathways enriched with the KEGG-based differential mRNAs, including membrane transportation, metabolism, cell cycles and signal transduction pathways.
1: The STRING database was employed to perform gene-act-network analysis to uncover the network of the differentially expressed mRNAs based on relationships extracted from the database 25.
2: Networks were developed based on complementary pairs between miRNA and mRNAs, and between miRNA and lncRNAs to infer the role of lncRNAs in ovaries of the Hu sheep.
3: miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were included in the networks.
4: Cytoscape (ver.
5: 2.8) was employed to visualize the miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA networks.

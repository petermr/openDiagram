<p id="Par10">Considering directionality and polarity differences between H-bonding and vdW interactions, the former facilitates localized bonding directionality and polarity (hydrophilicity). In contrast, vdW interactions offer high nondirectional polarizability (hydrophobicity) that can be enhanced by closer proximity of neighboring chains

 </sup>. For predominantly alternating/random hydrophobic p(MMA/nBA) copolymer topologies forming helix-like conformations, this was accomplished by interdigitated “key-and-lock” associations of neighboring chains. The presence of one H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecule per one copolymer-repeating unit (MMA/nBA) strengthens interchain forces by forcing a significant fraction of the nBA side groups to take L-shape conformations, thus resulting in stronger dipole–dipole forces and the decreased interchain distances. This environment creates a viscoelastic response that not only energetically favors self-repair upon chain separation, but also accelerates this process due to closer proximity of the neighboring chains and the ability to rapidly restore initial conformations. Unlike one type of interaction (H-bonding, coordination chemistry, covalent rebonding, and others

 </sup>) that is typically introduced to achieve self-healing properties, the presence of confined H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules in the proximity of ester groups may generate local plasticizing effect due to H-bonding that increases vdW interactions of nBA side groups. Although plasticizing effects are well-documented for hydrophilic polymers

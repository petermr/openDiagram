<p>Quinoa (
 <italic>Chenopodium quinoa</italic> Willd.) is a pseudocereal crop with high nutritional value [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Quinoa varieties are classified as bitter or sweet depending upon saponin content of the seed. Although saponins in quinoa are highly accumulated in the seed pericarp, they are also present in lower concentrations in leaves. Saponin biosynthesis in quinoa is regulated by the triterpene saponin biosynthesis activating regulator-like1 (TSARL1) gene [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C,D</xref> show the charge-discharge voltage profiles of the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich composites at a constant current density of 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. During the first discharge, the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> anode produced two potential plateaus at 1.4 and 0.5 V. The plateau at 1.4 V corresponded to the formation of Li
 <sub>x</sub>MoS
 <sub>2</sub> lattice and the insertion of lithium ions. The discharge plateau at 0.5 V was attributed to the conversion of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> into Mo and Li
 <sub>2</sub>S, as well as the formation of gelatinous polymeric layers driven by electrochemical degradation of electrolyte (Ding et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Consistent with CV test results, the broad plateau at about 2.3 V was a trace of the Li
 <sub>2</sub>S decomposition. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, although those plateaus recurred in the charge-discharge voltage profiles of the 3D flower-like composites, their width decreased. This indicated that the electron migration rate of the 3D flower-like composites is faster than that of the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens. Furthermore, the gentle potential curve slope and large charge capacity indicate that the 3D flower-like composites delivered more reactive sites and nice cycle stability. The first discharge-charge capacities of the 3D flower-like composites were 1,800 and 1,122 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, far higher than those of the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens. The initial irreversible capacity loss was about 37.7 %, mainly caused by the lithium ion residues in the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> lattice and the formation of SEI films (Tang et al.,

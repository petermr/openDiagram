<p>FISH assay was performed using riboâ„¢ fluorescent in situ hybridization Kit (Ribobio company, china). For FISH assay, fluorescent probe for LINC00466 was purchased from Ribo Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). The result was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher, USA) and the images were taken. Nuclear and cytoplasmic separation in A172 cells was performed by using PARIS Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), and then qRT-PCR was implemented to detect the expression of LINC00466 and reference genes (U6 and GAPDH) in nucleus and cytoplasm.</p>

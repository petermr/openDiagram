0: With the availability of the banana genome, it is now possible to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms governing plant height [ 17 19].
1: Unbiased modern high-throughput technologies such as whole transcriptome and metabolome have geared up the discovery of genetic factors controlling different traits in plants including, biotic and abiotic stresses, and agronomic traits [ 20 23].
2: Furthermore, the combination of multiple omics techniques has resulted in the elucidation of different pathways in banana such as peel ripening and the effect of melatonin on delaying anthracnose incidence [ 24 26].
3: In this study, we aimed at identifying the differentially expressed genes and metabolites in pseudostems of Pisang Awak Aifen No.
4: 1 dwarf wild type and its semi-dwarf mutant.
5: The transcriptome and metabolome responses involved hormonal signaling including GA, auxin, BR, ABA, and ethylene, and cell prolification and elongation.

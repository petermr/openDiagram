<p>Variable adherence-associated (Vaa) antigen is the key adhesin of 
 <italic>M. hominis</italic>. The secondary structure of the Vaa antigen contains an alpha-helical structure with a coiled-coil region, which mediates the adherence of 
 <italic>M. hominis</italic> to host cells [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. P50t is a truncated form of the Vaa adhesin, which adheres to macrophages to evoke an immune response via the upregulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 expression [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. fermentans</italic> surface lipoprotein P29 is an adhesin that mediates adhesion of 
 <italic>M. fermentans</italic> to HeLa cells, and undergoes phase variation by surface masking, which is distinct from Vaa that is governed by protein expression [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, 
 <italic>M. fermentans</italic> also express Eno, which take part in adherence and invasion [
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

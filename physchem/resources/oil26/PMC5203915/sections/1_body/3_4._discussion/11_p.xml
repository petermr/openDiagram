<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Many studies have also indicated that natural plant secondary metabolites may be used for the prevention of inflammation and oxidative damage-related neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In order to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of essential oils from<italic> R. carthamoides</italic> hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants, astrocytes were treated with HR and SGR essential oils and stimulated by LPS for 24&#8201;h. It was found that HR and SGR essential oils possessed anti-neuroinflammatory activity and were able to suppress the levels of IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic> in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. In response to inflammation molecular signaling cascades are activated in astrocytes. IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic> and TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic> are secreted during acute inflammation and are important for the production of IL-6 [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the stimulation of IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic> causes astrocytes to generate and release vascular endothelial growth factor, which increases blood-brain barrier permeability and promotes leukocyte extravasation [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. IL-10, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, reduces of TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic> level and shows neuroprotective effect by changes of intracellular calcium and mediates delay effects<italic> via</italic> NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, in response to IL-10, astrocytes release transforming growth factor-<italic>&#946;</italic> (TGF<italic>&#946;</italic>) that suppresses the inflammation [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>

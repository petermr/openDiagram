Although a small sample size, this represents 11.4% of the aardvark population housed in AZA facilities [<xref rid="B23-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A fourteen-year-old male, Baji, and a six-year-old female, Roxaane, comprised one group. A second group was comprised of a thirteen-year-old female, Rachaael, and a three-year-old female, Kaatie. Baji and Rachaael are the parents of both younger aardvarks. During the study, the aardvarks rotated daily between two behind-the-scenes indoor habitats of similar size with varied substrates and features (<xref rid="animals-10-01433-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The habitats shared a barrier that allowed for limited contact between the two groups. Light cycles for both habitats were created using a combination of artificial lighting and skylights, with the dark phase lasting from approximately 22:00 to 08:00 during this study. These aardvarks have never been housed on a reversed light cycle at the Detroit Zoo due to concerns about how that practice could potentially affect their welfare. Animal care staff usually serviced the habitat between 16:00 and 18:00, while the aardvarks slept. Fresh food (roughly 0.68 kg per aardvark of Mazuri<sup>&#174;</sup> insectivore diet; St. Louis, MO, USA) and water were provided nightly by 22:00, prior to the final light being turned off and animal care staff leaving the building. </p>

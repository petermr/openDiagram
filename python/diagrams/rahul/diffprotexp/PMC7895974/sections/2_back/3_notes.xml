 <p>G.F.M. and A.E.M. conceived and designed the study. G.F.M. generated and analysed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, performed and analysed chick reporter expression assays, in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry, QPCR experiments and assisted in bioinformatic analysis. L.F. performed bioinformatic analysis on RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. E.M. and S.A.W. assisted in live imaging, chick embryo injections and in situ hybridisation. V.M.H. assisted with cloning reporter constructs. R.M.W. and T.S.S. shared electroporation setup, plasmids and expertise in NGS. A.M.G. performed injections into 
  <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and in situ hybridisation. G.N.W. discussed and supervised 
  <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> experiments. S.M. helped oversee the computational analysis. G.F.M. and A.E.M. discussed ideas and interpretation of data and wrote the manuscript with input from all authors. A.E.M. supervised the study.

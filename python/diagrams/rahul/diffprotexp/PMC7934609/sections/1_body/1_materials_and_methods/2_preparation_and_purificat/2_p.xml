<p>Preparation of oncosphere and adult samples: on the day before the ovulation of the worm, half the infected dogs were anesthetized, and the duodenum was surgically extracted and cut into pieces of 3 cm under sterile conditions. After bathing in normal saline at 37 °C for 4 h, the adult worms were moved from the duodenum tissue to normal saline. They were aspirated with a plastic-tip dropper, and prepared for microscopic examination under a microscope at 40× and 100×. If a large number of mature gravid proglottid and eggs were observed, the sample was crushed, and saline and isotonic Percoll solution were added; after centrifugation at 3000 r/min, the eggs were collected. Oncosphere activation and cultivation were conducted according to the report published by Heath and Lawrence [

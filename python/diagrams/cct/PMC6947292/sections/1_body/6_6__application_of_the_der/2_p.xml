<p>The strength of a range of magnesium alloys is increased by precipitate strengthening, achieved through post-quench ageing [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The age-hardening potential of precipitation-hardening Mg alloys can be reduced by quench-induced precipitation. Until recently, the analysis of precipitation reactions by DSC was restricted to temperatures well below the solution temperature, mainly due to the low eutectic melting temperature in the system Mg-Al system, causing localised melting at the interface between Mg alloy sample and Al crucible. To solve this limitation recently the DSC methods have been adapted by using graphite crucibles to allow the kinetic analysis of precipitation and dissolution reactions in Mg alloys up to solution annealing temperatures [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f081">Figure 81</xref>, and these DSC curves show a high similarity to the DSC cooling curves for Al alloys. DSC has been shown in recent work to allow the derivation of a continuous cooling precipitation diagram for Mg alloys [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f082">Figure 82</xref>. The UCCR of this alloys is in the range of 10 to 100 K/s [

<p>Glucocerebrosidase (GCase; Enzyme Commission 3.2.1.45), also known as acid-β glucosidase (GBA) and glucosylceramidase, is a lysosomal enzyme that is responsible for the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside, an intermediate in the glycolipid metabolism and an abundant sphingolipid present in the plasma membranes. It is encoded by the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene, which is located on chromosome 1q21, spans ~7.6 kb and contains 11 exons. Mutations in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene cause Gaucher's disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is characterized by the accumulation of glucocerebrosides in macrophages referred to as ‘Gaucher cells’. There are three clinical subtypes of GD that have been recognized: Type 1 is non-neuronopathic, whereas types 2 and 3 are acute and chronic neuronopathic, respectively. Based on the Human Gene Mutation Database, &gt;400 mutations have been reported in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene (

The majority of these mutations are missense, followed by small deletions, splicing defects, complex rearrangements and small insertions. Of note, a highly homologous pseudogene (
 <italic>GBAP</italic>) is located ~16 kb downstream from the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene and shares 96% sequence identity to the functional 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene (
 <xref rid="b8-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The presence of this pseudogene at the same locus causes recombination events between the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>GBAP</italic> genes, thus resulting in several different mutations in GD (
 <xref rid="b9-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="b10-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

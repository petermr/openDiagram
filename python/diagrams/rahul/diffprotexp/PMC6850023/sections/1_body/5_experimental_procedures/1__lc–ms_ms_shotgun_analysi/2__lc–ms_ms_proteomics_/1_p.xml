<p>Cells were harvested from 50 ml of each culture by centrifugation (4600 × g, 15 min) and washed in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline. Total protein was immediately extracted by resuspending the cell pellet in 75 μl of extraction buffer (62.5 mM TRIS–HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol w/v, 12 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) v/v and one Pierce Protease Inhibitor Tablet per 50 ml), heating in a water bath (95°C, 12 min) and then centrifuging (10,500 × g, 5 min) to remove cell debris. Proteins extracts were visualized by SDS‐PAGE and trypsin digestion, and LC–MS/MS with a ThermoFisher hybrid high‐resolution LTQ Orbitrap instrument was performed as previously described (McKew

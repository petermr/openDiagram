0: Total RNA was extracted from clinical samples by using the E.Z.N.A Total RNA Kit I (Omega, USA) following the protocol.
1: Reverse transcriptional PCR was performed to synthesis complementary DNA (cDNA) by using the Prime Script RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio, Japan).
2: CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-rad, USA) was employed to perform real-time PCR, and the comparative Ct method was used to measure the expression levels of the hub genes.
3: Glyceraldehyde3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was considered as a normalization control.
4: The sequences of the primers are demonstrated in  Supplementary Table 2.

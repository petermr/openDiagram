<p>The ETS (E26 transformation specific) domain transcription factor superfamily includes 27 members in humans in 11 subfamilies [
 <xref rid="B2-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Taking its name from the founding member of this superfamily, namely oncogenic v-ets [
 <xref rid="B5-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], ETS domain transcription factors are typically defined by their DNA binding domain, called the ETS domain, which binds the consensus motif 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′, called the ets motif of the ETS binding site (EBS) [
 <xref rid="B6-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Their DNA binding property, as well as transactivation function, is regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway [

 <xref rid="B8-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

<p>We found that individuals harboring the AA genotype at rs2234237 showed higher levels of sTREM1 when compared to the AT genotype. Statistical differences were increased among IPA patients. The T allele at rs2234246 was associated with increased amounts of sTREM1 compared to the homozygous CC genotype in IPA patients (

 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we investigated the associations between the significance in the above SNPs and the levels of those cytokines with an important role in the lung environment. We found that IPA patients harboring the AA genotype at rs2234237 and individuals having the T allele for rs2234246 displayed differential levels of IL-1β (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b</xref>). Interestingly, genotype-specific differences were observed, with control and IPA patients displaying differential concentrations of most studied cytokines (

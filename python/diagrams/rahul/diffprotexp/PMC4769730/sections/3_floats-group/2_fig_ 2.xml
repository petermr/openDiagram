  <p>Representative chip-based arrays. Chip are grids that contain small amounts of purified proteins in high density, hybridized to sample and detected by fluorescent technique. 
   <bold>a</bold> The map showing the selected factors in a 14 × 10 grid. Each subarray contains 60 antibodies and specific positive/negative referring spots. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> Representative GenePix acquired arrays from POAG (
   <bold>b</bold>) and post-mortem (
   <bold>c</bold>) TM specimens, both loaded as normalized extracts. 
   <italic>White points</italic> are positive technique controls (framed), 
   <italic>dark points</italic> are negative technique controls and 
   <italic>green points</italic> are POAG/post-mortem TMs (cy3-labeled spots). Abbreviations of the main factors were according to International Classification. 
   <italic>EGF</italic> epidermal growth factor, 
   <italic>IL</italic> interleukin, 
   <italic>MIP</italic> macrophage inflammatory protein, 
   <italic>MMP</italic> matrix metalloproteinase,

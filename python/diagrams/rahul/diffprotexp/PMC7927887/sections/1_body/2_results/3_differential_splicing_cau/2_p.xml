<p>To determine if these novel splice sites generated novel coding sequences, we analyzed the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembled fulllength transcripts. Visual inspection of the novel splice sites allowed us to attribute 19 of the 39 novel splice sites to 20 novel transcripts. The coding potential for these assembled transcripts was determined and 16 of the novel splice junctions were categorized as protein coding and four were determined to be non-coding (
 <italic>CREBZF, MPC1, PKHD1L1</italic>, and 
 <italic>TXNDC11</italic>) (

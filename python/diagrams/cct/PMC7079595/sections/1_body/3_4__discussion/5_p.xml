<p>According to JMatPro calculations in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f012">Figure 12</xref>, a higher annealing temperature leads to a higher amount of austenite in steel (40%) when compared to that at 700 째C (34%). This means that the C enrichment of austenite is lower in the former than in the later, and so it is the austenite thermal stability [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which explains the detection of fresh martensite during cooling of samples treated at 720 째C when cooled down to room temperature. This is supported also by data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f013">Figure 13</xref>, which shows the C content of the phases present in the microstructure as a function of the intercritical temperatures. Because ferrite rejects excess carbon to the austenite, the higher the ferrite fraction, the higher the carbon content in the newly formed austenite. According to the JMatPro calculations, such enrichment was from 0.4% to 0.46% when the temperature was decreased from 720 to 700 째C. That is why no martensite was detected upon cooling in the case of 700 째C annealing. The morphology of the final microstructure is composed of lath constituents. When the reverse austenite transformation took place, the morphology of martensite is inherited by austenite and ferrite [

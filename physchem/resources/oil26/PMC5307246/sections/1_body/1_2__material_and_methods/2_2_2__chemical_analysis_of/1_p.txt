0: The seed proximate composition was analyzed following the standard official methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) [ 8]: moisture by vacuum oven (method 925.10), crude fat by Soxhlet method (method 960.39), total nitrogen or crude protein by Kjeldahl, using 6.25 as a conversion factor to calculate protein content (method 979.09), and ash by ignition (method 923.03).
1: Carbohydrate content was estimated by difference of mean values, that is, 100 (sum of percentages of moisture, protein, lipid, and ash) [ 9].

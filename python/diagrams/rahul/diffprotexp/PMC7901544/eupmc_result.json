    "The outbreaks of hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HPS) caused by the highly pathogenic serotype 4 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-4) have caused a huge economic loss to the poultry industry globally since 2013. Although the Fiber-2 has been identified as a key virulent related factor for FAdV-4, little is known about its molecular basis. In this study, we identified the efficient interaction of the Fiber-2 with the karyopherin alpha 3/4 (KPNA3/4) protein via its N-terminus of 1-40aa. The analysis of the overexpression and knockout of KPNA3/4 showed that KPNA3/4 could efficiently assist the replication of FAdV-4. Moreover, a <i>fiber-2</i>-edited virus FAV-4_Del with a deletion of 7-40aa in Fiber-2 was rescued through the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. In comparison with the wild type FAdV-4, FAV-4_Del was highly attenuated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Notably, the inoculation of FAV-4_Del in chickens could provide full protection against the lethal challenge with the wild type FAdV-4. All these findings not only give novel insights into the molecular basis for the pathogenesis of Fiber-2 but also provide efficient targets for developing antiviral strategies and live-attenuated vaccine candidates against the highly pathogenic FAdV-4."

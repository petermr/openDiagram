<p id="Par21">MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a particular class of serine/threonine protein kinases which are activated by various stresses such as salt, drought, cold etc. We observed the up-regulation of similar proteins i.e
 <italic>.</italic> protein phosphatase 2C (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN30190_c0_g2_i2), and Serine/threonine-protein kinase 10 (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN34126_c1_g1_i6) at high salinity i.e. ECe 30 dS/m, 40 dS/m and 50 dS/m (Supplementary file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Similarly, Copper-transporting ATPase RAN1 (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN38546_c0_g1_i1) which involved in MAP kinase pathway was also found to be up-regulated.

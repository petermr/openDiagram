<p>It has identified that miR-21 is temporally up-regulated in obstructive kidneys and TGF-β1 stimulated tubular cells. MiR-21 could be secreted by tubular cells and delivered into recipient tubules by MVs [

Compared with the control medium, the miR-21 expression was markedly increased in MVs isolated from conditioned medium (

MVs isolated from conditioned medium of donor NRK-52E cells were incubated with recipient cardiomyocytes for 24 h, Similarly, the miR-21 expression was markedly increased in recipient cardiomyocytes (

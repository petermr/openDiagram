<p id="Par11">Among the differentially expressed genes, 127 RPGs over 137 total RPGs resulted to be DEGs in at least one stage of the treatments by acetic acid. In particular, at 45 min there are 6 RPGs downregulated and 12 RPGs upregulated. At 120 min and at 200 min there are only downregulated genes, 60 and 122 per stage, respectively (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Interestingly, at 45 min RPL1A (YPL220W) is upregulated whereas its paralog RPL1B (YGL135W) is downregulated. In 2018, Segev et al.

 </sup> focused on the role of RPL1A and B paralogs. They found that ribosomes containing RPL1B are more efficient in translation of respiration-related proteins, and that this specific form is required for proper mitochondrial function, morphology, and for cell wall integrity. Moreover, they also showed that the upregulation of RPL1A did not replace the functionalities of RPL1B.

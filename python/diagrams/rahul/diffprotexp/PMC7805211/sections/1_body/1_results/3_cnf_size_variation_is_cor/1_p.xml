<p id="Par9">The degree of CNF involvement is highly variable among NF1 patients with poor genotype–phenotype correlation. CNF density is even noted to be discordant among monozygotic twins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To determine whether CNF size correlates with site-specific methylation events, we collected CNFs in three size categories. Adjusting for age and sex differences, we determined significant associations (
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) between CNF size in millimeters and probe-level methylation status. A total of 188 loci were found to be statistically significant. Both positive and negative correlations were discovered among the 188 associated loci, with 34 achieving an effect size (&gt; 4 mm) that reached statistical significance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Signaling pathway correlation of the 34 significant DMRs was not possible due to a lack of statistical confidence, however these results indicate that CNF size is significantly influenced by methylation of specific loci.

<p>As expected, the emulsions showed different behavior to creaming during the storage time, according to the concentration of the emulsifying agent used. The cream index (CI) reflects the emulsion stability by measuring the height of the separated cream layer with time, but also indirectly demonstrates the process of separation of droplets in the creaming.[

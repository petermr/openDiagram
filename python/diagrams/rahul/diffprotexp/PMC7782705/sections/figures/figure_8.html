 <caption> Expression of AD risk/causal genes is mostly altered in the TL of patients. A Heatmap showing the expression of predicted AD risk/causal genes in different cell types of the adult human brain. DEGs and gDTUs in at least one dataset are highlighted in red. B Venn diagram showing the number of AD risk/causal DEGs or gDTUs identified in the different datasets analyzed. The intersection between Mayo and MSBB TL is highlighted in yellow, and genes identified are shown in the yellow box. C Representation of the 6 most significant BIN1 isoforms altered (left) and quantification of the differential isoform fraction (dIF) in AD brains compared to controls (right). Main protein domains are indicated with different colors. D Similar representation for APP. * dIF &gt;0.05 and FDR &gt; 0.01. </caption>

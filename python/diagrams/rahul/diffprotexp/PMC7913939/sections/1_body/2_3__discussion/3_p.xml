<p>In the present study, we found that the mRNA expression levels of MCT1 and MCT4 as well as Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase α2 subunit are considerably changed in either the cortex, the cerebellum or the hippocampus of 
 <italic>Prnp
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> vs. WT mice. Additionally, we showed that MCT1 protein levels in the cortex are upregulated in 9-month-old WT mice as compared to 
 <italic>Prnp
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice (behavioral changes between both groups obvious in respect to learning, anxiety, curiosity), but not in 3-month-old mice (no behavioral changes between both groups obvious). This finding hints at the association of the presence/absence of PrP
 <sup>c</sup>, changes in MCTs mRNA/protein expression and potential impact on neuroenergetics.

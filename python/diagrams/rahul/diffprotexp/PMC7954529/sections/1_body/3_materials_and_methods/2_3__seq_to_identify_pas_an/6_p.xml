<p>To ensure gene expression level did not introduce ascertainment bias, we tested the relationship between PAS number and normalized gene expression. In both species, the number of PAS is negatively correlated with normalized gene expression (human: Pearson’s correlation = −0.19, p&lt;2.2×10
 <sup>−16</sup>; chimpanzee: Pearson’s correlation = −0.17, p&lt;2.2×10
 <sup>−16</sup>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We expected species to contribute the most amount of variation to PAS usage. We ran principal component analysis (PCA) on the filtered nuclear PAS usage. PC1 accounts for 41.8% of the variation and is highly correlated with species (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.68). PC2 accounts for 13.1% of the variation and is moderately correlated with RNA extraction technician (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.38) and extraction day (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.28). As both of these variables are balanced with respect to species, we do not believe they bias the results (

We identified 302 sites used at a rate of 5% or greater in humans and 0% in chimpanzees, which we designated as human-specific. We identified 357 sites used at a rate of 5% or greater in chimpanzee and 0% in humans, which we designated as chimp-specific.

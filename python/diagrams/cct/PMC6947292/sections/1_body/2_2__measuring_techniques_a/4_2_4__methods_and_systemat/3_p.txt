0: Imaging of precipitates of dimensions below about 1 m is commonly done by TEM (e.g., [ 141]) [ 112, 118, 119, 128, 142, 143].
1: In this work, bright-field TEM images and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) images from (scanning) TEM are used.
2: In TEM, additional analysis with EDS allows conclusions to be drawn on the elemental composition of certain relevant particles, down to precipitate structures composed of just a few layers of atoms [ 143].
3: The chemical analysis of the latter can potentially be supplemented or even improved by the application of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) [ 143].
4: When using TEM, information on local crystal structures can be generated by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) or nanobeam diffraction (NBD).

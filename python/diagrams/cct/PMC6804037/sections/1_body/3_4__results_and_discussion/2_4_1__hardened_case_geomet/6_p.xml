<p>By comparison, in samples #5 and #6, in which only the value of the pulse width differed, it could be observed that the higher the pulse width, the higher width and depth in the geometrical dimension and harder layer was obtained. More heat to the surface of the sample caused higher hardness and a larger hardened area. This trend was the same for sample #7 and sample #8.</p>

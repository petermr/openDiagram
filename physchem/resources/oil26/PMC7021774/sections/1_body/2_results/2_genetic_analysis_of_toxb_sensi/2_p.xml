<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par18">ToxB sensitivity was also found to be highly heritable in the AM panel (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;480, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;0.9). The majority of varieties (93%) were found to either be insensitive (ToxB sensitivity&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.2) or slightly sensitive (sensitivity&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.2,&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1), while just 7% of varieties were classified as sensitive (&#8805;&#8201;1) (Supplementary Table 2). GWAS using the 22,237 SNPs after skimming the complete data matrix on minor allele frequency&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.06 identified 73 significant SNPs at the Bonferroni corrected <italic>P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.01 threshold (&#8722;log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;6.35) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). Of these SNPs, 64 were located on the MAGIC genetic map on chromosome 2B between 15.13 and 73.65&#160;cM. Anchoring the remaining nine SNPs to the physical map via BLASTn indicated eight mapped to chromosome 2B (Supplementary Table 3) and supported by the analyses of Gardner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) who treated these SNPs as a trait and QTL mapped them back to chromosome 2B on the &#8216;NIAB Elite MAGIC&#8217; genetic map. For the remaining unmapped SNP (Kukri_c30668_294), while BLASTn predicted it to map to 2D, using the SNP as a trait predicted it to be located on 2B (Gardner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). Accordingly, we tentatively assign this marker to chromosome 2B.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Manhattan plot of GWAS results for ToxB sensitivity in the association mapping panel (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;480) using 22,237 SNPs.

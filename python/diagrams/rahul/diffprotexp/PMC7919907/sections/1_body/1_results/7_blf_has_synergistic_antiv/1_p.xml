<p>Combination therapy has been extensively explored for the treatment in oncology, parasitic, bacterial and viral infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36â€“38</xref>], it has many advantages over monotherapies such as delayed development of drug resistance; synergistic efficacy on treatment; and fewer side effects due to the lower doses of drugs used. The combination treatment potential of BLF with remdesivir was explored using HCoV-OC43 antiviral CPE assay. Remdesivir is a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase inhibitor and is an FDA-approved antiviral. Combination indices (CIs) versus the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compounds at different combination ratios were plotted as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The red line indicates additive effect; the right upper area above the red line indicates antagonism, while the left bottom area below the line indicates synergy [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In all combination scenarios, the CIs at all the combination ratios fell below the red line (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(E)</xref>), suggesting BLF displayed synergistic antiviral effect with remdesivir in the combination therapy.

0: Concentrations of IFN, CCL5, CXCL-1 and IL-1 were quantified in cell culture supernatant or processed tissue samples by ELISA (R&D Systems, USA), following the manufacturer instructions.
1: The detection limit of quantitative ELISA was in the range of 48 pg/mL or pg per 100 mg of tissue.
2: Results were expressed as pg per 100 mg of tissue, pg/mL of supernatant or by absorbance at 490 nm.
3: IFN4 and ISG expression levels (RIG-I (DDX58), Mx1, Mx2, ISG15, ISG20) were determined in processed samples by RT-qPCR using specific primers (IDT, USA), using primers pairs as described elsewhere [ 32].
4: Cycle threshold (Ct) values of target genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S and analyzed according to the Ct method: 2 Ct (sample)-Ct (housekeeping).
5: Results are expressed as fold increase over the mock-infected WT group.

<p id="Par32">This is the first study with a mesentery directed approach for improving specificity in the characterization of differential gene expression in regenerating tissues. Furthermore, it is also the first one in sea cucumbers for analysis of differential expression during intestinal regeneration at a stage as early as 24Â h after the organism has expelled its internal organs. An expected high number of DETs were found using high-throughput sequencing methods and numerous functional processes associated with regeneration. What is more appealing, TF activity correlated with regenerative machinery was diverse in expression trends that did not necessarily belong to the same group of processes. Further studies can be considered to unravel the regulatory networks associated with TF activity and connect them with distinctive cellular processes.</p>

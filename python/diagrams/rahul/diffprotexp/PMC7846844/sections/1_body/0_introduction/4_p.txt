0: Earlier studies obtained transcriptome expression profiles of Tibetan pigs and Yorkshire through RNA-seq data.
1: Among them, 209 genes were screened in TP, including multiple genes related to the formation of muscle fibers.
2: The author speculates that it may play an important role in determining the growth rate and potential weight of pigs after birth 10.
3: In this study, we used this set of RNA-seq data to explore the potential role of lincRNA on porcine skeletal muscle development.
4: DELs were obtained through pipeline analysis and differential expression analysis, and potential target genes in cis were predicted.
5: A co-expression network of MDRPTG and its corresponding long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) was constructed and used to explore the potential role of DEL in the process of muscle fiber hypertrophy.

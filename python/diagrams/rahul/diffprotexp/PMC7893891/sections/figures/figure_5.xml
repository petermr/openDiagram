  <p>Differential gene expression in key signaling pathways shaping MN differentiation. Gene transcript levels were determined by global RNA-seq analysis of (
   <bold>a</bold>) TGFβ, (
   <bold>b</bold>) Notch, and (
   <bold>c</bold>) Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathways and (
   <bold>d</bold>) Calcium signaling. Fold change was calculated relative to RNA reads in iPSC (D0). The statistics (average value and standard error) were derived from three independent biological replicas with

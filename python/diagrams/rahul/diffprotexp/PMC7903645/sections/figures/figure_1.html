 <caption> Overall gene expression and differential expression analysis of whole blood transcriptomes. a Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), denoting CI-term group, CI-preterm group, and normal controls. b Volcano plot of overall gene-based differential expression results in women with cervical insufficiency vs controls. The x-axis corresponds to the log of the fold change difference between groups and the y-axis corresponds to the negative log of the adjusted P values. There were 30 differentially expressed genes (red dots) when using adjusted P value &lt;â€‰0.05. CI, cervical insufficiency </caption>

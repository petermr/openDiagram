0: The surface structure parameters of the samples were determined using N 2 adsorptiondesorption measurements.
1: The adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured by an Autosorb iQ-AG-C Quantachrome instrument (Boyton Beach, FL, USA) at 77 K. The BrunauerEmmetTeller (BET) method was used to determine the specific surface area.

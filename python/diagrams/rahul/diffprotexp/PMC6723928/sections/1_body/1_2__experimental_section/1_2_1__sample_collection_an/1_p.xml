<p>Approval for this project was obtained from the Yonsei University Committee for Research on Human Subjects (2-2015-0050), and informed consent was acquired from all participants. All extraction and preparation procedures were performed by a single operator at the Department of Conservative Dentistry, Yonsei University Dental Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Five participants aged 22â€“35 years (three males and two females) were enrolled into three groups based on the pulpal status of the tooth being treated. The groups were as follows:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Healthy pulp (
    <italic>n</italic> = 1; 22/M): two healthy and completely erupted permanent human third molars with closed apex, which were caries free showing normal probing depths.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Inflamed pulp group (
    <italic>n</italic> = 2; 23/F and 35/M): maxillary central incisors with advanced dental caries, defined as the presence of spontaneous pain and lingering response to the cold test.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Traumatic pulp group (
    <italic>n</italic> = 2; 24/F and 35/M): maxillary central incisors with closed apex, ten days after replantation due to traumatic avulsion and avulsed time within 20 min.
   </p>

<p>The challenge now is to understand why and when the transport activity of ATP2 and the other putative P4-ATPases are required within the complex life-cycle of the malaria parasite. The intracellular development inside the parasitized cell depends on an initial heavy supply of lipids to build the different membrane compartments, together with efficient mechanisms to ensure a suitable lipid composition on each membrane, as ∼75% of all lipids exhibit significant variations on its relative amount along parasite’s development, particularly during gametogenesis [

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite has a limited capacity of synthesizing fatty acids and phospholipids[

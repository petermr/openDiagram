<p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that lncRNA transcripts of the upper thoracic spinal cord were differentially expressed after MIRI. These spinal lncRNAs may regulate the expression of MIRI-related proteins and genes, and contribute to the pathogenesis of MIRI. Future investigations of these spinal lncRNAs found in the present study will mainly focus on their functions and their relationship with MIRI. Nonetheless, the present study may provide important evidence for further basic research and clinical investigations on improved therapeutic interventions of MIRI.</p>

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par16">ToxB infiltration of the panel of 29 parental lines of wheat mapping populations found moderate to high sensitivity scores (&#8805;&#8201;2) in just two accessions (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All eight founders of the &#8216;BMW MAGIC&#8217; population were insensitive (score&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.2) to ToxB, ruling out this population for QTL analysis. Of the eight &#8216;NIAB Elite MAGIC&#8217; founders, six lines were insensitive (score&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.2; &#8216;Alchemy&#8217;, &#8216;Brompton&#8217;, &#8216;Claire&#8217;, &#8216;Hereward&#8217;, &#8216;Rialto&#8217;, &#8216;Robigus&#8217;) one showed intermediate sensitivity (&#8216;Soissons&#8217;, score&#8201;=&#8201;0.7), while one was highly sensitive (&#8216;Xi19&#8217;, score&#8201;=&#8201;2.8). Among the remaining 12 varieties tested, only &#8216;Battalion&#8217; showed marked ToxB sensitivity (score&#8201;=&#8201;2), with all other lines classified as ToxB insensitive (score&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.2; &#8216;Cadenza&#8217;, &#8216;Oakley&#8217;, &#8216;Apogee&#8217;, &#8216;Avalon&#8217;, &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;, &#8216;Dic12b&#8217;, &#8216;Exsept&#8217;, &#8216;Gatsby&#8217;, &#8216;Malacca&#8217;, &#8216;Paragon&#8217;, &#8216;SHW-041&#8217; and &#8216;Tios&#8217;). Based on these results, two wheat populations were selected for further analysis: &#8216;NIAB Elite MAGIC&#8217;, and a European AM panel so as to screen as widely as practicable for the evidently rare cases of sensitivity.</p>

<p id="p0090">IL6 signaling is enormously complex and capable of eliciting both pro- and anti-inflammatory cellular behaviors 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Classical IL6 pathways reliant upon membrane-bound IL6R tend to elicit anti-inflammatory responses. In contrast, trans-signaling-mediated responses are distinctly pro-inflammatory and proceed by way of IL6ST on cells that do not express membrane-bound IL6R 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These trans-signaling-mediated responses require soluble IL6R (sIL6R) to interact with IL6 and IL6ST proteins ( 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). A fluoxetine-mediated reduction in IL6ST signal transduction could therefore specifically decrease hyper-inflammatory IL6 pathways while maintaining the classic anti-inflammatory IL6 pathways critical to the re-establishment of homeostasis in hyperinflammatory disorders

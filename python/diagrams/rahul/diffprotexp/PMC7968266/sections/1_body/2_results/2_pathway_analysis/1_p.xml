<p id="Par34">For a further understanding of the three datasets’ overlapping DEGs, KEGG and GO analysis were carried out through DAVID. In KEGG analysis, the overlapping up-regulated genes were highly enriched in Cell cycle and Oocyte meiosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), while the down-regulated genes were enriched in Huntington’s disease (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In GO analysis, the overlapping up-regulated genes were highly enriched in Protein binding, Nucleoplasm and Nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), and the down-regulated genes were mostly enriched in Cilium, Microtubule, and Motile cilium (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d).

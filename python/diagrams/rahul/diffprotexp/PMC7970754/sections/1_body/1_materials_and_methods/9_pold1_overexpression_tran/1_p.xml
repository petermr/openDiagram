<p>MDA-MB-231 cells in logarithmic growth phase were inoculated into 6-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well. After 12 h of culturing, POLD1 over-expressing recombinant lentivirus (pCMV-EGFP-POLD1) was added. In addition, a control group and no-load negative control group without viruses were established, and 2 ug/L virus enhancement solution was added at the same time. After 12 h, the medium was changed to a fresh complete medium, and following 72 h, puromycin (2 mg/L) was added for screening. After 1 week, the concentration of puromycin was observed to be reduced by half, and the screening was continued for 1 week. MDA-MB-231/POLD1- Overexpression (OE) and MDA-MB-231/POLD1- Normal control (NC) cell lines were obtained for the subsequent experiments. Transfection efficiency was determined by fluorescence, WB and qPT-PCR.</p>

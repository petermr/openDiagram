<p>The formation process of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene composites is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. At the initial stage of the reaction, the chemical reaction follows a dissolutionâ€“precipitation mechanism. The iron ions, phosphate ions, and lithium ions in the solution react with each other and form agglomerated precipitate on the surface of the graphene oxide sheets, and a large number of active functional groups are adsorbed on the surface of graphene oxide. At the stage of microwave irradiation, the active functional groups, being polar molecules, can absorb microwave easily, and electromagnetic energy is converted into heat and molecular kinetic energy. The temperature increase quickly, the reactive oxygen groups are exfoliated, and, finally, the graphene oxide is restored into graphene. Meanwhile, the precipitated particles adsorbed on the surface of reduced graphene sheets become hot and absorb microwaves quickly, the particles interact with each other, and then crystal nuclei are formed quickly under the action of the microwave electromagnetic field. Finally, under the influence of micron graphene sheets, the crystal nuclei grow, agglomerate, and form microspheres and micron blocks.

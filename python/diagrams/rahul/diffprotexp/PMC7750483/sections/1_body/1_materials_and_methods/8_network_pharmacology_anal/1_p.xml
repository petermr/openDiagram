<p>Differentially expressed genes related to the 
 <italic>GSK3B</italic> gene were obtained by R package limma. The samples were divided into two groups according to the median expression values of the 
 <italic>GSK3B</italic> gene and | log
 <sub>2</sub> fold-change (FC)| &gt; 1, and the 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.05 was set as a threshold. According to the 
 <italic>P</italic> value ranking, the first 150 DEGs that were significantly up-regulated and the first 150 DEGs that were significantly down-regulated were included for potential drug target analysis. The Connectivity Map (CMap) is a gene expression profile database based on interventional gene expression (

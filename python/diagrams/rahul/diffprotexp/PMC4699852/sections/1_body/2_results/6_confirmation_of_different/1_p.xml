 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> shows the changes in cellular protein levels with time during neuronal differentiation. The western blotting results indicate that both PKC-ε and KIF5B increased with time of induction. Compared to the undifferentiated cells, the expression levels of PKC-ε and KIF5B were increased 154.7% and 159.6%, respectively, by the induction of neuronal differentiation for 5 days. However, after 5 days, the level of Nm23-H1 was reduced to 35.7% of its original level. According to the literature, KIF5B interacting to axonal synaptic vesicles is evident [

<p>As there are well-known disparities between cells in exponential and in stationary growth phases at the transcriptomic level, it is crucial to monitor and compare the changes in the proteome profile of 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> through these two different growth phases. Former studies revealed remarkable growth phase associated alterations in protein expression within 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our study, mono-dimensional electrophoresis for the proteins in two phases, not unexpectedly, showed variations in some band intensities between samples as same protein could be identified in two different growth phases and up/or down regulated according to the phase. Simultaneously, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, coupled with mass spectrometric and bioinformatic analysis, as a gel-based proteomics approach, showed that the expression of 12 proteins altered in the stationary phase.

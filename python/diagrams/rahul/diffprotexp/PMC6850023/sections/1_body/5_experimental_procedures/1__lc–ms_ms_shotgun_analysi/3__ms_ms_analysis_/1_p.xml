Proteins were quantified by counting the number of MS/MS spectra matched to the corresponding proteins. Uniprot protein sequences from the

Proteins were validated using the default settings in MaxQuant and Andromeda with a minimum of at least one peptide, but that any such protein had to unambiguously identified by peptides that were unique to that protein. Spectral counts were normalized to total spectral counts that account for differences between runs (total spectral counts varied between 11,015 and 15,856 per run).

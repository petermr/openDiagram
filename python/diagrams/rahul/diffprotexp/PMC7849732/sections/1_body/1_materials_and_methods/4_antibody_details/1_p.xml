<p>To selectively label the GluN2A NMDAR subunit we used a polyclonal antibody (Alomone Labs, #ACG-002) raised in rabbit. This antibody recognizes the extracellular, N-terminus, sequence GHSHDVTERELRN(C) corresponding to the amino-acid residues 41–53 of the rat GluN2A. The peptide is homologous to the mice and humans’ peptide and, therefore, can be used to detect GluN2A in all of these species. This specific antibody has been used to successfully label GluN2A in previous published immunohistochemistry [

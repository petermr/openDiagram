<p>Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentage of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in the spleen. On d 7 post-vagotomy, the percentages of IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> Th1 and IL-17
 <sup>+</sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> Th17 cells were increased, but the percentages of IL-4
 <sup>+</sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> Th2 and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> CD25
 <sup>+</sup> Foxp3
 <sup>+</sup> Treg cells in VMC mice were decreased (

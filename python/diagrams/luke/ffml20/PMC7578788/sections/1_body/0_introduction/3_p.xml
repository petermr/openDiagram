<p id="Par4">In the context of motor adaptation, only a limited number of studies have examined motor cortical beta signals in peri-movement time periods. The beta rebound has been observed to be attenuated during trials in which large errors are made

 </sup>, and this has been attributed to a reduction in the subject’s confidence in the motor program, prompting subsequent adjustment or exploratory movements

 <italic>adaptive drive</italic>—defined here as neuronal signals generated in response to an increase in behavioural error specifically computed to support modification of subsequent motor actions. Motor cortical beta signals have also been reported to be attenuated prior to movement initiation in both a forcefield and a visuomotor adaptation task

 </sup>. This pre-movement reduction in beta power was interpreted to reflect a predictive updating of the upcoming motor command in response to a previous error, and thereby signalling an adaptive drive
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. However, this idea was challenged by a subsequent study that used an interlimb cooperative adaptation task to decouple adaptive drive from altered motor commands and found that premovement beta modulation might be a result of higher-level processing of sensory information that updates upcoming movements

 </sup>. The present study sought to clarify whether changes in pre-movement beta oscillations are consistent with an increase in adaptive drive.

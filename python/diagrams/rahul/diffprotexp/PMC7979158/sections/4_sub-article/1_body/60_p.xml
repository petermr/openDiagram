<p>We apologize for this error in the methods. The dissection strategy for RNA-seq and immunoblotting sample collection at E17.5 was identical and only includes developing cortex. Thus RNA and protein quantitative analyses were performed on tissues collected using the same methods. We reorganized the Materials and methods section to highlight this by changing the subsection to the subtitle “Dissection methods for RNA-seq and immunoblotting.” We also removed the term “cortical extracts” from the legend for Figure 4—figure supplement 1A. See response text in [5b] for specific wording.</p>

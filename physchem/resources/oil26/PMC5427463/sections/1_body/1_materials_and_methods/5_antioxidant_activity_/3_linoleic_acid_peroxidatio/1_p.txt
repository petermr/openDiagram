0: In this assay, the antioxidant capacity of SoEO on inhibition of lipid peroxidation was assessed (Hui et al., 2010[ 21]).
1: 0.2804 g of Tween 20 and 0.2804 g of linoleic acid were mixed in 50 mL of PBS (200 mM, pH 7.0) to prepare the linoleic acid emulsion.
2: 2.5 mL of linoleic acid emulsion and 2 mL of PBS (200 mM, pH 7.0) were added to 0.5 mL of different concentrations of SoEO (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/mL) and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 C in the dark.
3: Then, 100 L of the reaction mixture, 100 L of ammonium thiocyanate solution (30 %) and 100 L of ferrous chloride solution (20 mM/ in HCl) were added to 9.7 mL of ethanol (75 %).
4: After stirring for 3 min the absorbance was measured at 500 nm.
5: -Tocopherol was used as a positive control solution without adding SoEO or -tocopherol was used as blank.
6: The percentage of antioxidant activity was determined using the following Eq.
7: (2):

<p id="Par31">To identify known miRNAs in the developing Tartary buckwheat seed, the mapped sRNA reads were subjected to Blastn search against miRBase v21.0. In total, 101 conserved miRNAs, belonging to 25 known miRNA families, were identified (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). Of these families, 17 families contained more than two members, three families (MiR390, MiR399, and MiR858) contained two members, and the remaining five families (MiR159, MiR394, MiR397, MiR828, and MiR845) only contained one member. The length of these known miRNAs ranged from 19 to 22 nt, and the numbers of miRNAs with length of 19, 20, 21, and 22 nt were 8, 29, 56, and 8, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). Among these identified conserved miRNAs, 29 miRNAs were highly expressed, which have more than 1000 read counts at least in one library (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The rest of miRNAs were expressed at a moderate level (36) or low level (36) which have &lt; 10 read counts for each library, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). Notably, the highest expression miRNA was fta-miR159, and read counts ranged from 14,806 to 95,396 for each library.

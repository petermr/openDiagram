<p>As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f012">Figure 12</xref>, the predicted stress values using the Arrhenius-type constitutive model are in very good agreement with the measured values over the entire temperature range and strain rates. The Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient 
 <italic>R</italic> was calculated to determine the quality of the correlation between the measured and predicted values of flow stresses. The evaluation of the suitability of using the selected model for flow stress prediction of AISI 4340 steel is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f013">Figure 13</xref>. The value of the coefficient of determination in comparison with the best fitting is R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9892.

<p id="Par22">The majority of the included ECM proteins had similar abundance in meniscus and articular cartilage, both in the DDA and DIA analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, DIA exhibited more statistically significant proteins and narrower confidence intervals than DDA. Out of 103 proteins 21 differed statistically significantly between the two tissue types in the DIA analysis and 19 remained different after FDR control (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, in the DDA analysis, only 11 out of 103 proteins were statistically significantly different and four of these remained after FDR control. Only two proteins, lysozyme C and transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (BGH3), were statistically significantly different (after FDR control) between the two tissue types in both analysis methods (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). On average the ratios of protein abundance between articular cartilage and meniscus were similar even if numerical differences were found (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>
 <italic>:</italic> Figure S2). For example, among the proteins with higher levels in articular cartilage, phospholipase A membrane-associated and lysozyme C yielded the largest differences in the DIA analysis and DDA analysis, respectively. Among the proteins with higher levels in meniscus, dermatopontin had the largest ratio in both analyses. Still, the DDA approach appeared to yield higher estimated intensity values than DIA as depicted in Additional file

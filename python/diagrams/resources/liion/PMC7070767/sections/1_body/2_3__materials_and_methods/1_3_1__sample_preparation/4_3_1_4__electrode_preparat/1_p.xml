<p>For the preparation of Si-based anodes, we used powder silicon samples (S1, S2, and S3) mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and conductive carbon black (CB) in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The ratio applied was 60 wt-% of samples S1, S2, and S3, 20 wt-% of PVDF, and 20 wt-% of CB. The prepared slurries were then spread onto aluminum foil current collector (20 µm thick) using a Doctorblade coating machine for wet thickness of 200 µm. The prepared electrode sheets were dried for 12 h at 60 °C in vacuum. Thereafter, circular electrodes with 16 mm diameter (A = 2 cm
 <sup>2</sup> ) were cut with an electrode punching tool and placed in a vacuum oven over night at 50 °C. The typical loading of composite electrode material was ≈12 mg.

 <caption> ( a) Heap map expression of Hemidactylus frenatus transcript during tail tissue regeneration. ( b) Heat map expression of differentially expressed proteins which are associated with tail regeneration; ( c) Heat map expression of various genes differentially regulated during regeneration based on RTPCR analysis. ( d) Venn diagram for number genes identified from Transcriptomics, proteomics and Real time PCR based gene expression analysis; e. Batches of genes/proteins which are differentially expressed at 1, 2 and 5-dpa. Genes/proteins which are in the red/organge arrow indicates the upregulation and in the green arrow indicates the downregulation. </caption>

<p>Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), the most commonly used plasticizer, is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that can trigger reproductive and developmental toxicity in females 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Importantly, DEHP exposure impairs establishment of the ovarian reserve by delaying or reducing PF assembly 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Similar observations in other studies suggest the deregulation of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor expression, and attenuation of NOTCH signaling 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Furthermore, the number of apoptotic germ cells increases during 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of newborn ovaries exposed to DEHP for three days 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Specifically, autophagy can be induced by DEHP exposure via activating AMPK-SKP2-CARM1 signaling, thus further reducing the PF pool and damaging female fertility 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>; these results indicate that DEHP affects oocyte survival during PF formation. From another aspect, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies both suggest that DEHP damages steroidogenesis and exerts toxicity during different stages of folliculogenesis 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. For example, plasticizer exposure could accelerate the development of PFs and therefore result in premature ovarian failure (POF) 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, and antral follicle depletion is increased as a result of estrogen deficiency, estrous cycle disorder, and impaired aromatase activity

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Meanwhile, the transgenerational inheritance of DEHP has attracted considerable attention 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Through maternal exposure, DEHP has been shown to exert adverse reproductive effects across generations: it reduces oocyte quality and follicle reserve in F1 female mice, and alters the same ovarian phenotype in F2 and F3 offspring; moreover, it accelerates follicular recruitment

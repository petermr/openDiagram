<p id="Par58">In this study, we aimed at delineating possible mechanisms governing pseudostem height in banana by employing a combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis of a mutant and its wild type plant. At the metabolic level, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism pathways showed differential regulation. At the transcriptome level, we observed that biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, metabolic pathways, ribosomes and tyrosine metabolism were significantly enriched. The higher expression of a gibberellin regulated protein, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases, a probable 2-oxoglutatrate-dependent dioxygenase, and BRI genes in MT coupled with the changes in the expression of genes associated with mevalonate pathway indicates that GA is an important contributor in pseudostem height regulation. Our results also confirmed the known coordinated role of GAs with BR, ABA, auxin, and other hormones for stem growth regulation. The pseudostem height in MT was also being regulated by the changes in the expression of cell-wall related genes, cell elongation, and expansion.</p>

<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201914760-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> a,b depicts the minimum‐energy curve and voltage profile for the FeNCN archetype in a NIB, obtained with the same computational approach as used for the LIB before. An analogous high voltage plateau (about 3.4 V vs. Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Na
 <sup>0</sup>) appears at a low Na content (
 <italic>x</italic>&lt;0.2), similar to the LIB. The maximum experimentally achievable Na content, however, is only 
 <italic>x</italic>=1.5. This is because Na fails to react with all FeNCN in experiments, probably due to kinetic hindrance, so there is only a partial reaction (or partial discharge). The SEI (or electrolyte degradation) effect is the same as in a LIB, but with less reversible capacity to form the active material. If we set 
 <italic>x</italic>=1.5 as the theoretical maximum Na content, that is, the discharge process ends at Na
 <sub>6</sub>Fe(NCN)
 <sub>4</sub> and not Na
 <sub>2</sub>NCN, we end up with a new voltage profile for a partial discharge. It is reassuring that this new profile, depicted as a solid orange line in Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201914760-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> b, agrees nicely with the experimental result.

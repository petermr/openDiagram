<p id="Par19">Demographic variables (sex, age, and PMI) were compared between the groups using a χ
 <sup>2</sup>-test and Welch’s t-test. The latter was also used for comparing the levels of protein (DARPP-32, CaN) expression between the diagnostic groups (schizophrenia and control, with bipolar disorder as a reference). The correlations of expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN in each sample were assessed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and the ratio of proteins were compared between the diagnostic groups by Welch’s t-test. For association study of SNPs, we divided all samples into minor allele carriers and non-carriers of each SNPs. A Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test was then used for comparing the levels of protein expression between the genotypes of each SNP. In the comparison between the two groups, we excluded outliers (&gt;mean ± 3 SD) from analysis. Further, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between the expressions of each protein and estimated total dosage of neuroleptic drugs. SPSS ver. 25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and (SigmaPlot14.0; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) was used for analysis.

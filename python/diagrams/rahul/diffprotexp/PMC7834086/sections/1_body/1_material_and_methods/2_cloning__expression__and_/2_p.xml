<p>Next, immunocytochemical staining was used to analyze the Pir toxin proteins’ ability to enter primary shrimp hemocytes using a previously described method with minor modifications [

 <sup>6</sup> hemocytes were seeded onto glass-bottom plates, incubated at 28°C for 2 h, before being treated with 0.1 µM His-rPirA or His-rPirB at 28°C for 2 h. Following this, cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed three times with 0.01 M PBS (137 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na

 <sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4), followed by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.01 M PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were then washed and incubated with 5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) for 30 min, and then with mouse anti-His antibody (TransGen BioTech, Beijing, China, 1:100) overnight at 4°C. After being washed, samples were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor 488 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China, 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were washed three times, stained with Hochest 33,342 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 10 min at room temperature protected from light, followed by washing six times, before being examined under a Confocal Microscope LSM800 (Carl ZEISS, Heidenheim, Germany).

<p>As found through qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis revealed that only the GluN2B NMDAR isoform was preferentially localized to the SDH in female spinal cord. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in staining intensity per area in the SDH versus the DDH for both the GluN2A (p = 0.35, n = 6) and GluN2D (p = 0.20, n = 5) isoforms, while there was significantly higher immunoreactivity for GluN2B in the SDH compared to the DDH (p = 0.020, n = 6; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(b</xref>)). Calculating the ratio of immunoreactivity in the SDH versus DDH revealed values near 1 for both GluN2A (1.07 ± 0.05, n = 6) and GluN2D (1.13 ± 0.09, n = 5), while GluN2B had a SDH/DDH immunoreactivity ratio of 1.30 ± 0.07 (n = 6). However, as for males, ANOVA analysis revealed no significant difference between groups (p = 0.085).

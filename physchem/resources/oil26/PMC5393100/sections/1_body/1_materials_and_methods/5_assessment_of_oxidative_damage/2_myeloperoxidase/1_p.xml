Absorbance of the mixture was measured at 460 nm for 3 min using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (GBC, Cintra 40). One unit of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was equal to the change in absorbance per min at room temperature in the final reaction.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p>

<p>HBMEC were first seeded in four 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> culture flasks. Then, cells were infected with EV71 Strain (KC122766) at a MOI of 5. As a negative control, one culture flask was mock infected with DMEM. Briefly, time was set as 0 h when HBMEC was mock infected with DMEM. Time was set as 1 h after HBMEC was infected with EV71 for 1 h. At 1 h, 16 h, and 24 h after infection, infected cells and mock infected cells (0 h) were harvested by scraping and washed with the PBS twice (0.01 M, pH 7.4) at 4°C. Cells were then pelleted by centrifuging at 4°C (150 g for 10 min), and 800 
 <italic>μ</italic>L ice-cold lysis buffer (containing 20 mM Tris base, 2 M Thiourea, 7 M Urea, and 2% Chaps) was added into the centrifuge tube for 60 min on ice. The protein extract supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 16,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The proteins were separated into several equal parts (125

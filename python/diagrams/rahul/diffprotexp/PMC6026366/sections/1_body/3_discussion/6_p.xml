 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Our study demonstrated an elevation of SOD and a reduction in lipid peroxidation of MDA content in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> treated with RGE. In addition, three antioxidant-related proteins—HSP70, UCHL1, and ALF

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>—in 2-DE results were identified by Western blotting and elevated in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> induced by RGE. Previous studies reported that Korean Red Ginseng ameliorated oxidative tissue injury, provided an antiaging effect, and suppressed age-related renal injury

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Therefore, the higher expression of the antioxidants HSP70 and UCHL1 in RGE-treated flies may facilitate slower aging progression and prolong life span.

<p>QTLs are the genomic loci that are associated with phenotype of an organism and harbor important genes or molecular signatures that govern agronomic traits. To identify candidate miRNAs and/or their target genes important for seed size/weight determination, we analyzed the set of miRNAs and their targets genes located within the known QTLs associated with seed size/weight. Interestingly, a total of 40 miRNAs and 472 target genes were found to be located within the known seed size/weight associated QTLs (Table 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). Among them, genes encoding for transcription factors, such as 
 <italic>SPL</italic>, 
 <italic>HB</italic>, 
 <italic>GRF, TCP,</italic> and 
 <italic>AP2,</italic> were included. Further, 19 miRNAs known to be involved in seed development or exhibiting differential expression at S3 and/or S5 stages between the two cultivars were located within the known QTLs (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). These included members of miR156, miR159, miR160, miR170, and miR1511 families, along with several novel miRNAs. The target genes of these miRNAs were enriched in GO terms, such as seed development, cell division, cell differentiation, developmental process, regulation of transcription, biosynthetic processes, along with different signaling pathways (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Among the QTL originated miRNAs, 15 of them targeted at least 41 genes located within the same or other QTL(s) (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a,c</xref>,d). Interestingly, known genes involved in seed development and size/weight determination, such as 
 <italic>ARF, SBP, MYB</italic>, tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), leucine‐rich repeat (LRR) protein, TIR‐NBS‐LRR proteins, and early nodulin‐like protein 2, were found to be targeted by these miRNAs (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6c,d</xref>). In addition, genes with unknown function were also included among the targets of these miRNAs. These results suggest plausible role of miRNAs in regulating candidate genes involved in biosynthetic processes and organ development, which eventually may determine seed size/weight in chickpea cultivars.

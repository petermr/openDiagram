0: EV71 were amplified by using RD cells.
1: Virus was propagated in RD cells which were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and antibiotics.
2: Briefly, 80~90% confluent monolayers of RD cells were inoculated with the virus; once 90% of the cells showed cytopathic effect (CPE), the culture medium and cell debris were harvested and were repeated freezing and thawing three times, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min.
3: Supernatants were filtered through a 0.22  L membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 80C before use.
4: Furthermore, the virus titers were determined by a plaque assay using vero cells as described in [ 20].
5: Plaques developed by series dilute suspension of EV71 virus in Vero cell cultures 96 h postinfection after crystal violet staining.
6: Scoring was done by counting the plaques in each well.

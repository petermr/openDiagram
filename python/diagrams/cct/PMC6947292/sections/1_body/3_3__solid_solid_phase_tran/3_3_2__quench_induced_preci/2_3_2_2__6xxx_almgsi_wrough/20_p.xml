<p>In general, most of the quench-induced precipitates found in the pure ternary alloys Al0.6Mg0.8Si and Al0.8Mg0.6Si after cooling with 0.1 K/s are β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f043">Figure 43</xref>, originating from HTR) but also for relatively fine/small particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f044">Figure 44</xref>). The origin of the latter is not clearly determined, but their size hints at the potential additional precipitation of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si during LTR in these laboratory alloys. However, during cooling at 0.1 K/s in the ternary laboratory alloys, two further types of MgSi precursor phases were identified, namely hexagonal β’-Mg9Si5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f045">Figure 45</xref>) and U1-MgAl2Si2. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f045">Figure 45</xref>, it is particularly interesting to note that these fine particles are polycrystalline, and are likely to contain disordered areas such as those previously reported for fine precipitates formed during ageing in AlMgSi alloys [

0: Three independent experiments were run in duplicate using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences).
1: Fifty ng of each RNA sample were probed for motor neuron differentiation markers using Taqman RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Bioscience) in a 25 l volume according to the manufacturers instructions.
2: Taqman probes included NEUROG2 (Hs00935087_g1), ChAT (Hs00758143_m1), Isl1 (Hs01099686_m1), PAX6 (Hs01088114_m1), MAP2 (Hs00258900_m1), Nestin (Hs04187831_g1), Oct4 (Hs00999632_g1), and HB9 (Hs00907365_m1).
3: Two endogenous controls, actin (Hs99999903_m1) and GAPDH (Hs01922876_u1), were analyzed by RT-qPCR and no significant differences were observed in their expression levels (data not shown); thus, all data shown are normalized to GAPDH.

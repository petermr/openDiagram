 <caption> ( a) Cyclic voltammetry experiments performed at a scan rate of 0.03 mV·s −1 for three PTCDA electrodes containing a mixture of VGCF–SO 3H and CNT–SO 3H. ( b) Comparison of rate capabilities for the same electrodes. Full and empty characters represent the Coulombic efficiency (%) and discharge capacity, respectively. </caption>

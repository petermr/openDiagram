<p>The reason for our previous finding remains unexplained. Although cMSCs may produce expressions that are closely similar to adult chondrocytes (AC), within the mixture of proteins expressed there may be alterations or deviations in the protein expression patterns, which lead to the limitations in the final outcome observed previously. When attempts were made to determine if such phenomenon may be the case, it is found that previous studies were mainly confined to determining the differential protein expression of pre- and post-chondrogenic induction of MSCs. Furthermore, reports comparing cMSCs to ACs appear lacking

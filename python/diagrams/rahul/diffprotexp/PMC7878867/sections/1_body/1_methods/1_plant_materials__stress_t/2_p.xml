 </sup>. All plants were well-watered from germination to booting. Pre-anthesis water-deficit stress was applied from the booting stage (Zadoks stage 49) until maturity, by maintaining the soil water content in pots at 6% (equal to half of the field capacity). Both the flag leaf and developing grain samples were collected from the main tiller at 5 DPA (days post-anthesis). Total RNA was extracted using the Tri reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and treated with TURBO DNase (ThermoFisher Scientific). The concentration, quality and integrity of total RNA samples were assessed by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, gel electrophoresis and the Agilent Bioanalyzer prior to use in next generation sequencing and qPCR. Six biological replicates were sampled for each group. Equal pooling of total RNA samples from the six biological replicates was performed prior to next-generation sequencing analysis.

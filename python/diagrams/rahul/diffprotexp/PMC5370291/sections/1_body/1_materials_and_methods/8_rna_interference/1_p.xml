<p>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was applied to knockdown the expression of HSP70 in HepG2 cells. Specific siRNA against HSP70 and the non-specific negative control were obtained from Qiagene (Hilden, Germany) and prepared according to manufacturer's instructions, and dissolved in siRNA suspension buffer at concentration of 20 Î¼M as previously described 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The HSP70 siRNA was transfected into HepG2 cells with T-Pro NTR II reagent (Ji-Feng Biotechnology CO., Ltd. Taiwan) to obtain high knockdown efficiency. Control non-silencing siRNA (sense 5'-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTdT -3', antisense 5'-ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA AdTdT-3'). HSP70 siRNA targeting [2 lines pooled, HSP70(a), sense 5'-CCA UUG AGG AGG UAG AUU ATT-3', antisense 5'-GTG GUA ACU CCU CCA UCU AAU-3', and HSP70(b), sense 5'-GUU ACU UCA AAG UAA AUA ATT-3', antisense 5'-ACC AAU GAA GUU UCA UUU AUU-3'].

<p>In order to confirm the expression profiles of the mRNAs and lncRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells obtained from the Illumina sequencing analysis, we randomly selected eight DE lncRNAs and thirteen DE mRNAs to verify by qPCR assay. The qPCR results confirmed the Illumina sequencing data, showing similar trends in the up- or down-regulated mRNAs (

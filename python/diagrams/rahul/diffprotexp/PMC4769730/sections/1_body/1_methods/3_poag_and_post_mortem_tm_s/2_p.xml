<p>Control samples, made available by the Eye Bank of Rome (Italy), were obtained from organ donors undergoing removal of eyes for corneal transplant, within 6 h of death and provided in Eusol-C medium (herein shorten as post-mortem samples). The absence of any eye diseases in these donors was ascertained in agreement with Italian national law (No. 301 of 12 August 1993). Briefly, four representative TMs were collected for each specimen under a dissector microscope (SMZ645; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with cold-light optic fibers (PL2000 photonic; Axon, Vienna, Austria), reproducing accurately the procedure of trabeculectomy and quickly stored in inhibitor-supplemented storage buffer at −70 °C until using in parallel with POAG samples. All post-mortem TMs were quickly stabilized in appropriate buffer, similar to POAG specimens.</p>

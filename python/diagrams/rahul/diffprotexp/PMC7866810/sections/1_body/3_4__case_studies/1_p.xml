<p>To showcase DIscBIO, we analyzed two scRNA-seq datasets: one consisting of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with breast cancer, and a second dataset from a myxoid liposarcoma cell line. Additionally, we illustrate how to use the conquer repository by loading and analyzing one of the available mice scRNA-seq datasets. For each case study, we provide a Jupyter notebook that includes the complete analysis and can be used as a guide to examine other datasets.</p>

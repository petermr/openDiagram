<p>The aggregative adherence phenotype can also be conferred by another adhesin designated aggregate-forming pilus (AFP). AFP is more similar to the bundle-forming pilus (BFP), which is usually expressed in enteropathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC), in terms of their operon structure and relatedness of their protein subunits. Expression of the 
 <italic>afp</italic> operon in AAF-negative EAEC/EHEC hybrids has been correlated with aggregative adherence [

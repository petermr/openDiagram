<p>Globally, one of the leading causes of years lived with a disability (126 out of 195 countries) is lower back pain, which has increased in prevalence from 42.5 million in 1990 to 64.9 million in 2017, standardized by age and sex [
 <xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. A theory explaining the pathophysiology in the intervertebral discs that links to the pain experienced is that of increased lactate production (due to anaerobic glycolysis in the muscle) which leads to reduced pH and ultimately neuronal death [
 <xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Within the inner core of the invertebrate disc is the nucleus pulposus, which sits in a mildly acidic (pH 6.8–7.2) [
 <xref rid="cit0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], hyperosmotic and avascular environment, and under these conditions ASIC3 (expressed by nucleus pulposus cells) serves to promote cell survival and lower the activity of the pro-apoptotic protein, caspase-3; ASIC3 was shown to be positively regulated by NGF via p75NTR and ERK signaling [
 <xref rid="cit0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], a pathway implicated in neuronal diseases and when inhibited, suppresses neuropathic pain [
 <xref rid="cit0091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. During degeneration of the rat nucleus pulposus tissue, ASIC3 expression is decreased and there is an elevated level of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which has been proposed to downregulate ASIC3 through the SMAD3 pathway [
 <xref rid="cit0092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This protective function of ASIC3 in intervertebral disc degeneration is further supported by the observation that culturing human nucleus pulposus cells under acidic conditions leads to increased apoptosis, which can be prevented through the use of amiloride [

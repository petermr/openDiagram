<p id="p0350">The proteome datasets from CPTAC [
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] and corresponding transcriptome datasets from gdc-portal [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] were used to assess correlation between expression on transcriptome and proteome level for key genes in tumor and normal tissues. We totally used 102 paired RNA sequencing and proteome profiles of breast, 53 - colon, 210 – lung, 108 – brain, 62 – ovary, 151 – head and neck tissues.

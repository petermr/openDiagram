 <caption> Comparative profiling of the prefrontal cortical proteomes of the stressed rats. A Analysis flowchart of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics of the prefrontal cortex tissue samples from the control (Cont), depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus), anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus), and insusceptible (Insus) groups. B Identification of differentially expressed proteins in the prefrontal cortex. Volcano plot displaying protein expression variations in the Dep-Sus, Anx-Sus, and Insus groups. The x-axis shows the average fold change (log2), and the y-axis shows the negative p value (log10). Low and high relative expressions were indicated in blue and red, respectively. </caption>

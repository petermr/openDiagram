<p>In clean rooms, the polyimide (2,7-CPI) was synthesized following the procedure: 2,7-CDA (0.3379 g, 1.713 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF in a 50-mL flask under argon atmosphere. Then, PMDA (0.3736 g, 1.713 mmol) was added, reaching a solid content of about 7 wt%. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 8 h to produce a viscous poly(amic acid) (PAA) solution. Then, the PAA is defoamed and coated uniformly on a glass plate. Subsequently, the thermal imidization was carried out in a vacuum oven with the temperature program of 100 °C (1 h) / 100~200 °C (1 h) / 200~300 °C (1 h)/300~400 °C (1 h) to form 2,7-CPI film. The 2,7-CPI film was then released from the glass plate after the oven cooled down to room temperature. IR (KBr,

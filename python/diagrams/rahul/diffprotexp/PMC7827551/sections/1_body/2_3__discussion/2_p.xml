<p>As expected, we found that elongation factor Tu was down regulated in the stationary growth phase. Notoriously, this protein has translation elongation activity and plays a significant role in cell energy metabolism, which is not a critical point in the stationary phase [

In a similar fashion, a protein, which is related to the transferase activity, has been declined in the stationary phase, since it is known that the transferase activity is needed for maintaining energy inside the bacterial cell, which is again less necessary during this growth phase [

 <italic>E. coli</italic>, which are proteins associated with energy metabolism and phosphotransferase proteins are down-regulated through the stationary growth phase relative to the exponential growth phase [

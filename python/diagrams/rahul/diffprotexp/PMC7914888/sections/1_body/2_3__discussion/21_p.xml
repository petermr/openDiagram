<p>Coordinated and reciprocal miRNA expression changes may explain changes in melanoma phenotypes induced by L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU. miR-211-5p is overexpressed in the hyperpigmented phenotype and downward in the hypopigmented phenotype, without ignoring other miRNAs’ possible participation such as miR-470-5p miR-148-3p, miR-30d-5p, and miR-27b-3p, which have 
 <italic>Mitf</italic>, 
 <italic>Tyr</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tyrp1</italic> as potential molecular targets. It was striking that exposure to L-Tyr did not affect the expression levels of the gene and protein of MITF, the master regulator of the expression of TYR, TYRP1, and DCT, but for the levels of 
 <italic>Tyr</italic> mRNA, an increase with statistical significance. These results suggest an additional regulation to the transcription factor, possibly involving miR-211-5p, as has already been reported in other models [

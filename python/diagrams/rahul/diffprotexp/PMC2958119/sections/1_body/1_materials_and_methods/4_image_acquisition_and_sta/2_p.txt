0: In order to accurately compare spot quantities of the two samples, the volume of each protein spot was normalized and automatically calculated by the software as a single spot volume.
1: After normalization and background subtraction, the matched sets were created for all the samples.
2: A quantitative table with all the normalized optical spot volumes was generated in this software for subsequent statistic analysis.
3: Analysis of variance (ANOVA, Version 6.12, SAS Institute), Duncan parametric test, was employed to test the statistic significance of the differentially expressed proteins (2 fold changes) in all gels.
4: A probability of  p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

<p id="Par28">To further investigate the intrinsic differences in immunity between VTE and normal samples, we performed a bayes test on GSE19151 gene chip data, and obtained a total of 88 DEGs (VTE group/normal control group), of which 77 were upregulated and 11 were downregulated. The expression of the differential genes in the two groups is shown in Fig.

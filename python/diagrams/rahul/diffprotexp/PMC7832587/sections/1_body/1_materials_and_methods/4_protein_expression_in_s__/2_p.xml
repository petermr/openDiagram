<p>For large-scale cultures used for membrane fractionation, the first pre-culture was diluted to a OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.1 in 50 mL of S6A media and incubated at 28°C for another 24 h. Then, this second pre-culture was diluted to an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.05 in 500 mL of YPGE2X media. The cells were grown for 36 h at 28°C to consume the majority of glucose. The culture flasks were cooled down to 18°C, and 2% (w/v) of galactose were added to induce protein expression. After 13 h at 18°C, a second addition of 2% (w/v) galactose was done and the culture was left for five more hours. The cells were centrifuged at 4000 
 <italic>× g</italic> during 10 min at 4°C and washed two times with cold water. The cell-pellet was weighted and re-suspended in 2 mL of cold TEKS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M KCl and 0.6 M sorbitol) per gram of cells. After incubation at 4°C for 15 min, the cells were centrifuged and the resulting pellet was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.

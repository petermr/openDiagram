<p>One of the most striking effects of this study, which was initially identified through an unbiased quantitative analysis approach, is the pronounced localization of GluN2B to the medial SDH in male rats. This finding is consistent with cytoarchitectural and functional studies on juvenile rodents demonstrating dendritic asymmetry and enhanced NMDAR-dependent evoked excitability in the medial compared to lateral SDH [

 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] results that differential neuronal circuits exist throughout the SDH and are devoted to specific aspects of sensory integration and processing. A critical experimental implication of our mediolateral GluN2B expression findings is that researchers should take careful note of where along the mediolateral axis they are studying and recording from when investigating the physiological and molecular properties of SDH neurons. From our results here and those of many other research groups, it is clear that the SDH does not consist of homogenous repeating neuronal circuits throughout its axes. Future research is needed to uncover the molecular underpinnings of these differences, especially given the large clinical implications of differences within these nociceptive circuits between males and females.

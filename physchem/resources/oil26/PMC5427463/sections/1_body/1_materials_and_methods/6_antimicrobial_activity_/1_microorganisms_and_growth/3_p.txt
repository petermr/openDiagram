0: The indicator organisms (bacteria) were grown in 3 mL LB broth overnight at 37 C. For the test, final inoculum concentrations of 10 6 CFU/mL were used.
1: Fungal spore suspensions were collected from the surface of such fungal colonies by gently scraping with a loop and suspended in 3 mL Potato Dextrose broth (PDB).
2: This suspension was mixed vigorously by vortexing for 15-20 min.
3: The spore suspension stock was diluted to obtain a concentration of 10 6 spores/mL (measured by Malassez blade).

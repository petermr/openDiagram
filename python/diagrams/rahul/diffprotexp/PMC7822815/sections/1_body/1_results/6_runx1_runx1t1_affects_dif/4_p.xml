<p id="Par32">We further examined the functionality of this element by targeting an endonuclease-deficient dCas9-KRAB repressor to a site 200 bp upstream of TSS3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). Expression of dCas9-KRAB was induced by addition of doxycycline to the medium. When compared to mismatch siRNA-treated Kasumi-1 cells, knockdown of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 caused twentyfold increased expression of 
 <italic>PARL-03</italic> without significantly affecting canonical 
 <italic>PARL-01</italic> levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>). Induction of dCas9-KRAB did not affect 
 <italic>PARL-01</italic> expression with 0.98 and 1.01fold changes for siMM and siRR-treated cells, respectively. However, dCas9-KRAB induction significantly reduced the induction of 
 <italic>PARL-03</italic> transcription that was caused by RUNX1/RUNX1T1 loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>). These findings confirm that transcription of 
 <italic>PARL-03</italic> is regulated by a promoter located 6.6 kb in canonical intron 1 and further supports the notion that binding of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 to this element represses its transcription-activating potential.

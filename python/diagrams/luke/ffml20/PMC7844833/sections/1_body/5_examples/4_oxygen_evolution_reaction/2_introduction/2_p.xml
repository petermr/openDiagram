<p>The oxygen evolution reaction is at the heart and is often the limiting step of promising enabling technologies such as the electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production, rechargeable metal-air batteries and reversible fuel cells that can resurge the fuel through electrocatalysis.

 </sup> The electrochemical formation of molecular oxygen is a sluggish 4-electron process which requires an efficient electrocatalyst. Importantly, OER is strongly pH-dependent, and therefore, it proceeds differently in alkaline and acidic electrolytes, and different catalysts may be needed for the different conditions.

<p>ETS proteins are present in metazoan lineages [
 <xref rid="B1-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and play a role in diverse biological processes. Intriguingly, ETS proteins also exhibit extensive overlaps in their tissue expression profiles, with many members of this superfamily having ubiquitous expression [
 <xref rid="B2-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Not surprisingly, members of this family also tend to exhibit overlapping and sometimes redundant DNA binding, as analyzed by genome-wide occupancy and other assays [
 <xref rid="B3-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

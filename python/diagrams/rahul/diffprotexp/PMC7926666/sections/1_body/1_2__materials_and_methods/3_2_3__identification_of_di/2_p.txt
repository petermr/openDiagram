0: DIPs, the proteins having differential interactions, were classified into two groups according to their interaction patterns: (i) DIPs having repressed interactions under tumor condition, and (ii) DIPs having activated interactions under tumor condition.
1: DIPs that were specific to the RCC subtypes and were common in all subtypes were detected for further analyses.
2: The networks consisting of dPPIs and DIPs were visualized through the Cytoscape 3.4.0 [ 13].

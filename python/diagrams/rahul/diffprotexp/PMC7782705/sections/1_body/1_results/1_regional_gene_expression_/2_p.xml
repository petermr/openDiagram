 </sup>, we decided to focus only on DEGs replicated in at least two independent datasets obtained from related brain areas. This resulted in a set of 734 DEGs detected in both Mayo and MSBB TL (temporal lobe intersection—TLI), and 31 DEGs shared between ROSMAP and MSBB FL (frontal lobe intersection—FLI) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Among TLI DEGs, we observed ABCA1 and 2 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 and 2), primarily involved in the maintenance of normal brain homeostasis and associated with AD and other neurological diseases

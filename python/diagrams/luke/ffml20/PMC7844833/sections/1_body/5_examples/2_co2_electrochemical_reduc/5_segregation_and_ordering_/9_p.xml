<p>Overall, the changes of the interatomic distances can have a significant impact on the catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts. As discussed in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref319">319</xref>), the expansion of Cuâ€“Cu distances may result in suppressed HER and, hence, higher selectivity for CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR (
 <xref rid="fig30" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig30" ref-type="fig">30</xref>
 </xref>a). From this viewpoint, the segregation of Cu to the surface of smaller alloy NPs, as observed, for example, in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref319">319</xref>) for CuCo NPs from XPS and 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS analysis, is not beneficial for CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR, because it often results in contracted, rather than expanded Cu-M distances due to surface tension effects. On the other hand, random mixing of Cu with, for example, Zn, as we discuss in the next example, can be helpful due to the expanded lattice constant in the CuZn brass alloy with respect to that of pure Cu.

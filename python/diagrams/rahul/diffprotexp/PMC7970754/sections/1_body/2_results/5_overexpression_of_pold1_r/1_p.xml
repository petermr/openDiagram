<p>To further verify whether POLD1 is an intermediary for RSV in the treatment of TNBC, a rescue experiment of POLD1 overexpression (OE) was performed. The results of the POLD1 lentivirus-transfected cells showed that the transfection efficiency was over 90% (×100-fold) (

 </xref>). WB and qRT-PCR showed that the expression of POLD1 protein (nearly 2 times) and mRNA (about 25 times) in POLD1-OE group were highly expressed (

 </xref>). In addition, the proteins after RSV treated MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 h were extracted, and protein was detected in expression levels of POLD1, PARP1, Cleaved-PARP1, PCNA, BCL-2, Cleaved-Caspase3, and other proteins using WB. Accordingly, the results demonstrated that the protein expression level of POLD1 in the RSV + POLD1-OE group was significantly higher than that in the RSV group (P&lt;0.01), and the expression level of BCL-2 (P&lt;0.05) was also significantly higher than that in the RSV group (

 </xref>). However, the expression of Cleaved-PARP1 (P&lt;0.01) and Cleaved-Caspase3 (P&lt;0.05) was significantly lower. Although the expression of full length PARP1 decreased, the ratio of Cleaved-PARP1/full length PARP1 (P&lt;0.01) decreased significantly. Overexpression of POLD1 and RSV treatment can synergistically lead to a further reduction in PARP1 expression, however, POLD1 overexpression can reduce the ratio of Cleaved-PARP1/full length PARP1, indicating apoptosis. CCK8 showed (

 </xref>) that RSV could significantly promote MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis, while POLD1 overexpression could slightly increase the proliferation ability of MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, overexpression of POLD1 could significantly reduce RSV’s pro-apoptotic effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. At the same time, flow cytometry demonstrated (

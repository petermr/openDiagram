0: In order to investigate the effects of Se in different chemical forms on the protein expression to Caco-2 cells, sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se were prepared at 100 nmol L -1.
1: Before Se exposure, three forms of selenium sources were all diluted to the required concentration by HBSS.
2: After washing, the Caco-2 cells three times by HBSS, the cells were incubated with HBSS containing 100 nmol L -1 of Se in different forms (or only HBSS as control) for 2 h at 37C in cell incubator.
3: Two hours later, the cells were washed with HBSS triple and collected into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.
4: Then, the electrophoresis cell lysis solution was added to the Eppendorf tube, and the Eppendorf tubes were oscillated about 1 h to ensure the lysis sufficiently.
5: Then, the ultracentrifuge was used to centrifuge the solution for 1 h at 4C, 40,000   g, and the liquid supernatant was collected and stored at -80C.
6: Protein quantification was performed using the commercial protein assay kit with BSA as the standard (Jiancheng Biotechnology Co., Nanjing, China).

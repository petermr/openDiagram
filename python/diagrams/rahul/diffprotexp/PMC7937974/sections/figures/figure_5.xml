  <p>Oxidative phosphorylation was involved in the expression of E-selectin and monocyte–endothelial cell interaction. 
   <bold>(A–E)</bold> Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were treated with medium containing 15% sera from Kawasaki disease without coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL–; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) and Kawasaki disease with coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL+; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) subjects plus oligomycin (50 μg/ml) or DMSO (same volume) for 4 h. The E-selectin mRNA levels were measured by qPCR 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, and protein levels were measured by Western blot 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Statistical analysis of immunoblots. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from KD-CAL– (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) and KD-CAL+ (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) subjects plus oligomycin (50 μg/ml) or DMSO (same volume) for 4 h then co-incubated with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM)-labeled THP-1 cells for 1 h. Representative images used quantification of THP-1 cells (green) attached to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Quantitative analysis of adherent THP-1 cells lysate fluorescence at 490-nm excitation and 530-nm emission. All samples were normalized to HCAECs with CAL serum treatment. The bar graphs are mean ± SEM.

0: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction initiated by an imbalance in the systemic inflammatory response to infection ( 1).
1: Over the past few decades, numerous medical studies have proposed several definitions for sepsis, such as septicemia, sepsis, toxemia, bacteremia, endotoxemia, and so on ( 2).
2: Sepsis is characterized by a general pro-inflammatory cascade that causes extensive tissue damages, which includes severe clinical spectrums, such as septic shock as well as multiple organ failures ( 3).
3: Sepsis can be initiated by bacteria, fungi, as well as viruses, without specific treatment ( 4).
4: In this case, the diagnosis of sepsis is particularly difficult because these patients have multiple comorbidities and underlying diseases ( 5).
5: Sepsis is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide, which is estimated as 60% for children under 5 ( 6).
6: A US cohort study indicated a significant increase for the annual incidence of severe pediatric sepsis ( 7).

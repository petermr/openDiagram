0: Analysis of the sequencing data and differential gene expression was performed by UC Davis Bioinformatics Core.
1: Differential expression analyses were conducted using limma-voom [ 22].
2: The model fitted included effects for sample type, treatment, the interaction between sample type and treatment, sequencing pool, and RNA isolation date.
3: Standard errors of log fold changes were adjusted for within-animal correlations.
4: Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the whole transcriptome was conducted using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as implemented in the Bioconductor package topGO, version 2.30.1 [ 23].
5: KEGG pathway [ 24] enrichment analysis was conducted using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with KEGG pathway annotation obtained using the Bioconductor package KEGGREST, version 1.18.1 ( https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/KEGGREST/man/KEGGREST.pdf).
6: Bos taurus Ensembl gene identifiers and annotations were used in this study [ 25].

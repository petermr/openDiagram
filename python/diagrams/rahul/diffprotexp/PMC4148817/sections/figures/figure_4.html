 <caption> Overlap of the changes in protein abundance in common Biological Functions after 24 h exposure to a low concentration (100 ng/mL) of MWCNT or SWCNT. The numbers of proteins that are altered in response to low dose carbon nanotube exposure within defined biological functions are listed. The Venn diagrams show the number of proteins with shared identity altered in response to both MWCNT and SWCNT. </caption>

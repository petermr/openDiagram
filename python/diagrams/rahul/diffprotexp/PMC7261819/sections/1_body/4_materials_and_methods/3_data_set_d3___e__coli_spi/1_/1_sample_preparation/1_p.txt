0: One MCF-7 and one  E. coli K-12 cell pellet were lysed and sonicated in a buffer containing 4% SDS, 25 m m HEPES pH 7.6 and 1 m m DTT.
1: Total protein amount was estimated (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad, Hercules, California).
2: Samples with different spiked in amounts of  E. coli protein extract (3 replicates with 7.5 g, 4 with 15 g and 3 with 45 ug) in MCF-7 background (70 g of protein extract) were prepared.
3: Protein digestion (LysC and trypsin, sequencing grade modified, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) was performed using a modified SP3-protocol ( 20).
4: In brief, each sample was reduced with 1 m m DTT and alkylated with 40 m m Chloroacetamide.
5: Sera-Mag SP3 bead mix (20 l) was transferred into the protein sample together with 100% Acetonitrile to a final concentration of 70%.
6: The mix was incubated under rotation at room temperature for 18 min.
7: The mix was placed on the magnetic rack and the supernatant was discarded, followed by two washes with 70% ethanol and one with 100% acetonitrile.
8: The beads-protein mixture was reconstituted in 100 l LysC buffer (0.5  m Urea, 50 m m HEPES pH: 7.6 and 1:50 enzyme (LysC) to protein ratio) and incubated O/N.
9: Finally, trypsin was added in 1:50 enzyme to protein ratio in 100 l 50 m m HEPES pH 7.6 and incubated O/N.
10: The peptides were eluted from the mixture after placing the mixture on a magnetic rack, followed by peptide concentration measurement (Bio-Rad DC Assay).
11: Before labeling, samples were pH adjusted using TEAB pH 8.5 (50 m m final concentration).
12: Thirty-five micrograms of each sample were labeled with an isobaric TMT-tag (Thermo Scientific).
13: Labeling efficiency was determined by LC-MS/MS before pooling of samples.
14: Sample clean-up was performed by solid phase extraction (SPE strata-X-C, Phenomenex, Torrance, California).
15: Purified samples were dried in a SpeedVac.

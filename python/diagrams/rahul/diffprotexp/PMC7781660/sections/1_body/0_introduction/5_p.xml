<p>Here, Illumina sequencing was employed to explore the different expression profiles of lncRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells for further investigating the roles of lncRNAs in BVDV infection and host–BVDV interaction. The potential functions of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted by lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, which would provide a molecular biology basis for further understanding the roles of lncRNAs in host–BVDV interaction.</p>

<p>The sponge 
 <italic>Tedaniophorbas ceratosis</italic> (20 g, wet weight) was chopped into small pieces and exhaustively extracted with MeOH (6 Ã— 200 mL) in an ultrasonic bath (20 min. per extraction) to afford a yellow brown residue (0.892 g). This extract was then separated by reversed phase C
 <sub>18</sub> HPLC gradient elution from H
 <sub>2</sub>O to MeOH (containing 1% TFA) over 60 min. and then eluted with MeOH (containing 1% TFA) for 10 min. to afford 70 fractions. Fractions 17 and 18 contained tedaniophorbasin A 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyltryptamine, which were subsequently separated by recrystallization from MeOH. Tedaniophorbasin A (
 <bold>1</bold>) was crystallized from the solution to leave 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyltryptamine in the supernatant. Fraction 20 eluting with 66% H
 <sub>2</sub>O/34% MeOH yielded pure 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyltryptamine, and fraction 27 eluting with 55% H
 <sub>2</sub>O/45% MeOH (all containing 1% TFA) yielded pure tedaniophorbasin B (
 <bold>2</bold>).

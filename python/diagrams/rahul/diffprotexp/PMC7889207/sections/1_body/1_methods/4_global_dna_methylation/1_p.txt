0: Global DNA methylation was analysed using the Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification kit (MDQ1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions, as previously described [ 15].
1: Briefly, 100 ng genomic DNA was bound to the ELISA plate, after which the methylated DNA fraction was detected using a 5-methylcytosine monoclonal antibody and the absorbance was measured on a SpectraMax i3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm.
2: The percent global DNA methylation was calculated relative to the methylated DNA control, which was included in the kit.
3: All samples were analysed in duplicate.

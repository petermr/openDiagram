<sup>4</sup> cells/well and grown for 36&#8201;h and then subjected with essential oil at concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000&#8201;&#956;g/mL. After treatments, MTT (0.5&#8201;mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for 2&#8201;h at 37&#8201;&#176;C and the formed formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO, and then the percentage of cell viability was calculated. For LDH release assay, the SH-SY5Y cells were plated at a density of 5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10

<p>In this study, 86 differentially expressed proteins were identified in perfusates from isolated livers metastasized by Walker-256 tumor cells. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed proteins via IPA showed that liver-associated immune function was suppressed by the metastasis of these cells. Proteins associated with liver metastasis were identified in perfusates. Ywhab was among these proteins, and its differential expression in plasma was further validated by Western blotting. The results shown in this study demonstrate the value of utilizing liver perfusates in biomarker discovery for liver diseases.</p>

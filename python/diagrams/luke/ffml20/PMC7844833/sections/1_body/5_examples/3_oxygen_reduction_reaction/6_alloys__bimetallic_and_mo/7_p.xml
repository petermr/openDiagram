<p>For example, Pt monolayer-coated PdAu nanowires were studied in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref341">341</xref>), and the insight from EXAFS data analysis was used to differentiate between different possible structural models and distributions of the metals. Pt atoms were found to be predominantly surrounded by Pt or Au, which allowed the authors to conclude that Pt atoms are located predominantly on the surfaces of the nanowires. More surprisingly, it was found that the coordination numbers for both Au–Au/Pt and Au–Pd atomic pairs were quite close to 6, despite the fact that the investigated particles were Pd-rich (a much larger Au–Pd CN is expected if the metals are uniformly mixed). This finding indicated that the Au atoms were also localized next to the surface, either directly underneath the Pt layer, or were mixed with Pt forming a PtAu shell on top of the Pd core. Such complex architecture was confirmed by DFT simulations. Notably, the segregation of Au to the nanowire surface in this case took place during the synthesis and pretreatment, and not during the ORR reaction itself.

 </sup> In contrast, a reversible, potential-dependent exchange process involving Pd migrating between the core and the shell, within Pd–Au alloy (Pd-rich) NPs, was mentioned by Jirkovský et al. in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref500">500</xref>). At potentials below 0.8 V versus RHE, the surface tended to be Au-rich, whereas at higher potentials (&gt;1.0 V vs RHE) the surface was found to be Pd-rich.

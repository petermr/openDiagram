<p id="Par36">Furthermore, DE target genes like 
 <italic>STMN1</italic> is a highly conserved gene that codes for cytoplasmic phosphoproteins, acting role in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and cell migration through diverse intracellular signaling pathways. Studies have found the potential role of STMN1 in regulation of hormone secretion in rodent pituitary and insulinoma cell lines [

 <italic>RAG2</italic> is indispensable for generation of antigen receptor diversity in immune cells [

 <italic>STMN1</italic>,

 </sup> sheep and enriched in hippo signaling term. As known that 
 <italic>DLG4</italic> encodes a member of MAGUK family, is widely expressed and playing an essential role in regulation of cellular signal transduction, circadian entrainment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Taken together, the DE lncRNAs identified in this study might cooperate with their target genes and DE genes to regulate pineal gland physiological function, and involved in hormone synthesis for effecting reproductive cycle and final lambing.

0: The protein supernatant from above was directly added to a 30 K spin filter and mixed with 200 L of 8 M urea in Tris-HCl and centrifuged at 14000  g for 15 min.
1: The concentrate was diluted with 200 L of urea solution and centrifuged at 14000  g for 15 min.
2: Then, 10 L of 10 X IAA in urea solution was added to the concentrate in the filter and vortexed for 1 min.
3: The spin filter was incubated for 20 min at RT in the dark followed by centrifugation at 14000  g for 10 min.
4: To the concentrate on the filter, 100 L of urea solution was added and centrifuged at 14000  g for 15 min then repeated 2X.
5: There was 100 L of 100 mM ABC solution added to the spin filter and centrifuged at 14000  g for 10 min then repeated 2X.
6: Then, 0.1 g/L of LysC was added 1:100 and incubated O/N at 30 C. Following incubation, 40 L of 100 mM ABC solution was added and centrifuged at 14000  g for 10 min and repeated 1X to increase peptide yield.
7: Finally, 50 L of 0.5 M NaCl solution was added to the spin filter and centrifuged at 14000 x g for 10 min.

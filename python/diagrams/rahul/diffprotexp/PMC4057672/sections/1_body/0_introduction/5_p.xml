<p>In this study, proteomic technique was used to explore the mechanism of ricin aerosol exposure-induced lung injury in mice. So far, there are only limited studies reported on the toxicology of inhaled ricin. Since there is no effective drug or clinically approved vaccine for ricin poisoning, a better understanding of the mechanism of the ricin toxicity can offer new directions to develop new treatments for the respiratory poisoning caused by ricin aerosol.</p>

<p id="Par29">To clarify the mediating roles of miR-3653-3p in circ_0003865-regulated BMSC osteogenic differentiation, we then transfected human BMSCs with the combination of circ_0003865 siRNAs (si-CIRC) and miR-3653-3p inhibitors (miR-3653-3p In). We found that miR-3653-3p inhibitors significantly reduced the expression of miR-3653-3p in si-CIRC+miR-3653-3p In group compared with the si-CIRC group. There is also a significant decrease of ALP, RUNX2, and OPN and increases in GAS1 expression in si-CIRC+miR-3653-3p In group compared with the si-CIRC group. No differences were observed in circ_0003865 expression in si-CIRC+miR-3653-3p In compared with the si-CIRC group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Additionally, ALP, RUNX2, and OPN protein levels in BMSCs transfected with circ_0003865 siRNAs were significantly reduced by miR-3653-3p inhibitors and accompanied by an increase of GAS1 protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). Furthermore, the proliferation had no significant change after circ_0003865 siRNA and miR-3653-3p inhibitor treatment compared to circ_0003865 siRNA treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). And the in-site expression of ALP in BMSCs transfected with circ_0003865 siRNAs was repressed by miR-3653-3p inhibitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). Consistently, the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs transfected with circ_0003865 siRNAs was significantly suppressed by miR-3653-3p inhibitors as well (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e). These results indicate that miR-3653-3p reverses circ_0003865-induced alterations of GAS1 expression and BMSC osteogenic differentiation.

<p>IBM SPSS Statistics software was used for statistical analysis. To assess the normality of the data, Shapiro-Wilk tests were performed. As appropriate, T-tests and one-way ANOVA tests for paired or independent samples were performed to test for significant differences between groups. The results are presented as average ± standard error of the mean (SEM). P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

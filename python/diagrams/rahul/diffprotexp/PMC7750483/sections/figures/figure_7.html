 <caption> GO and network analysis of proteins in two important pathways. (A) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the m 5C RNA methylation modification was analyzed via DAVID. GO contains biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions. In this picture, count represents the number of genes contained in the GO term. The count and P values were considered together to obtain important metabolic process. Three important metabolic processes are affected by m 5C RNA methylation, including protein binding, cytosol, and signal transduction. (B) Multicenter protein–protein interaction (PPI) network between m 5C regulatory proteins and differential proteins in the ErbB and PI3K–Akt pathways in the STRING database. </caption>

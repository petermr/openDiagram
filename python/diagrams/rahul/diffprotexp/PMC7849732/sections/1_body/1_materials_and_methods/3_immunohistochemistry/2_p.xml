<p>We applied a modified immunohistochemistry technique based on pepsin treatment to unmask and retrieve the antigen. The pre-treatment of the sections with pepsin allows the detection of the GluN2 subunits, including the subunits localized at synapses. Pepsin exposes the epitope of cross-linked proteins, such as those at postsynaptic densities, and facilitates the binding of the antibody to the target [

Therefore, after incubation in a peroxidase solution (50% methanol, 1.8% hydrogen peroxide in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT), we treated the slides with pre-warmed pepsin at 37°C for 5 minutes. Immediately after, the sections were washed 3 times (x 5 min) with PBS. The sections were incubated with a blocking solution containing 5% NGS, 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.3% BSA (in PBS) for 1 h. This step was followed by incubation with a mixture of primary antibodies (see below and

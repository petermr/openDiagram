0: Blood samples from 33 COVID-19 patients without any complications were collected at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 19th February 2020 to 17th March 2020.
1: A flowchart of sample preprocessing for this study is shown in Fig.
2: 1a.
3: Demographics and baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients are shown in Additional file  1: Table S1.
4: The mean age of the COVID-19 patients was 50.0 years old (standard deviation = 11.9), and the male:female ratio is 1.06:1.
5: All patients were diagnosed in accordance with the guidelines for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment (Trial Version 7) released by the National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China.
6: Selected patients were classified into two groups, including severely and critically ill.

8: The severe state was defined with at least one of the following criteria: respiratory rate  30 times/min; arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2)  300 mmHg; oxygen saturation  93% at resting state; and pulmonary imaging inspection showing significant injury progression by > 50% within 2448 h. The definition of disease severity was consistent with previous study [ 20].
9: The exclusion criteria of comorbidities included hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, surgical history, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, immunodeficiency disease, chronic hepatitis, and tuberculosis.

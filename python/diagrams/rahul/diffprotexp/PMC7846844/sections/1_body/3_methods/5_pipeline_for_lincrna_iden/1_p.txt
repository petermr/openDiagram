0: 361 lincRNAs were screened based on established pipelines in our laboratory 8.
1: The complete pipeline follows the one shown in Fig.
2: 1A.
3: Step 1, Transcripts representing intergenic transcripts classified as "U" were screened using the gffcompare program Stringtie (version1.2.2).
4: Step 2, based on the transcript characteristics of lincRNA, transcripts with transcript lengths greater than 200 bp and exon numbers greater than 2 were screened.
5: Step 3, the coding potential of lincRNAs were verified using a coding potential calculator (Cpc) tool 58, and the lincRNAs with Cpc value < 0 was entered into the downstream screening program.
6: Step 4, to improve the accuracy of lincRNA screening, we predicted the coding potential of transcripts from multiple perspectives.
7: We translated the transcript into six possible protein sequences, which were then transcribed and compared to the Pfam database.
8: Finally, no Pfam hit (E value < 1e5) transcripts are retained.
9: Step 5, Transcripts were aligned with NCBI NR and UniRef90 databases using the Blastx program, and transcripts of similar proteins in known proteins were filtered (E value < 1e-5).
10: Step 6, to minimize the chance of false positives, transcripts that were not expressed (FPKM values) in all samples were removed.

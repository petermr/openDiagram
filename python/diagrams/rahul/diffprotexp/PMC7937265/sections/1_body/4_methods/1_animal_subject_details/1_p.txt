0: Male and female zebra finches from our breeding colony at the University of Georgia were randomly assigned in breeding pairs.
1: Pairs were individually housed in standard cages (43  43  38 cm) with a light dark cycle of 14:10 h. They received two perches, a nest-box, and burlap ribbon as nesting material.
2: They were provided with a mixed seed diet, water, and cuttlebone ad libitum.
3: Food and water were checked and refreshed daily.
4: Offspring were reared in the parental cage until their sexually dimorphic adult plumage was visible (~ 50 days post-hatch), at which point they were placed in same-sex flocks in standard cages.
5: This study was approved by the University of Georgias Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP #A2014-03-014-Y2-A0).

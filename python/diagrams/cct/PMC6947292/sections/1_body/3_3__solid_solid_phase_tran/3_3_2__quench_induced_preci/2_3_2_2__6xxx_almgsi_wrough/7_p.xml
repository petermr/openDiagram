<p>As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f031">Figure 31</xref>, the two laboratory alloys Al0.6Mg0.8Si and Al0.8Mg0.6Si form an exception in terms of their UCCR: they have much lower values compared to commercial alloys with comparable Mg and Si contents. This is due to the substantially lower concentration of nucleation sites for quench-induced precipitation, as demonstrated below.

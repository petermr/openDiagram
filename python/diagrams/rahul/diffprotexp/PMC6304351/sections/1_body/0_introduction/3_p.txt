0: Given the importance of  Thalassolituus in the attenuation of marine oil pollution, the type strain ( T. oleivorans MIL-1 DSM 14913 T) was genome sequenced ( Golyshin et al., 2013).
1: T. oleivorans has a strong biotechnological potential to be used for bioremediation of marine oil spills due to its high affinity for alkanes, autochthonous marine origin, and critical role in natural cleansing of marine systems.
2: Compared to some physicochemical methods currently used, bioremediation is considered a safer, more efficient and cost-effective alternative for the removal of oil contaminants in the environment ( Liu et al., 2011).

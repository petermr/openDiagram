<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The quantification studies were performed on a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph (model GC-2010 Plus, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column DB-1 dimethylpolysiloxane (30mx 0.25 mm, 0.25 micron), and a flame ionization detector was used to analyze the samples.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The carrier gas was N<sub>2</sub> with a flow of 1.3 ml/min., split 1:100, injector temperature 260&#176;C, detector temperature 280&#176;C, initial column temperature equal to 60&#186;C heated at a rate of 10&#176;C. min<sup>-1</sup> up to 92&#186;C for 3 minutes, followed by a heating rate of 10&#176;C/min up to 120&#176;C and a rate of 20&#176;C/min up to 280&#176;C. The injection volume was 1.0 &#956;l. The calibration curve from a commercial sample of carvacrol [Sigma-Aldrich, Chicago, IL, USA] was obtained by recording the peak areas against the known injected amount contained in the same injected volume (1 ml). The analysis was performed in triplicate.</p>

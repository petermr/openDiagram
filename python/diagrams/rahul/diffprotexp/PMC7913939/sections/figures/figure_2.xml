  <p>Western blot and densitometric analysis of MCT1 and PrP
   <sup>c</sup> expression in the cortex of 9-month-old WT and 
   <italic>Prnp
    <sup>−/−</sup>
   </italic> mice. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Homogenates prepared from cortex were examined for MCT1 and PrP
   <sup>c</sup> expression by Western blotting. All brain homogenates of WT mice exhibited PrP
   <sup>c</sup> expression (diglycosylated at 35 kDa, monoglycosylated at 33 kDa and unglycosylated at 26 kDa), whereas 
   <italic>Prnp
    <sup>−/−</sup>
   </italic> mice blots confirmed the absence of PrP
   <sup>c</sup>. An equal protein load (20 µg per lane) is shown by GAPDH expression. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Densitometric quantification of band intensities via 
   <italic>Image Lab 6.0.1</italic> revealed a higher protein expression of MCT1 in WT as compared to 
   <italic>Prnp
    <sup>−/−</sup>
   </italic> mice. The analyses were performed on 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 animals per group in three different Western blots. Displayed are means ± SEM. A 
   <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 is considered as very significant (**).

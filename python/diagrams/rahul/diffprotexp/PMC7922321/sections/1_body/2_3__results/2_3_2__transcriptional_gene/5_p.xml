<p>Similar comparative analysis using KEGG pathway enrichment showed that, unlike the GO biological processes analyzed above, distinct signaling pathways were regulated by each ETS regulon, while a positively regulated cluster of the ETV4 regulon was enriched for the MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, and a negatively regulated cluster of this protein was enriched for endocytosis and the synaptic vesicle cycle (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jpm-11-00138">Supplementary Tables S6 and S7</xref>); the positively regulated cluster of ELK1 was enriched for cholinergic and dopaminergic synapses, as well as calcium signaling, while its negatively regulated cluster was enriched Hippo signaling, signaling of pluripotent stem cells, and cell cycle (

0: Plants producing essential oils represent a large part of natural flora and an important resource in various fields such as the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries, thanks to their flavour, fragrance, and biological activities [ 1].
1: Essential oils are a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons arising from the isoprenoid pathways and secreted by glandular trichomes disseminated mainly onto the surface of plant organs; therefore, they have a pivotal role in the growth and colonization of plants, conferring colour and scent to reproductive organs, attracting pollinators and favouring seed dispersal [ 2].
2: Furthermore, they seem to mediate the plant relationship with abiotic (e.g., light, temperature, and so on) and biotic factors, playing a defensive role against herbivores, harmful insects, and microbial pathogens [ 2].

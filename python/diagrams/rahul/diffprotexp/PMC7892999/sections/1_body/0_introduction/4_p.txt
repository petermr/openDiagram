0: Non-coding RNAs with a length higher than 200 nucleotides are defined as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).
1: They were originally considered to be transcriptional byproducts, or transcriptional noise, and were often dismissed in transcriptome analyses due to their low expression and low sequence conservation compared with protein-coding mRNAs.
2: However, specific lncRNAs were shown to be involved in chromatin modification, epigenetic regulation, genomic imprinting, transcriptional control as well as pre- and post-translational mRNA processing in diverse biological processes in plants 27  30.
3: Certain lncRNAs can be precursors of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNAs), triggering the repression of protein-coding genes at the transcription level (transcriptional gene silencing or TGS) or at post-transcriptional level (PTGS) 27,  31.
4: Additionally, other lncRNAs can act as endogenous target mimics of miRNAs, to fine-tune the miRNA-dependent regulation of target genes 32,  33.
5: It has been suggested that lncRNAs can regulate gene expression in both the  cis- and  trans-acting mode 35.
6: The  cis-acting lncRNAs can be classified by their relative position to annotated genes 27,  34,  35 and notably include long noncoding natural antisense (lncNATs) transcribed in opposite strand of a coding gene, overlapping with at least one of its exons 36,  37.
7: Other so-called intronic lncRNAs are transcribed within introns of a protein-coding gene 38 whereas long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are transcripts located farther than 1 kb from protein-coding genes 27,  34,  35.
8: Among these  cis-lncRNAs, NATs are of special interest as they have been shown to provide a mechanism for locally regulating the transcription or translation of the target gene on the other strand, providing novel mechanisms involved in the regulation of key biological processes 39, plant development 40 and environmentally dependent gene expression 36,  37.

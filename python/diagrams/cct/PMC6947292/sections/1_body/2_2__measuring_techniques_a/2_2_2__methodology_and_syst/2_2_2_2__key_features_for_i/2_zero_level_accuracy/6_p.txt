0: Even if all of the abovementioned aspects are ensured, the zero level of the resulting specific excess heat capacity may still show a slight curvature, and this is slightly different for each experiment [ 75].
1: This may be caused by slight differences in the sample position for each individual measurement, for instance [ 125].
2: Thus, the raw DSC data must undergo a sophisticated data treatment prior to evaluation, including baseline subtraction in each case, and possibly also the elimination of the remaining zero-level curvature [ 120] or a mean value curve calculation [ 122, 123, 127].
3: If efforts are made to ensure the best zero level quality, a result that is straight and close to zero can be achieved.
4: In heating experiments, this allows us to judge whether exo- or endothermic reactions predominate at a certain temperature or time [ 75, 120].
5: In addition, the zero level can act as an integration reference for enthalpy calculations [ 75, 120, 121].

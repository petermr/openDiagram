 <caption> Effects of inadequate or adequate sample packing in a CALVET-type heat flux differential scanning calorimeter under otherwise very similar experimental conditions: ( A) heat flow of sample (HF S) and baseline (HF BL) measurements without sample packing showing substantially different heat flow in regions without phase transformations; ( B) if the samples are packed properly HF S and HF BL are very similar in reaction-free temperature regions, i.e., subtracting HF BL from HF S results in a nearly straight zero-level. </caption>

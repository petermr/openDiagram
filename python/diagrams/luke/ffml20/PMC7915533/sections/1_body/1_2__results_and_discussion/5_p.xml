<p>The degree of unsaturation derived from the molecular formula required two additional sp
 <sup>2</sup> nitrogen atoms to be present in the molecule. These atoms could only logically be placed between the pyrimidine and thiomorpholine partial structures, and six alternative structures (two pyrazine (
 <bold>1a</bold>/
 <bold>1a′</bold>) and four pyridazines (
 <bold>1b</bold>/
 <bold>1b′</bold> and 
 <bold>1c</bold>/
 <bold>1c′</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-19-00095-f003">Figure 3</xref>)) could be proposed, with three pairs of regioisomers about the thiomorpholino moiety being possible. Based on the observed chemical shifts, the four pyridazine structures were rejected. In the two pyridazine structures containing a C-C bond between C-4a and the thiomorpholine (structures 
 <bold>1b</bold>/
 <bold>1b′</bold>), C-4a is predicted to be shielded and resonate at ~ δ
 <sub>C</sub> 110 and C-10a deshielded, resonating at ~δ
 <sub>C</sub> 160, while in the two pyridazine structures with a C-C bond between C-10a and the thiomorpholino moiety (structures 
 <bold>1c</bold>/
 <bold>1c′</bold>), C-4a and C-10a would both resonate at ~δ
 <sub>C</sub> 135 [

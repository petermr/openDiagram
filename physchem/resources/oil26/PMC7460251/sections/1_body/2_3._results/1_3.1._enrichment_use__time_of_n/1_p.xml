<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Based on scan data, the aardvarks spent significantly more time investigating the foraging enrichment (mean &#177; SE: 19.14 &#177; 2.24% of time) compared to the exploring enrichment (2.60 &#177; 0.31% of time; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01433">Figure S1</xref>), but patterns of enrichment use were significantly influenced by time of night (F<sub>2,664</sub> = 85.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01433-f001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01433">Tables S1 and S2</xref>). Event counts for using foraging and exploring enrichment also had a significant interaction between stated enrichment goal and time of night (F<sub>2,664</sub> = 32.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Use of items from both stated enrichment goals decreased throughout the night. Foraging enrichment was used the most during PM observations (55.31 &#177; 7.08% of time) compared to exploring enrichment (4.58 &#177; 1.02% of time). During MID observations, use of enrichment was similar between the two enrichment goals (foraging: 1.56 &#177; 0.57% of time; exploring: 1.56 &#177; 0.06% of time), but during AM observations, exploring (1.65 &#177; 0.63% of time) was used more than the foraging (0.55 &#177; 0.29% of time) enrichment. Rates of enrichment use followed a similar pattern. Time spent using and event counts for using the individual items also varied significantly among the three time periods (F<sub>12,649</sub> = 14.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and F<sub>12,649</sub> = 7.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01433-f002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01433">Tables S3 and S4</xref>). </p>

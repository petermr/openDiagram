0: B16F1 cells exposed or not to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2-dU were seeded in a sterile 96-well culture box (Corning, NY, USA); after 10-12 h of incubation, the medium was removed and incubated again for 1h at 37 C with 0.83 mg.mL 1 of MTT (3 (4.5 dimethylthiazol) 2.5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
1: We removed the MTT excess MTT, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Merck, Branchburg, NJ, USA) to help to dissolve the formazan crystals.
2: The wells were read at 560 nm on a GloMax -Multi Detection System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturers specifications.
3: To determine the diluted formazan crystals proportionality with the number of viable cells, we constructed a calibration curve using six serials 1:2 dilutions from 8.0 * 10 4 cells.
4: Each well-read read under the same conditions.
5: We assessed population doubling time following the reported protocol [ 109].

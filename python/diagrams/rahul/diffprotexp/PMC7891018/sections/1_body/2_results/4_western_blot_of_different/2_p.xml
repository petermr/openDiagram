<p id="Par38">ECHS1 is associated with apoptosis; we speculate that the difference between hosts infected with different subtypes of influenza virus may be related to apoptosis. Western blotting was used to assess the total protein levels of BAX and Caspase 3 in A549 cells, with β-actin as the internal reference. The results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b. The expression of BAX was increased in both the H5N1-infected group and the H9N2-infected group and was slightly higher in the H9N2-infected group than in the H5N1-infected group. Caspase 3 (32 kDa) expression was reduced in both the H5N1-infected and H9N2-infected groups, but the difference between the two groups was nonsignificant. Total protein Western blotting experiments showed that the differentially expressed proteins were mainly related to endogenous apoptosis.

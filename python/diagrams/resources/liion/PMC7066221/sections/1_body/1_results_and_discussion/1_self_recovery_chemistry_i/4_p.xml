 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E gives a schematic and an equation that describe the dynamic capacity of a Mn-based cathode. Based on the fact that no matter what be the phase structures of the Mn-based cathode (e.g., α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>), the discharge capacity of the cathode mainly originates from the redox of Mn species between different valent states (from +4 to +3 or even to +2). Therefore, the discharge capacity of a Mn-based cathode on a specific cycle is determined by three essential parameters and their interaction (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E): (1) the initial amount and valence of Mn in the solid Mn-based cathode before cycling, (2) the dissolution amount of the active Mn compound during each discharge/charge cycle, and (3) the deposition amount of active Mn compound during each charge. In these parameters, the initial valent state of the Mn element is determined by the cathode material itself, which has a significant influence on the first discharge capacity. On the subsequent cycling, the dissolution rate and deposition rate will negatively and positively, respectively, influence the amount of Mn on the cathode, thereby playing a more important role in the capacity retention. Based on this equation, developing a cathode with a low dissolution rate and a high deposition rate is crucial to the stable operation of Zn-ion batteries.

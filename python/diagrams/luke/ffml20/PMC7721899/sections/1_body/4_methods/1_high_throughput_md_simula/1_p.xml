<p id="Par27">In this study, high-throughput MD simulations are performed to obtain an adequate dataset of elastic constants for different compositions of C–S–H. The C–S–H model construction procedure for varying Ca/Si ratios, molecular loading conditions, and evaluation of elastic constants for all the C–S–H compositions within the high-throughput MD simulations are presented in the forthcoming sub-sections.</p>

<italic>P. anisum</italic> L. (voucher number: PMP-667). Extraction of the fruits was performed using boiling water, and the collected extract was concentrated by rotary evaporator at 45&#176;C temperature. Essential oil of the fruits was obtained by steam distillation method using Clevenger apparatus. Essential oil was analyzed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatography (GC) system equipped with a BPX5 column (30 mm &#215; 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 &#181;m). The column temperature was programmed from 50&#176;C, being held for 5 min, at a rate of 3&#176;C/min to 240&#176;C, at a rate of 15&#176;C/min to 300&#176;C, and being held for 3 min. The injector temperature was set at 290&#176;C. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Mass spectroscopy (MS) was Agilent 5973 model mass detector with electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV, and ionization source temperature of 220&#176;C was used. For GC and GC-MS analysis, 1 &#181;L of the essential oil dissolved in hexane was injected by the split mode (1:25). Electronic integration of the Flame Ionization Detector peak areas was used for determination of quantitative data. MSD Chemstation software (Agilent Technologies) was used for data analysis. Components were identified using their retention times to n-alkanes compared to those of Wiley 275 library and those described by Adams (2004).[

<p>In conclusion, we identified several proteins that may be involved in brain metastasis of gynecological malignancies. Since our study consisted of a small number of patients, a larger study should be conducted in order to define the biological functions and influence in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated the biomarker analysis tool using FFPE tissue-based proteomics by comparison of expression protein. Future studies using this tool will contribute to analysis of biomarkers, not only brain metastasis but also other organ metastasis such as lung and lymph node.</p>

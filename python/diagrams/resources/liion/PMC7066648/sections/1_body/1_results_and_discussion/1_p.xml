<p>The fabrication process of the yarn-shaped LIB is briefly described in this section. As shown in

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>, a yarn-shaped LIB with SSYs@LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> (SSY@LFP) as the cathode, the SSYs@graphite (SSY@G) as the anode, and PVDF-HFP/LiBF
 <sub>4</sub> with EC/PC as the gel electrolyte was successfully assembled. It is advantageous that SSYs provide high electrical conductivity and excellent flexibility, whereas gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) play the role of electrolytes and separators which ensure equivalent high ionic conductivity to the liquid electrolyte and enhance the safety performance of the battery.

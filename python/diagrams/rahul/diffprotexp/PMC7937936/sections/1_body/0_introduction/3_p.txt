0: To investigate the TME status in patients with HNSCC and the underlying mechanism of prognostic influence, a series of analyses have been conducted around the relationship between TME and prognosis.
1: In the present study, we used ESTIMATE software to analyze immune and stromal components scores in tumor tissues.
2: The relationships between microenvironment and tumor prognosis in HNSCC were further explored through prognostic-related Cox regression analysis and TME-associated protein interaction networks (PPI) to search for predictive hub genes significantly associated with TME.
3: CIBERSORT software was used to analyze the relative fraction of 22 immune cells in tumor tissues.
4: The relationships between the expression of hub genes and the fraction of these tumor-infiltrating immune cells were also further analyzed.

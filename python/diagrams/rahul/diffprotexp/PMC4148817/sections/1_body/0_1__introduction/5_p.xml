<p>The serous cells also play a role in maintaining airway hydration by selective absorption or secretion of electrolytes which is accompanied by compensatory water flux. Our previous studies showed that CNT exposure over a wide range of concentrations decreases a secretory Cl
 <sup>−</sup> flux that is stimulated in response to epinephrine [

 <sup>−</sup> secretion, these results indicate a potential for CNT-induced alterations in airway hydration.

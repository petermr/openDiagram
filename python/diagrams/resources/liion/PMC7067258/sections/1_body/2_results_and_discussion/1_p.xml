<p>To prepare powder crystalline 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold>, HHTP and HAT-CN were dissolved in DMF and stirred at 100 °C for 3 h to yield the deep green powder of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold>. We also attempted the preparation of a single crystal of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> using various solvent combinations to allow single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements to be carried out. However, only unsuitable ultrafine needle-like crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method at room temperature due to the fast nucleation of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> (Fig. S1 in the ESI
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). Thus, to slow the crystallization rate, a boronate ester COF (COF-5) was used as an HHTP source. As the framework of COF-5 is composed of HHTP and boronic acid, and the boronate ester bond easily undergoes hydrolysis, HHTP molecules are expected to be released gradually under ambient conditions, which could in turn control the nucleation rate of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold>. Thus, COF-5 and HAT-CN were suspended in DMF and allowed to stand exposed to hexane vapor as a poor solvent. After 1 week, plate-like single crystals of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> with a measurable size of 350 μm were obtained, suggesting that COF-5 was decomposed by moisture in the air and HHTP molecules were released in the DMF solvent. The crystal structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) revealed that 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> exhibits a pseudo-hexagonal columnar structure in which HHTP and HAT-CN molecules stack alternately along the 
 <italic>c</italic> axis. The distance between the π planes of HHTP and HAT-CN in the column was 3.27 Å, suggesting the presence of strong π–π interactions between these two compounds. In addition, the intercolumnar spaces were filled with DMF, which forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxy groups of HHTP (Fig. S2
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>, the XRPD pattern of 
 <bold>PCT-1·DMF</bold> agreed with the simulated pattern predicted from the single-crystal structural analysis, demonstrating that the bulk-synthesized dark green powder forms the same structure.

<p>Herein, we have shown that the chemical profile drawn for essential oil of 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. growing in Eastern Morocco reveal a new chemotype related to this region and spathulenol was identified as the predominant component of this oil. The pharmacological properties attributed to AcEO, like antioxidant, antiplatelet and vasorelaxant effects seem to be very interesting. The present work provide, also, evidence about the signaling mechanism of vasorelaxation induced by AcEO, showing that essential oil acts via L-type calcium channels and SERCA pumps to reduce intracellular calcium, and consequently triggering a sustained vasodilation.

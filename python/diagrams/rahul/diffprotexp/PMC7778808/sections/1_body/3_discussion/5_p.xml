<p id="Par45">Compared with previous studies, this article focuses on the genetics and immunology of VTE, and finds that ribosomal protein family genes and immune-related genes are closely related to VTE, which provides new ideas for further exploring the pathogenesis of VTE. Of course, this study also has some limitations. First, the chip data in this study is a single-center study with limitations in representativeness. Second, the molecular mechanism and therapeutic targets of VTE still need to be verified by a series of experiments.</p>

0: The three most important thermodynamic parameters of the electrode reaction are Gibbs free energy  G, entropy  S, and enthalpy  H. The change in Gibbs free energy  G is the maximum work of the battery.
1: The change in lattice order is characterized by the change in entropy  S. The enthalpy change  H is the reaction heat of the electrochemical reaction.
2: These three parameters can be measured by electrochemical tests and  eqs   1 320123where  n is the number of electrons transfer per formula,  F is the Faraday constant,  E is the standard electromotive force [also known as open-circuit potential (OCV)] of the battery reaction,  T is the temperature, and  P is the pressure.

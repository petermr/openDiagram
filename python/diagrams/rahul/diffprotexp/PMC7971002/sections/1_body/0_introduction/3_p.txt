0: The RNA-seq have been recently employed to identify differentially expressed genes and novel transcripts in cattle 9, cows 10, goats 11 and pigs 12.
1: RNA-seq efficacy has also been demonstrated in mammalian reproductive tissues, such as pig gonad 13, bovine blastocyst 14, bovine granulosa cell 15; goat ovary 16; sheep oocyte and granulosa cell; and sheep ovary 17.
2: A novel technology of high sequence RNA-seq 18 in which sequences are singularly traced to the genome source and are computed to procure the density and number of respective RNAs from already known exons 19 has been employed to analyze genome-wide mRNAs in several species including yeasts, ruminants, and humans 20.

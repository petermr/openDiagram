<p id="p0150">HSP70 is an important molecular chaperone, which plays a key role in cell protection by assisting with protein homeostasis or protein quality control

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In addition, aging has been related to impairment in activity and availability of HSP70 induction. Previous reports revealed that exogenous HSP70 protein can significantly enhance mouse life span

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Ginseng treatment increased expression of HSP70 in rats, which showed protected functions of neurological responses and memory ability 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In the present study, we found an increased level of HSP70 in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, suggesting a protective role in aging and life span extension. Therefore, RGE might be considered a potential source to identify compounds that delay aging.

<p id="Par44">In order to produce a low-cost Li-ion battery with recyclable organic cathode and anode, self-standing graphite electrodes are also prepared. Graphite is the most common anode material used in Li-ion batteries

 <sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to that of stage-I compound LiC

 <sub>3</sub>H-modified graphite powders (Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI12</xref>). The self-standing anode is firstly combined with the LFP, and the full LFP/graphite battery is assembled with an excess capacity for the anode. The charge/discharge profile of the first cycle at C/24 of the corresponding battery is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16a</xref>. A flat plateau at approximately 3.25 V is obtained with a small polarization, and the first discharge delivered is approximately 125 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The overall potential is more interesting than that of the LFP/LTO system presented earlier; however, the specific capacity is lower because of the irreversible consumption of lithium by the graphite anode. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16a</xref>, this strong irreversibility results in a Coulombic efficiency of only 76% for the first cycle, but it practically reaches 100% in the succeeding cycles at 1 C. A long-term cycling experiment is also performed for 300 cycles at a cycling rate of 1 C. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16b</xref> presents the stability of the LFP/graphite battery. After 300 charge/discharge cycles, the specific capacity is approximately 88 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to 85% of the initial discharge capacity obtained at 1 C. Although the Coulombic efficiency remains constant at approximately 100% during the entire experiment, a gradual capacity fading is evident probably because of the cathode and anode, as shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI12</xref>. In contrast, the all-paper LFP/graphite battery fabricated by Leijonmarck 
 <italic>et al</italic>. exhibits poor cyclability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. In fact, after 300 charge/discharge cycles at 1 C, approximately 50 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> is obtained, which corresponds to a retention capacity of ~45%.

0: Mid-exponential growth phase cultures of  S. suis were adjusted to 0.2 of OD600.
1: Then, 100 L of cultures were added to each wells of a 96-well microplate with equal volume of tylosin solution with the final concentrations of 1/2 MIC (0.25 g/mL), 1/4 MIC (0.125 g/mL), 1/8 MIC (0.0625 g/mL), and 1/16 MIC (0.03125 g/mL), respectively.
2: In addition, a negative control (with THB alone) and a positive control (with bacteria alone) were also included.
3: After incubation at 37C for 72 h without shaking, the medium was removed by aspiration and the wells were washed three times with sterile physiological saline.
4: The remaining attached bacteria were fixed with 200 L of 99% methanol (Guoyao Ltd., China) per well, and the plates were emptied after 15 min and left to dry.
5: Then, the plates were stained for 5 min with 200 L of 2% crystal violet (Guoyao Ltd., China) per well.
6: The excess stain was rinsed off by placing the plate under running tap water.
7: After the plates were air dried, the dye bound to the adherent cells was resolubilized with 200 L of 33% (v/v) glacial acetic acid (Guoyao Ltd., China) per well.
8: The amount of released stain was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm with a microplate reader (DG5033A, Huadong Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).
9: The reported values are the means of three measurements.
10: The experiments were performed in triplicate.

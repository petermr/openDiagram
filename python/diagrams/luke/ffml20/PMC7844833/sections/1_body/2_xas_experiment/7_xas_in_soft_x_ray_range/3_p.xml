<p>The strong X-ray attenuation in the soft X-ray range puts significant additional constraints on the experimental design, where X-ray attenuation by air should be avoided. This complicates the design and assembly of the cells for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> measurements since the sample cell needs to be integrated into the beamline setup and separated from vacuum by thin windows made from X-ray transparent materials. For example, Ishihara et al. recently reported the design of an electrochemical cell for soft X-ray XAS, where the catalyst/working electrode was a 15 nm layer of platinum deposited on a window made of silicon carbide.

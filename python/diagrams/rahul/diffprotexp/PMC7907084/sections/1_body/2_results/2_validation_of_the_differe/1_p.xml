<p id="Par23">To validate the differential expression patterns of genes identified by RNA-seq analyses, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed in this study. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the differential expression patterns of genes involved in cell cycle (
 <italic>CDC20</italic>, 
 <italic>CCNB2</italic>, 
 <italic>CCNA1</italic>), DNA replication (
 <italic>RFC4</italic>, 
 <italic>MCM2</italic>), and steroidogenesis (
 <italic>CYP51A1</italic>, 
 <italic>DHCR24</italic>) were confirmed to be differentially expressed between Gd and Gp cells in F1 or F5 follicles by qRT-PCR assay. These findings confirmed the reliability of RNA-seq data (Fig.

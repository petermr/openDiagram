<p>In the second temperature range from 430 °C to 300 °C, the differences in the heat flow curves are much more pronounced, 
 <xref rid="f9-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B,C</xref>. The maximum heat flow peak was observed at 370 °C after only 33 s. The peak height values and their positions are shifted to longer durations with both higher and lower temperatures. This effect is stronger towards higher soaking temperatures. Within the soaking temperature range from 380 °C to 350 °C, the differences between the heat flow curves are small and the peak height values are the highest (about −0.05 W/g to −0.06 W/g). The reactions are also relatively fast in this temperature range. The peak values were found after around 33 s to 41 s.

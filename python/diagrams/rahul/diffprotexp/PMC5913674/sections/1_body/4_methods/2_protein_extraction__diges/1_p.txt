0: Trophozoite cultures for protein extraction were generated as previously described [ 18].
1: Briefly, trophozoites were seeded at a number normalized to growth rate in order to achieve equivalent final cell numbers in t25 flasks (Falcon), followed by decanting of media and unattached and nonviable trophozoites.
2: Adherent trophozoites were then harvested by chilling trophozoites in fresh, complete TYI-S33 media on wet ice before collection by centrifugation.
3: Total protein, RNA [ 18], and DNA were extracted using the TriPure reagent (Roche) from the same trophozoite pellet material according to the manufacturer's instructions.

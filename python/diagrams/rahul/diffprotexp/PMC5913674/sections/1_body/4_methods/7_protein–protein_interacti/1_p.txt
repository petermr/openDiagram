0: Network analysis was performed by submitting DEP ascensions to the STRING software (v10.5) [ 98,  99].
1: Interaction networks were visualized for proteins with medium confidence (0.4), with network edges based on confidence, continuous lines for direct interactions, and indirect interactions with interrupted lines.
2: Clustering was based on a Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) inflation default parameter of 3.

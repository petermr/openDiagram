<p>The preparation of agar, broth, and bacteria were carried out as described in

 <xref rid="B54-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with some minor modifications. The original solution of each EO was dissolved in Tween-20 (0.5%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DSMO, 5%), or ethanol (100%) in a 1:1 ratio to make serial 2-fold dilutions, yielding solutions with a gradient from 100% oil to 0.2% oil (

 <sup>4</sup>–10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL suspension of each tested bacterium. DSMO without bacteria was used as a control.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was performed on Agilent gas chromatograph, Model 7890A, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Analytical conditions were HP-5MS capillary column (30 m &#215; 0.25 mm coated with 5% phenyl methyl silicone, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane, 0.25 &#181;m film thickness) and helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min). Injection was done in split mode (1:60), injected volume was 1 &#181;L (10% essential oil/CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>
<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>), and the injector and detector temperatures were 250 &#176;C and 280 &#176;C, respectively. The oven temperature was held at 50 &#176;C for 1 min, then increased to 240 &#176;C at 5 &#176;C/min and held at 240 &#176;C for 5 min. Percentages of compounds were determined from their peak areas in the GC-FID profiles.</p>

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The GLMM results indicate that minimum 24-h body temperature of aardvarks was associated positively with minimum 24-h air temperature, photoperiod and with EVI (an index for food availability for aardvark prey; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>). Maximum 24-h body temperature of aardvarks was associated positively with photoperiod and negatively with maximum 24-h air temperature, but not associated with EVI (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>). Though significant, the influence of minimum and maximum air temperature on body temperature was trivial (&#946; &lt; 0.01). The amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm was associated negatively with photoperiod and with EVI, but not associated with the range of 24-h air temperature (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1C</xref>), indicating that days with large fluctuations in air temperature were not associated with large fluctuations in body temperatures.</p>

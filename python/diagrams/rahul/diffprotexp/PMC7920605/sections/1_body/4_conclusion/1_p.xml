<p>In summary, our study revealed the differential expression of m6A methylation and mRNA genes in MH7A cells, provided the m6A transcriptome map of MH7A cells, and revealed the potential relationship between RNA methylation modification and RA related genes. Nevertheless, the specific and mechanism of m6A methylation in RA remains to be further studied in the future.</p>

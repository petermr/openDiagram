 <sup>3</sup> Ks
 <sup>−1</sup> (ϕ2 mm), 1.1 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> Ks
 <sup>−1</sup> (ϕ6 mm), 40 Ks
 <sup>−1</sup> (ϕ10 mm), 10 Ks
 <sup>−1</sup> (ϕ20 mm) and 1.6 Ks
 <sup>−1</sup> (100 g ingot). It is known that the cooling rate usually has a strong influence on the volume fraction of the β-phase in Zr/Ti-based BMGCs and the volume fractions tend to increase with lowering the cooling rates

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Because the cooling rate in the 100 g ingot is more than 20 times lower than in the case of the rod with a diameter of 10 mm, there is much more time for the precipitation of β-Ti. Consequently, the crystalline volume fraction should be much higher in the ingot than in the ϕ10 mm rod. Contrary to expectation, the volume fraction of β-Ti does not change when the cooling rate is between 40 and 1.6 K s
 <sup>−1</sup> and only the dendrites become coarser (

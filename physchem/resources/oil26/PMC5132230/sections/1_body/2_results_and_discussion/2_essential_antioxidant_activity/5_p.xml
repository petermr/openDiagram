<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For Beatovi&#263; et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166684.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the OE antioxidant capacity is related to their major compounds, but this study has not observed the antioxidant activity. Studies with <italic>Ocimun basilicum</italic> species, and linalool as major compound showed strong antioxidant capacity [<xref rid="pone.0166684.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the other hand, Lu and Foo [<xref rid="pone.0166684.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] believe that most compounds act synergistically together producing a broad spectrum of antioxidant properties and thus create an effective defense against free radicals.</p>

<p>For practical applications (for example, in rechargeable metal–air batteries), the design of a bifunctional catalyst which enables both OER and ORR reactions has attracted attention. One promising material is manganese oxide, which exhibits a large number of different phases, and allows one to tune its properties to find a balance between the requirements for OER and ORR processes.

 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and the corresponding EXAFS spectra featured fingerprints of the spinel-like structure. Under OER conditions, the oxidation state of Mn was increased, and both XANES and EXAFS features resembled those for birnessite, a mixed oxide containing Mn

 </sup> In a related study, Gul et al. used 
 <italic>in situ</italic> XAS and XES to investigate the structural and chemical transformations of MnNiO
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>. The presence of Ni resulted in an increased oxidation state for Mn, and the birnessite-like structure and the +3/+4 valence for Mn species was already observed at ORR conditions, while under OER potentials the oxidation of Mn to the 4+ state and the formation of a MnO
 <sub>2</sub>-like phase was observed in Mn K-edge XANES and EXAFS, respectively. Analysis of the Ni K-edge position suggested an average oxidation state between +2 and +3 under ORR conditions, and ∼+ 3.7 under OER conditions. The corresponding local structure around Ni probed by EXAFS revealed transformations similar to the transition between Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and γ-NiOOH.

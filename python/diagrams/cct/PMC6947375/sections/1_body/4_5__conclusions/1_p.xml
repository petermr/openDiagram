<p>The motivation of this study was to obtain the best combination of strength and ductility by controlling the ratio of small and large cementite particles in the microstructure. The study indicated that the ratio of small and large cementite particles varied with the variation of heat treatment and working processes, resulting in a significantly improved strength of the studied high-carbon steel. The major conclusions were as follows:</p>

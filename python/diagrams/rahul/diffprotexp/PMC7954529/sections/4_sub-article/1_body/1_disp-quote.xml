 <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
 <p>The paper is a well-executed and thorough analysis of PAS usage in LCLs between humans and chimpanzees. The research is technically sound, and this is additionally demonstrated by the accompanying supplemental analyses, and the use of additional datasets which permitted studying how differential PAS usage relates to protein level expression. Yet the paper lacks direct connections to actual phenotypic and biological differences between humans and chimpanzees, and in this regard reads more of a technical work (perhaps suitable in its current form in a journal such as Genome Research or Nucleic Acids Research), than the type of study that is published on a specific biological phenotype as often presented in eLife. Along with additional issues listed below, are suggestions for adjusting the analyses and text to help bridge the gap to phenotype:</p>
 <p>1) Throughout the Results sections the authors present a myriad of lists of gene and PAS usage sites that result from different ways of cutting the data and connecting PAS usage to isoform and protein expression. Can these lists be explored in more detail, perhaps through functional gene set enrichment analyses and/or the use of the GREAT? Analyzing the sets in at least this manner might help to connect PAS usage differences to actual biology between humans/chimpanzees as well as within each species.</p>

<p>Generally, the energy storage mechanism in both types of cell involves the oxidation of metallic sodium into the sodium metal cation (Na
 <sup>+</sup>) and the release of an electron at the negative electrode during discharge. The electron moves to the counter electrode through the external circuit whereas the oxidized Na
 <sup>+</sup> ion moves through the electrolyte to reach the counter electrode. The generated electron reduces the oxygen by ORR at the surface of the air electrode and the negative intermediate of the ORR is balanced by the Na
 <sup>+</sup> ion to form a discharge product. On the contrary, upon charging, electroplating process of sodium occurs at negative electrode; while OER takes place at the air electrode. The discharge products are sodium peroxide (Na
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) or sodium superoxide (NaO
 <sub>2</sub>) for the nonaqueous Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> cell and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for the hybrid Na–air cell. Nonetheless, the energy storage mechanism is clear in nonaqueous Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> battery, but as far as the discharge products are concerned, their chemical nature is still a matter of debate.[qv: 6c,16b] The possible reactions pathways during discharge in nonaqueous Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> battery can be explained as below:

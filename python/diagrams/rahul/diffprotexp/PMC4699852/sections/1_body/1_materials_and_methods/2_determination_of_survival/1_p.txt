0: MSCs were seeded on a 96-well plate with a cell density of 5000 cells/well.
1: After neuronal induction, the number of viable proliferating cells was determined using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega).
2: The assay was performed by adding 20 l of the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent directly to culture wells, incubating in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37C for 14 hours, and then recording absorbance at 490 nm in a 96-well plate reader.
3: The CellTiter 96 AQ ueous One Solution Reagent contains a tetrazolium compound MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt), which in the presence of phenazine methosulfate can be reduced by living cells to yield a colored formazan product.
4: The quantity of formazan product as measured by absorbance at 490 nm is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture.

0: GO was prepared based on improved Hummers method.
1: 1.5 g of potash nitrate (NaNO 3) and 3.0 g of flake graphite were dissolved in 100 mL of sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4, 98%), and stirred for 0.5 h under 10C.
2: Then, 10.0 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) was slowly added to the mixture, followed by continuous magnetic stirring for 0.5 h. This mixture was diluted with 700 mL deionized water and continued to stir at 95C for 1 h. Afterward, 30% hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2, 15 mL) was dropped to the mixture and turned dark green solution into a bright yellow one.
3: The suspension was then washed with 1:10 HCl solution and deionized water for several times.
4: Finally, the obtained GO was freeze-dried for 48 h.

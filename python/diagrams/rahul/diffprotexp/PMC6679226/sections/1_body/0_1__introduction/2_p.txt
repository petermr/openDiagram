0: Unbiased discovery and the quantitative proteomic approach is a powerful tool for identifying novel biomarkers and regulatory signaling networks in lung diseases including ARDS [ 8].
1: The protein expression profile of the bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) directly reflects the pathological changes in the airspace milieu in ARDS.
2: Differential BALF protein expression was observed at different time points following the onset of ARDS [ 9], as well as with differing disease severity (mild vs. severe) [ 10].
3: Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technology, Bhargava and colleagues characterized BALF protein expression profiles of ARDS survivors and non-survivors at different stages of disease progression and found that non-survivors manifested decreased expression of proteins related to coagulation, iron homeostasis and immune activation, but increased expression of proteins related to glycolysis, collagen metabolism and the actin cytoskeleton [ 11].
4: In addition, this study identified several candidate biomarkers (club cell secretory protein and thioredoxin) that can be utilized to predict survival in ARDS patients [ 11].
5: By employing shotgun proteomics, Schnapp et al.
6: identified a total of 870 proteins in BALF from three ARDS patients and further showed that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and IGF binding protein-3 expression levels in BALF correlated with ARDS progression [ 12].
7: The above BALF proteomic studies provided new insights into the pathogenesis of ARDS and also identified novel therapeutic targets for ARDS treatment.
8: However, these studies did not differentiate between pulmonary and extra-pulmonary ARDS, and the differences in BALF protein expression profiles between these two ARDS sub-groups are unknown.

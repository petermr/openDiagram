<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par26">Burrowing decreased plant species richness, except at burrow entrances in the mesic grassland where species richness was higher than the other microsites at both abandoned and collapsed burrows. This suggests that burrowing increased habitat diversity and/or opportunities for establishment for plant species in the mesic site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. It is possible that the substantially lower soil compaction here facilitated the establishment of plant species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Less compact soils at burrow entrances will be more aerated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and may have higher water infiltration rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, which may also explain the drier soil conditions found at this microsite in the mesic grassland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Although not considered in this study, variation in the effect of burrowing on soil moisture may also be driven by fine-scale heterogeneity within and between the three study sites (e.g. burrow orientation and slope, humus content of soil and time since rainfall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>).</p>

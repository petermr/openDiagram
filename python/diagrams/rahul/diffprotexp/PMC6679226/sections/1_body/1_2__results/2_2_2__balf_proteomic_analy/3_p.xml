<p>Intriguingly, two canonical signaling pathways activated by I.T. LPS were suppressed by I.P. LPS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03401-f002">Figure 2</xref>B, boxed pathways). These two pathways were liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation pathway involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and the pathway involved in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages. The up- and down-regulated proteins in these two pathways by I.T. or I.P. LPS challenges are listed in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03401-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Among these proteins, many of the same apolipoproteins (ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoA4, ApoD, ApoE), paraoxonase 1 (Pon1, involved in the regulation of lipid oxidation), S100 calcium binding protein A8 (S100A8) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1B (Tnfrsf1B) participate in both the LXR/RXR activation and the production of NO and ROS in macrophages. The differential regulation of these two pathways by I.T. and I.P. LPS is novel, and suggests that, while direct LPS challenge to the lung stimulates these two pathways, systemic inflammation induced by I.P. LPS suppresses lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in lung macrophages.

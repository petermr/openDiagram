(8) Determining the likelihood of gene presence/absence in &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;: Percentage gene presence in &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; (CS) was determined by using BLAST to query the CS chr2B region for each CDS followed by calculating the mean average of the best % CDS presence (nident/qlen * 100) for each transcript. Where there was more than one splice variant present, the transcript with the highest average CDS presence was used to represent the % gene presence in CS. (9) Functional annotation of the synthetic 2B assembled fragment predicted genes was carried out via BLAST queries to the uniprot90 protein database (releaseDate&#8201;=&#8201;&#8216;2019-04-10&#8217; version&#8201;=&#8201;&#8216;2019_03&#8217;). For each predicted peptide, the top 20 BLAST hits (based on e-values&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;1e&#8722;25) were retained. The gene functions were then assigned by hand. Where there was no function known or where BLAST results were&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1e&#8722;25, proteins were labelled as uncharacterised. (10) Identifying the corresponding CS gene IDs to the synthetic gene predictions: The coding sequences for each of the transcripts from both the synthetic region and corresponding CS region were extracted using gffread. BLAST was used to query the CS coding sequences with the predicted synthetic coding sequences. The best BLAST results (determined by e-value and bit score) were taken for each query and coding sequences with less than a 90% CDS identity (nident / qlen * 100) were ignored.

<p>We found the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E2) increased in semen from infertile males. This protein is involved in the ubiquitin transfer to targets in the proteasome system. This increased enzyme in infertile patients might be involved in the ubiquitin transfer to the surface of defective sperm during epididymal passage[
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or ejaculation. Ubiquitin was detected in human epididymal cells[
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and seminal plasma[
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and a relationship with sperm quality was proposed.[

 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In humans and other mammalian species, male infertility has been associated with a higher content of sperm surface proteins that cross-react with antiubiquitin antibodies[
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and bind predominantly to the surface of defective spermatozoa.[

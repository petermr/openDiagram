<p>In an analysis of splice site usage, we identified 39 (10%) novel splice sites, 153 (38%) known splice sites and 211 (52%) differentially used exons (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). The types of splicing events include: Skipped Exons (SE), Mutually Exclusive Exons (MX), Alternative 5’ Splice-sites (A5), Alternative 3’ Splice-sites (A3), Retained Introns (RI), Alternative First Exons (AF) and Alternative Last Exons (AL). Identified splice site variants were categorized as 418 (60%) AF exons, 76 (9%) SE, 55 (8%) A3, 45 (6%) A5, 26 (4%) RI and 12 (2%) MX (

The Leafcutter algorithm, which takes account of novel splice junctions, identified 373 cryptic 5’ splice site events and 527 cryptic 3’ splice site events consistent with the expected effect of mutation of SF3B1 where 3’ alternative splicing is the main mechanism of action (

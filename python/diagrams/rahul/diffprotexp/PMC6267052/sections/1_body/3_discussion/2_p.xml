<p id="Par25">Approximately 14% of the proteins were identified in either meniscus or articular cartilage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) alone, which could be due to biological differences and sample complexity e.g. the vascularization of the meniscus is likely to impact the results allowing more plasma proteins to be present and thereby detected. Many of the identified proteins could be highly relevant for the tissue characterisation in OA, but since one aim of the study was to compare the two MS methods by statistical means we only included proteins that were identified in both tissue types.

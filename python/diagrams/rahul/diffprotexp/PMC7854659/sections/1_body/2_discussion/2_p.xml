 </sup>. We successfully mapped 338 TFs as putative regulators of TS and DEG. It is worth mentioning that these are not the only TFs regulating the tissue development and gene transcription; however, they were consistently most differentially co-expressed (RIF1) or could predict (RIF2) the abundance of the TS and DEG

 </sup>. The regulatory role of these TFs on day 50 of gestation was perturbed due to maternal nutrient restriction, as evidenced by their identification either as DC or DK. The liver showed the greatest number of TS genes, followed by the cerebrum and muscle. Moreover, the greatest number of DEG and TF genes were found in the liver, emphasizing its wide range of essential metabolic functions.

<p id="p0095">In this study, 200 males (20 flies per cage) of wild type and RGE-treated flies were used for longevity screening. RGE extended 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> life span and generated significantly lower mortality in older population groups (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). All wild type flies had died by Day 84, whereas the RGE-treated flies survived until Day 94 (

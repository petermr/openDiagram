<p>To gain functional insight into the differentially expressed genes common in both the gene disrupted mutants, we used Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis. We found that the genes involved in pathogenesis and extracellular region were highly represented among the downregulated genes. Some of the most downregulated genes included the SAUSA300_0113 (
 <italic>spa)</italic> gene, encoding the immunoglobulin G binding protein A precursor; SAUSA300_2453, encoding ATP-binding protein of ABC transporters; SAUSA300_2454, encoding a putative membrane-spanning protein; SAUSA300_0114 (
 <italic>sarS</italic>), and SAUSA300_1890, encoding staphopain A protease. In addition, the alternative sigma factor 
 <italic>sigB</italic> and the genes whose transcription exclusively depends on SigB, such as 
 <italic>asp23</italic>, SAUSA300_2143, and SAUSA300_2144, were downregulated (Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that YjbH contributes to the control of SigB activity. Further, expression of the 
 <italic>spxA</italic> was downregulated, which might be due to the autoregulation of 
 <italic>spx</italic> transcription due to increased Spx level [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We further observed a significant downregulation of zinc metalloprotease 
 <italic>aur</italic> and other proteases such as serine and cysteine proteases, which explains the reduced protease production in these mutants.

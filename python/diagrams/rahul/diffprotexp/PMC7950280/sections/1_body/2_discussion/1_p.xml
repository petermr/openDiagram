<p>In this study, we identified BDNF as a target gene of HD and the RNA data revealed that BDNF expression was down-regulated. The GSEA analyses engaging 19,414 background genes showed that DEGs in HD / control and BDNF-low / high groups were significantly enriched in regulation of angiogenesis, protein maturation and protein processing. Pathologically, the accumulation of N-terminal mHtt was observed to be responsible for protein processing impairment, protein misfolding and neuronal degeneration [

 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was worth noting that these biological processes were potentially related to HD as well as the low BDNF expression. Thenceforth, the global regulatory network and co-expression modules of DEGs interacting with BDNF were constructed to investigate the genome-level pathogenesis of BDNF in HD.

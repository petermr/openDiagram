<p>Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from adult bone marrow can be cultured long-term, expanded in proper conditions, and show the ability to differentiate into neuronal cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The induction of MSCs into neural cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was first attempted in 2000 by Woodbury et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They used chemicals to induce mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into neurons. Firstly, the cells were cultured in Î²-mercaptoethanol (BME)-containing medium for 1 day and then in a differentiation-inducing medium containing dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). After 3 hours of induction, the cells showed the characteristics of neuronal cells, exhibiting neuron-specific enolase and neurofilament-M. In the same year, Sanchez-Ramos published results describing 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of human and rat mesenchymal stem cells into neuronal cells using growth factors EGF and BDNF. The differentiated cells expressed the precursor gene of neurons, nestin, and biomarkers of neuronal cells, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Blondheim et al. found that human bone marrow MSCs exhibit a total of 12 neural genes, including Nestin, NSE, NeuN, and 11 nerve-related transcription factors, including neural zinc finger 3 (NZF-3) and paired box gene 3 (Pax3) [
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Human MSCs also express eight dopamine neuron-related genes such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic 
 <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the transcription factor nuclear receptor related-1 (Nurr-1), and the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor-3 (Pitx-3). The literature confirms that MSCs have the ability to differentiate into neurons.

<p id="Par59">Previously, we reported many newly identified proteins in the cochlea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that Parvin α and Dbn1, are exclusively expressed on P3 relative to P14, whereas Tmd10 is exclusively expressed on P3 relative to P30. Parvin α is a member of the parvin family of actin-binding proteins and is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, formation of lamellipodia and ciliogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Dbn1 is an actin-binding protein found in the central nervous system that regulates the dendritic spine shape of neurons. This protein plays an important role in the structure-based plasticity of synapses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and may thus contribute to early synapse formation, a critical component in controlling the tonotopic organization of these spontaneously active cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Tmed10 is a member of the p24 family of type I integral-membrane proteins, which are found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the intermediate compartment, and the Golgi apparatus. They are involved in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Hence, this protein may play a role in trafficking membrane proteins to and from stereocilia, thereby maintaining their structure and organization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

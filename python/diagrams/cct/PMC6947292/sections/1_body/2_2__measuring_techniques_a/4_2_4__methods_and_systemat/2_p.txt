0: The presence of crystal structures with volume fractions of above 1 % and large precipitates can be detected by common X-ray diffraction (XRD) [ 112, 138].
1: Hence, this technique is again limited to relatively slow cooling rates, which produce corresponding volume fractions and particle dimensions of the phase of interest.
2: In addition, the wide and small-angle X-ray scattering techniques briefly discussed above can generate information on quench-induced precipitation [ 102, 103, 104, 111].

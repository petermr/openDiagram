<p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). DNA was isolated using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with optional RNase A digestion. Quantitative PCR was performed using target-specific primers. PCR reactions consisted of 1X PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.5 μM forward and reverse primers, 5–20 ng cDNA (mRNA analysis) or 25–50 ng DNA (mitochondrial or genomic DNA analysis) in a total reaction volume of 10 μL. Reactions were amplified as technical duplicates or triplicates on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The instrument cover was set to 105°C and the PCR program included a hold stage (1 cycle: 50°C/2 min, 95°C/2 min), a PCR stage (45 cycles: 95°C/1 sec, 60°C/20 sec with data collection), and a final melting curve stage (95°C/1 sec, 60°C/20 sec, 95°C/1 sec with a temperature transition of 0.15°C/sec and continuous data acquisition during the melting transition). Data were analysed using the Thermo Fisher Cloud analysis platform with an efficiency-corrected relative quantification (2^ΔΔCq) methodology utilizing

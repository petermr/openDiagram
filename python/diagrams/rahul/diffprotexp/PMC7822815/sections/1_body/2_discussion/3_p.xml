<p id="Par48">It was recently suggested that RUNX1/RUNX1T1 may recruit the splicing of regulatory proteins including proteins with poly(A) RNA binding activity (i.e., CIRBP, DKC1, GAR1, or RBM3)

 </sup>. These data imply a role of the fusion protein in the control of polyadenylation. Indeed, we found 614 3’-terminal exons that overlap with RUNX1/RUNX1T1 binding peaks (data not shown). However, only 4 of these exons were differentially used in the transcriptome of the siRR-treated versus siMM-treated Kasumi-1 cells (at least twofold changes,

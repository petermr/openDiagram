<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Although spathulenol was the major compound in <italic>K. anatolica, K. syriaca</italic> and <italic>K. sicula</italic> collected from different localities, it was not detected in essential oils of seed samples of <italic>K. anatolica</italic> in the present study. Taking into account previous studies and comparing present results with those previously reported in relation to the analysis of <italic>K. anatolica</italic> essential oils from Turkey; we noticed a clear variation in major components present in essential oils from different plant parts and populations of <italic>K. anatolica</italic>. Thus, spathulenol detected as the main constituent in the essential oils derived from aerial parts of the species growing in Turkey, whereas a-Pinene and &#946;-Pinene considered as one of the prominent chemical constituents of the seed essential oils in our study. Additionally, it was found that differences between major compounds of <italic>Kundmannia</italic> species when compared to each other. These variations can be explained by the differences of mainly part of plant utilized, genotype, the plant ecotype, geographic origins or adaptive process to some particular and local ecological conditions (Chalchat et al., 1995; Djarri et al., 2008; Faidi et al., 2014). The origin of changes should be sought mainly in the differences in the nature of soil on the one hand and solar radiation on the other. Both factors involve the activation or inactivation of certain enzymatic groups, leading to the predominance of a particular biosynthetic pathway (Arruda et al., 2012).</p>

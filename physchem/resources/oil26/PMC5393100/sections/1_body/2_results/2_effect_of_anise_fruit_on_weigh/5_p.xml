<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The levels of hepatic enzymes AST and ALT were significantly elevated as a result of CDD-induced NAFLD [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. AE and AO with all doses were able to significantly reverse this increase (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The dose of 200 mg/kg/day AE as well as simvastatin showed the best effect by decreasing the levels of these enzymes to the same level of normal diet group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001].</p>

<p id="Par4">Echinoderms comprise an important group of organisms with extraordinary regeneration capabilities. However, despite being among the most highly regenerative deuterostomes and their close relationship to vertebrates, the number of studies on their regenerative capacity is rather limited

 </sup>. Sea cucumbers have been particularly attractive for intestinal regeneration studies because of their innate capacity of expelling their digestive tract in a process known as evisceration, which is then followed by its regeneration. Research relating regeneration of the whole digestive system is scarce among regenerating competent organisms, where in addition to sea cucumbers, other studies include planarians

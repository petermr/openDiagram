 <sup>++</sup> (ww) genotypes, to determine the DE lncRNAs and genes, and predict their potential function that related to reproduction. Which is essential for better understanding the molecular mechanisms by lncRNAs regulate sheep reproduction with different genotypes, also providing insight for other female mammals.

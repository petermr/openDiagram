<p>The above considerations lead to the postulation of two critical heating rates for the dissolution of a specific initial heat treatment state, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f021">Figure 21</xref>. The first of these is the lower critical heating rate (LCHR), and the second is the upper critical heating rate (UCHR). The LCHR is postulated to be the fastest heating rate at which the particular initial state can be dissolved completely during heating to a certain maximum temperature T
 <sub>max</sub> (which must be above the solvus temperature of the alloy). A potential further increase in this temperature in the solid state will reduce the LCHR. If heating is carried out to T
 <sub>max</sub> at a rate slower than the LCHR, a complete solid solution will be obtained during heating. The LCHR therefore has high technological importance. For a soft annealed state of 6005A, we found indications that the LCHR is on the order of 0.01 K/s, although there is no extensive experimental proof of this. The UCHR is theoretically defined as a fast heating rate at which diffusion is prevented completely and no dissolution takes place. Currently, for the soft annealed 6005A, a UCHR can only be estimated as about 10 to 20 K/s (compare

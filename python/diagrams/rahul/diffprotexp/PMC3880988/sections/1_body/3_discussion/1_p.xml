<p>In this preliminary study, primary MSCs and ACs demonstrated significant differences in their protein profiles. Whilst it can be assumed that similar profiles to that of ACs should be expressed by chondrogenic MSCs, this was not observed in our present study, suggesting that cMSCs may not function exactly the same way to native ACs. This has become the premise in which based on the differentially expressed protein profile, we hypothesize that cMSCs do not perform as expected

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. There were six most differentially expressed proteins observed in between the ACs, MSCs and cMSCs. However, of these, only MYL6B, ALDOA, TAGLN2 and EF1-ALPHA were not highly modulated in cMSCs as compared to ACs. Further analyses of the data gained in this study revealed that these differentially expressed proteins from cMSCs were related to cytoskeletal, metabolic enzymes, and biosynthesis proteins, which may have contributed to the ineffectiveness of these differentiated cells in cartilage repair.

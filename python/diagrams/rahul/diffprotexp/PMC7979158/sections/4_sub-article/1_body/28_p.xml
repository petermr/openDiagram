<p>Of interest and relevant to the reviewer comment on migration, the new co-staining experiments also provide evidence of alterations in migration. By analyzing higher magnification images, we identified differences in cell body shape of both TBR1 and SATB2 positive cells between the MIA and control groups, indicative of an active radial migration state observable in control animals versus a more static rounded cell body shape in the MIA brains (shown in Figure 5D). This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that timing of lamination is altered following MIA exposure, with greater number of cells that were still migrating evident in the control versus MIA group.</p>

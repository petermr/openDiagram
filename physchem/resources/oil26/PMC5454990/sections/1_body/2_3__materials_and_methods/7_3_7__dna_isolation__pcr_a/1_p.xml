<p>Genomic DNA material was extracted from dried leaf tissue of each plant using E.Z.N.A
 <sup>®</sup> Poly-Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the protocol given by the company. For amplification of 
 <italic>matK</italic> region, PCR was performed in a 50 µL reaction mixture that consisted of 36.5 µL of nanofiltrated (NF) water, 5.0 µL of 10× Advantage Buffer, 1.0 µL of deoxynucleotide (DNTP), 0.5 µL of Taq-DNA polymerase, 5.0 µL template DNA, 1.0 µL of 
 <italic>matK</italic>-Lau001 (F-5’-TCCTTTCTTGAGCGAACACA-3’), and 1.0 µL of 
 <italic>matK</italic>-Lau002 (R-5’-CTGACAAATCGGACCGAAAC-3’) primers purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA). Amplifications conditions for 
 <italic>matK</italic> primers consisted of an initial denaturation step for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 61 °C, 60 s at 68 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C for final extension. Amplifications were performed in an Eppendorf MasterCycler Pro thermocycler, the PCR products were visualized in agarose gel (1%), purified, and then they were sent to Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA) for sequencing.

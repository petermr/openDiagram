<p>Unexpected expression of non-epithelial protein in our experiments contradicts the epithelial rest theory where the congenital cholesteatoma arises from ectodermal derivatives from the first epibranchial placode, as found in various vertebrates. Among the 10 most abundant proteins exclusively expressed in congenital cholesteatoma tissues, FKH 5–3 was most interesting. Expression of this protein was also confirmed in congenital cholesteatoma by immunohistochemistry. Forkhead proteins, a family of transcription factors, play pathophysiologic roles in regulating expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity. Forkhead proteins regulate embryonic development mechanisms [

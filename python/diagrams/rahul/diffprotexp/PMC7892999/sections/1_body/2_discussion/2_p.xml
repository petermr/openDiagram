<p id="Par15">In this work, we performed a thorough transcriptomic analysis by comparing two carrot hybrids with contrasted anthocyanin pigmentation phenotypes (i.e. purple vs. orange), both in phloem and xylem tissues. The study corroborates the involvement of the principal reported structural genes of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway

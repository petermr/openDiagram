<p>The ninety bZIP sequences from potato and representative bZIP sequences from each group were analyzed from rice (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), barley (
 <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), maize (
 <italic>Zea mays</italic>), and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>). Multiple sequence alignment of StbZIPs with rice, barley, maize, and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> bZIPs was performed with ClustalW (with gap open penalty 10 and gap extension penalty 0.05) and is represented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247864.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. The Neighbor-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA7.0 and visualized by EvolView (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247864.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The phylogenetic tree analysis grouped StbZIPs proteins into 11 clades, designated as groups A to I, S, and U, following those in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among these, groups A and D constituted the largest clades with 11 and 22 members, respectively. StbZIP members were placed within category C and B (3 StbZIPs each), group I (8 StbZIPs), group G (9 StbZIPs), group S (16 StbZIPs), group E (7 StbZIPs), group F (1 StbZIP), and group H (3 StbZIPs) (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247864.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247864.g003">3</xref>). Group A is one of the major groups comprising 11 StbZIPs, (
 <italic>StbZIP</italic>s 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22). It is evident from prior studies that group A StbZIPs have an important role in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and tolerance to abiotic stresses as evident by transcriptional and post-translational regulation of its group members [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Recently, in rice, 
 <italic>OsbZIP23</italic> was reported to have a significant role in tolerance to salinity and drought (ABA-dependent) [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Group D is composed of 22 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic>, one of the largest potato groups. This groupâ€™s genes are primarily involved in plant development and defense-related pathways [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Earlier findings on the bZIP domain containing TGA family (TGACG sequence binding protein) in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco reported a pivotal role in stress defense mechanisms [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The TGA family generally interacts with the Non-Expressor of PR1 (NPR1) proteins, so this protein is a central component in the defense signaling related to salicylic acid [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> TGA2 protein interacts with the xenobiotic responsive promoters that trigger the reaction process linked to salicylic acid pathways. A similar form of the process has been found in tobacco, as pathways are activated by interaction with TGA1a [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Group B and C are among the smallest groups in the potato bZIP family that consists of three StbZIPs. The function-related information of group B is limited. The earlier published reports showed that Group B bZIPs have a transmembrane domain with specific stretches of amino acids at the C-terminus and play significant roles in salt stress response via endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The members of Group C bZIPs have an essential role in modulating seed-specific gene expression [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The rice 
 <italic>OsbZIP52</italic> from group C showed a significant increase in the susceptivity to drought and cold stresses during the seed germination process [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

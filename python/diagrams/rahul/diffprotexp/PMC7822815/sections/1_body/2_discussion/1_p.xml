<p id="Par46">Analyzing modes of malignant dysregulation of the transcriptome usually separates transcriptional from posttranscriptional control mechanisms. Consequently, alterations in splicing patterns have been mainly explored in conjunction with mutations in splicing factors, while investigations regarding mutated or aberrantly expressed transcription factors focused on their impact on transcription

 </sup>. However, most of the latter studies include genome wide transcriptomic analyses such as total RNA-Seq as well

 </sup>. Here, we have extended such transcription-centered studies by analyzing the impact of RUNX1/RUNX1T1, a prototype of a leukemic transcriptional regulator, on the generation of alternative transcripts and found that it controls transcription start site and exon choice. Such changes can be associated with altered protein sequences including the generation of isoforms of yet unknown function as shown here for PARL. We find that RUNX1/RUNX1T1 controls RNA-isoform expression by preventing alternative initiation of transcription and, thus, directly link an initiating and driving oncogenic event with the recently discovered pervasive regulation of transcription through alternative promoters in cancer cells

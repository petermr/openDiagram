0: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) activates an inflammatory response that closely resembles the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is characterized by alterations in cardiovascular and pulmonary function, fever, fluid retention, coagulopathy, and multisystem organ dysfunction/failure (MODS) 5,  6.
1: The degree of morbidity attributed to the post-CPB inflammatory response is correlated to its severity 7.
2: In particular, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) has been associated with this inflammatory response which contributes to post-operative morbidity and mortality 8,  9.

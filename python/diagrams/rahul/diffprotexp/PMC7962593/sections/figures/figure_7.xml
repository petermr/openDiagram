  <p>Identification of persistently dysregulated genes during progression from sepsis to septic shock. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Heatmap of persistently dysregulated genes identified by STEM in the trend: healthy controls &lt; sepsis patients &lt; septic shock patients. Gene sets were arranged based on cluster assignment in order to generate simplified expression profiles. We graphically depicted only five clusters with &gt;10 genes. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The box plots of STEM genes in five clusters. Line plots and box plots were used to display log
   <sub>2</sub> (fold change). Representative genes were highlighted using red lines. Key genes were in significant STEM clustering and located on the right side of the box map. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Expression of key genes were persistently elevated during sepsis development. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Signaling pathways persistently up- or down-regulated as sepsis develops. Red in the heatmap represents an enrichment score greater than 0; blue represents an enrichment score less than 0.

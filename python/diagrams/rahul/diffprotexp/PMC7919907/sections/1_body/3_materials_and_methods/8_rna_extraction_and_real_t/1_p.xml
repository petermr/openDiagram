<p>RNA extraction and RT–PCR were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). About 2.0 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA of viral RNA and host RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Random Hexamer primers. After digestion of genomic DNA with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega), target gene was amplified on a Thermal Fisher QuantStudio
 <sup>TM</sup> 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master mix (carboxy-X-rhodamine; Roche) and following HCoV-NL63 N gene-specific primers (Forward: 5'-CTGTTACTTTGGCTTTAAAGAACTTAGG-3’; Reverse: 5'-CTCACTATCAAAGAATAACGCAGCCTG-3’) or HCoV-OC43 N gene-specific primers (Forward: 5'-CGATGAGGCTATTCCGACTAGGT-3’; Reverse: 5'- CCTTCCTGAGCCTTCAATATAGTAACC-3’). GAPDH was also amplified to serve as a control using human GAPDH-specific primers (GAPDH-F: 5′-ACACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTG-3′ and GAPDH-R: 5′-CACCACCCT GTTGCTGTAGCC-3′). The amplification conditions were: 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. Melting curve analysis was performed to verify the specificity of each amplification. All experiments were repeated three times independently.

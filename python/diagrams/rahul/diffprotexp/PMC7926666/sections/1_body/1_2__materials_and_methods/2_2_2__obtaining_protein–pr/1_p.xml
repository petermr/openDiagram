<p>Physical PPI data experimentally detected in humans was obtained from the BioGRID database using the latest version (v. 4.0.189) [
 <xref rid="B12-jpm-11-00158" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The data contained 51,745 PPIs among 10,177 human proteins. After filtering the PPI data for proteins encoded by genes having transcriptome data in TCGA datasets, a network was reconstructed with 34,604 PPIs among 8322 proteins.

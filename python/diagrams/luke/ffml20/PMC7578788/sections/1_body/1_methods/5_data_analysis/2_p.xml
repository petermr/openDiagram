<p id="Par23">Based on our interest in motor preparation, we computed the mean spectral power during the reaction time between target presentation and movement initiation. In the case of the cats, as we had access to electromyographic (EMG) data from the Cleidobrachialis Flexor, responsible for lifting the forelimb, we were able to determine a suitable location for the window from the trial averaged EMG traces. The flexor muscle is consistently quiescent when the animal is sitting quietly but has a robust ramping activity during reaching that onsets prior to the timestamp of the paw lift (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Thus, a 200 ms window was positioned immediately prior to this ramping activity (Cats B and G: 400–200 ms prior to paw lift. Cat S: 100–300 ms prior to paw lift). As we did not have access to the equivalent EMG data for human participants, the full reaction time period was used.

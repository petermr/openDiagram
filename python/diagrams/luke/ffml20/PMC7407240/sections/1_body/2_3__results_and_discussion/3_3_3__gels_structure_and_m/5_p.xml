<p>A smooth and homogeneous morphology can be observed for the PVA hydrogel, with macropores ranging from 8 to 15 μm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-01544-f006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, for the ι-carrageenan hydrogel surface, no apparent porosity was observed, implying a different gelation mechanism for this polymer, in contrast to PVA. In PVA solutions, freezing induces the formation of two bicontinuous phases: a polymer-rich swollen phase in which crystallites (i.e., crosslinking points) are formed, and a free freezable water-rich phase, which shapes the network’s pore morphology [

Carrageenan, like other hydrocolloids, forms freestanding thermoreversible gels above a critical concentration value, when the macromolecules come in close proximity with one another, forming weakly associated regions (junction zones), which are responsible for the very low value of the gel content (

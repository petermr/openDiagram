 <caption> Representative images of 2D-DIGE analytical gel and 3D view of protein spots in vehicle and AAS-treated GT1-7 cells. (A) Twenty-three (23) protein spots were identified as differentially expressed in GT1-7 cells that were exposed to the AAS, 17α-meT (1μM). Protein samples were labeled with Cy5 (red), whereas those from the internal standard were labeled with Cy3 (green). After merging, protein spots exhibiting no changes appear yellow in DIGE images, underexpressed proteins appear in green, and overexpressed proteins are in red. White numbers and arrows correspond to the identified proteins in Tables 1 and 2. ( B-C) Panels depict the protein spots’ abundance of (B) overexpressed and (C) underexpressed protein spots analyzed by DeCyder software. Purple lines encircle peaks representing protein spots from AAS-treated samples (left panels) or control vehicle (center panels). Protein abundance was calculated from normalized spot volume, standardized against the in-gel standard of each gel (right panels). </caption>

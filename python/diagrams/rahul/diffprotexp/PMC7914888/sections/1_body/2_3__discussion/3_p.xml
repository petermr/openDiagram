<p>p16 is mutated in B16 cells [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (not shown data); therefore, we decided to evaluate the expression of 
 <italic>p21</italic> to understand the decrease in proliferation induced by L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU. Cells exposed to L-Tyr increase the 
 <italic>p21</italic> expression with an rER 2.7 ± 0.4 (2.7 X), and cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU decrease 
 <italic>p21</italic> with an rER of 0.67 ± 0.1 (1.5 X) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f005">Figure 5</xref>j). This increase in 
 <italic>p21</italic> would explain, at least in part, the decrease in the S phase for cells exposed to L-Tyr (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>e), while the reduction of p21 is related to the arrest in G2/M in 
 <italic>CdK2</italic> in 5-Brd-2′-dU (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>e) [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. CDK2 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that participates in the late transition of G1/S by binding to cyclin E [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and in the passage of G2/M by binding to cyclin A [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The late participation of p21 in regulating the cell cycle under exposure to 5-Brd-2′-dU [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] agrees with its high expression after seven days of maintaining the treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f005">Figure 5</xref>m).

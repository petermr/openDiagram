0: Following transfection, 5  10 4 cells were harvested and replated in the upper compartment of Transwell chambers (8-m pore size, Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States) in serum-free medium.
1: For invasion assay, the upper chambers were coated with 50 L of 0.5 mg/mL Matrigel .
2: Fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower chamber.
3: The fetal bovine serum-containing medium in the lower chamber serves as a chemoattractant for cell migration.
4: After incubation for 36 h, the cells in the lower membrane were fixed with methanol for 30 min and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
5: Three 20 magnification fields were randomly chosen to count the cell number under a microscope.

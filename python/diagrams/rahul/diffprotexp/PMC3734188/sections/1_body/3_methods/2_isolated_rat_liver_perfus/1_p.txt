1: The procedure for isolated liver perfusion was similar to that described in a previous publication [ 3].
2: The perfusion conditions were in accordance with the standards proposed by Bessems [ 5].
3: The perfusate medium was freshly prepared Krebs/Henseleit- bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) saturated with a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide (95:5).
4: Perfusion flow was mantained at a rate of 3 ml/min.g liver weight.
5: The perfusion temperature was maintained at 37C.

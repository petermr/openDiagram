On the other hand, farnecene and isocaryophyllene were identified in a total percentage of 2&#160;%, these belong to the hydrocarbon sesquiterpenoid group of essential oils. Oxygenated sesquiterpenoid was found only as nerolidol (0.17&#160;%). Other compounds that are not terpenoid were identified such as 3-octanol (4.38&#160;%) and 3-octanone (1.42&#160;%).</p>

<p id="Par7">Given the potent inhibitory effects of metformin in bladder cancer cell growth, we evaluated its antitumor activity in vivo using nude mice bearing UMUC3-luc orthotopic models (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6a</xref>). Intravesical metformin substantially decelerated tumor growth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1m</xref>) and significantly reduced the weight of bladders (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6b, c</xref>). Furthermore, metformin treated mice showed reduced lipogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6d</xref>). H&amp;E and Ki67 staining demonstrated that metformin effectively inhibited tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6d</xref>). Meanwhile, we found that metformin decreased Clusterin, SREBP-1c, and FASN levels (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6d</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated that metformin blocked bladder cancer growth and inhibited lipogenesis-associated proteins in orthotopic models which were established by high expressed Clusterin UMUC3 cell line.

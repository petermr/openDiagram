0: The human EC cell line HEC-1A (moderately differentiated grade 2 adenocarcinoma; HTB112, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) [ 40,  41] was cultured in Eagles minimal essential medium (MEM, 5.5 mmol/L glucose, equivalent to 100 mg/dL; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 g/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin G (Gibco) at 37C and 5% CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere.
1: Cells were subcultured by detachment with 0.25% (v/v) trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Gibco) once a week and the medium was changed every 23 days.
2: Experiments were carried out in 25 cm 2 cell culture flasks (Greiner, Kremsmunster, Austria) with a seeding density of 1.0  10 5 cells in 5 mL medium in duplicates.
3: After seeding, cells were allowed to attach and grow for 24 h before treatment.

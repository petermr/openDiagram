<p>The entire collection of 48 corticotroph tumors was subjected to miRNA expression profiling with next-generation sequencing of a small RNA fraction. Sequencing of small RNA libraries produced approximately 2,497,367 reads per sample, which were mapped to the human genome (hg19) and used for quantification of expression levels of known miRNAs, according to miRBase 22 release. Sequencing reads were annotated to 1917 miRNAs. Measurements of 1902 mature miRNAs were included in the analysis, after filtering out the miRNAs with low expression.</p>

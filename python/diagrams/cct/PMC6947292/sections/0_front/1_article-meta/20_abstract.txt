0: For aluminium alloys, precipitation strengthening is controlled by age-hardening heat treatments, including solution treatment, quenching, and ageing.
1: In terms of technological applications, quenching is considered a critical step, because detrimental quench-induced precipitation must be avoided to exploit the full age-hardening potential of the alloy.
2: The alloy therefore needs to be quenched faster than a critical cooling rate, but slow enough to avoid undesired distortion and residual stresses.
3: These contrary requirements for quenching can only be aligned based on detailed knowledge of the kinetics of quench-induced precipitation.
4: Until the beginning of the 21st century, the kinetics of relevant solid-solid phase transformations in aluminium alloys could only be estimated by ex-situ testing of different properties.
5: Over the past ten years, significant progress has been achieved in this field of materials science, enabled by the development of highly sensitive differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques.
6: This review presents a comprehensive report on the solid-solid phase transformation kinetics in Al alloys covering precipitation and dissolution reactions during heating from different initial states, dissolution during solution annealing and to a vast extent quench-induced precipitation during continuous cooling over a dynamic cooling rate range of ten orders of magnitude.
7: The kinetic analyses are complemented by sophisticated micro- and nano-structural analyses and continuous cooling precipitation (CCP) diagrams are derived.
8: The measurement of enthalpies released by quench-induced precipitation as a function of the cooling rate also enables predictions of the quench sensitivities of Al alloys using physically-based models.
9: Various alloys are compared, and general aspects of quench-induced precipitation in Al alloys are derived.

  <caption> Supplementary file1 Effects of DCVC on cell cycle progression. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0 (control), 10 μM or 20 μM DCVC for 12 h. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, as described in the methods section. A) Graphical representation of cell cycle phase distribution. B) Representative cell cycle distribution histograms generated by flow cytometry and table showing percentage of cells in each phase per treatment group. Dark red represents G1/0 phase, stripes represent S phase and light red represents G2/0 phase. Bars represent means ± SEM. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (no significant interaction) with posthoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons. N=3 independent experiments (TIF 443 KB) </caption>

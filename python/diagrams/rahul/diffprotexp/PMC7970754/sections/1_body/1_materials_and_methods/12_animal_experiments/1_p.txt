0: Nine nude mice were divided into three groups (n = 3) by random grouping into the blank control (Ctrl), RSV, and RSV + POLD1-OE groups.
1: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/POLD-OE cells in logarithmic growth-phase were prepared as a suspension of 1  107 cells per ml, and 0.1 ml was inoculated subcutaneously into the right lateral axillae of the nude mice.
2: After pinching, the pinholes were clamped with tweezers to prevent cell fluid from leaking.
3: The injection site was observed for ulceration and swelling daily and was ready for use after about 1 week of subcutaneous inoculation.
4: The solvent in the control group was intraperitoneally injected with a 100 l mixture of PEG400: DMSO: sterile deionized water [1: 1: 3].
5: The RSV group and the RSV + POLD1-OE group were then injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg RSV containing PEG400: DMSO: sterile deionized water [1: 1: 3] mixed solution ( 36,  37).
6: After subcutaneous tumorigenesis (generally on the 7th day), the drug was given every other day 8 times.

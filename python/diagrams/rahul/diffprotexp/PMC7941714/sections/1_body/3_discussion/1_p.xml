<p id="Par51">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Increasing evidence has shown that dysregulated lncRNAs or lncRNA-mediated ceRNA networks are involved in the progression and prognosis of the CRC. LncRNAs suppress miRNA-induced translational inhibition of gene expression by competitively binding to miRNA response elements. In recent years, they have gained wide attention due to their important roles in tumor progression, patient prognosis, and immune infiltration [

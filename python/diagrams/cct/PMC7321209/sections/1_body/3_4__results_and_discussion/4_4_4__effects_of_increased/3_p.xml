<p>To correlate process adaptations and resulting metallurgical properties of the previously built structures (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f011">Figure 11</xref>), cooling rates of the set layers were analyzed during WAAM with adapted CTWD. Therefore, t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times were recorded layer wise by IR imaging. The analysis was carried out on each of the first 10 layers due to strongly varying cooling rates. This can be explained by heat conduction to the substrate, which featured room temperature in the initial state. As a result, an increasing number of layers led to heat accumulation and rising temperatures in the substrate until a quasi-stationary condition of heat input and heat transfer was reached. During the manufacturing of the following 10 layers, measurements were carried out in every second layer. Finally, every 10th layer was recorded with the exception of layer 35, which is the center of the structure.

 <sub>8/5</sub>-times during WAAM depending on the layer height and the set CTWD.

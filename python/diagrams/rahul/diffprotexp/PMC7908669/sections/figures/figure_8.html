 <caption> Silencing of circ_0003865 suppresses OP pathogenesis in a mouse model. a Decreased circ_0003865 expression in BMSCs caused by infection with adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying sh-circ_0003865 sequences. Relative expression of circ_0003865 as measured by qRT-PCR. b Transfection of circ_0003865-silencing AAVs into bone tissues of the mouse OP model established by ovariectomy. The infection of AAVs in bone tissues was observed by immunofluorescence (magnification: × 200, scale bar: 0.5 μm). c Silencing of circ_0003865 restored the femur densities in the mice OP model. Femur densities were analyzed by micro-CT examination. d Bone microstructure parameters in the mouse OP model. The Siemens Preclinical Imaging System was used to detect BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, trabecular pattern factor, and bone mineral density of the mouse bones. e Relative expression of circ_0003865, miR-3653-3p, GAS1, ALP, RUNX2, and OPN mRNAs in bone tissues of the mouse OP model. qRT-PCR was used to measure relative expression. f Changes in GAS1, ALP, RUNX2, and OPN protein levels in bone tissues of the mouse OP model. In situ protein expression in mouse bone tissues as detected by immunofluorescence (magnification: × 200, scale bar: 0.5 μm) Sh-NC: negative control; OP: osteoporosis; BV/TV: bone volume/total volume; Tb.N: trabecular number; Tb.Th: trabecular thickness; Tb.Sp: trabecular separation; GAS1: growth arrest-specific gene 1; ALP: alkaline phosphatase; RUNX2: runt-related transcription factor 2; OPN: osteopontin; * P &lt; 0.05 </caption>

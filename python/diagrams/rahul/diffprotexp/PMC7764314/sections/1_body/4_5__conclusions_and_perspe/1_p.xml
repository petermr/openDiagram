<p>Disentangling molecular interactions underlying cancer properties may help in understanding and predicting cancer behaviour, selecting therapeutic targets and efficacious drugs to be employed for treatments. In this, gene co-expression networks and, even more, 
 <italic>differential</italic> co-expression networks have shown a strong potential. A wealth of different methods has been developed (

<p>Simultaneously, the results of GO analysis showed that 854 enriched GO terms in the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories, particularly in the tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway, tube formation, regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and more. Similarly, KEGG analysis found that 93 pathways were enriched, especially RNA degradation, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and apoptosis. The top 30 enriched GO terms and pathways are shown in

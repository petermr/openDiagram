 <caption> Operando Fourier transformed Cu K-edge EXAFS spectra showing the gradual reduction of Cu oxide films grown on a Cu foil via an oxygen-plasma treatment under CO 2RR conditions (in 0.1 M KHCO 3 and at −1.2 V vs RHE). Reproduced from ref ( 364) under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. Time-resolved Cu K-edge (b) XANES and (c) FT-EXAFS spectra showing the reduction of unsupported Cu 2O nanocubes under CO 2RR conditions (in 0.1 M KHCO 3 and at −0.6 V or −0.95 V vs RHE). XANES LCA and EXAFS fits are shown in panel d and demonstrate that even after several hours under a reducing potential, a non-negligible fraction of Cu species remains in Cu(I) state.

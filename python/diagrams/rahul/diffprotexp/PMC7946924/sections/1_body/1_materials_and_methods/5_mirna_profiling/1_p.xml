<p id="Par11">Profiling of miRNA was done in the RNA extracts obtained from 12 spikelet samples, six each from groups 1 (SR-159) and 2 (SR-157) plants. Spikelets were sampled from apical and basal portions of the panicle separately on three occasions at 5-day intervals from 0 to 10 days after flowering. Each of these samples was a pooled mixture from spikelets of three individual panicles obtained from the three biological replicates. The 12 RNA samples from two different groups were sequenced followed by length filtering, adapter trimming and elimination having no match. After homology search, the resulting pool of miRNA were categorised into either common or unique miRNA based on their presence in the different days after flowering. Sequencing was done in Illumina single end read chemistry. The raw data of length 75 bp was generated on Illumina platform and received in FASTQ format. Srna workbench V3.0_ALPHA was used to trim adapter and performed length filtering in the range of minimum length 16 bp and maximum 40 bp. To obtain final reads, the exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) low quality reads (&lt; q30), (2) reads without 3′ or 5′ adapters, (3) reads without insert, (4) reads &lt; 16 bp and &gt; 40 bp, (5) reads not matching to reference genome, (6) reads matching to other ncRNAs (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and piRNA) by referring to NCBI nucleotide database and Rfam version-12 RNA family database which represent multiple sequence alignments, consensus secondary structures and covariance models

 </sup>. Maximum numbers of reads were obtained with sequences of 24 bp (Supplementary Fig.

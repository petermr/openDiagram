<p id="Par26">DEGs from several pathways shown in the interaction network obtained from the STRING database emphasized that ovary development which is a major determinant of prolificacy in sheep, may be regulated by multiple genes from different signalling pathways. The unique miRNAs and lncRNAs identified in this study may serve as potential selection signatures for identifying new candidate genes, and novel candidate regions involved in ovary development of Hu sheep. Our study provides valuable evidence for further molecular research on ovary development in the Hu sheep breed. However, further studies are needed to investigate the functional roles of some of the selected DEGs, especially novel genes identified in the Hu sheep ovaries.</p>

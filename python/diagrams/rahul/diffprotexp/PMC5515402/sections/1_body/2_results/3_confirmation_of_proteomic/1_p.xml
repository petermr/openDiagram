<p>In order to validate proteins that were differentially expressed in GT1-7 cells by AAS, we performed western blotting on cell lysates for several proteins in different categories. We found that all proteins tested by Western blots were expressed in GT1-7 cells. These were: GSTM1, GAPDH/G3P, ERH, PEBP1, and PDIA6. Thereafter, we performed Western blots to GT1-7 cell lysates in order to determine the expression of these proteins after steroid treatment. We confirmed that similar to the proteomic results, treatment with 17α-meT increased the expression of GSTM1 and G3P (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180409.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). PDIA6 was observed to be underexpressed in Western blots, while 2D-DIGE revealed overexpression. Finally, in order to evaluate modulatory effects of AAS in classical endocrine substrates, we interrogated the expression of AR, ER and GnRH, as well as proteins associated to signaling pathway proteins (p-ERK, ERK, p-p38 and AKT). Densitometry analyses showed that 17α-meT did not significantly change AR (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180409.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) were decreased. Regarding the expression of signaling proteins, AAS exposure increased p-ERK expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180409.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), while p-p38 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180409.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) was downregulated. On the other hand, expression of the non-phosphorylated forms, ERK and AKT did not change, as observed by the % of change over control (data not shown).

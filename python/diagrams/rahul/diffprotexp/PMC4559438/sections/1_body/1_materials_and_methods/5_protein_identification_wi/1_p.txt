0: Among the exclusive spots identified by 2-DE image analysis, protein components of the 10 most prominent spots were investigated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).
1: For 2-DE gel mapping, major proteins were identified by mass finger printing.
2: Protein spots excised from 2-DE gels were destained, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), as previously described [ 15].
3: For MALDI-TOF MS analyses, peptides were concentrated with a POROS R2, Oligo R3 column (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA).
4: After washing the column with 70% acetonitrile, 100% acetonitrile, and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, samples were applied to the R2, R3 column and eluted onto the MALDI plate (Opti-TOF 384-well Insert, Applied Biosystems) with cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 70% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid [ 16].
5: MALDI-TOF MS was performed on 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 355 nm Nd:YAG laser.
6: The pressure in the TOF analyzer was approximately 7.6 x 10 7 Torr.
7: Mass spectra were obtained in the reflectron mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, summed from 500 laser pulses, and calibrated using the 4700 calibration mixture (Applied Biosystems).
8: Proteins were identified from the peptide mass maps using MASCOT ( http://www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html), which searched the 115,818 entries in the protein databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant human database (downloaded on 05/09/2009).

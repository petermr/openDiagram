0: Isoelectric point (IP) and molecular weight (MW) were determined for all spots in the two-dimensional gels with the software ImageMaster 2D Platinum v.7.0 (GE Healthcare).
1: These data were compared with the  T.  solium secretome ( Fig 1).
2: A protein in  T.  solium secretome with matching IP and MW was selected for each spot in the gels [ 12].

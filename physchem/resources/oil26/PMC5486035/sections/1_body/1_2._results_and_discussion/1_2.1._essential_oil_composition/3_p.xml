<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A total of 40 volatile constituents were identified, fully characterized, and grouped in four classes: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and others (non-terpenoidic compounds). The major components of HEO were 4-Carene (31.743%), &#945;-Pinene (23.584%), <sc>d</sc>-Limonene (8.002%), and 3-Carene (7.731%), all monoterpenes hydrocarbons that represented 86.591% of the HEO, followed by oxygenated monoterpenes, which presented an average value of 8.235% with &#945;-Terpineol (4.036%), Borneol (0.831%), and &#945;-Pinene oxide (0.787%) as the main compounds.</p>

<p>In summary, a Ti-based BMGCs containing β-Ti was developed in the Ti-Zr-Cu-Co-Be system, and its glassy matrix can solidify into fully glassy ingots up to 150 g. A two-phase quasi-equilibrium is established during continuous cooling and determines the microstructural evolution in terms of composition of the constituent phases as well as their volume fractions. Also its dependence on the cooling rate can be understood by assuming this quasi-equilibrium between two metastable phases. The nature of the two-phase quasi-equilibrium and a steep liquidus line near the temperature at which diffusion is effectively suppressed,

 <sub>3.0</sub>Be
 <sub>12.5</sub>). The influence of designed β-Ti mole fractions on the microstructures of BMGCs can also be understood based on the two-phase quasi-equilibrium. By carefully modifying the composition the respective volume fractions of the composite can be predicted and composite microstructures can thus be tailored. Moreover, the size of the dendrites can be adjusted by choosing the appropriate cooling rate for a given alloy while the volume fractions remain constant. In this way, one has a large degree of freedom in designing BMGCs. We envision that the two-phase quasi-equilibrium has scientific significance for the understanding of BMGCs with various microstructures.

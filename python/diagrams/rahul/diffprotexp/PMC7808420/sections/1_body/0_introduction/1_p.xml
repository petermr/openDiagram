 <italic>St. Louis Encephalitis virus</italic> (SLEV) is a neglected reemerging mosquito-borne virus serologically related to other relevant encephalitic flaviviruses such as

 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Disease caused by SLEV is mostly asymptomatic or characterized by flu/dengue-like symptoms [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yet, severe disease pathogenesis is associated to an acute inflammatory process set in the central nervous system (CNS) [

 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Symptoms include intense headache and neurological alterations such as memory loss, disorientation and meningoencephalitis. Mortality rates in severe cases may reach up to 20% with possible sequelae to survivors [

<p>The XAS experiment consists of measuring the absorption coefficient for X-rays as a function of the energy of the incident X-ray photons. While conceptually simple, XAS experiments put stringent requirements on the X-ray source and optical elements, since a broad spectrum of the incident radiation is needed (with bandwidth of up to 1–2 keV), while simultaneously allowing for accurate energy selection with energy resolution up to a fraction of an eV. Moreover, a signal-to-noise ratio better than 1000 is required to extract the EXAFS component of the absorption spectra. Thus, to collect spectra in reasonable time, very high intensity of the incoming radiation is required, with ∼10
 <sup>10</sup> photons per second per eV or better.

0: The marginal likelihood of the output given the input can be obtained through the marginalization and the model is selected by updating the hyperparameters during training through the maximization of the marginal-likelihood (or log-marginal-likelihood).
1: The set of hyperparameters should ideally converge to a global optimum.

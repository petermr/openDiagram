<p>For some systems, information about the oxidation state can be obtained from the analysis of pre-edge features. Because pre-edge features arise due to transitions to unoccupied localized states, XAS spectra for metals typically do not have them, while they are common for oxidized absorbing atoms, and are also quite sensitive to the oxidation state.

 </sup> For example, Cu K-edge XANES has no pre-edge feature for Cu(I) species due to a completely filled 3d orbital (d
 <sup>10</sup> state).

 </sup> For the Cu(II) state, there is a single hole in the 3d orbital, and a pre-edge feature can be observed at ∼8980 eV,

 </sup> Similarly, the analysis of the shape and position of pre-edge features in the Fe K-edge is a powerful tool to discriminate between Fe(II) and Fe(III) species and is used, for example, in environmental science.

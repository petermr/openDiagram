<p>Helium (purity 99.999%) with flow rate of 0.9 ml/min was employed as the carrier gas. The column oven temperature was incresed from 50 °C (hold 1 min) to 240 °C (hold 10 min) with the rate of 5 °C/min. The injector and FID detector temperatures were aslo 230 and 300 °C, respectively. The injector was operated in the split less mode and programmed to return to the split mode after 1 min from the beginning of the run. Diluted samples (1/10 in ether, v/v) of 0.3 μL were injected manually, and the split ratio was adjusted to 50:1.</p>

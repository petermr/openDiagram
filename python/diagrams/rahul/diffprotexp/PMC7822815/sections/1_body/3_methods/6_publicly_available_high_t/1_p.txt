0: Our public microarray dataset included data on 106 primary samples of bone marrow or peripheral blood from patients with t(8;21)-positive AML, and 85 samples of bone marrow-derived CD34-positive cells (BM), 32 samples of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) and 100 samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNC) from healthy donors (Supplementary Data  1).
1: CEL files of the selected microarrays were downloaded from the NCBI GEO repository 67, converted into CHP files, and primary data matrix was corrected against the background, log2-transformed and quantile normalized by the robust multi-array averaging algorithm using Affymetrix Expression Console TM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, USA).

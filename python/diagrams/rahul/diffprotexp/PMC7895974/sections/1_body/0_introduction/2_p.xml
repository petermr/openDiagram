<p id="Par4">In addition, somite derivatives exhibit regional differences depending on their anterior–posterior axial position. Regional identity is already established at gastrula stages and is controlled by the stepwise transcriptional activation of 
 <italic>HOX</italic> gene expression

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. For example, members of the 
 <italic>HOXB</italic> cluster are first activated in a temporal colinear fashion in prospective paraxial mesoderm, prior to ingression through the primitive streak

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. The colinear activation of 
 <italic>HOX</italic> genes culminates in nested expression domains within the paraxial mesoderm, thereby conferring regional identity along the axis

 <italic>HOX</italic> clusters has been investigated
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. It has also been shown that posterior Wnt signalling and CDX transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of the “trunk” 
 <italic>HOX</italic> genes in the centre of 
 <italic>HOX</italic> clusters
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. In particular, CDX2 is essential for axial elongation with mutations leading to posterior truncations associated with changes in 
 <italic>HOX</italic> expression domains
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. CDX activity is associated with histone acetylation and mediates chromatin accessibility of regulatory elements

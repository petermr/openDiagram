<p>Principal component analysis (PCA)
 <xref rid="anie201914760-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> indicates that three independent principal components are needed to reproduce the entire data set, yielding 99.9 % total variance, as shown in Figure S4. Subsequently pure spectral components were reconstructed via multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR‐ALS).
 <xref rid="anie201914760-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> The EXAFS spectra indicate that component 1 and component 3 can be easily fitted with the structure of pristine FeNCN and the iron nanoparticles, as shown in Figure S6 and S7, respectively. Component 2 represents the ternary intermediate, which reaches its maximum concentration at about one third of the first discharge (Figure S5 b), and can therefore be successfully fitted by the theoretical structure of Li

 <sub>3</sub> structure derived from the Li
 <sub>2</sub>NCN supercell possess a more negative ICOHP value (meaning stronger bonding, −1.84 eV) than the ones in the FeNCN supercell (−1.46 eV). In other words, the good agreement of the DFT‐predicted structure with the experimental spectra confirms the formation of an intermediate yet amorphous phase compatible with the local structure of Li

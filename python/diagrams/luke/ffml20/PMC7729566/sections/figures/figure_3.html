 <caption> ( A) RDFs of the CH 3COOH···Cl − with increasing water content (reference atoms for acetic acid were OH) and ( B) corresponding coordination numbers (region 1 and 3 are monophasic whilst region 2 corresponds to the experimentally determined biphasic regime). ( C) A representative snapshot of water-in-IL hydrated clusters for 5.1 wt.% H 2O. ( D) Spatial density function plots of the various system components around acetic acid for three water concentrations (Cl −—blue; [P 44414] +—yellow; CH 3COOH—red; H 2O—cyan). </caption>

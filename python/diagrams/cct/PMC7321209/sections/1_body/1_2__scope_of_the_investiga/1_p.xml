<p>The objective of this study was the reduction of energy input during WAAM with gas metal arc welding throughout the systematic extension of the contact tube to work piece distance. Thereby, effects on droplet transfer such as resulting droplet diameter or detaching frequency were analyzed by high velocity video recording. Moreover, measurements of welding current and voltage were analyzed to record the resulting reduction of energy input during additive manufacturing. Moreover, investigations on the microstructure and grain size as well as mechanical properties such as material hardness were carried out on low-alloyed steel. Finally, the analysis of cooling rates of the set layers enabled the correlation of interactions between the process strategy and mechanical properties of the built structures.</p>

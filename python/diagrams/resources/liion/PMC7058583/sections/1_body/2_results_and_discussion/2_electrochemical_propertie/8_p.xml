<p>The excellent electrochemical performance of the 3D flower-like composites was further verified by the EIS measurements. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows the Nyquist plots of the 3D flower-like composite electrodes after different cycles. All Nyquist plots were semi-circular at the high frequencies and oblique in the low frequencies. The semicircle reflected the charge-transfer impedance on electrode (R
 <sub>ct</sub>), and the slope line in the low-frequency range represented the Warburg impedance (W) associated with the diffusion process of lithium ions (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The Randles equivalent circuit inserted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> simulated the corresponding electrochemical system, where CPE represents the double-layer capacitance and Rs is the ohmic resistance. The fresh 3D flower-like composite electrodes exhibited a small semi-circular with a slight increase after 500 cycles. This indicated that the 3D flower-like composite electrodes possessed lower charge-transfer resistance and long-term cycling stability. Their lower charge-transfer resistance is due to the good conductivity of rGO. Furthermore, their unique 3D layered sandwich structure also facilitates rapid transfer of lithium ions upon cycling. Assisted by PEO chains buffering, the robust rGO interlayers effectively suppressed the volume expansion of MoS
 <sub>2</sub> and ensured a good cycling performance. In addition, the ultrathin MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets also accommodated a high tolerance to structure changes. Their unique 3D flower-like sandwich structure provided more active sites for the interface reaction between active materials and the lithium-ions, which endowed the final electrodes with a high reversible capacity.

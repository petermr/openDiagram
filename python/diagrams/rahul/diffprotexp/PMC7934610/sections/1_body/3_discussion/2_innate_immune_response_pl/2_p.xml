<p>In this study, we found that when Kazakh sheep were infected with oncospheres, the expression of 
 <italic>CLEC9A</italic>, 
 <italic>CLEC10A</italic>, and 
 <italic>CLEC4G</italic> genes was significantly higher in the CE-R group than in the CE-NR group. All these genes are C-type lectin receptor family members, which has been demonstrated for immunomodulatory effects against parasitic infections in the epithelial layer [
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Reports have shown that upregulation of C-type lectin genes is beneficial to recognition of parasite antigens, thus activating antigen presentation more effectively [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which has a positive effect on disease resistance [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Based on these reports and our findings, we speculated that the high regulation of lectin receptor genes in the intestinal tissue may enhance the recognition of parasite antigens and present them to the internal immune cells, which can induce the immune system to kill the parasite. This effect was more significant in the CE-R sheep than in the CE-NR sheep, and it may lead to different 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> resistance of Kazakh sheep with different MHC genotypes.

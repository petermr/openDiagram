<p>Our previous study revealed that XIAP is overexpressed in the Caki-1 cell line (
 <xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is easier to display the differentially expressed proteins if only one cell line is used for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Therefore, the Caki-1 cell line with XIAP overexpression was selected for the present study. Through the construction of a plasmid, along with cell transfection, the stably transfected XIAP-knockdown Caki-1 cell line was obtained. Additionally, iTRAQ proteomic bio mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteins that were differentially expressed between the Caki-1 cells with XIAP overexpression and those with XIAP-knockdown. Combining the GO database and the KEGG pathway, the proteins that were significantly altered prior to and following apoptosis stimulation at 0, 0.5 and 3 h were classified. According to the biological processes and pathways involved, the biological behaviors of RCC cells, in which XIAP is possibly involved, were summarized.

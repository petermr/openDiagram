<p id="Par6">We found that beta frequency power recorded over the motor cortex as scalp EEG in humans, or directly from the primary motor cortex as LFP activity in cats, was reduced prior to movement in trials in the early adaptation phase of a joystick visuomotor adaptation task (humans) or when target mis-reaches occurred in a prism visuomotor adaptation task (cats). These changes in beta power wereÂ not related to kinematics of the reach, consistent with a role of reduced beta activity in the motor cortex reflecting adaptive drive. Interestingly, in both cases the effect was restricted to early adaptation, but not the early phase of the aftereffect (in which targeting errors also occur), suggesting a dissociation in neuronal activity between adaptation and washout periods.</p>

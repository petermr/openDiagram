0: The quantitative analysis of the essential oil was carried out using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 6,890 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20 m  0.18 mm; 0.18 m).
1: The oven temperature was programmed to 50C for 3.2 min, then heated to 300C at a rate of 10C/min.
2: The temperatures of the injector and the flame ionization detector (FID) were maintained at 280C.
3: The essential oils were diluted in acetone to 3.5% (v/v) and injected in split mode (1/60); hydrogen was used as the carrier gas (1 ml/min), and the injection volume was 1 l. At the same time, a solution of  nalkanes (C8C30) was analyzed under the same conditions to calculate retention indices (RI) using the Van den Dool and Kratz equation (Van Del Dool & Kratz,  1963).
4: The relative concentrations of the compounds were calculated from the peak area obtained by gas chromatography without using correction factors.

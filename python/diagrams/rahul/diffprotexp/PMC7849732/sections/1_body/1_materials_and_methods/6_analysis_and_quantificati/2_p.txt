0: Here we analyzed the optical density (OD) of GluN2 immunoreactivity in the CGRP-positive (CGRP+) SDH versus the remaining DDH.
1: Despite the majority of afferent CGRP fibers terminating in the SDH, a few CGRP fibers penetrate and synapse into the deeper laminae (laminae IIIVI), resulting in minor positive CGRP staining in the DDH.
2: For simplicity, given that the strongest CGRP staining is visualized in the SDH, we referred to the SDH as the CGRP+ region, whereas we referred to the DDH as the CGRP-negative (CGRP) region.
3: We selected the CGRP+ area by drawing a contour along the dorsal edge of the dorsal horn and then along the more ventral border of the main CGRP-positive staining (excluding the dorsal root and the deeper laminae).
4: We then made a second selection corresponding to the CGRP area, which terminates in proximity of the beginning of the central canal.
5: To assess the relative expression of the GluN2-NMDAR subunits, we measured the OD of the cy-3 stained areas in the CGRP+ and CGRP regions using the software Fiji ImageJ.
6: We normalized these OD values to their respective areas.
7: Furthermore, we subsequently normalized OD/area values to the background (BG)/area values by measuring the OD within a square selection (55 x 55 m) positioned in the deep dorsal column of white matter where there was minimal punctate GluN2-positive signal.
8: We measured the BG values in the white matter instead of the gray matter as the GluN2 subunit staining was extensive throughout the gray matter regions and so this prevented the selection of a GluN2-negatively stained BG region in the gray matter.

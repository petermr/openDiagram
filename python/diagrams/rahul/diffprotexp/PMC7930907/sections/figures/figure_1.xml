  <p>Functional annotation of upregulated DEGs among SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The gene content is aligned between EASCs vs. SASCs with PASCs vs. SASCs. The intersection set of experiments is defined as “common” and marked as a blue/white striped bar. The unique genes for the experiments are marked as colored bars. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Top 10 pathway map analysis (left panel), Gene Ontology (GO) process analysis (middle panel), and process networks (right panel) analysis sorting as differentially affected for different sets of DEGs. Star filling with different colors represent the significant enrichment. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Top scored network analysis of common upregulated DEGs. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Top scored network analysis of unique upregulated DEGs in PASCs. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Top scored network analysis of unique upregulated DEGs in EASCs.

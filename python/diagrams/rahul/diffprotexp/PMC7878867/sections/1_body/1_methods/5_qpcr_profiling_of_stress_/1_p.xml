<p id="Par13">A total of eight stress-responsive miRNAs and 12 target genes were selected for qPCR analysis in DBA Artemis and DBA Aurora. These candidates were selected for their predicted biological functions associated with stress response and plant growth, potentially contributing to the transgenerational effects. cDNA was synthesised from treated total RNA samples with the MystiCq microRNA cDNA Synthesis Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described

 </sup>. The relative gene expression level was calculated using the durum wheat GAPDH gene as the reference gene. Data was represented as mean ± SE (three biological replicates). The three biological replicates were randomly chosen from the six biological replicates used for pooling in next-generation sequencing libraries. One-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance across treatment groups at

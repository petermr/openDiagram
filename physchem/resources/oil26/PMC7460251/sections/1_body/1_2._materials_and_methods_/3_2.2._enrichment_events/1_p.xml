<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We chose seven enrichment items to encourage two main behavioral goals: foraging and exploring the environment (<xref rid="animals-10-01433-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These items were all previously approved through the DZS enrichment approval process and were not novel to the aardvarks. Enrichment items usually were distributed between 21:00 and 22:00 each night. Each item was assigned to a day of the week to create a recurring schedule that was repeated for eight weeks, allowing each aardvark to receive each item in each habitat four times. As the aardvarks were accustomed to receiving enrichment daily, and we did not want to impact their welfare negatively by removing a potentially positive event, we did not include a &#8216;no enrichment&#8217; condition. No enrichment additional to the study items was given to the aardvarks during this time period.</p>

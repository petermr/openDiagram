<p id="Par4">One of the mechanisms through which ecosystem engineers interact with their environment, and specifically increase environmental heterogeneity, is through creating local disturbances

 </sup>. Burrowing mammals, in particular, can be important agents of disturbance as they can displace large volumes of soil, thereby, creating discrete habitat patches, and potentially constructing new landforms, within landscapes at relatively small spatial scales

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Burrowing can result in large geomorphic changes in the landscape by destabilizing soils and enhancing erosion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, possibly creating geomorphic signatures in the landscape
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. As a result, burrowing mammals are often considered to be both biogeomorphic agents
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> and ecosystem engineers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, in this context there is considerable overlap between these two concepts, since the formation and decay of burrows (i.e. reflecting the landform-focused approach of biogeomorphology) has consequences for species occurring in the landscape (i.e. in line with the organism-focus of ecosystem engineering)

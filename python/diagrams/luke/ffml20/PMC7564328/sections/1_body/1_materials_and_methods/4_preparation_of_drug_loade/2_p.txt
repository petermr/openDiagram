0: SCU was loaded in CD-MOF using a simple incubation approach, in which SCU and CD-MOF were mixed in ethanol under the condition of heating and stirring for a period of time.
1: According to the previous trials, the main factors to the loading rate were reaction temperature, molar ratio of SCU:CD-MOF and incubation time.
2: Herein, SCU@CD-MOF was prepared using SCU:CD-MOF molar ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 5:1 and 10:1, under gentle stirring (400 rpm) at 30, 40, 50 and 60 C for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h (RCT basic, IKA, Staufen, Germany).
3: The precipitates were washed thrice with 30 mL of anhydrous ethanol to remove the non-incorporated SCU.
4: The crystals were obtained after being dried in vacuum (DZF-6050, Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at 40 C for 12 h ( n = 3).
5: In addition, the physical mixtures of SCU and CD-MOF were prepared by mixing SCU and CD-MOF with the proportion of the optimal SCU loading above.

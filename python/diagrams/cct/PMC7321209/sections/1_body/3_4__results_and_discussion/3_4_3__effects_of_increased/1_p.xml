<p>In gas metal arc welding, increasing CTWD led to the reduction of energy input per unit length

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This had a direct effect on the formation of the weld bead geometry at a constant deposition rate. Due to lower energy input, the weld seams increased in height and decreased in width continuously. This could be described by lower temperatures in the melt pool and thus a lower viscosity of the melt, resulting in less flowable melt and faster solidification of the molten material. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f010">Figure 10</xref> shows experimental results for the adaptation of CTWD from 12 to 44 mm in the context of resulting layer geometries. Three parameter sets with differing energy input per unit length were chosen. Though, layer height (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f010">Figure 10</xref>a) and layer width (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f010">Figure 10</xref>b) were measured on three positions of a wall structure with 10 layers. The mean values are shown in

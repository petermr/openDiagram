<p>FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows that the SDS-PAGE patterns were significantly different between the perfusate and liver cytosolic extract. Many high-abundance cytosolic proteins (black arrows) were not present in the perfusates, whereas some proteins were enriched in perfusates (white arrows).

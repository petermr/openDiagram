<p id="Par24">Extension of the vertebrate body axis is driven by the addition of new segments at the posterior end of the embryo. During avian gastrulation, presumptive paraxial mesoderm cells ingress through the primitive streak and their early migration patterns can be observed directly

 <italic>HOX</italic> genes are activated in a temporal colinear fashion, just prior to ingression when the precursors are still located in the epiblast

0: To understand the underlying biological processes between differentially expressed mRNAs, the gene ontology (GO) database by DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) 1 was used to perform functional enrichment analysis.
1: Pathway analysis was conducted using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 2.
2: The relationships among the enriched clusters from the GO and KEGG pathway analyses were visualized using R ggplot2 package and Cytoscape v3.7.2.

<p>The concentrations of the extracted proteins were measured with the Infinite M1000 spectrophotometer (Tecan, Switzerland) at 480 nm. Samples were then diluted to 1200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g with rehydration buffer (containing 2 M Thiourea, 7 M urea, 4% Chaps) and applied to 24 cm (pH 4–7) ReadyStrip IPG Strips. The strips were first rehydrated and then focused on the Ettan IPGphor 3 IEF system (GE, USA) with the following conditions: rehydrated for 12 h at 20°C (30 V), 300 V for 30 min with rapid ramping, 700 V for 30 min with rapid ramping, 1,500 V for 1.5 h, 9,000 V for 3 h with linear ramp, and finally 9,000 V for 4 h with rapid ramping. After equilibration with equilibration buffers (containing 100 mM DTT and 250 mM IAA), the gel strips were applied to second-dimensional SDS-PAGE for 45 min at 1 W/gel, then 4.5 h at 11 W/gel. The gels were fixed for at least 2 h with stationary liquid (containing 40% ethanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, and 68% (m/v, g/L) acetic acid sodium without water) and then stained with coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (1000 mL solution containing G-2501.2 g, ammonium sulfate 100 g, phosphoric acid 100 mL, methanol 200 mL) for 6 h and subsequently destained with distilled water until background staining were negligible. In addition, the fixed gels are also stained with MS compatible silver nitrate method [

<p id="Par6">In order to confirm whether CNFs and PNFs are genomically and transcriptomically distinct lesions using advanced sequencing techniques, we compared publicly available RNA-seq data from an NF1 test cohort where cutaneous/non-plexiform neurofibromas were compared to PNFs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the RNA-seq data confirmed that histologically   similar cutaneous CNFs and PNFs cannot be discriminated based on global gene expression profiles, largely due to transcript heterogeneity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Prior expression profiling studies using cDNA microarrays did not identify distinct CNF and PNF transcriptome signatures at the macro-level, even though individual differences in key gene expression were identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We also evaluated whether genomic differences were present among our CNF and PNF cohorts and did not observe any large-scale differences in copy number variation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). However, we note that there do appear to be focal copy number alterations identified in both CNF and PNF patient samples, consistent with observations from prior work (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, Supplemental Fig. 7) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These results verify that few distinctive genomic or transcriptome alterations exist outside of putative

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d).

<p id="Par20">To study the transgenerational effects of parental treatment, paired-comparisons were made between AtCC and AtWC, AtCW and AtWW (Supplementary Table

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) in the flag leaf between different parental sources (AtWW_L vs AtCW_L). In the developing grains (AtWW_G vs AtCW_G), 770 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (

<p>The aim of this work is to create isothermal TTP diagrams based on 
 <italic>in situ</italic> DSC measurements. Therefore, the characteristic time values of the precipitation reaction, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., the start and end of the reaction, must be evaluated from heat flow curves like those shown in 
 <xref rid="f4-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>. However, due to the initial critical dead time mentioned above, as well as the flat course of the heat flow curves at the end of the analyzed time period, a well-adapted further evaluation is necessary. Two options have been developed to characterize the precipitation kinetics for the TTP diagrams: The first is to determine the heat flow peak-time and to plot the corresponding time/temperature values in a time-temperature diagram. If needed, straight lines were fitted to the peak flanks. In those cases the intersection point of the lines was evaluated as the peak-time (
 <xref rid="f6-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This method is relatively easy and fast. However, uncertainties occur with the decreasing peak-sharpness of the heat flow, and only one single time value results for each measured curve.

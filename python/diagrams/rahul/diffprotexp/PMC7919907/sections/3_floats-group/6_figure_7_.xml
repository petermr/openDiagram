  <p>Antiviral potency of BLF in the absence or presence of different concentrations of heparin against HCoVs. Cells at near confluency were infected with (A) HCoV-229E; (B) HCoV-NL63; or (C) HCoV-OC43, different concentrations of BLF and indicated concentrations of heparin were mixed and immediately added into the cells for EC
   <sub>50</sub> determination. EC
   <sub>50</sub> curve fittings were obtained using log
   <sub>10</sub> (concentration of inhibitors) vs. percentage of positive control (uninfected cells) with variable slopes in prism 8. (D) Antiviral EC
   <sub>50</sub> values of BLF in the presence of different concentrations of heparin. (E) Combination therapy of remdesivir with BLF. Data are mean ± standard deviation of three replicates.

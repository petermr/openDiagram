<p>In the present study, the differentially expressed lncRNAs in the T1-T4 spinal cord during MIRI, along with their characteristics and possible relationships with mRNAs, were identified. A total of 126 lncRNAs were observed in the T1-T4 spinal cord of the MIRI model rats. Among these lncRNAs, 41 lncRNAs were upregulated, and 85 lncRNAs were downregulated at 2 h after MIRI. Moreover, RT-qPCR was used to validate the microarray analysis results, for which the conclusion was consistent. Based on these findings, it was suggested that the aforementioned lncRNAs may serve a role in MIRI pathology. Furthermore, the present research contributes to understanding the molecular mechanism of MIRI.</p>

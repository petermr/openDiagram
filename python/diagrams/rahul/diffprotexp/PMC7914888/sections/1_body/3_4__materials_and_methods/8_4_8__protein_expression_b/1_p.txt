0: B16F1 cells were washed with sterile PBS and mechanically lysed in the presence of RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1mM phenyl-methyl sulfonyl-fluoride (PMFS) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a protease inhibitor.
1: The samples were centrifuged at 13,000  g for 15 min at 4 C. The supernatant and the protein concentration were quantified using a calibration curve constructed with bovine serum albumin and bicinchoninic acid (Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay Kitt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturers recommendations.
2: A total of 30 g of protein quantified per sample was removed by 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under denaturing conditions.
3: The obtained gels were electro-transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore-Merck) using the Novex  semi-dry system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturers recommendations.
4: For immuno-detection, the non-specific sites of the PVDF membrane were blocked with a 1% ( m/ v) solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40) (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS-Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) [ 112] and incubated with the primary antibodies used in the immunofluorescence, in addition to p16INK4a/CDKN2A (ab108349) from Abcam and p27 (sc-528) (Santa Cruz).
5: Subsequently, the incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody marked with horseradish peroxidase-HRP (VECTOR, Burlingame, CA, USA): anti-goat made in a horse (PI-9500) and anti-rabbit made in goat (P1-1000).
6: As load control, we used the detection of the nuclear protein Lamina B1 (sc-6216) (Santa Cruz).
7: Finally, the detection was completed by chemiluminescence using ECL-western blotting system (Amersham, Boston, MA, USA) and densitometric analysis in Fiji-ImageJ ( https://fiji.sc/)

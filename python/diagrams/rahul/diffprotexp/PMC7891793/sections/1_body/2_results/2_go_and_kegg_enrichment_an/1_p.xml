<p>Additionally, GO enrichment analysis of the whole transcriptome in samples from LL in comparison with LN was performed for all treatment groups. The analysis determined approximately 50–85 GO terms with p&lt;0.05 per treatment group. Since the goal of this study is to explore how immune mechanisms were modulated by different types of treatment, we have selected GO terms related to immune functions or relevant to some other aspects of this study. Analyzing general trends in expression of genes comprising these GO terms we determined whether this function was relatively increased or decreased in LL compared to LN. The result (
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) demonstrated that one of the most active processes in the lesions of the lung was leukocyte migration, especially in groups 1 and 6 in which ibuprofen was administered starting from day 3. But, in group 1, not treated with FPI, this function appeared to be more activated and involved GO terms related to chemotaxis of all major immune cell types (monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and lymphoid cells). Interestingly, negative regulation of viral genome replication was activated only in groups 1 and 2 (both treated with ibuprofen without FPI), but not in the placebo group 3. Some unique functions in LL from group 3 were increased, including oxidative stress-related terms and regulation of angiogenesis. GO terms enriched in all groups with increased function were toll-like receptor 3 signaling, antimicrobial humoral response with production of antibacterial peptides, autophagosome assembly, response to antibiotic and prostaglandin biosynthesis. Decreased functions that were not specific to any group and characteristic to all treatments were neutrophil activation, cytokine production and response to IL-4. More decreased adaptive immune system and lymphoid cells-related functional terms were observed in lesional lung tissue from group 1: positive regulation of B cell proliferation, adaptive immune response, positive regulation of interleukin-17 production. Also in group 4 (FPI day 5–10)–T cell co-stimulation, and in group 6 (FPI and Ibuprofen day3-10)–antigen presenting functions were reduced. Type one interferon production was reduced in LL of groups 5 and 6. In group 2 (Ibuprofen day 5–10) reduction of interferon-gamma production and medium-chain fatty acid metabolism was observed.

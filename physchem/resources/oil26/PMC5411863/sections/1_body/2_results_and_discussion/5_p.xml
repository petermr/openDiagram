<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Among the monoterpenic hydrocarbons a-Pinene predominates in the oil from C (61.94%) and D (59.05%) and it is also present at high concentrations in A oils (31.91%) and B oils (27.87%). On the other hand, essential oils form A and B have higher concentration of &#946;-Pinene (36.46%, 33.07%, respectively) than C and D (24.92%, 26.98%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Essential oils from the populations of A and B have a high level of a-Thujene (8.15%, 8.02%), l-Limonene (7.31%, 8.23%) and a-Phellandrene (5.01%, 4.7%), which are about two to three-fold as high compared with the same class of compounds identified in the oil from C and D. Concerning the content of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, the proportion of the compounds changes drastically. In fact, a-Muurolene content was higher in B (3.77%) than other localities (0.07%) although all localitie contain similar compounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

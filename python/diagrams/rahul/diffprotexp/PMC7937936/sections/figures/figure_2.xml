  <p>Correlation of tumor microenvironment (TME) with survival and clinical characteristics. 
   <bold>(Aâ€“C)</bold> According to the median value of the immune score, stromal score, or estimate score, 502 patients were stratified into the high- or low-score group. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for survival analyses between different score groups in the TCGA-HNSC data set. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Females have a worse prognosis than male patients with an OS&lt;5 years (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). 
   <bold>(E)</bold> There was a significant correlation between immune score and T stage (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Immune scores of tumor tissues were significantly lower in male patients than in female patients (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05).

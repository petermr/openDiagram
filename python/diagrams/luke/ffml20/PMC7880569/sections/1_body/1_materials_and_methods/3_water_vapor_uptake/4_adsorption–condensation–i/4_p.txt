0: In this work, one complete monolayer (1 W) on the basal face of birnessite corresponds to  W1,int = 1.33 H 2O/UC or  Wads = 9 H 2O/nm 2, which are values determined by our molecular dynamics simulations to be presented in the latter part of this paper.
1: We determined the total populations associated to the external basal faces in terms of H 2O/UC with 2where  ss is the total B.E.T.
2: specific surface area.
3: Incidentally, we do not explicitly account for water populations at particle edges, which represent a low proportion of the particle surface area.

<p>In contrast to Fe-based TMNCs, 
 <italic>in situ</italic> XAS studies of Ni-based TMNCs show much less pronounced changes in the metal environment under reaction conditions. No changes in the Ni K-edge XAS were observed by Jiang et al.,

 </sup> In the latter case, a small shift of the Ni K-edge XAS to higher energies was observed in the electrolyte under open circuit potential, which was reversed under applied negative potential. No changes in the Ni K-edge EXAFS features were detected at potentials higher than −0.9 V versus RHE. A slight increase in the main FT-EXAFS feature amplitude and small shift toward larger interatomic distances (by ca. 0.03 Å) were observed at more negative potentials, which were interpreted as a signature of CO
 <sub>2</sub> activation, adsorption at a Ni site, and distortion of the Ni–N
 <sub>4</sub> motif due to Ni 3d electron redistribution.

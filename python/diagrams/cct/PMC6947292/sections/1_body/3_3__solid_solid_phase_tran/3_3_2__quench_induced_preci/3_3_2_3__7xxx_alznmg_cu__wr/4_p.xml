<p>The type and nature of quench-induced precipitation in 7xxx alloys has been widely investigated [

 <xref rid="B196-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. In general, it can be stated that in presence of Cu, the S-Al
 <sub>2</sub>CuMg phase is precipitated, and in the presence of Si, the β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si phase is precipitated during the HTRs [

 <xref rid="B197-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Nucleation of these two phases appears to take place on coarse intermetallic particles. In almost every AlZnMg alloy, the MTRs seem to be dominated by the precipitation of isostructure variants of the η-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub> phase [
 <xref rid="B119-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Examples of this quench-induced phase are seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f051">Figure 51</xref>. Nucleation of quench-induced η-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub> apparently occurs on dispersoids [

 <xref rid="B196-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. In cold-rolled sheet material, dispersoids are heterogeneously aligned in lines, resulting in bands of quenched-induced precipitates [
 <xref rid="B196-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. As a result, fine precipitates originating from ageing can only be found heterogeneously distributed between the bands of quench-induced precipitates [

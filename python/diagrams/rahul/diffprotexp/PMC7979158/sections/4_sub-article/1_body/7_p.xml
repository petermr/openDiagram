<p>“To characterize the neuroanatomical specificity of Blue and Turquoise dysregulation transcriptional signatures (Figure 4D), we performed a static immuno-fluorescent labeling comparison of late neurogenesis, cortical lamination and cell specification at E17.5 in an independent MIA cohort. E17.5 represents the end of the peak of neurogenesis during cortical development, before the neuronal-glial transition that occurs around E18.5. […] Reduced expression of SOX2, a progenitor marker that is restricted to the VZ, was also observed in MIA brains (SOX2 VZ, P=0.0006 two tailed Student’s t-test) (Figure 4F)”.</p>

0: The exit tunnel can act synergistically with macrolides to inhibit protein synthesis, and altering the ribosomal nucleotides and residues that line the tunnel can lead to macrolide-resistant bacteria 3,  5,  6,  14,  15.
1: Mutations of the 23S ribosomal RNA (a component of the 50S ribosomal subunit) can confer macrolide resistance 15.
2: The mutations at A2058 and A2059, which are located on the surface of the tunnel mediate ERY resistance in multiple species 16,  17.
3: The C2610U mutation in  Escherichia colis ( E. coli) ribosome reduces ERY-dependent ribosome stalling of ErmCL peptide twofold 6, implying that the interaction between the exit tunnel and macrolide plays an important role in inhibition.
4: Mutations in other components of 50S subunit can also contribute to macrolide resistance 18.
5: The mutation  82MKR 84 in ribosomal protein L22, for example, confers antibiotic resistance in  E. coli,  Thermus thermophilus and  Haloarcula marismortui19.
6: Distinct amino acids and peptides attached to macrolide derivatives can establish interactions with components of the ribosomal tunnel that enhance the ribosome binding and inhibitory properties of macrolides 20.
7: For example, attaching Ala-Ala to the C20 aldehyde position of tylosin prevents covalent bonding between tylosin and A2062 of the ribosomal tunnel, but establishes a new interaction with the tunnel that improves inhibitory properties of tylosin.

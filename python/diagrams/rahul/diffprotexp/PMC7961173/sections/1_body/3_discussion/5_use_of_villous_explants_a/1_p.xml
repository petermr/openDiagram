<p id="Par57">The study was conducted with a cell line and placental tissues in vitro
 <italic>,</italic> which may not represent biological interactions that occur in vivo. Although the tissue model keeps the villi structure intact, the critical interplay is lost ex vivo between fetal and maternal cells that play a pivotal role in placental development. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic profile differences have been reported in HTR-8/SVneo cells when compared to primary extravillous trophoblasts cultured in similar conditions (Bilban et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>; Novakovic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>). Nevertheless, HTR-8/SVneo cells express a signature combination of molecular markers particular to extravillous trophoblasts, including cytokeratin 7 and HLA-G when grown on Matrigel (Irving et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1995</xref>; Khan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Kilburn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2000</xref>; Takao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2011</xref>). Despite the drawbacks of using these in vitro models, both have been extensively used to investigate placental biology and the complex processes involved in placental development (Mannelli et al.

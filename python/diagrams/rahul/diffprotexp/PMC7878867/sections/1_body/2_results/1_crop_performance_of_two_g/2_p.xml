<p id="Par15">Yield components including biomass per plant, grain weight per plant, grain number per plant, harvest index and 1000-grain weight were analysed in two durum wheat genotypes across treatment groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In DBA Artemis, biomass per plant, grain weight per plant, and grain number per plant exhibited the same trend â€“ these traits significantly decreased in the progeny treated with water-deficit stress compared with the control from the same parental source (i.e. AtCW vs AtCC, AtWW vs AtWC). No significant difference was detected for progeny under the same treatment condition but originating from different parents (i.e. AtCC vs AtWC, AtCW vs AtWW). Interestingly, the harvest index of DBA Artemis progeny from the stressed parents was significantly higher than that of the progeny from the control parents, under both control and water-deficit stress conditions (i.e. AtWC vs AtCC and AtWW vs AtCW). No significant difference was detected between control and stress-treated progeny from the same parents. For 1000-grain weight, stress-treated DBA Artemis progeny from the stressed parents showed the highest value across all treatment groups. The 1000-grain weight of progeny from the control parents significantly increased under water-deficit stress (AtCW vs AtCC). For DBA Aurora, the same trend was observed for biomass per plant, grain weight per plant, and grain number per plant, where significant reductions were observed between control and stressed progeny from the same parents. No significant difference was detected for harvest index in DBA Aurora. In terms of 1000-grain weight, water-deficit stress significantly increased the 1000-grain weight in the progeny from the stressed parents (AuWW vs AtWC). No significant difference was detected between control and stressed progeny from the control parents (AuCW vs AtCC).

0: Analyses of the essential oil were performed by application of gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
1: According to the property of the essential oil extract, the condition of GC or GC-MS was optimized.
2: GC-FID analysis was conducted on a HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m*0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m).

<p id="Par40">We found several statistically significant transcriptomic differences among the four chambers. The differences were the largest between the atrium and ventricle of same side, substantially large between the right and left atria but almost negligible between the right and left ventricles, both for the entire transcriptome and for the selected pathways. Our results for male heart were qualitatively similar to what was previously reported for adult female C57Bl/6 mice

 </sup>, although our analysis was on male heart (of the same mouse strain) and went far beyond the expression levels. The differences between the right and the left atria (RA/LA) were larger for the cardiac muscle contraction (CMC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OPH) pathways.

0: Figure 4 displays a typical temperature and scanning rate profile of the DSC measurements.
1: In  Figure 4A the profiles of program- and sample-temperature are plotted corresponding to the right ordinate.
2: Additionally the first derivative of sample-temperature with respect to time, which represents the actual scanning rate, is plotted corresponding to the left ordinate, both as function of time.
3: The alloy-specific critical cooling rate (which further depends on high- or low-temperature-reactions) is denoted by a dash-dot horizontal line.

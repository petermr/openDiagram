<p>The four D1 and four D2 nuclei pellets were each resuspended in 250 μL resuspension buffer with DyeCycle Ruby (1:1000; Invitrogen) for 1 hr on ice. Nuclei were then sorted with a BD FACSAria™ cell sorter equipped with 640-nm and 488-nm excitation lasers and an 85 μm nozzle. Nuclei were gated by two criteria: the presence of a GFP signal above the background fluorescence level (as assessed by comparison with nuclei obtained from a wild-type littermate mouse) and the signal from DyeCycle Ruby corresponding to single nuclei. Sorted nuclei (i.e., about 80,000 for each biological replicate from two mice) were collected in 100 μL of resuspension buffer, centrifuged for 5 min at 2000× 
 <italic>g</italic>, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To assess the purity of the isolated nuclei, the sorted nuclei were imaged at 40× with a fluorescence microscope using 640-nm and 488-nm excitation lasers.

 <caption> Immune cell suppression in sepsis patients. ( A) Differences in immune cell infiltration between sepsis and controls. Each row represents a type of immune cell; each column, a different dataset. Red nodes represent significant up-regulation in sepsis; blue nodes, significant down-regulation. ( B) Clustering and correlation of immune cell types based on infiltration levels. The size of each node represents the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores of each immune cell type, transformed by log 10 (Log rank test P-value). Connections between immune cell types represent interactions between the two. The thickness of the line indicates the strength of the correlation, based on Pearson correlation analysis. Red lines represent positive correlations; blue lines, negative correlations. Immune cell cluster A is shown in yellow; cell cluster B, blue; cell cluster C, red; and cell cluster D, brown. </caption>

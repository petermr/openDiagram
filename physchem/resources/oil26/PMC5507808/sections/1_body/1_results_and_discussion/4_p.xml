<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par8">Several other studies have confirmed the antibacterial activity of eugenol against various pathogens such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>B. cereus</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> amongst numerous others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is believed to have antibacterial property by the inhibition of extracellular enzymes synthesis and disruption of the cell wall structure resulting in lack of cytoplasm, cytoplasm granulation, cytoplasm hyperacidity, and depletion of intracellular ATP pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, despite of the presence of eugenol in high proportion in this essential oil, its high antimicrobial potential could also be due to the synergic of action between main components and minority components of the essential oil.</p>

 <caption> Differential expression, control and prominence of selected functional pathways and groups of genes in LA, RA, LV, RV = left and right atria and ventricles. ( a) Percentages of regulated genes; ( b) weighted pathway regulation (WPR); ( c) pathway relative expression control; ( d) top 5 genes (highest GCH scores) in each chamber; ( e) five most prominent (highest GCH) genes in each chamber; ( f) GCH scores of voltage-dependent calcium, potassium and sodium channels. The denominator in the legend of panels ( a) and ( b) indicates the reference chamber, while the numerator indicates the referred one. ALL all genes, ASC adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, CAS calcium signaling, CMC cardiac muscle contraction, GLY glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, ICT ion channels and transporters, OPH oxidative phosphorylation. Note that CMC is the most altered, OPH the most controlled and ICT the least controlled pathway. </caption>

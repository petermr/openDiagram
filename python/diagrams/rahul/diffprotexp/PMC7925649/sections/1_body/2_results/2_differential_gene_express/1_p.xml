<p id="Par21">Principal component analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and determine if the predominant gene expression variation in the samples could be associated with pre-operative or post-operative status, or with the LCOS outcome. There is an emergent pattern showing that LCOS status can be attributed to the variation observed in the samples after surgery between patients that develop LCOS and those that do not (post-operative LCOS vs. No-LCOS). There is also a pattern present in the patients that develop LCOS when samples before and after surgery are compared (LCOS post-operative vs. pre-operative). However, within the first three principal components there is not a clear delineation between pre-operative and post-operative patients that do not develop LCOS (Fig.Â

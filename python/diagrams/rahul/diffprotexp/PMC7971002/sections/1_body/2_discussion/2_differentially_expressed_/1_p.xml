<p id="Par22">In this study, FSHR was up-regulated, and FSH activates FSH receptor (FSHR) in granulosa cells to induce follicular differentiation, growth, and estradiol production

 </sup>. In domestic animals, FSHR is only expressed in the GC of the ovary and plays a key role in apoptosis, atresia, follicle maturation, GC proliferation and differentiation, and ovulation

 </sup>. The mRNA level of FSHR in the ovarian follicle is similar to that of sheep in an earlier study by Goyal et al. (2017). Three lncRNAs, MSTRG.188947.6, MSTRG.222844.7, MSTRG.283534.2 were predicted to regulate the expression of FSHR, which may be associated with follicle development

 <italic>trans</italic> effect regulates the expression of STAR; an indispensable component in the acute regulatory phase. It mediates the transfer of cholesterol from the outer membrane to the inner membrane of the mitochondria to form the first type of sterol, which regulates the synthesis of sex hormones. This indicates that differential lncRNAs may mediate ovarian hormone synthesis by influencing STAR. CCNA2 has different roles in mitosis and meiosis in female animals as CCNA2 and CDK coordinate mitosis and promote oocytes to enter meiosis, regulating the transition of meiosis I to meiosis II

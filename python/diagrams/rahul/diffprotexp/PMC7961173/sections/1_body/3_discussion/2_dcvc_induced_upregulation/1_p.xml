<p id="Par47">In agreement with overall concentration- and time-dependent effects, the upregulated UPR pathway was enriched with 10 µM and 20 µM DCVC treatment. Moreover, evaluation of temporal patterns revealed that the groups of late responder genes upregulated by 10 µM and 20 µM DCVC were enriched for the ATF4 transcription factor, specifically indicating activation of the ISR. When ISR activation is triggered at the cellular level by stress stimuli, including the PERK branch of the UPR, the principal initiating event is the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (Pakos-Zebrucka et al.

Furthermore, in order for cellular recovery to occur from stress-induced homeostatic perturbations, eIF2α phosphorylation concomitantly suppresses global CAP-dependent protein translation while allowing for transcription and translation of selected stress response genes with open read frames in their promotors; namely the central ISR regulatory transcription factor ATF4 (Pakos-Zebrucka et al.

Indeed, further verification of ISR activation in HTR-8/SVneo cells—beyond differential gene expression—demonstrated DCVC-induced increased eIF2α phosphorylation, global attenuation of protein synthesis, and elevation of ATF4 mRNA and protein concentrations, confirming ISR activation, as summarized in Fig.

Eutheria was named in 1872 by Theodore Gill and refined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880. Living Eutherians are comprised of 18 orders, divided into two major clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): Atlantogenata including the superorders Xenarthra (armadillos, anteaters, and sloths) and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Tublidentata, Afroinsectivora, Cingulata, and Pilosa), and Boreoeutheria including the superorders Laurasiatheria (Insectivora, Artodactyla, Pholidota, and Carnovora) and Euarchontoglires (Lagomorpha, Rodentia, Scandentia, Dermoptera, and Primates). In our analyses, we have focused on identifying gene duplications in Afrotherian and Xenarthran genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), using the Xenarthrans Hoffmans two-toed sloth (<italic>Choloepus hoffmanni</italic>) and nine-banded armadillo (<italic>Dasypus novemcinctus</italic>) as out-groups to the Afrotherians. This approach allows us to use phylogenetic methods to polarize gene duplication events and identify genes that duplicated in the Afrotherian stem-lineage.</p></caption>

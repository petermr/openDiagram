<p>Previously we showed that a high fat, high sugar cafeteria diet (CD) induced obesity and concomitant gene expression changes in the liver and muscle from male Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether CD induces depot-specific gene expression and DNA methylation changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and retroperitoneal fat, a marker of visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Here we show that CD exposure evoked depot-specific upregulation of the 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> long chain fatty acid transporter, which was accompanied by both global and 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic>-specific DNA hypomethylation. These findings provide insights into the physiological differences between VAT and SAT depots and suggest that differences in fatty acid transport may underly the distinct adipose tissue expansion properties observed between these depots.

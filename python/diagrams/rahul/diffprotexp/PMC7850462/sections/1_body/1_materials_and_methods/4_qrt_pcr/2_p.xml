<p>Concentration and purity of the RNA samples were measured after the extraction. Qualified RNA samples were adjusted to an appropriate concentration and then reverse-transcribed by reverse transcription kits (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) using random primers. LightCycler 480 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used to detect gene expressions, and the experiments were carried out based on the instruction of SYBR Green Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) as described below: 5 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 60 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. Quantitative PCR of each RNA sample was performed in triplicate. U6 and GAPDH acted as the internal references of miRNA and mRNA, respectively. The 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method was used for data analysis. Sequences of the primers are exhibited in

<p>The mechanism of the differential effect of SERM remains to be elucidated, but is likely to involve 2 aspects; first, the tissue-specific expression of ERα coactivators and corepressors and, second, the sex-specific epigenetic landscape of individual tissues. Notably, a recent study revealed that the epigenetic landscape of the male and female brain is largely different due the highly sexual dimorphic effect of gonadal steroids in the preoptic area that inhibit the expression of DNA methylase (Dnmt) enzymes (

 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). It will be of interest to understand how these epigenetic aspects affect the binding of the pioneer factor FoxA1, a major player in defining the binding sites of the ERα across the genome.

<p>The total protein from heart tissue and splenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells was lysed in Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) Lysis Buffer (ThermoFisher, 89,900), with protease inhibitors (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China, ST506-2) and phosphatase inhibitors (Applygen Technologies, Beijing, China, P1260) for 30 min under rotating agitation. The splenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). A BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, 23,235) was used to measure protein concentration. Then, 40 μg heart tissue protein or 10–20 μg CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell protein were mixed with one-fifth volume of 5× loading buffer. The mixture was denatured by boiling at 100°C for 10 min. Samples were separated with 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 2 h. After incubation with primary antibody at 4°C overnight and secondary antibodies, membranes were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The antibodies used included the following: rabbit anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #12,426), rabbit anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #12,912), rabbit anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #11,948), rabbit anti-T-bet polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Abcam, #ab53174), rabbit anti-GATA3 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab106625), mouse anti-Ror-γ monoclonal antibody (1:1000; R&amp;D System Technology, #600,214), rabbit anti-Foxp3 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, # ab54501), rabbit anti-IFN-γ polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab216642), rat anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab11524), rabbit anti-IL-17 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab79056), rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #8242), rabbit anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #3033), rabbit anti-IκB-α monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #4812), rabbit anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser32) monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #2859), rabbit anti-JAK2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #3230), rabbit anti-phospho-JAK2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #4406), rabbit anti-STAT3 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #12,640), rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #9145), and rabbit anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #5174). The experiment was repeated 3 times for each sample.

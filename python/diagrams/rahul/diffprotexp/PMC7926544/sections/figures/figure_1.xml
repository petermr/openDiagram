  <p>Identification of STCH as a novel NKCC2-interacting protein. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Mouse NKCC2 yeast two-hybrid baits constructs. A proposed topology for sodium-coupled chloride co-transporter NKCC2. N442 and N452 are the potential 
   <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites. As previously described, mouse NKCC2 C terminus was divided into three peptide fragments (C1-term, C2-term, and C3-term) used as baits for the yeast two-hybrid. Similar to Aldolase B [
   <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and SCAMP2 [
   <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], STCH interacts with C1-term while OS9 binds to C3-term [
   <xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. (
   <bold>B</bold>) NKCC2 binds, in vivo, to STCH in HEK cells. HEK cells transiently transfected with Myc-NKCC2 singly or in combination with GFP-STCH were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-GFP anti-body (
   <bold>lanes 2 and 3</bold>). 5% of total cell lysate (Lys) was resolved as positive control. Co-immunoprecipitated NKCC2 and STCH proteins were detected by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-Myc (
   <bold>lane 3</bold>) and anti-GFP respectively (
   <bold>lane 3</bold>). IgGH, the heavy chain of IgG. The positions of immature (core glycosylated) and mature (complex-glycosylated) proteins of NKCC2 are indicated. The interaction of NKCC2 with STCH involves mainly the immature form of the co-transporter. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Imunofluorescence confocal microscopy showing distribution of Myc-NKCC2 and GFP-STCH in HEK cells. Fixed and permeabilized cells were stained with mouse anti-Myc for NKCC2 (Texas Red). The yellow color (merged image) indicates co-localization of the proteins. Bars, 5 Î¼m.

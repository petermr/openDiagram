0: TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used to extract total RNA from blood samples and HK-2 cells.
1: The extraction process of the total RNA from blood samples was as follows.
2: An RNase-free centrifuge tube was added with 0.5 mL of blood and 1.5 mL of TRIzol reagent, and maintained at a still position at room temperature after vibration.
3: The mixture was centrifuged at 4 C, 12,000 g/min for 15 min.
4: Supernatant obtained after the centrifugation was transferred to another RNase-free centrifuge tube using a pipette.
5: This tube was added with chloroform (TRIzol:chloroform = 5:1), and placed at a still position for 3 min after 15 s of vortex.
6: After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 4 C, 12,000 g/min for 15 min.
7: Supernatant obtained (450 L) and pre-chilled isopropanol (TRIzol:isopropanol = 2:1) were added into a clean 1.5-mL RNase-free centrifuge tube.
8: The well-mixed liquid was maintained stationary at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 4 C, 12,000 g/min for 15 min.
9: Supernatant was carefully removed, and the remaining sediments were mixed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol prepared with DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate)-treated water, followed by centrifugation at 4 C, 8000 g/min for 5 min.
10: Supernatant obtained after the centrifugation was discarded, and the tube was put upside down on a clean filter paper for a while.
11: After ethanol volatilization for 23 min, the tube was added with 15 L of DEPC-treated water.
12: The mixture was treated with a water bath at 5560 C for 10 min.
13: HK-2 cells collected for RNA extraction were centrifuged at 800 r/min for 35 min.
14: The culture medium was discarded, and the cells were mixed with 1 mL of TRIzol reagent.
15: The cell suspension was transferred to a dry EP tube that had been soaked in DEPC-treated water.
16: The tube was placed on ice for 10 min.
17: The remaining process was the same as the extraction of total RNA from blood samples.

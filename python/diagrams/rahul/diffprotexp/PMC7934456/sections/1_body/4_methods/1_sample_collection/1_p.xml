<p id="Par38">In the laboratory, bing409 (pol restorer line)(Source: Prof. Tingdong Fu) and 1141A (sterile pol line)(Source: Prof. Tingdong Fu) was used to establish a near-isogenic line (NIL) through 13 generations of backcrossing (Source: Dr. Zonghui Yang). Using this material, we finely mapped the 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS restorer gene. In the BC8 generation, the 32 kb infiltrated the specific marker scanning located gene fragment, and then the experiment was carried out by crossing 13 generations of sterile lines and reproductive lines. The NIL of oil-seed rape was seeded in May 2018 in Wuhan, with the seedling density controlled to 20 cm × 40 cm. The NIL material passed the multi-year backcrossing experiment, and the phenotype was 1:1 sterile line to the restorer line. The sterile and fertile phenotypes can be well distinguished. Through paraffin section observation, we found that the infertility period of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS was 3–4 stages of anther development, and the degradation of tapetum occurred in advance, leading to abortion [

In stages 2–3 of anther development, the flower buds’ size was &lt; 1 mm; therefore, we collected flower buds of &lt; 1 mm and studied the proteome and metabolome. All samples taken were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. Simultaneously, we collected the flower buds of sterile and fertile lines in the same period and fixed them for laser microdissection capture to study single-cell transcriptomics. This procedure was conducted to investigate 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS more accurately at the metabolic, protein, and transcription levels. The transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome sample collection set up three biological replicates for omics sequencing analysis.

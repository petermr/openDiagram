 <caption> AS6 significantly disturbs critical biological pathways in MCF7 cells. ( A) GO analysis of upregulated genes in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. ( B) PPI analysis showing the relatedness of upregulated protein-coding genes in these cells. ( C) GO analysis of downregulated genes in AS6-treated MCF7 cells showing a severe impairment of cell cycle and growth.

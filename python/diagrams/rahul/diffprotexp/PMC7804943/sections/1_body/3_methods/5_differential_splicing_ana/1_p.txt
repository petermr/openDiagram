0: Differential identification of percentage splicing in (PSI) for AS events or percentage intron retained (PIR) for IR events were calculated using the VAST-TOOLS diff module (minReads = 10), as described previously 71.
1: Events were screened for sufficient read coverage by keeping those with OK/SOK quality designation in 60% of samples.

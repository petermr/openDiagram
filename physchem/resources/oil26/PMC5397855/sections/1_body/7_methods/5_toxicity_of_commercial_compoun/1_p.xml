<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide identified as toxic compounds in garlic essential oil, were obtained commercially. Diallyl sulfide (purity 97.0%) and diallyl disulfide (purity 70%) were purchased from Across Organics (New Jersey, USA). Six different concentrations of the commercial compounds besides the control (acetone) were adjusted in 1&#8201;mL of stock solution (treatment and acetone) used to calculate the lethal LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> concentrations: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160&#8201;mg&#8201;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. For each treatment, aliquots were taken from the stock solution and mixed with acetone in 5&#8201;mL glass vials. Different concentrations of the each treatment were applied in 1&#8201;uL solution on the body of larva, pupa and adult of <italic>T. molitor</italic>. Individuals were placed in Petri dishes with wheat bran and sugarcane. A total of 50 larvae, 50 pupae, and 50 adults were used for each concentration and mortality was evaluated for 48&#8201;h after application to compared with toxicity garlic essential oil, followed by rate corrections according to the Abbott&#8217; formule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.</p>

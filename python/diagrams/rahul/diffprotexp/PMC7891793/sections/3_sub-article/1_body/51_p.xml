<p>Reviewer #1:Â In the present study, the authors have presented lung transcriptomics of bovine lung upon BRSV infection. They further analyzed the effect of antiviral treatment regimen. In my opinion, it is a nice piece of work. However, I found redundant information have been provided at places. The discussion section can be presented precisely by removing the details of their findings, which have already been discussed in results section. Also, they should give precise information about any gene or physiological pathway while discussing.</p>

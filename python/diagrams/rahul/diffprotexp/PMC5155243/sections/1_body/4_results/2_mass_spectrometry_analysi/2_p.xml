 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> provides detailed results of the mass spectrometry identification of these 13 differentially expressed proteins. According to the changing trends in each group (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), these proteins were classified into 7 groups. (1) Under normal physiological conditions, the protein expression levels of ezrin, transthyretin, and ATP synthase-coupling factor 6 in MT−/− mice were higher than in MT+/+ mice. (2) Under physiological conditions, the protein expression levels of phosphotriesterase-related protein, λ-crystallin homolog, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, propionyl-CoA carboxylase α chain, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in MT−/− mice were lower than in MT+/+ mice. (3) Under physiological conditions, the protein expression levels of sarcosine dehydrogenase, N(G), N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1, aminoacylase-3 (ACY-3), ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) between MT−/− and MT+/+ mice did not exhibit differences. (4) The proteins that showed increased expression after the addition of DU and whose expression significantly increased in MT+/+ mice included λ-crystallin homolog and ATP synthase-coupling factor 6. (5) The one protein that showed increased expression after the addition of DU and did not exhibit a difference in the increase observed in these two types of mice was transthyretin. (6) The proteins that showed decreased expression after the addition of DU and whose expression was significantly decreased in MT−/− mice included SOD, ETHE1, and ACY-3. (7) The proteins that presented decreased expression after the addition of DU and did not exhibit a difference in the decrease observed in these two types of mice included sarcosine dehydrogenase, N(G), N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1, ezrin, phosphotriesterase–related protein, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, propionyl-CoA carboxylase α chain, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

<p>We agree that the metabolomics in this experiment are a critical aspect for analysis. We have collected samples for metabolomics analysis and that work has been completed using mass spec. We are currently in the process of analysis of this mass spec. data and will be developing a manuscript specifically targeting this aspect of the work. It is our hope that the transcriptome manuscript and the pathology manuscript can then be cited in the metabolomics manuscript thereby providing a way for a reader to completely understand the total picture that emerges from this very large and lengthy experiment.</p>

0: We have used our standard protocol 28 for data filtration and normalization.
1: Any spot with corrupted pixels or with foreground fluorescence less than twice the background in any of the 16 samples was removed from the analysis.
2: As justified in a recent paper 28, profiling four biological replicas provides for the expression of each gene three independent measures: level, variability and correlation with each other gene from the same chamber or with the same gene in adjacent chamber.
3: The three features are as independent and complementary as are the impressions on the same movie of a blind person and a deaf one.

<p id="p0170">The changes in alanine were not sufficient in liver or skeletal muscle for this metabolite to be a DEM (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C); although in skeletal muscle alanine was slightly decreased [FC (
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic>/WT) = 0.59, q value = 0.10] and in liver alanine was slightly increased [FC (
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic>/WT) = 1.21, q value = 0.20)]. Despite these limited changes in alanine in the organs, alanine decreased in the blood of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, suggesting either decreased release from skeletal muscle or increased uptake by liver. We found increased expression of the alanine transporter genes 
 <italic>Asct1</italic> and 
 <italic>Asct2</italic> in both liver and skeletal muscle, suggesting enhanced uptake in liver. The limited increase in alanine in liver was consistent with increased Gpt and Gpt2, which catalyzes at the conversion of alanine to pyruvate. In the glucose-lactate cycle, lactate was unchanged in skeletal muscle and the blood of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. However, in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, lactate and its transporter, Slc16a1, increased (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), suggesting the increased uptake of lactate from the blood to the liver. Ldha, which catalyzes lactate to pyruvate, also increased in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), consistent with the previous finding (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Nesteruk et al., 2014</xref>). An increase of Gpt2 of the glucose-alanine cycle and Ldha of the glucose-lactate cycle in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice may increase the amount of pyruvate. Although we did not measure the amount of pyruvate, it has been reported that the hepatic pyruvate is actually increased in liver of overnight-fasted 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Shannon et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the increased Ldha and Gpt2 can contribute to the activation of gluconeogenesis through the conversion of lactate and alanine to pyruvate. Furthermore, expression of 
 <italic>Gpt2</italic>, 
 <italic>Ldha</italic>, and 
 <italic>Asct2</italic> were upregulated by the DRTF 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), suggesting that both glucose-alanine and glucose-lactate cycles in the liver are coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level. Collectively, these results suggested that increased hepatic glucose production occurs from both lactate and alanine in fasted 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice.

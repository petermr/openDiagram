<p id="Par21">GO annotation enrichment was used to describe functions of the DE lncRNAs and mRNAs involved in cellular components, molecular function and biological processes, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Between MM_FP and MM_LP, targeted genes for DE lncRNAs were most enriched, and the terms were related to regulation of trans-membrane transport, antigen processing and presentation, immune system process. DE mRNAs were most enriched, the meaningful terms were related to the regulation of C-terminal protein methylation, C-terminal protein amino acid modification, post-translation protein modification, cellular macromolecular complex assembly and cellular metabolic process (Fig.

<p>We established a PPI network of 708 genes by STRING database, as 577 genes with a confidence score â‰¥0.4. We used Cytoscape software and the MNC algorithm to score the importance of each node in the network. With these together, we developed the top 50 genes according to the score from large to small. The darker the color, the more important the node was (

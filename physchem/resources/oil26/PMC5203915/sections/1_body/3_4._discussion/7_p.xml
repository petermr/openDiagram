<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The essential oils from hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants showed antimicrobial properties with higher antibacterial (MIC = 125&#8211;250&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) than antifungal (MIC = 625&#8211;1250&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) activities. The most susceptible bacteria strains were<italic> Enterococcus faecalis </italic>(ATCC 29212) and<italic> Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>(ATCC 27853) with a MIC value of 125&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL. However, no significant difference in susceptibility between Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria was found, although it is known that the latter are less sensitive to essential oils because their outer membrane contains hydrophilic lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS inhibits the penetration of membrane by the different hydrophobic compounds of the essential oils [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Essential oils and their hydrophobic components may disrupt the bacterial cell membranes by separating the lipids leading to inhibition of the functional properties of the bacterial cell [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The strong antimicrobial activity (MIC = 32&#8211;256&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) also showed<italic> R. carthamoides </italic>root and rhizomes essential oil from commercial available material [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but with lower activity against<italic> E. faecalis </italic>(ATCC 29212) (MIC = 265&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) and<italic> P. aeruginosa </italic>(ATCC 27853) (MIC &gt; 512&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL) than the root essential oils in the present study (MIC = 125&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL). A pure compound is usually used as a bactericide if the MBC is no more than four times the MIC value [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] which was observed for<italic> R. carthamoides</italic> HR and SGR essential oils. Therefore, these essential oils may be effective as bactericidal agents.</p>

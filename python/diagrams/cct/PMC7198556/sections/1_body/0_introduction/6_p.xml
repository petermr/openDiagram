 <italic>in-situ</italic>, the temperature history of the hardened workpiece still left its traces in its microstructure. This paper aims at describing a method of combining metallurgical data from phase diagrams usually available to the heat treatment facility with a micrograph analysis of a surface hardened sample in order to deduce several depths of different transition temperatures within the material. Consequently, a general numerical temperature distribution fitted to these temperature-depth pairs can be used to verify the estimated surface temperature.

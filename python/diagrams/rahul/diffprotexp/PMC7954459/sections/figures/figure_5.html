 <caption> Co‐expression network and stage‐specificity of miRNAs modules, and GO enrichment analysis. (a) Dendrogram showing the hierarchical clustering of miRNAs based on co‐expression network analysis. The color rows below the dendrogram indicate module membership. (b) Heatmap showing stage‐specificity of co‐expressed miRNA modules based on their eigengene expression values. The colors on the left represent different modules. (c) Bar‐plot of the modules exhibiting opposite eigengene expression pattern at S3 or S5 stages of seed development between Himchana 1 (HS3/HS5) and JGK 3 (JS3/JS5) cultivars. (d) Heatmap showing expression profiles of miRNAs (included in the modules shown in c) at S3 and S5 stages in the two cultivars. (e) Heatmaps showing expression profiles of the selected miRNAs at S3 and S5 stages of seed development in JGK 3 and Himchana 1 chickpea cultivars based on the smRNA‐seq (left) and RT‐qPCR (right) methods. Correlation between the expression values obtained in smRNA‐seq and RT‐qPCR data is given in the middle. (f,g) Enriched GO (biological process) terms among the targets of miRNAs included in modules showing opposite eigengene expression pattern at S3 (f) and S5 (g) stages. The color scale and values in the colored boxes represent P‐value of enrichment </caption>

    <bold>Figure S1</bold>: 2-DE gel images of H9N2-infected and H5N1 groups of A549 cells at 24 hpi. a 2-DE gel of the H5N1-infected group. b 2-DE gel of the H9N2-infected group. The distribution of differential protein spots identified by mass spectrometry in the two-dimensional electrophoresis pattern. The downward arrow indicates that H5N1 expressed down-regulated protein spots compared to the low-toxic control; the upward arrow indicates that H5N1 expressed up-regulated protein spots compared to the low-toxic control. c Enlarged regions of several differentially expressed protein spots. Differentially expressed protein spots are indicated by numbers and circles.

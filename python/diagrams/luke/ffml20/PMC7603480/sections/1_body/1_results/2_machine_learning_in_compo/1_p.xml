 <sub>int</sub>-based FPS sets are shown, i.e., we also combine extensive kernel learning with intensive training sets and vice versa. It can be seen that with the largest training sets, all four models are able to predict atomization energies for these systems with mean absolute errors (MAEs) well below 0.1 eV. In all cases, the log-log plots display the expected linear relationship (i.e., the learning curve can be fitted as a power law), indicating that even higher accuracy could be achieved with more data. To put this performance into perspective, it should be noted that our baseline method (dispersion-corrected hybrid DFT) itself has an average accuracy of ca. 4–5  kcal mol

<p>Clinical samples, including primary skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood samples, were used in this study. Primary skin fibroblasts were obtained from 4 patients with PD (median age, 46 years; age range, 41-57 years) and 4 healthy age-matched controls (median age, 45.5 years; age range, 45-53 years). These included two patients with PD carrying different heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants, including c.1309delG and IVS2+1G&gt;A, and two patients with PD carrying different heterozygous 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants, including c.2T&gt;C and exon 8 deletion (exon8del). All participants were screened and were free of common 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations as well as 
 <italic>TBP, SCNA, FBX07</italic> and 
 <italic>GCH1</italic> mutations. The age, sex, genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the investigated individuals are shown in

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">GC-MS analysis was carried out in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent 5973 MSD applying helium as the carrier gas (0.9 ml/min, and the same capillary column previously mentioned). The column temperature was raised from 50 (hold 3 min) to 180 &#8220;C at the rate of 5 &#8220;C/min and to 240 &#8220;C at 10 &#8220;C/min rate; and then was kept stable for an additional 20 min at 280 &#176;C. The injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 280 &#176;C, respectively. A 0.3-&#956;l sample was injected using the split mode (split ratio 50:1). Oil components were analyzed and identified by comparison of MS fragmentation pattern with that of pure compounds, corresponding data in the literature (Adams 2007) and/or computer mass spectra libraries (Wiley 138K and NIST 98). For gaining the retention indices, a standard solution of <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C6-C26) was used (Jennings and Shibamoto 1980). Also, the electronic integration of the FID peak areas without using any correction factors was employed for obtaining quantitative data.</p>

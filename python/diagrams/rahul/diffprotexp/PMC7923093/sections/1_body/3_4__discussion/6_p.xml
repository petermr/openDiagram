<p>There already have been studies evaluating miRNAs expression in the mammary gland [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], thus, our observations expand the recognition about these tissue-specific miRNAs which may have simplification for non-muscular tissue. In addition, miR-486, another tissue-specific miRNA up-regulated in this study, plays not only powerful roles in muscle cells, but also in regulation of angiogenic activity. MiR-486 was first found in human fetal liver [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and it has been reported that it is an erythroid-related microRNA and may play important roles in regulation of hematopoiesis [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, it could be possible that hematopoiesis regulated by miR-486 is correlated to function of NO generated from arginine.

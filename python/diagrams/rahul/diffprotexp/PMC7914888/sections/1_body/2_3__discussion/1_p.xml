<p>The number of reports related to changes in miRNAs’ expression and their targets in melanoma samples under different tumor progression stages is growing; however, their role in growth suppression models and whether these miRNAs change reciprocally with the phenotype are little known. We present the first report about changes in miRNAs’ expression profile in mouse B16 melanoma cells under growth suppression and differential pigmentation induced by exposure to the amino acid L-Tyrosine or the thymidine analog 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine. We propose some network models of co-expression of microRNAs that present potential common targets associated with cell cycle control, senescence, proliferation, and melanogenesis in the mouse melanoma B16-F1 cells.</p>

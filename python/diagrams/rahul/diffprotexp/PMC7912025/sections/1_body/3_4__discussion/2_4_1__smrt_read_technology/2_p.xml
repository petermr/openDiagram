<p>The major focus of this study was to identify the effect of the RSV induced innate response on AS events. Previous work analyzing the global gene expression profile using high-density microarrays [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] has been published. These studies have been successful in identifying time-dependent, replication-sensitive [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in response to RSV infection. Here, RSV replication can affect the expression of &gt;1000 epithelial genes in a time- and MOI-dependent manner, including up- and downregulation [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. From these studies, it is well established that the inducible transcriptome encodes innate responses and growth-factor-associated remodeling pathways [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although this gene-level analysis has been informative to elucidate key signaling mediators and characterize products of innate defense, we lack a deep understanding of how mRNA processing controls the diversity of the cell stress response.

  <p>Proteome maps (two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis images; representative of six gels) of wild type and red ginseng extract (RGE)-treated 
   <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. (A) Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels of protein extracts from wild type (left) and RGE-treated (right) flies. Proteins (40 μg in total) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to detect the quality of extracted protein. Silver stained gels (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) of extracted protein: (B) Wild type flies. (C) RGE-treated flies. Proteins (1.2 mg) were resolved in 17 cm linear, immobilized pH (3–10) gradient gels and then separated by 12.5% SDS–PAGE. All spots were matched and normalized by gel-to-gel comparison using the PDquest software version 8.0 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and only those spots with reproducible changes (quantitative changes &gt; 1.5-fold in abundance, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were considered for subsequent analyses. (D) Spot numbers indicated on the master gel are differentially expressed proteins related to RGE treatment that were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry. IEF, isoelectrofocusing.

0: Ovarian tissues of the high-fertility Hu sheep breed at different developmental stages were harvested, their LncRNAs and miRNAs were sequenced to identify and predict differently expressed genes (DEGs) at the various time periods.
1: Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were also used for functional enrichment analyses, LncRNAs and miRNAs involved in their expression levels and the genes associated with Hu sheep ovary development were identified.
2: We further studied ovarian gene expression patterns and their enrichment pathways in Hu sheep to gain a better understanding of their regulatory roles in folliculogenesis.

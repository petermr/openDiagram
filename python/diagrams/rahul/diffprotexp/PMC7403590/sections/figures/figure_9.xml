  <p>ER Stress in AD. UPR markers were determined in 
   <italic>post-mortem</italic> human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of sporadic AD patients and controls. The levels of GRP78 and ATF4 were determined in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) SNpc; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Hippocampus and (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Densitometric analysis of the levels of GRP78 and ATF4. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information.

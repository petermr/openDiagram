<p>Gas vesicles are gas-filled prokaryotic organelles that function as flotation devices [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These results suggest that nitrogen deprivation induced heterocyst differentiation, which is consistent with previously reported findings [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In total, we identified eight DEGs encoding the gas vesicle protein (
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the comparison of NVs vs. NDVs, six DEGs were highly downregulated, suggesting that nitrogen deprivation inhibits the expression of gas vesicle genes in vegetative cells; these results are consistent with most of the results obtained previously on gas vesicle protein regulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, in the NDV vs. NDH comparison, three DEGs encoding gas vesicle genes were upregulated, suggesting that the expression of gas vesicle genes is higher in heterocysts than in vegetative cells under nitrogen deprivation conditions (
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the density of vegetative cells increases via inhibition of gas vesicle protein expression under nitrogen deprivation conditions. Our results are consistent with the phenomenon of water bloom under eutrophication conditions [

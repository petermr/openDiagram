<p>Our results indicate that raloxifene uniquely promotes proteostasis by simultaneously modulating the transcription of proteasome subunits, promoting proteasome assembly, altering deubiquitinating enzymes expression, and decreasing insoluble protein aggregation. These effects of raloxifene on proteostasis translate into a delay in disease progression in an animal model of familial ALS; however, these effects are observed only in females. Therefore, our study indicates that raloxifene, a drug widely used clinically, is a female-specific proteostasis therapeutic.</p>

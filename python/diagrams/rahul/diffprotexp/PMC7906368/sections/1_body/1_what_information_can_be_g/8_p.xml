<p>Metaproteomics can also be used to infer natural carbon isotope composition of peptides and proteins and thus of specific species. Recently developed approaches make use of this to (1) link microbial species in communities to the environmental carbon sources that they consume by protein stable isotope fingerprinting (Protein-SIF) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Protein-SIP was recently used to detect differential incorporation of

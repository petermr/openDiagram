  <p>Differential gene expression during carcinogenesis. (A) The total and top 4 significantly differentially expressed genes from inter‐comparisons between the normal cervix and CIN1, −2 and −3 lesions. (B) The total and top 4 significantly differentially expressed genes in cervical cancer compared to normal tissue and CIN1, −2 and −3 lesions. Blue represents up‐regulation; green represents down‐regulation. (C) Heatmap presentations of gene expression levels of 12 genes with predominantly increasing expression level. (D) Heatmap presentations of 12 genes with predominantly decreasing expression level. Red color represents the highest expression; green color represents the lowest expression</p>

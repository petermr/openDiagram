<p>Our results are also consistent with Ampuero et al that demonstrated microtubule cytoskeleton organization consistent with mitosis occurring in RSV-infected lung epithelial cells at 96 hours after infection. [

This suggests that in group 6 processes of mitosis started earlier than in group 2 (which had higher viral loads as shown by increased shedding) and tissue remodeling, characterized by cell proliferation and also basement membrane related processes, were already more active in the group with the lowest viral load and disease manifestation.

<p>To identify the change in gene expression during the course of development from sepsis to septic shock, we utilized STEM software to identify 712 common genes showing progressive dysregulation during sepsis progression. These genes fell into five significant clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7A</xref>). Interestingly, all the key genes that we identified above were detected in these clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7B</xref>). The expression of MAPK14, FGR, RHOG was gradually up-regulated from control to sepsis then to septic shock, while the expression of LAT, PRKACB, UBE2Q2, ITK, IL2RB, and CD247 was gradually down-regulated (

The pathway heatmap built by GSEA algorithm showed that starch and sucrose metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, and legionellosis were gradually up-regulated during the development of sepsis, while Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, IgA production in the intestinal immune network, as well as antigen processing and presentation were gradually down-regulated (

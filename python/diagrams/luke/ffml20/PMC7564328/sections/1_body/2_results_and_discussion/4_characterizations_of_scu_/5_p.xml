<p id="p0175">To further illustrate the interaction between SCU and CD-MOF, the thermal behaviors of SCU and SCU@CD-MOF were characterized by DSC (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). The pure SCU displayed typical crystalline features with characteristic endothermic peaks at 134.74 and 198.51 °C, and an exothermic peak at 203.84 °C. As a control group, the endothermic peak of SCU still existed in the physical mixture, and the endothermic peak shifted to the low temperature to 118.06 °C. Except for a large and broad endothermic peak at around 70 °C, corresponding to trace solvent (ethanol) evaporation, no significant endothermic and exothermic peaks were observed in SCU@CD-MOF. This result demonstrated that SCU distributed inside CD-MOF was in non-crystalline state and supported the previously hypothesis of SCU insertion into the molecular cavities of CD-MOF.

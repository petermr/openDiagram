0: Adaptors were removed from raw paired-end sequencing reads and trimmed for quality using Trim Galore!
1: (v.0.5.0) 65 a wrapper tool around Cutadapt 66 and FastQC 67.
2: Default parameters were used.
3: Quality control (QC) was performed before and after read trimming using FastQC (v.0.11.6) 67 and no issues were highlighted from the QC process.
4: Subsequent read alignment and post-alignment filtering was performed in concordance with the ENCODE projects ATAC-seq Data Standards and Prototype Processing Pipeline for replicated data ( https://www.encodeproject.org/atac-seq/).
5: In brief, reads were mapped to the chicken genome galGal5 assembly using bowtie2 (v.2.3.4.2) 68.
6: The resultant Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) files were compressed to the Binary Alignment Map (BAM) version on which SAMtools (v.1.9) 69 was used to filter reads that were unmapped, mate unmapped, not primary alignment or failing platform quality checks.
7: Reads mapped as proper pairs were retained.
8: Multi-mapping reads were removed using the Python script assign_multimappers provided by ENCODEs processing pipeline and duplicate reads within the BAM files were tagged using Picard MarkDuplicates (v.2.18.12) [ http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/] and then filtered using SAMtools.
9: For each step, parameters detailed in the ENCODE pipeline were used.
10: From the processed BAM files, coverage tracks in bigWig format were generated using deepTools bamCoverage (v 3.1.2) 70 and peaks were called using MACS2 (v.2.1.1) 71 (parameters -f BAMPE -g mm -B -nomodel -shift -100 -extsize 200).
11: Coverage tracks and peaks (narrow peak format) were uploaded to the UCSC Genome Browser 72 as custom tracks for ATAC-seq data visualisation.

<p>We also obtain a rank aggregated list of the proteins, based on the p-values of the tests based on differential connectivity of each protein in the two different networks of the two patient groups. The proportions of top fifty differentially connected proteins for each of the “target pathways” are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d)</xref>. Once again, PI3K and RAS take the top two most important spots in terms of differential network connectivity.

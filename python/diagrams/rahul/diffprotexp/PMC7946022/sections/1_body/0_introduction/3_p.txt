0: Our previous characterization of mixed  C. albicans and  S. aureus biofilms  in vitro and  in vivo demonstrated that  S. aureus exhibits high affinity to the  C. albicans hyphal form as these species co-adhere and interact synergistically, forming a dense and architecturally complex biofilm [ 25, 28, 29].
1: Furthermore, using a mouse model of oral co-infection, we demonstrated that onset of oral candidiasis may lead to systemic staphylococcal infection, stemming from a thick matrix of mixed biofilm formed on tongue tissue [ 30, 31].
2: Our subsequent  in vitro studies into the therapeutic implication of  C. albicans-S. aureus interactions in biofilm demonstrated that  C. albicans secreted matrix polysaccharides, primarily -1,3-glucan, confers  S. aureus with enhanced tolerance to antimicrobials by impeding drug penetration through the biofilm [ 29].
3: However, findings from the study also indicated that other factors may also contribute to the enhanced  S. aureus tolerance to antimicrobials, which we subsequently identified to be farnesol, a quorum-sensing molecule secreted by  C. albicans [ 32].
4: Specifically, we demonstrated that farnesol indirectly confers  S. aureus tolerance to vancomycin by elicitng a stress response  via activation of the thiol-based redox system.

<sup>-1</sup> up to 92&#186;C for 3 minutes, followed by a heating rate of 10&#176;C/min up to 120&#176;C and a rate of 20&#176;C/min up to 280&#176;C. The injection volume was 1.0 &#956;l. The calibration curve from a commercial sample of carvacrol [Sigma-Aldrich, Chicago, IL, USA] was obtained by recording the peak areas against the known injected amount contained in the same injected volume (1 ml). The analysis was performed in triplicate.

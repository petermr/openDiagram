<p>To understand the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of mice deficient in type I IFN responses, we infected WT (SV129) and ABR-/- mice with SLEV and collected tissue samples in time points preceding the death of ABR-/- mice (days 1–3 post-infection (p.i.)). We evaluated the viral load in SLEV-infected mouse brains to observe that SLEV replicates faster and to a greater extent in ABR-/- brains in comparison to WT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2a</xref>). SLEV is already detectable in ABR-/- brain samples at day 1 p.i., whereas some WT samples remain negative for the presence of SLEV up do day 3 p.i. Moreover, SLEV accumulation in ABR-/- brains is several orders of magnitude higher than the viral loads observed in WT brain samples. The biological effects of type I IFNs are mediated by ISGs, which prompted us to evaluate ISG expression in our model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b-g</xref>). We detected an early increase in IFNα4 in both WT and ABR-/- brain samples, which was downregulated in ABR-/- brain samples on day 2 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b</xref>). RIG-I, Mx1 and ISG15 expression increased to peak levels on day 3 p.i. in WT brains, which was not observed in ABR-/- brains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2c,d,g</xref>). Mx2 expression was upregulated in WT brains on day 2 p.i. and on day 3 in both WT and ABR-/- tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2e</xref>). ISG20 expression closely resembled IFNα4 expression and showed decreased expression in day 2 p.i. in ABR-/- samples in comparison to WT.

0: BackgroundTagetes minuta has a long record of human use for the treatment of stomach and intestinal diseases.
1: Most drugs used for diseases treatment are less efficacious with side effects and this brought the search for new treatment regimens mainly from medicinal plants.
2: MethodThe essential oil (EO) was extracted by Clevengers-type apparatus and its chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial properties were determined by GC-MS, spectrophotometric and broth dilution methods respectively.
3: S. uberis,    E. cloacae,    S. aureus,    M. smegmatis,    L. ivanovii,    Vibrio spp.
4: and    E. coli bacteria strains were used as test bacteria.
5: ResultsGC-MS analysis revealed 98 compounds in the EO flower of    T. minuta and -Ocimene (14.
6: 40%) was the major chemical constituents.
7: The EO exhibited highest inhibitory effect against DPPH radical, followed by its effect on ABTS, while LP radical showed the least sensitivity with IC   50 values of 2.45 mg/mL, 2.76 mg/mL and 3.23 mg/mL respectively.
8: The EO showed antibacterial activities against all test organisms with MIC value for    S. aureus,    M. smegatis and    S. uberis at 0.125 mg/mL and for    L. ivanovii,    Vibrio spp.,    E. cloacae and    E. coli at 0.06 mg/mL.
9: The EO showed MBC against    E. cloacae and    E. coli at 0.06 mg/mL at 0.5 mg/mL for    S. uberis and 0.125 mg/mL for    Vibrio spp.
10: ConclusionFindings from this study suggest that the EO of    T. minuta flower may be a useful candidate in the search for lead constituents for the synthesis of new potent antibacterial and antioxidant agent.

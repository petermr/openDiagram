<p>In addition to their roles in normal growth and development, ETS proteins are commonly involved in cancer formation and progression through the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, or vascularization, as well as regulation of epithelial–stromal interactions and epithelial–mesenchymal transition [
 <xref rid="B9-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The expressions of several ETS family members, such as PEA3, ETS-1, and ETS-2, are upregulated in tumors, playing a role in different aspects of tumorigenesis, including tumor initiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and angiogenesis [

In some cases, ETS members are amplified and/or rearranged, such as c-ETS1 in acute myelomonocytic leukemia, or undergo chromosomal relocations that result in fusions, like in the case of chromosomal translocation of 5′ TMPRSS2 to the ETS genes, resulting in TMPRSS:ERG fusion proteins in nearly half of prostate cancers, or chromosomal translocation that yields EWS-FLI1 fusion in Ewing sarcoma. The transcriptional potency of ETS proteins is also often increased in various cancers as a result of changes in protein–protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and/or protein stabilization [

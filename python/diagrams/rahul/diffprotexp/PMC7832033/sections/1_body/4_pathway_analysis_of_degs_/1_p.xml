<p>To gain better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the 283 altered genes in non-survivors compared to survivors, we performed KEGG pathway analysis. Interestingly, KEGG identified six pathways in immunological response that were associated with 65 up-regulated genes (Supplementary Table 4). These included pathways of Toll-like receptor signalling, Th17 cell differentiation, MAPK, IL-17 signalling, FoxO signalling, HIF-1 signalling. Moreover, KEGG identified seven pathways in immunological response that were associated with 218 down-regulated genes. These included hematopoietic cell lineage, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), intestinal immune network for IgA production, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, antigen processing and presentation and B cell receptor signalling pathway.</p>

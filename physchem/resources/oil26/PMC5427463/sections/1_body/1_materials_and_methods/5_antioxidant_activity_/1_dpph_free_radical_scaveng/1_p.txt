0: The ability of SoEO to scavenge the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured using the method described by Sahin et al.
1: (2004[ 45]) with modifications.
2: 0.5 mL of different concentrations of SoEO prepared in methanol (1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/mL) was added to 1.5 mL of a methanolic DPPH solution (100 M).
3: The measurement of absorbance was made against a blank prepared for each concentration at 517 nm after 30 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature.
4: The positive control is represented by a solution of a standard antioxidant (BHT).
5: Its absorbance was measured under the same conditions as the samples.
6: Absorbance values of these solutions were recorded on an ultraviolet and visible (UV-VIS) spectrometer (Lambda 25, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
7: The results were expressed as percent inhibition (I %) using the following Eq .
8: (1):

 <caption> ( a) First charge (—) and discharge ( ) obtained at a constant current of C/24 between 2 and 4 V versus graphite in an LFP/graphite battery. A paper Kodoshi separator is used, and an excess of the anode capacity is employed. ( b) The corresponding long cycling experiment is performed at a 1 C rate. The full and empty characters represent the Coulombic efficiency (%) and discharge capacity, respectively. </caption>

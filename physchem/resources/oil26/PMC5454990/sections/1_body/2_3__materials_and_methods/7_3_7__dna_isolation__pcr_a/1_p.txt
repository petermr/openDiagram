0: Genomic DNA material was extracted from dried leaf tissue of each plant using E.Z.N.A  Poly-Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the protocol given by the company.
1: For amplification of  matK region, PCR was performed in a 50 L reaction mixture that consisted of 36.5 L of nanofiltrated (NF) water, 5.0 L of 10 Advantage Buffer, 1.0 L of deoxynucleotide (DNTP), 0.5 L of Taq-DNA polymerase, 5.0 L template DNA, 1.0 L of  matK-Lau001 (F-5-TCCTTTCTTGAGCGAACACA-3), and 1.0 L of  matK-Lau002 (R-5-CTGACAAATCGGACCGAAAC-3) primers purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA).
2: Amplifications conditions for  matK primers consisted of an initial denaturation step for 2 min at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 C, 30 s at 61 C, 60 s at 68 C, and 60 s at 72 C for final extension.
3: Amplifications were performed in an Eppendorf MasterCycler Pro thermocycler, the PCR products were visualized in agarose gel (1%), purified, and then they were sent to Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA) for sequencing.

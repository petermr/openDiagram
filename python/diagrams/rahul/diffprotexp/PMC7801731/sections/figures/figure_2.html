 <caption> Gene expression patterns of RNA-seq and correlation with RT-qPCR. ( A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) at day 1 of regeneration. ( B) Volcano plot of DETs at day 3 of regeneration. ( C) Bar plots show upregulated and downregulated DETs in one or both days of regeneration. ( D) Plot showing correlation line, squared Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value between 12 expression values (Log2FC) of seven genes in regeneration stages compared to the normal stage. RNA-seq values are located in the x axis and RT-qPCR values are located on the y axis. Green colored points are from day 1 values, while red colored are from day 3. </caption>

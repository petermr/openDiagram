0: DPPH assay was carried out following the modified method of Ajileye et al., [ 25].
1: Briefly, the solution of DPPH (0.135 mM) was prepared in methanol and incubated in the dark for 30 min.
2: One hundred microliter of the essential oil or standards (positive control) were prepared in methanol of various concentration ranging from (0.030.5 mg/mL), and was added into all the wells of microtiter plate starting from (C-H) in triplicates except for A (A1-A12) and B (B1-B12).
3: Thereafter, 100 L of 0.135 mM of DPPH solution prepared in methanol was added into the wells from C-H. Absorbance was spectrophotometrically observed at 517 nm and the essential oil ability to lower DPPH to neutral molecule was expressed as percentage inhibition using the formula percentage inhibition = {(Abs  control Abs  sample)}/ (Abs control)  100.

0: After solution heat treatment at 540 C for 20 min, the samples were quenched to a certain soaking temperature in a power-compensated DSC (Pyris 1 DSC, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
1: The temperature program and the parameters used are shown in  Figure 1.
2: Cooling should be carried out at a rate faster than the critical cooling rate for the alloy [ 31].
3: The selected soaking temperatures ranged from 250 C to 450 C with temperature intervals  T = 10 K. The soaking time was determined with preliminary tests, varying the soaking step between 30 and 60 min.
4: The preliminary tests showed that after 30 min, dissolution reactions were no longer detectable.
5: One disc-shaped sample of EN AW-6005A with a diameter of 5.7 mm and a height of 1 mm was repeatedly used for all experiments.
6: Due to initial solution annealing and quenching, a fresh supersaturated solid solution was adjusted for every new experiment.
7: The sample mass was 69.615 mg.

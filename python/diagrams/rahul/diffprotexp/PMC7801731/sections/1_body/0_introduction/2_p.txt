0: Organisms with astonishing regenerative capacities are scattered among basal metazoan lineages and in various lophotrochozoan and deuterostome phyla.
1: The latter encompasses a wide group of organisms that includes vertebrates along with tunicates, echinoderms, hemichordates, and cephalochordates.
2: This phylogenetic placement makes highly regenerative groups such as tunicates and echinoderms, attractive models for studying regeneration.
3: Their potentially shared genetic mechanisms highlight their importance for biomedical studies 3,  4.

0: Peptides were separated off-line on a 200  2.1 mm, 5 m SCX column (Polysulfoethyl A, The Nest Group) using a gradient of 240% B over 50 min with a flow rate of 250 L/min.
1: Solvent A was 5 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.0 in 25% acetonitrile and 75% ddH 2O.
2: Solvent B was 500 mM ammonium formate, pH 6.0 in 25% acetonitrile and 75% ddH 2O.
3: The separation was monitored at 280 nm followed by collecting fractions every 4 min.
4: Fractions were dried using a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 15 L of 0.1% FA for MS analysis.

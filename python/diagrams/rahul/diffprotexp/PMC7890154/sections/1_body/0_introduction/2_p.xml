<p id="par0030">Wheat is ancient and staple cereal crops grown in large part of the world under a wide range of agro-climatic regions. Major share of carbohydrate and calories in the diet are provided by wheat [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It contains 1.5–2% fat, 1.5–2% minerals, vitamins, and 2.2% crude fibers. Various abiotic stresses like drought stress, chilling injury, heat stress (HS), salinity stress, etc. have severe impact on the yield and grain-quality of wheat across the globe [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Terminal HS is defined as an elevation in temperature above ambient (&gt;32 °C) during flowering and grain-filling stages [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Terminal HS has severe effect on different biological processes operating inside the plant system causing enormous losses in grain yield. Since, the ambient temperature is predicted to continue rising under climate change (1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052; IPCC, 2018), HS will be more severe for most of the agriculturally important crops, especially wheat [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The grain-quality and overall yield has been reported to be severely affected due to fluctuation in temperature during fertilization and grain-filling stages [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Heat stress during pollination stage causes formation of defunct pollen, unwinding of stigma, improper fertilization, false-seed setting, defragmentation of starch particles, and formation of shriveled grains [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Terminal HS reduces the grain-filling duration as well as the length of peduncle minimizing the total grain yield [

0: A congenital cholesteatoma is a keratinized squamous epithelial middle ear lesion that usually presents in young children who do not have a history of otitis media, middle ear surgery, or trauma.
1: The presentation and progress of congenital cholesteatoma are quite different from those of acquired cholesteatoma.
2: Congenital cholesteatomas commonly appear as pearl-like epidermoid cysts, mostly located in the antero-superior quadrant behind an intact tympanic membrane [ 1,  2].
3: These cholesteatomas can have invasive growth and cause osteolysis [ 3].

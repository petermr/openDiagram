0: All samples were acquired by the LC-MS system followed machine orders.
1: Chromatographic separations were performed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters, USA) and a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer SYNAPT G2 XS QTOF (Waters, USA) was used to detect metabolites as the methods described by Huang et al.
2: [ 30].
3: The mass spectrometry data were acquired in Centroid MSE mode.
4: Statistical analysis was performed as previous [ 31].
5: Putative metabolites were first derived by searching the exact molecular mass data from redundant m/z peaks against the online HMDB ( http://www.hmdb.ca/), METLIN ( http://metlin.scripps.edu/) and KEGG ( www.genome.jp/kegg/) databases.

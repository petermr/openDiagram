<p>The results apply only to the murine melanoma cell line B16 under specific experimental conditions of this study. They do not allow for any generalization and cannot extrapolate the results found in our work to another melanoma model given the high biological variability. In this regard, we compared the same population of the cell line under two different phenotypes to have the same genetic background to decrease biological variability. While a basis for comparison is still maintained, many differences between cell lines and primary cell cultures and the heterogeneity in melanoma from biopsies or surgical specimens may limit these findingsâ€™ relevance to the miRNA expression. They may be different and questionable for the genetic variations. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the findings in other melanoma cells, especially in primary human melanoma cultures.</p>

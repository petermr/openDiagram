<p>To complete our analysis, the assignment of the DRIFTS bands to surface methoxy and hydrogen bonded methanol species is verified by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Calculated vibrational frequencies of methoxy species at the Brønsted acidic site are 925, 1157/1165, 2880 and 2988 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>. The band at 925 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is arising from the 
 <italic>ν</italic>(C–O) stretch (structure A in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>)
 <xref rid="cit21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and the pair of bands at 1157/1165 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> are due to perpendicular and parallel methyl rock modes (the parallel mode is represented by structure B in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which themselves are not resolved in the DRIFTS data (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">ref. 30</xref>). The bands at 2880 and 2988 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> result from

 <sub>s</sub>(C–H) and 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>as</sub>(C–H) stretching modes of the methoxy species, respectively (structures C and D in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). By comparison with the DRIFTS data, the calculated vibrational frequencies of methoxy 
 <italic>ν</italic>(C–O) stretch and methyl rock modes are slightly red shifted, while 
 <italic>ν</italic>(C–H) stretching modes are slightly blue shifted. Also, 
 <italic>ν</italic>(C–O) stretch and methyl rock modes are slightly red shifted as compared to those reported in our earlier study, which can be attributed to the two different methods employed.
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The calculated vibrational frequencies of the methoxy species are slightly affected by co-adsorption of either methanol and/or water molecules in the unit cell, representing the experimental conditions, which indicates the sensitivity of vibrational frequencies of adsorbed species to the local environment of the zeolite unit cell. Based on these observations, we conclude that the calculated vibrational frequencies are in line with the experimental DRIFTS data as is evident from 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2.</xref> The vibrational frequencies of deuterated methoxy species are calculated to be 753, 865/900, 2078 and 2253 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, which are arising from 
 <italic>ν</italic>(C–O) stretch, 
 <italic>ρ</italic>(CD

 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>(C–D) and 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>as</sub>(C–D) modes, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The calculated 
 <italic>ν</italic>(C–D) stretching modes represent an ideal case of only one kind of methoxy species as opposed to the experimental data that reflect a complex combination of reactants and product molecules in a unit cell, and hence are blue shifted slightly as compared to the DRIFTS results (see 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

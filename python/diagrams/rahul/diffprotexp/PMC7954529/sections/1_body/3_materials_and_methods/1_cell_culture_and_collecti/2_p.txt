0: Once all cells lines reached 1  10 6 cells/mL, we used the collection and RNA extraction method detailed in  Mittleman et al., 2020 .
1: to extract whole-cell and nuclear mRNA.
2: Briefly, we collected 30 million cells in two 15 million cell aliquots.
3: We extracted nuclei from one aliquot per line using the nuclear isolation protocol outlined by  Mayer and Churchman, 2016.
4: We extracted mRNA in two fraction- and species-matched batches, using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions, including the DNase step to remove genomic DNA.
5: We quantified mRNA and tested quality using a nanodrop.
6: Details of mRNA processing for each line, including concentrations and quality, can be found in  Supplementary file 4.

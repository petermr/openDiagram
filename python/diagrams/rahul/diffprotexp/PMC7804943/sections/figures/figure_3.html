 <caption> GE and APA changes in LF2 distinguish proximal-distal neurons from other axes. a Enrichment map displaying the functional enrichment analysis of genes from top GE events with the largest absolute LF2 loading. See Fig.  2c for description of enrichment maps. b Bar-plot showing the proportion of top-weighted genes that overlap known RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). When comparing the degree of overlap between each latent factor and known RBPs, only LF2 has a significant overlap (27/298, p = 4.19 × 10 −6, hypergeometric test). n.s.: not significant. c Heatmap showing normalized read counts of top 15 RBPs (rows) observed in LF2 for each sample (columns). Each gene is annotated according to its differential expression status between proximal-distal and dorsal-ventral-superficial-deep neurons (left vertical bar). Each sample is annotated according to region (top horizontal bar) and sample names are as in Fig.  2b. PD = proximal-distal neurons. d Heatmap showing the APA profiles inferred by QAPA, measured by proximal poly(A) site usage (PPAU), of the top-weighted 3′ UTRs (rows) for each sample (columns). e Bar-plot showing the proportion of top-weighted 3′ UTRs from each latent factor with genes known to localize to dendrites and axons 46 . Similar to b, when comparing the degree of overlap between each latent factor and known localization genes, only LF2 had a significant overlap (27/66, p = 3.85 × 10 −5, hypergeometric test). Sample names are as in Fig.  2b. n.s.: not significant. f Scatterplot showing the latent factor 2 loadings ( y-axis) for each 3′ UTR in ascending order from left to right ( x-axis). Lengthening 3′ UTRs (indicated by negative loadings, Supplementary Fig.  3A) that belong to localized transcripts are represented by red dots. The bottom-right box shows genes with localized transcripts from the indicated region of the plot. </caption>

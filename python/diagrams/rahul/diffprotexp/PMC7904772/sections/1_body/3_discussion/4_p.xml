<p id="Par28">In the present study, the 20 differentially expressed proteins involved in the significant KEGG pathways were further independently validated using the PRM-based approach. The results showed that Gfap, Rhog, Gnai2, Ppp1r1b, and Uqcrh were specifically dysregulated in the prefrontal cortex of the depression-susceptible group, while Tubb6, Urod, Cul1, Spred1, and Gpcpd1 were specifically dysregulated in the anxiety-susceptible group. The molecular response specificity in the prefrontal cortex suggested that identical CMS could differently impact the MF, thereby potentially pushing forward various BP and correlated rat behavioral phenotypes. Interestingly, we found that Acadl, Ppp1r1a, Grm2, Mtor, Lsm8, Cplx2, and Tsta3 were specifically dysregulated in the insusceptible group. This suggests a potential pathway to coping with the CMS-induced protein dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex. It could be speculated that these distinct changes might be involved in positive molecular mechanisms of stress protection in the rat prefrontal cortex

 </sup>. Furthermore, we also noted the opposite change of Thy1 in depression-susceptible and insusceptible groups, which might be an important clue for resilience to depression.

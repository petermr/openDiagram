<p>Recent studies have shown that miRNAs secreted by MVs can serve as paracrine intercellular signaling molecules in different cell types, highlighting their potential role in cell-to-cell communication between kidney and heart. Therefore, we first examined whether injured tubular cells were capable of promoting MVs. NRK-52E is a kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line of normal rat origin. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A)</xref> shows that after NRK-52E cells were incubated with TGF-β1 for 48 h, the production and secretion of MVs were assessed by TEM. Our results indicated that compared with control, recipient cardiomyocytes were induced to undergo hypertrophy, evidenced by enlarged cell size (

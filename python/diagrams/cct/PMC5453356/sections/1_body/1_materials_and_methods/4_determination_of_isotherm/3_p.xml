<p>The second method to create TTP diagrams out of the isothermal DSC measurements is to use a certain relative amount of released heat of any heat flow curve and to plot the corresponding time values of the relative amounts in the time-temperature diagram. Therefore, the total specific precipitation heat or specific enthalpy was calculated by integrating the area below the heat flow curves and normalizing the gained values by the sample mass.</p>

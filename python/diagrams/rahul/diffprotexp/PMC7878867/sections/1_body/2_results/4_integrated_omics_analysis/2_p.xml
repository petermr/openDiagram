<p id="Par28">To identify miRNA-mRNA pairs responsive to the transgenerational effects of parental treatment, comparisons were made between AtCC and AtWC, AtCW and AtWW (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM20" ref-type="media">S15</xref>). For the progeny under the control conditions, 424 miRNA-mRNA pairs showed antagonistic regulatory patterns in the flag leaf in response to stress imposed on the parents (AtWC_L vs AtCC_L); in the developing grains, 495 miRNA-mRNA pairs were found (AtWC_G vs AtCC_G). For the progeny under water-deficit stress, 365 miRNA-mRNA pairs showed antagonistic regulatory patterns in the flag leaf in response to stress imposed on the parents (AtWW_L vs AtCW_L); in the developing grains, 770 miRNA-mRNA pairs were found (AtWW_G vs AtCW_G).

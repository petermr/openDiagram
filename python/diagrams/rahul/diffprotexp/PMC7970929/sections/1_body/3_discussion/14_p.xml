<p id="Par40">Briefly, the response of 
 <italic>Urochondra setulosa</italic> is slightly different from other studied halophytes by maintaining membrane stability and better plant growth at higher salinity. Differential gene expression analysis depicts that, RUBISCO activity is upregulated and hence photosynthesis is not inhibited by salinity. Other reports are also available in 
 <italic>U. setulosa</italic> with enhanced gas exchange efficiency and plant biomass at salinity

 </sup>. In other halophytes, e.g. in 
 <italic>Suaeda salsa</italic>, down-regulation of photosynthesis was observed with upregulation of antioxidant genes at 30% salinity

 <italic>U. setulosa</italic> is similar to that observed in other highly salt tolerant halophytes, 
 <italic>Thellungiella halophile</italic> and 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> through upregulation of H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPases, Na and K transporters under salinity

 </sup>. 
 <italic>U. setulosa</italic>, being a perennial halophyte find opportunity for further exploring salt tolerance pathways in a way that salt cress (
 <italic>Thellungiella halophila</italic>) is able to tolerate high salinity levels for shorter periods only and not able to survive at high salt concentrations for longer durations

0: The functional annotations of genes were carried out against the curated KEGG genes database using KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server), ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html).
1: Subsequently, each gene was provided with KO (KEGG Orthology) assignment, and association of the gene with KEGG metabolic pathway was determined.

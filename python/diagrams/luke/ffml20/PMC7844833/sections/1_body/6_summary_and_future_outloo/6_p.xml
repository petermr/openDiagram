<p>Furthermore, it is extremely important for 
 <italic>operando</italic> studies to ensure that tools for the online monitoring of the reaction products and evaluation of the catalyst performance are directly available at the beamline. The demand for complementary techniques results also in the need of developing new reaction cells suitable for multimodal characterization, as, for example, XAS combined with 
 <italic>in situ</italic> IR and Raman signal detection. Alternatively, in cases where multimodal characterization tools cannot be applied simultaneously at the beamline, reactor cells should be employed that are compatible with the sample transfer among different experimental techniques without breaking their original environment. An example here is to conduct XAS and TEM studies at different stages of a catalytic process on the same catalyst and within the same reactor cell.

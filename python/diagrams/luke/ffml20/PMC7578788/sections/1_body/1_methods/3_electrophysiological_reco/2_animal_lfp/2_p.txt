0: Data from the neural probe were captured at 30 kHz with a Cerberus neural acquisition processor (Blackrock Microsystems).
1: EMG signals were online filtered with analog filters (bandpass 0.35 kHz) and visualised on a digital oscilloscope and then recorded at 30 kHz by the Cerberus processor.
2: The paw contact signal was converted into an analog TTL signal to indicate paw contact with the base plate and time of paw lift.
3: Paw entry into the tube was determined by a photo-electric switch at the tube entrance.

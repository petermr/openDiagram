0: Since it is an essential oil and not easily dissolved in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) nutrient medium, in order to dissolve the essential oil in the nutrient medium, first it is dissolved in the organic solvent DMSO and then added to the nutrient medium MHB located on a shaker (100 rpm) so that the oil is uniformly dissolved in all parts of the medium.
1: Each ml of  D.kotschyi oil weights 0.68 g. 300 ml oil is dissolved in 300 l DMSO solution and then using a nutrient solution MHB, the volume is increased to 1000 l and spin and vortex for 5 minutes (2000 rpm) so that a stock with a concentration of 20480 g/m1 is prepared and then by serial dilution in nutrient medium MHB the concentrations of 20 to 5120 g/m1 oil are prepared in the wells.
2: The final DMSO concentration was 5% (v/v), and this solution was selected as a negative control.

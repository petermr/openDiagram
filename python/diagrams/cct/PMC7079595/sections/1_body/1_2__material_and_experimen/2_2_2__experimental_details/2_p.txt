0: The experimental procedure was carried out by the means of dilatometry using a high-resolution BAHR Dilatometer DIL805A/D.
1: The analysis and determination of transformation temperatures were performed according to the ASTM A1033-04 standard [ 16].
2: Dilatometric samples of 4 mm diameter and 10 mm length were used in all experiments.
3: The heating of samples was performed by an induction system in a vacuum and the temperature controlled by a K type thermocouple welded to the center of the specimen.
4: The samples were heated up at the rate of 3 C/s to a temperature of 1100 C (variants A and B).
5: The austenitization time was 300 s, after which the samples were cooled down at 60 C/s, by blowing He directly into the specimens, down to selected temperatures.
6: In the case of the variant C, the material was heated to an intercritical temperature of 700 and 720 C with the same heating rate.
7: After the isothermal holding, samples in all variants were cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 10 C/s.
8: The longer time was designed because of manganese diffusion, which needs more time to enrich austenite.
9: It is necessary because the manganese is an austenite forming element.
10: Therefore, it enhances the stability of retained austenite [ 17].

It has been demonstrated that when articular cartilage defects regenerate, they form mainly fibro-cartilaginous tissue, which has inferior biochemical and biomechanical properties as compared to hyaline cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. It has been mentioned that the development of fibrocartilage tissue can be attenuated if the appropriate cartilage proteins are expressed. It is therefore believed that further improvement to the cartilage repair outcomes can be achieved by ensuring that the appropriate proteins, which may also involve the proteins predominantly found in hyaline matrix, are expressed within the repaired cartilage site. One way to ensure that this is achieved is through the implantation of cells that have the ability to express the typical proteins required to obtain optimal tissue repair. The effect of implanting these cells has been observed in many studies and is presently being used as acceptable therapies in many countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. In most studies, the use of autologous chondrocyte is common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. However, the use of these cells appears to only provide good medium-term outcomes attributed to the ageing transplanted cells, which is expected of any adult somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>.</p><p>Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are regarded as a promising and potential alternative cell source in the repair of cartilage due to its multi-lineage differentiation ability <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although MSCs possess strong intrinsic chondrogenic capacity, implantation of undifferentiated MSCs in constructs using various sources has also resulted in the formation of fibrous tissues, increased expression of type-I collagen and the loss of sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. Furthermore, bone marrow MSCs showed an increased propensity to express type-X collagen which correlates with mineralization of the tissue at the implanted site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. It has therefore been postulated that the use of pre-differentiated chondrogenic MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> would have the ability to express specific cartilage related proteins, which can lead to early if not better cartilage healing. However, in our previous pre-clinical study, we were not able to demonstrate the superiority of cMSCs over MSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>.</p><p>The reason for our previous finding remains unexplained. Although cMSCs may produce expressions that are closely similar to adult chondrocytes (AC), within the mixture of proteins expressed there may be alterations or deviations in the protein expression patterns, which lead to the limitations in the final outcome observed previously. When attempts were made to determine if such phenomenon may be the case, it is found that previous studies were mainly confined to determining the differential protein expression of pre- and post-chondrogenic induction of MSCs. Furthermore, reports comparing cMSCs to ACs appear lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. Considering that the understanding of such findings holds great importance for the development of future therapies, this proteomic study was therefore conducted to compare the global protein expression of cMSCs to that of ACs and MSCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell and tissue Culture</title><p>This study was approved by the University of Malaya animal ethics committee [OS/05/07/2006/TKZ/A(R) and OS/02/06/2008/TKZ(a)(R)].

Whilst it can be assumed that similar profiles to that of ACs should be expressed by chondrogenic MSCs, this was not observed in our present study, suggesting that cMSCs may not function exactly the same way to native ACs. This has become the premise in which based on the differentially expressed protein profile, we hypothesize that cMSCs do not perform as expected <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. There were six most differentially expressed proteins observed in between the ACs, MSCs and cMSCs. However, of these, only MYL6B, ALDOA, TAGLN2 and EF1-ALPHA were not highly modulated in cMSCs as compared to ACs. Further analyses of the data gained in this study revealed that these differentially expressed proteins from cMSCs were related to cytoskeletal, metabolic enzymes, and biosynthesis proteins, which may have contributed to the ineffectiveness of these differentiated cells in cartilage repair.</p><p>In general, the actin cytoskeleton regulation of stem cell is essential for chondrogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> where TGF-&#x003b2; rapidly activates PI3K/Akt pathway towards the reorganization of actin filament and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. However, this study demonstrates that cofilin-1 (CFL1), myosin light chain (MLC6B) and transgelin-2 (TAGLN2) were highly modulated in MSC towards chondrogenic lineage <italic>in vitro</italic>. CFL1 enhances the rate of dissociation of actin microfilaments, which in turn affects the mechanical properties and extracellular matrix assembly of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. In contrary to CFL1, the expression level of MYL6B appears to be increasing in an ascending order from MSCs, cMSCs to ACs. In this study, cMSCs and ACs may have indicated the occurrence of cell contraction during the remodelling of collagen-GAG extracellular matrix (ECM) and acto-myosin fibril <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2; has been reported to inhibit cofilin through non-Smad signalling pathways by activating Rho GTPases, ROCK and Limk2, thus shifting towards actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Our findings indicate that the complex interactions of ECM molecules may modulate cell-ECM attachment, resulting in initiation of chondrogenesis and maintenance of the chondrogenic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. Although hydrogel contraction could be beneficial for the production of cartilaginous constructs using MSCs, it is postulated that the transgelin associated cell-seeded scaffolds contraction might possibly affect cell migration and proliferation, hence resulting in poorly functional chondrocytes. In this study, TAGLN2 was significantly down-regulated in cMSC (p&#x0003c;0.01). Absence of TAGLN2 has shown to increase the activity of Rho GTPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> that phosphorylates MYL6B and induces formation of stress fibres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>. The underlying mechanism behind the association of TAGLN2 down-regulation in cMSCs compared to the AC is unclear, therefore further comparative analysis may be required in order to provide further insights to the role of TAGLN2 in chondrogenesis.</p><p>Activity of GAPD in cMSC and ACs has increased three folds as compared to MSCs. Rocha et. al. (2012) reported similar outcome of which the cytoskeleton-related and metabolic-related protein were upregulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>. Increased expression of GAPD is associated with the synthesis and deposition of ECM molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Cartilage ECM proteoglycans formation is preceded by markedly increased activity of uridinediphosphoglucose dehydrogenase (UDPGD), which is directly associated with GAG synthesis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPD and succinate dehydrogenase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. In this study, ALDOA expression was lower in cMSCs than both the MSCs and ACs. ALDOA is a glycolytic enzyme for energy generation in chondrocytes, particularly marked at cell maturity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Reduction of energy modulated by ALDOA may limit the ability of ACs to restore GAG matrices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. Recently, both GAPD and ALDOA have been found to interact with S100A1 and S100B proteins that suppress hypertrophic differentiation and mineralization of chondrogenic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>.</p><p>Elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-alpha), a GTP-binding protein plays a central role in protein biosynthesis. In this study, this factor was found significantly down-regulated in cMSC (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). EF1-alpha is a key regulator of various physiological processes, such as aging, proliferation, apoptosis, protein degradation and cytoskeletal rearrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>. Phosphorylated EF1-alpha by type-I TGF&#x003b2; receptor kinase at Serine 300 exerted a direct inhibitory on protein synthesis, therefore reducing cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. Detailed molecular mechanism of this pathway remains unexplored. It was suggested that phosphorylated EF1-alpha represents a mechanism by which cell cycle is inhibited as a relative fast response to TGF-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. EF1-alpha also interacts with the cytoskeleton by binding and bundling with actin filaments and microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. In this context, EF1-alpha functions in regulating the transport, anchorage and translation of mRNA on actin filaments that may be important in ACs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>.</p><p>It needs to be reminded that although the present study has demonstrated some interesting results, certain limitations needs to be understood in order not to overstate the findings of the present study. In a study using animal as a reference of protein differences, it is worth noting that several protein differences may exist in other species, especially in human. It has been previously demonstrated that cartilage gene expressions and characteristics are species specific, and therefore may vary among the different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>. This is important when having to translate the findings clinically. Nevertheless, healthy human donor matched MSCs and ACs samples under a well-controlled environment are not usually available and therefore not feasible to be used in any laboratory study. However, in comparison to what is available today, the present study has its positive points as most studies of similar nature are limited to immortalized cell line such as C3H10T1/2, which many will agree by itself express aberrant proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>. While the present study has suggested that any disruption in the cytoskeletal, metabolic enzymes, and biosynthesis proteins functions may be the cause for the ineffectiveness of cMSCs, this still needs to be proven in more specifically experimental designs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, distinct differences in the global protein expressions were identified between ACs, MSCs and cMSCs. Of these differentially expressed proteins, MYL6B, ALDOA, TAGLN2 and EF1-ALPHA were not as highly modulated during MSC chondrogenesis as compared to ACs. These differences may have been the contributing factors to the ineffectiveness of cMSCs in the cartilage repair. However, this needs to be demonstrated and supported by data obtained from more rigorously designed studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Grant numbers and sources of support: University of Malaya's HIR-MOHE research grant initiative, University of Malaya Research Grant: RG087/09HTM and University of Malaya Postgraduate Research Grant: PS259/2010B.

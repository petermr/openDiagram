<p>Fitting with one or a combination of several Lorentzian functions is also a common approach to characterize the shape, positions and intensities of the pre-edge features. The choice of Lorentzian line shape is based on the observation that if the broadening of the spectral features due to the instrumental resolution is low, the width of the features corresponding to a particular electronic transition is limited by the intrinsic lifetime of the excitation, which results in Lorentzian broadening. If the effect of the finite instrumental resolution cannot be neglected, Voigt or Gaussian functions can be a more meaningful approximations of the shapes of the observed peaks.

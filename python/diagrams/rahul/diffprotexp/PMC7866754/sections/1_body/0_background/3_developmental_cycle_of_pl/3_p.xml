<p id="Par9">Approaches to identify candidate genes that are responsible for the development of infectivity to mammalian hosts typically involve differential gene expression analysis between oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, although these studies have successfully identified genes and proteins that are upregulated in the mammalian-infectious stage, the detection may be limited to annotated proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and open reading frames (ORFs) predicted using restrictive criteria such as a minimum length of 100 codons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

 <caption> Alternative splicing mechanisms associated with isoform switches and consequences for protein expression. A Schematic showing different splicing events that can lead to gene isoform switches. B Quantification of the number of isoforms showing more or less splicing events in AD compared to controls for each dataset. C Quantification of the number of isoforms showing (i) gain or loss of coding potential, domains/signal peptides identified, intrinsically disordered regions (IDR), intron retention, open-reading frame (ORF) sequencing similarity; (ii) switch (simultaneous gain and loss) of domains identified or IDR; (iii) sensitive or insensitive to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD); and (iv) longer or shorter ORF sequencing similarity. </caption>

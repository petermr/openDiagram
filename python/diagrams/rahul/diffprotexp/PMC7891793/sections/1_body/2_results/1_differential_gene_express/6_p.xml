<p>Generation of a network among GO terms using predicted network interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246695.g003">Fig 3</xref>) demonstrated close relationships between B cell activation/differentiation terms and antigen receptor-mediated signaling. The close relationship of this functional cluster with purine base metabolism GO terms, points to active nucleic translation and transcription processes. Genes (ADA and MFNG), that are differentially expressed in B cell activation pathways have significantly lower expression in lesions than in the lung tissue without lesion. ADA is the shared gene between these two functional clusters. Another gene (PRKCB) belonging to the antigen receptor-mediated pathway is down-regulated in the lesions too, demonstrating that antigen response, B cell differentiation and proliferation is suppressed in affected lung tissue with apparent pathological changes.

 <sub>H2O</sub>(
 <italic>c</italic>) and 
 <italic>c</italic> represents the concentration of water and of solute, respectively. In THz‐DR experiments, larger amounts of depolarization were measured than depolarization by dilution effect and kinetic depolarization. This amount of depolarization can be explained by the presence of the water molecules which no longer participate in bulk‐like reorientation dynamics. This corresponds to the hydration water.[

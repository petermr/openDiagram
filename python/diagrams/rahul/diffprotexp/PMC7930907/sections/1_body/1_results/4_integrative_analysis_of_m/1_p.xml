<p>We analyzed the association between DEGs and differential metabolites among three ASC adipose deposits. In EASCs, the heat map and association analysis network diagram show the top 20 DEGs and differential metabolites and the correlation between DEGs and metabolites by Pearson correlation analysis with 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>), including 18 differential metabolites and 19 DEGs. The results showed that the 
 <italic>acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase 2</italic> (
 <italic>Acat2</italic>) gene (the top 10 nodes ranked by MCC and degree ≥6, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) was associated with nine metabolites in 10 metabolic pathways, including seven downregulated and two upregulated metabolites in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Markup Language (KGML) network analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similarly, the correlation analysis between DEGs and differential metabolites in SASCs and PASCs showed that 20 DEGs were closely related to 9 differential metabolites. KGML network analysis showed that the 
 <italic>Rrm1/Rrm2</italic> gene (the top 10 nodes ranked by MCC and degree ≥6, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) was closely related to 11 metabolites in six metabolic pathways, including five downregulated and six upregulated metabolites; the 
 <italic>Galactosidase alpha</italic> (
 <italic>Gla</italic>) gene (the top 10 nodes ranked by MCC and degree ≥6, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) was closely related to four metabolites in six metabolic pathways, including one downregulated and three upregulated metabolites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A–C</xref>).

<p id="Par45">An interesting finding in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c is that PREC has the largest values for the OPH pathway in all chambers, indicating that the energy metabolism is the most controlled pathway, presumably to limit alteration of the ATP level

 </sup>. In contrast, ICT is the least controlled group of genes, most likely for faster adaptation to the needed changes in heart rhythm, electrical and contractile properties during physical activity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>
 </sup>. However, the low expression control of ICT genes is compensated by the high percentages of their synergistic pairing (particularly in LV, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b) and expression synchrony (particularly between the two ventricles, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c,d). We assume that the high interventricular expression synchrony of the sodium channels and their poor interatrial synchrony may be the evolutionary results of much earlier separation of the two atria.

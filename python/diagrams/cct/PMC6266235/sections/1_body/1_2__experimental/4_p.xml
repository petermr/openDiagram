<p>The mean grain size was estimated on the CLSM sample using a circular-intercept method from image analysis of at least 500 grains. Intercept lengths were determined and then converted into nominal grain diameters using standard tables. The electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) was applied to analyze the misorientation of the microstructure.</p>

<p id="Par30">With the advancement of science and technology, multi-omics analysis is extensively used to solve biological problems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Multi-omics joint analysis can understand and prioritize the problems we need to solve from big data and multi-dimensional data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This study used laser capture microdissection to extract RNA from tapetum cells for transcriptome analysis, and &lt; 1 mm flower buds were used for proteomics and metabolomics analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Excellent results were achieved for our subsequent analysis and screening of candidate genes. We obtained 24 candidate genes involved in RNA editing, electron transfer respiratory chain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], anther development, energy conversion, tapetum development, and oxidative phosphorylation-associated through joint analysis of multi-omics pathways. Our results suggested that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways were near related to the generation and transport of energy in the tricarboxylic acid cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This study’s joint analysis found a correlation analysis of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways is considerably diverse. Our findings refer that energy changes should be fundamental in 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we discovered the restorer gene, and it was found that the protein involved in RNA editing may work together in the 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS 
 <italic>atp6/orf224</italic> transcript [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, sharing caused the infertility gene to be non-functional.

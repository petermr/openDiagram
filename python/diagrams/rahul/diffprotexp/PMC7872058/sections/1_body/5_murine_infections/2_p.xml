<p>Mice were weighed every 24Â hours from the day of infection and visual inspection was made twice daily. Mice dying of fungal challenge were recorded daily for survival analysis. Depending on the experiment, mice were culled and whole lungs were collected after two, three, or five days post-infection (dpi). We used 10 to 12 mice per condition for survival, three mice per day for immune response and histology analyses. Uninfected animals were included as controls in all experiments. At least two independent murine infections were performed.</p>

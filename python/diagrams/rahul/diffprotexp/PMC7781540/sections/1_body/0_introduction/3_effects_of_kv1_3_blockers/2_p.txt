0: In these types of  in vitro systems K V1.3 inhibition or genetic deletion reduces the expression and production of multiple inflammatory mediators measured at 24- or 48-hours following microglia activation.
1: About 20 years ago the laboratory of Lyanne Schlichter reported that K V1.3 inhibitors suppress phorbol ester stimulated respiratory burst [ 22] and NO production in cultured neonatal rat microglia, thus reducing microglia mediated neuronal killing in a transwell culture system [ 16].
2: In a more recent study from our own laboratory [ 17], which compared the effects of K V1.3 and K Ca3.1 blockers with the widely used microglia inhibitor minocycline on differentially polarized neonatal mouse microglia, we observed that Kv1.3 inhibition reduced expression and production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF- at 24 and 28 hours and prevented upregulation of the inflammation associated enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
3: The later effect was probably responsible for the reduced NO production observed in microglia treated with K V1.3 inhibitors at 24 and 48 hours after LPS stimulation.
4: Similar to the earlier work, we also observed that K V1.3 inhibitors prevent microglia mediated neuronal killing in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures 3 days after microglia were activated either through 1-hour of hypoxia/aglycemia to simulate ischemic stroke [ 5] or by treatment with oligomeric amyloid- to simulate microglia activation in AD [ 7].
5: In addition to reducing AO induced microglia activation, a phenomenon which can be clearly shown by staining microglia for CD11b or Iba-1 and evaluating fluorescence intensity, the K V1.3 inhibitor PAP-1 has also been found to prevent AO-induced, microglia-mediated impairment of long-term potentiation (LPT) in hippocampal slices and to reduce AO-induced production of IL-1, TNF- and NO in cultured mouse microglia [ 7], very similar to what had been found for K V1.3 inhibitors with LPS stimulated microglia [ 17, 18].
6: In experiments where cultured neonatal mouse microglia from wild-type and K V1.3 /- mice were stimulated with aggregate -synuclein (Syn Agg), which activates microglia through binding to the pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and CD36 [ 23], both pharmacological K V1.3 inhibition with PAP-1 and genetic deletion of the channel resulted in reduced IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF- production and prevented NLRP3 inflammasome protein upregulation at 24 hours after microglia stimulation [ 8].
7: Conversely, overexpression of K V1.3 in a microglial cell line increased Syn Agg-induced expression or secretion of IL-1, TNF-, IL-6 and IL-12 at 24 hours after stimulation [ 8]

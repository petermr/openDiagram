0: Here, we explore the lasting effects of prenatal T on adult behavioral plasticity and genome-wide patterns of gene expression and methylation in male zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata).
1: Zebra finches are a good study system because they have numerous genes that are potential targets of epigenetic regulation [ 21].
2: Zebra finch embryos also express steroid receptors during early development (prior to endogenous T production) [ 22].
3: We injected zebra finch eggs with T or a vehicle control the morning eggs were laid.
4: Embryos are in the earliest stages of development at this point [ 23,  24] and, based on work in other altricial songbirds [ 25] and more well-known mammalian models [ 26], injections should coincide with a time just prior to when de novo methylation patterns are starting to become established.
5: We measured aggression in sexually mature adult males.
6: Then, using transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-Seq), we examined patterns of gene expression and DNA methylation in steroid-sensitive brain regions containing the vertebrate social behavior network, the hypothalamus (HYPO) and nucleus taenia of the amygdala (TnA) [ 27,  28].
7: The TnA is involved in social arousal and responses to same-sex conspecifics in songbirds [ 29], while the HYPO plays a central role in neuroendocrine function, regulating many of the neurotransmitters and hormones associated with aggression [ 14,  30].
8: Overall, this study provides novel insight into whether prenatal T can generate lasting changes in behavior alongside altered gene expression and methylation.

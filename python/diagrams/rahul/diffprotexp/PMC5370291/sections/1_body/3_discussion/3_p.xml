<p>14-3-3 proteins, indicating in cell cycle process by GO analysis, modulate cellular functions via binding intracellular proteins with Ser/Thr phosphorylation-dependent domains and consequently influence subcellular localization, conformation, activity, and protein complex stability 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Seven isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins have been identified and reported to play pivotal roles in regulating cell cycle progression, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell adhesion and motility 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Among the 14-3-3 isoforms, overexpression of 14-3-3ε has been reported in breast cancer 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, lung cancer 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, and HCC 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In addition, upregulation of 14-3-3ε has been demonstrated to protect colorectal cancer cells and endothelial cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Recently, 14-3-3ε has been reported to mediate cell polarization and migration via changing Zeb-1/E-cadherin expression, which contributes to HCC tumor development, progression, and metastasis 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Our results revealed that 14-3-3ε level was increased in response to TNFα, suggesting that 14-3-3ε may play a role in the TNF-induced anti-apoptotic signals.

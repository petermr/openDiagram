<p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the electrochemical behaviors of LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C cathodes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11A</xref> shows the Nyquist plots of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C cathodes. The experimental EIS data is simulated by Zview2.1 software according to the equivalent circuit as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11B</xref>. It can be found that all the Nyquist plots present a high-frequency quasi-semicircle, which is related to the migration of the Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge transfer process. Meanwhile, a low-frequency sloping line is related to the Warburg impedance of the lithium-ion diffusion in the electrode (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>S</sub> is the internal resistance of the cell and corresponds to the electrodes, electrolyte, and the separator resistance, 
 <italic>R</italic>ct is associated with the charge-transfer resistance, 
 <italic>CPE</italic> is associated with the capacitance contributed by the surface of the active material (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The simulation results show that the 
 <italic>R</italic>ct value of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene cathode is 79 Ω, which is smaller than the 129 Ω value of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C cathode. The result shows that graphene can reduce the charge transfer resistance of Li-ion insertion and extraction between the electrode/electrolyte and increase the conductivity of the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene cathode.

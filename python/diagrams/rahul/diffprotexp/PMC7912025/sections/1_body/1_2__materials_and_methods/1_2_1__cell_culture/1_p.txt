0: Human small-airway epithelial cells (hSAECs) from a cadaveric donor were immortalized using human telomerase/CDK4, as previously described [ 20, 21].
1: These non-oncogenic, telomerase-immortalized cells maintain genomic and proteomic signatures representative of primary SAECs over many population doublings [ 21] and manifest characteristic cell-state transitions typical of primary hSAECs [ 20, 22, 23].
2: hSAECs were grown in small-airway epithelial cell growth medium (Lonza, cc-3118) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2.
3: For validation experiments, primary small-airway epithelial cells (pSAECs) were obtained from cadaveric donors (ATCC, PCS-301-010).
4: Cells were grown in airway epithelial cell basal medium (ATCC, PCS-300-030) supplemented with a bronchial epithelial cell growth kit (PCS-300-040).

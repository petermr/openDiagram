<p>A substantial compression of the information generated for quench-induced precipitation is plotted in continuous cooling precipitation (CCP) diagrams, which correspond to the well-established continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams for steels. CCP diagrams allow us to choose suitable heat treatment parameters for a certain alloy in the heat treatment shop, and thus allow for the practical application of the findings on the quench sensitivity of Al alloys. Furthermore, they are important input data for heat treatment simulations.</p>

<p id="Par61">A number of hearing-related proteins were expressed differentially, such as collagen alpha-1 (XI) chain, thiomorpholine-carboxylate dehydrogenase, Î²-tectorin, unconventional myosin-VI, Cdh1, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (Slc1a3), cochlin, and thiomorpholine-carboxylate dehydrogenase. Thiomorpholine-carboxylate dehydrogenase an oxidoreductase was expressed exclusively on P3, whereas Slc1a3 was expressed exclusively on P30. Proteins that were significantly upregulated on P14 and P30 and exclusively expressed on P30 relative to P3 are of interest, because they may be involved in more mature functions. Laminin subunit alpha-1 and bone sialoprotein 2 (Bsp2) showed the greatest increase on P14 and P30 relative to P3. Laminin, a major component of the basement membrane, is an important regulator of basement membrane assembly and is also involved in cell adhesion, migration, and growth [

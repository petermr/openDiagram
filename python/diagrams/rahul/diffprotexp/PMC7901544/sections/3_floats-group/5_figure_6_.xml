   <bold>FAV4_Del showed low replication ability in LMH cells</bold>. (a) LMH cells were infected with FAV4_Del and FAdV-4 at the same dose, the viral supernatant collected from infected LMH cells at indicated time points were then titrated with TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. (b) LMH cells infected with the FAV4_Del and FAdV-4 were analyzed by IFA using mAb 3B5 against Fiber-1. (c) LMH cells infected with FAV4_Del and FAdV-4 were harvested at different time points and lysed by lysis buffer, and then the lysates were examined with western blot by mAb 1C9 against Fiber-2. All experiments were performed for three times with comparable results

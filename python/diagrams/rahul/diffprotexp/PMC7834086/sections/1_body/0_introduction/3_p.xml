<p>Thus far, most of the AHPND associated cellular damage caused by PirB is found in the hepatopancreas, stomach and other digestive organs [

 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The effect of PirB on other shrimp tissues or organs is therefore worthy of evaluation, given that these toxins are transported to other tissues via hemolymph [

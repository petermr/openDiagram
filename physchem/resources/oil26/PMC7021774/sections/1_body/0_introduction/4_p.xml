<p id="Par5">ToxB is a small protein that causes necrosis in sensitive wheat lines. It was first identified in the culture filtrate of race 5 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> isolates, as well as in combination with other effectors in races 6, 7 and 8 (Strelkov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2002</xref>; Lamari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). The 
 <italic>ToxB</italic> gene encodes a mature protein of 64 amino acids (Martinez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>), although no functional motifs that might contribute to toxic activity have been identified to date (Ciuffetti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>). 
 <italic>ToxB</italic> copy number variation has been shown to impact on tan spot susceptibility, with isolates containing increased 
 <italic>ToxB</italic> copies linked to higher 
 <italic>ToxB</italic> gene expression and protein production and the induction of increased symptoms in the host (Strelkov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2002</xref>; Strelkov and Lamari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2003</xref>; Martinez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>). ToxB-mediated chlorosis is known to be light dependent (Strelkov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1998</xref>), and ToxB has been shown to inhibit photosynthesis and to modify the wheat leaf proteome prior to the development of chlorosis (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). The major ToxB sensitivity locus 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> has previously been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2B (Friesen and Faris 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>; Abeysekara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>), accounting for up to 69% of total phenotypic variation (Friesen and Faris 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>).

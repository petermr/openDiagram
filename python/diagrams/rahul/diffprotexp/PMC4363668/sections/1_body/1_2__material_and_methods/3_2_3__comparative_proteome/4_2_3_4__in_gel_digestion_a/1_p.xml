<p>The protein spots that were significant (|ratio| &gt; 2.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased or decreased in samples compared with control samples were chosen for further analysis. The differential protein spots were excised from the gel and washed twice with water. The gels were then destained and washed in 25 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>3</sub> and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Destaining was repeated two more times. The gel was subsequently dehydrated with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L acetonitrile and dried with a vacuum centrifuge. Digestion was done with 12.5 ng/
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sequencing grade modified trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated for 30 min at 4°C, then 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added into each tube at 37°C for 18 h. The digested peptides were concentrated by centrifugation and were moved into another tube. The digested peptides were mixed with freshly prepared matrix solution (1 mg of HCCA in 0.3 mL of 0.1% TFA and 0.7 mL acetonitrile) in a 1 : 1 (v/v) ratio and applied onto a target plate (MTP 600-384 anchor chip). All samples were analyzed using an Autoflex MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Peptide tolerance was set at 100 ppm with fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethyl, variable modification of methionine oxidated, and permitted missed cleavage of up to 1. Trypsin cleavage of the protein is at the C-terminal side of KR unless next residue is P. Protein identification was achieved by a protein blast search using the NCBI protein database (

 <italic>χ</italic>2 test with 2 degrees of freedom (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.05).

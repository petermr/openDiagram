0: A total of 50 g of each protein fraction from each biological replicate was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with CBB.
1: Each lane was processed into 5 gel slices and subject to pyridylethylation and in-gel trypsin digestion as described previously  9.
2: Peptides were extracted once in 100 L of 1% formic acid and subsequently twice in 100 L of 50% acetonitrile in 5% formic acid.
3: The volume was reduced to 50 L in a vacuum centrifuge prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.

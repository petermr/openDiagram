<p id="p0065">Protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed through STRING. A total of 9 differentially expressed proteins were imputed into STRING, and a complex network was obtained. The obtained protein–protein interactions are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. In biological process analysis, these proteins were mainly involved in platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, acute phase proteins highly expressed in response to inflammation and tissue injury, lipid homeostasis, cartilage development, iron ion transport, and select metabolic processes.

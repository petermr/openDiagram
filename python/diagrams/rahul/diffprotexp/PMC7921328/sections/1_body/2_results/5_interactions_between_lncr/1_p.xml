<p>Studies on tumor immunology have proposed various therapeutic strategies for tumor patients, among which immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy showed promising clinical benefits in multiple solid tumor types. Among significant lncRNA-immune cell interactions, memory resting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were found to interact with the most differential lncRNAs, most of which were positively correlated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). In particular, cancer samples with high expression level of MAGI2-AS3 showed significantly higher infiltrated abundance of memory resting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells than those with low expression (

 <sup>+</sup> T cell in prostate cancer (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). To further explore the associations between lncRNAs and immune checkpoints in prostate cancer, we estimated the correlations between the expression levels of lncRNAs and immune checkpoint genes. Most of PRAD differential lncRNAs were found to be significantly positively correlated with immune checkpoint gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Some lncRNAs are positively associated with most immune checkpoint genes, such as LINC00861 and CTD-2521M24.9, while some are negative correlated with most of these genes, such as RP3-325F22.5, BMPR1B-AS1, LINC00665, and RP11-44B19.1. Specifically, LINC00861 was the most positively related to PD1 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2E-16, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), CTLA4 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2E-16, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) and TIGIT, and CTD-2521M24.9 was the most positively related to PD-L1; in contrast, LINC00665, RP3325F22.5, BMPR1B-AS1, and RP11-44B19.1 were the most negatively correlated to PD1, PD-L1, CTLA4, and TIGIT. Moreover, a Sankey diagram was employed to describe the connections between lncRNAs, immune cells and actionable immune checkpoints, with a subset of lncRNAs was closely related to the immune cells and actionable immune checkpoints (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). These observations implied that LINC00861 might regulate the expression of PD-1 and CTLA4, actionable targets of ICB therapy or be efficient biomarker for their abundance in prostate cancer. Collectively, these results suggested that lncRNAs might be utilized to modulate activity of immune cells or levels of immune checkpoints to promote immunotherapy for patients with prostate cancer.

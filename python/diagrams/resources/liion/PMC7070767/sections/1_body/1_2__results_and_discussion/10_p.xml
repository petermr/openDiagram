<p>According to Ikonen et al., porous silicon was prepared by electrochemical etching of silicon wafers and ball milling. The average pore size of pSi was 5–16 nm and the obtained electrode shows a capacity of 1200 mAh/g [

According to Gauthier et al., an Si-based anode with improved performance was achieved using high-energy ball milling as a cheap and easy process to produce Si powder. Milled powders were nanostructured with micrometric agglomerates (approximately 10 µm in size), made of submicrometric particles with crystallite size of 10 nm. They showed that, compared to non-milled 1–5 µm powders, the improved performance is linked to a strong lowering of particle disconnection at each charge, while the irreversibility due to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation remains unchanged. Electrode achieves 600 cycles at more than 1170 mAh/g with coulombic efficiency above 99% [

In the study by Zhang et al., one-dimensional porous silicon nanowires were prepared through the MACE process by using metallurgical silicon as raw material. Nanowires were coated with crossed carbon skeleton via in situ polymerization and carbonization process. The resultant composite delivered a high capacity of 1253 mAh/g with good cycling stability [

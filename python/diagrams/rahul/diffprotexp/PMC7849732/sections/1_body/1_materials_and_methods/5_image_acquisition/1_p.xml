<p>All immunohistochemistry sections were imaged on a confocal Zeiss LSM 800 Airyscan microscope at 20x objective magnification with Zeiss ZEN 3.1 imaging software. Stacks of horizontal plane images and orthogonal projections of the entire dorsal horn were acquired for each L4/L5 lumbar section in triplicate or quadruplicate. The regions corresponding to the SDH and DDH laminae were tiled. All the settings (laser power and gain) were maintained the same for each experiment.</p>

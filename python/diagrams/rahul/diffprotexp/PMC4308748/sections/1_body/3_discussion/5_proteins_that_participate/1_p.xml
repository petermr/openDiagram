<p>Calpain is a calcium-dependent, highly conserved protease. Recent studies demonstrated that calpain participates in cytoskeletal protein reforming, cell transformation and migration, and accelerates cell circulation. Calcium overloading and calmodulin complex formation in nerve cells is a pathological mechanism underlying secondary central nerve injury[

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Results from this study demonstrated that after ischemia/reperfusion, up regulated calpain expression causes the opening of calcium channels in nerve cells resulting in an abnormal increase in intracytoplasmic free calcium. This severe Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> overloading can directly influence the activity of many intracellular metabolic enzymes, causing abnormal cellular metabolism and injury to cell structures and functions. Under physiological conditions, calpain binds to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> to form a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> CaM complex. Following spinal cord injury, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and calpain increase simultaneously resulting in high levels of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> CaM complex. However, in the sham-surgery group, calpastatin expression was significantly down regulated, and this loss of calpain control may be an important pathological factor causing delayed neurological impairment following ischemia/reperfusion.

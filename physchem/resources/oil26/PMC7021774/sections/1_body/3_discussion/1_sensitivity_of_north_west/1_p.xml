<p id="Par24">Despite the cloning of 
 <italic>ToxB</italic> over 17 years ago (Martinez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>), relatively few screens for ToxB sensitivity in wheat have been published. Surveys of Canadian wheat varieties found sensitivity to be present in around 30% of wheat varieties (Tran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>: 24 of 100 cultivars. Lamari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005a</xref>: 30 of 86 cultivars), while in a recent screen of 122 Australian varieties just 4% were ToxB sensitive (See et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). Here, screening an AM panel of 480 varieties found ToxB sensitivity to be uncommon in the European germplasm screened, with just 7% possessing a sensitivity score ≥ 1. It appears that ToxB sensitivity was introduced via the variety ‘Thatcher’, released in the USA in 1931. ‘Thatcher’ was used 41 times as a parent in the pedigree, and was a parent of the second oldest sensitive variety in the AM panel, ‘Aronde’ (France, 1962). ‘Thatcher’ has been previously identified as the possible source of ToxB sensitivity in Canadian wheat (Lamari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005a</xref>; Tran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>), highlighting its prominent role in wheat pedigrees across the world.

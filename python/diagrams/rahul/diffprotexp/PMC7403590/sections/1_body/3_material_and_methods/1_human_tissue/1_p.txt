0: Human brain tissue was obtained from the Neurological Tissue Bank, Biobanc-HospitalClinic-IDIBAPS and as generous gift from Professor I Ferrer Abizanda, Bellvitge Hospital Universitari, Institut Catala de la Salut, Barcelona, Spain and used under local regional ethical approval (Law 14/2007 on Biomedical Research).
1: Frozen samples of SNpc, Hippocampus and Temporal Cortex from idiopathic PD patients (n = 5), idiopathic AD patients (n = 5), VD patients (n = 5) and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 6) were used.
2: All patients had been diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the Neurological Tissue Bank.
3: The neuropathological assessments of disease cases were performed and Braak neuropathological staging found AD patients to be at Braak stages 34 and PD patients to be at Braak stages 456.
4: None of the patients were believed to have alternative diagnoses, degeneration of related systems, drug induced Parkinsonism, or any other serious medical illness.
5: Enrolment was also contingent on the absence of a diagnosis for another neurodegenerative disease.
6: The control subjects have not been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative or pre-neurodegenerative disease condition.
7: The gender, age at death, and clinical diagnosis of the study cohort are summarized in Table  1.

<p>A variety of mycoplasmas possess a layer of sticky capsule-like substance outside the cell membrane; chemical analysis indicates that its primary component is polysaccharide [
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The formation of mycoplasma capsule is similar to that of the bacterial capsule. Generally, capsules are easily formed in the body but disappear 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>; they are encoded by multiple genes [
 <xref rid="cit0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], but there are exceptions. For example, only one capsule synthesis-related gene is annotated in the 
 <italic>M. bovirhinis</italic> genome [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The formation of the capsule is attributed to glycosyltransferase, which is present in various mycoplasmas [
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Mycoplasma capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is considered as an important virulence factor for pathogenic mycoplasmas as it is essential for adhesion, cell invasion, phase variation, and defense against immune systems such as anti-phagocytosis and anti-bacteriolytic activity [

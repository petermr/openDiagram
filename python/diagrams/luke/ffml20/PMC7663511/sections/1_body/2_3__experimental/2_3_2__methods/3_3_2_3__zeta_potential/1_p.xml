<p>Electrokinetic potential values of MWCNTs and the modified MWCNTs were measured in deionized water in the 3–10 pH range by means of Litesizer™ 500 Anton Paarat at room temperature. Suspensions were prepared to get the particle concentration of 1 mg/mL. The pH value of the investigated systems was adjusted with HCl and NaOH. Before measurement, 30 min ultrasonic bath treatment (at 44 MHz) was applied. The values of zeta potential presented in this paper represent the mean average of triplicate measurements.</p>

<p>We also examined the expression yield in two different membrane fractions obtained from differential centrifugation of BAD-PcATP2 co-expressed with either PcCdc50A-His or PcCdc50B-His. We detected the presence of PcATP2 and the two PcCdc50 subunits in both, the P2 and in the P3 membrane fraction (

 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A and B). That is, while the relative amount of PcATP2 in P2 or P3 was similar when co-expressed with PcCdc50B (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), PcATP2 seems to be mostly accumulated in P2 when co-expressed with PcCdc50A (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). In addition, the relative distribution of PcATP2 between P2 and P3 followed the same relative distribution as its co-expressed PcCdc50 protein (

<p>Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed with a TA thermal analyzer (TGA55, TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) under N
 <sub>2</sub> with a heating rate of 20 °C/min from 50 to 800 °C, and heated under flowing nitrogen (40 mL/min). The dynamic mechanical (DMA) spectra of the samples were obtained by using TA thermal analyzer (DMA Q850, TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The specimens were analyzed in tensile mode at a constant frequency of 1 Hz, amplitude of 20 μm, and a temperature range from 25 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) was used to study the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the film with a heating rate of 5 °C/min from 25 °C to 350 °C by TMA Q400 instrument (TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) under nitrogen.

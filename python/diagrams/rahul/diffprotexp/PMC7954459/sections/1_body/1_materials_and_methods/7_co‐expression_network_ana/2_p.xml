<p>Co‐expression network analysis was performed using WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co‐expression Network Analysis) package in R (Langfelder &amp; Horvath, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The normalized expression values of miRNAs obtained from DESeq2 were used as input for co‐expression analysis. To identify modules, Pearson's correlation coefficient for all miRNAs in all the samples was calculated and an adjacency matrix was generated by raising correlation to a power β. The β value of 16 was selected based on the scale‐free topology criterion as described (Langfelder &amp; Horvath, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The miRNAs were clustered using the degree of overlap with shared neighbors between them. A clustering tree (dendrogram) was created based on average linkage hierarchical clustering using the dynamic tree‐cutting algorithm. Each branch of the tree represented a module and modules with at least five miRNAs were considered and assigned a color code. The miRNAs included in each module and their target mRNAs were subjected to further analysis.

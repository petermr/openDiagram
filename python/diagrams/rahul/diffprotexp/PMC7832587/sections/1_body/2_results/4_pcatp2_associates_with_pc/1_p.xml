<p>To assess the association of PcATP2 with PcCdc50B or PcCdc50A even after DDM/CHS solubilization, we performed immunoprecipitation studies. We fused the superfolder green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the C-terminal end of PcATP2 followed by the BAD (PcATP2-GFP-BAD). We chose to tag PcATP2 at the C-terminal end rather than the N-terminal like the previous experiments because the GFP is a more sensitive folding reporter when fused at the C-terminal end of the target protein [

In addition, the relative distribution of C-terminally tagged PcATP2 between P2 and P3 membranes, and the solubilization efficiency of DDM/CHS of PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50B-His or PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50A-His from P3 membranes were very similar to the N-terminally tagged version of PcATP2 (not shown). Therefore, DDM/CHS-solubilized PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50B-His or PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50A-His were trapped in agarose beads coupled to an anti-GFP nanobody (GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup>), and bound proteins were eluted with a low-pH buffer and analyzed by western blot. As expected, PcATP2-GFP-BAD was detected in both elution fractions (

 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A and B, lanes 4 in bottom panels), demonstrating that PcATP2 interacts with either PcCdc50B or PcCdc50A in the membrane and after detergent solubilization. The western blot signals of eluted PcATP2-GFP and PcCdc50A-His were much weaker than the ones of the PcATP2-GFP/PcCdc50B-His experiment, in concordance with their relative amounts in the P3 membrane fraction (Figure 2 and Figure supplement 5). As control, we performed the same experiment using P3 membranes co-expressing a non GFP-tagged PcATP2 with either PcCdc50B (PcATP2-BAD/PcCdc50B-His) or PcCdc50A (PcATP2-BAD/PcCdc50A-His). In this case, none of the PcCdc50 proteins were detected in the elution fraction (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, lane 8 bottom panels), thus excluding a false positive result due to a non-specific binding of PcCdc50B-His or PcCdc50A-His to the GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads.

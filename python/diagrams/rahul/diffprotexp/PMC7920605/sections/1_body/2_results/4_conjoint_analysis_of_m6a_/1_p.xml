<p>A conjoint analysis was conducted for m6A-seq and RNA-seq data. We found 88 genes that commonly had differential m6A methylation levels and differentially expressed mRNA levels. Among them, there were 57 genes with m6A hypomethylation and downregulated mRNA expression, 30 genes with m6A hypermethylation and downregulated mRNA expression and 1 gene with m6A hypermethylation and upregulated mRNA expression (

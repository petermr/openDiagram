0: The effect of microstructure on the impact toughness and the temper embrittlement of a SA508Gr.4N steel was investigated.
1: Martensitic and bainitic structures formed in this material were examined via scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) analysis.
2: The martensitic structure had a positive effect on both the strength and toughness.
3: Compared with the bainitic structure, this structure consisted of smaller blocks and more high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs).
4: Changes in the ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the martensitic structure were attributed to an increase in the crack propagation path.
5: This increase resulted from an increased number of HAGBs and refinement of the sub-structure (block).
6: The AES results revealed that sulfur segregation is higher in the martensitic structure than in the bainitic structure.
7: Therefore, the martensitic structure is more susceptible to temper embrittlement than the bainitic structure.

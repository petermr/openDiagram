<p>Stathmin-1 was observed to be upregulated at 1 hpi and 16 hpi, but downregulated at 24 hpi in the host cells infected with EV71, Stathmin-1 is involved in the regulation of the microtubule filament system by destabilizing and preventing assembly of microtubules, Thus, its increased expression may be associated with destroying the cell in the early stage of EV71 infection. But the downregulation of Stathmin-1 at 24 hpi supported the previous findings by Leong and Chow when RD cells were infected with EV71 MS/7423/87 strain, which is expected to induce growth arrest in EV71-infected cells [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, dUTPase only appeared at 1 hpi but was not detected at 0 h, 16 hpi, and 24 hpi. This showed that dUTPase might be related to the process of EV71 attaching and penetrating into HBMEC. But, its mechanism remains to be further studied. Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), a low molecular mass (m) (~10 kDa) soluble protein ubiquitous in eukaryotes, plays an important housekeeping role in lipid metabolism by maintaining the intracellular acyl-CoA pool. ACBP is involved in lipid biosynthesis and transport, gene expression, and membrane biogenesis [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, ACBP was upregulated at 1 hpi and downregulated at 16 hpi and 24 hpi. Maybe the ACBP interact with EV71 and thus may facilitate EV71 entry.

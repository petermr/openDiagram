<p>To test if the addition of purified specific AAF antibodies to the bacterial suspension disturbs AAF interaction and thus bacterial autoaggregation, we prepared the autoaggregation assays with EAEC strain 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <sup>−</sup> expressing the different AAF subtypes as described above. We then added 25 µl of purified antibodies raised against the individual AAF subtype per ml of bacterial suspension and measured the optical density of the bacterial suspension in the absence and presence of the antibodies at time point 0 min and 60 min, respectively.

<p>All these discrete pieces of evidences from our experimental results designate the significance of the COL11A1 gene along with its highly correlated genes (THBS2, COL10A1, COL5A2, and COL1A2) in the progression of colorectal cancer across the various parameters using a wide range of data available in the cancer databases globally. Taken together, this study comprehensively enlightens the validation of the COL11A1 gene in the initiation, progression, and development of colorectal cancer using the bioinformatic approach, and the overall mechanism is schematized in

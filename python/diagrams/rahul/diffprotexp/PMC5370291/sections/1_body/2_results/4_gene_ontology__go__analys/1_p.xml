<p>After identifying and quantitating the extracted proteins, we next investigated the biological process and molecular function linking to the proteins with significant change [log
 <sub>2</sub>(level in TNFα treatment/level in control)&gt;1.0 or &lt;-1.0] in response to TNFα treatment by using DAVID online annotation and gene ontology (GO) annotation analysis. A complete list of GO annotations for all the proteins significantly altered with the associated 
 <italic>P</italic> values for functional enrichment is provided in Supplemental Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>. The biological processes associating with significantly altered proteins featured by GO annotations were shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A. We observed that the proteins associating with the cellular process, cellular component organization, catabolic process, DNA repair and cell cycle process were up-regulated in response to TNFα treatment. Conversely, we found that the proteins associating with translation elongation, RNA processing, and metabolic process were down-regulated in response to TNFα treatment. Similarly, we performed the molecular function analysis for the protein with significant changes (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B) and observed that the proteins exhibiting ATP binding, ATPase activity, and hydrolase activity were up-regulated in response to TNFα treatment. On the contrary, proteins exhibiting RNA binding, nucleic acid binding, binding and translation factor activity were down-regulated in response to TNFα treatment. Taken together, we suggested that TNFα treatment suppressed specific gene transcription and the subsequent translation that promoted energy metabolism.

<p>The CNTs, at concentrations of 10 μg/mL and 100 ng/mL, were added to the apical media and cells were exposed for 24 h. Only 200 µL of CNT containing media were added to the apical side (5 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) to maintain the AIC for the cells. However, all volumes were maintained in constant proportions so that the surface exposure could be converted to concentration per unit volume of media using the following formula: N g/cm
 <sup>2</sup> = 25N g/mL. Therefore, the concentrations used in the experiments could also be expressed as 0.4μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and 4 ng/cm
 <sup>2</sup> respectively.

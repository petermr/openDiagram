0: Raw reads were uploaded to the High-Performance Computing Facility of the University of Puerto Rico.
1: Samples for the assembly comprised 3 from normal mesentery, 3 from day 1 regenerating intestine, 5 from day 3 regenerating intestine, and 6 samples from the radial organ complex from a previous study by Mashanov et al.
2: 25.
3: Preprocessing steps of quality, trimming and filtering were done using FastQCv0.11.5 74 and Trimmomaticv0.36 75 applying the following parameters ILLUMINACLIP:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDING-WINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36.

<p id="Par27">Total unique reads were in the length of 16–40 bp after adaptor trimming, where the percentage of reads aligned to reference genome using Bowtie-1.1.1 exceeded 80 on most of the sampling occasions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Analyses of clustering reads obtained through homology search done against mature miRNA sequences retrieved from miRbase data base using NCBI-Blast identified 198 known unique miRNA on average belonging to 66 families in the apical and basal spikelets of SR-159 and SR-157 on each sampling occasion in the first 10 days after anthesis (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Between the apical and basal spikelets, the miRNA number was almost similar on days 0 and 10 post anthesis for SR-157, but it differed on day 5, where the number was higher in basal compared to apical spikelet. In SR-159, the number was similar on day 0 post-anthesis between apical and basal spikelets, but it differed on days 5 and 10 post-anthesis. On day 5, miRNA number was higher in apical, and it reversed on day 10. The miRNA family analyses further revealed high abundance of MIR 166 and MIR812 families. It was followed by MIR444 and MIR1846 in a sequence (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The number of known miRNAs common to apical and basal spikelets on 0, 5 and 10 days after anthesis were 86 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and 94 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) in SR-159 and SR-157 cultivars, respectively.

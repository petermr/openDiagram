0: Rehydration solution (8 M urea; 2 M thiourea; 4.0% [w/v] CHAPS; 20 mM Tris base; 20 mM DL-dithiothreitol; 0.5% [v/v] pH 310 amidine, and 10% [v/v] bromophenol blue) was added to the protein sample.
1: For isolation of proteins by isoelectric focusing (IEF), a salt bridge was formed at the two poles of the electrophoresis tank, the supernatant of the centrifuged protein sample was added uniformly to the electrophoresis tank, and the isoelectric focusing strip (17 cm, pH 310) was removed from the  20 C freezer and equilibrated to room temperature.
2: The sample was added to the electrophoresis channel, and the appropriate amount of mineral oil was added to cover the strip.
3: The program was set as follows: 50 V for 14 h, passive rehydration; 500 V for 1 h, linear; 1000 V for 1 h, rapid; 5000 V for 1 h, rapid; 8000 V for 1 h, linear; and rapid ramping to 8000 V for 60,000 Vh [ 17].
4: After isoelectric focusing, strips were equilibrated in equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 25 mM TrisHCl [pH 8.8]) containing 0.2% (w/v) dithiothreitol for 15 min and then in the same buffer containing 3.0% (w/v) iodoacetamide and 0.175% (v/v) bromophenol blue for 15 min.
5: Separation in the second direction was performed via 12.5% SDS-PAGE under a constant current of 25 mA, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.
6: After decolorization, analysis was performed using ImageMaster software to match gel spots, and gray values that were significantly different (gray value  2.0-fold) between the H9N2-infected and H5N1-infected groups were selected for MS analysis.

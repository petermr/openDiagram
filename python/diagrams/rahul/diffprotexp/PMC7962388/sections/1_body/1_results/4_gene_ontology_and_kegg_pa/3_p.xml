<p id="Par60">Then, Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment analyses were performed on a subset of 5268 DETs which were common to the four developmental stages analyzed (i.e., transcripts that were found differentially expressed at all stages of sexual and apomictic developments) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>). The most represented GO terms regarding Cellular Component (CC) were ribonucleoprotein complex, nuclear lumen, vacuolar membrane, vacuolar part and chloroplast thylakoid. The most represented Biological Process (BP) terms were protein localization to organelle, the establishment of protein localization to organelle, nucleotide biosynthetic process, nucleoside phosphate biosynthetic process and pyruvate metabolic processes. The Molecular Function (MF) main classes were structural molecule activity, structural constituent of ribosome, adenyl nucleotide binding, adenyl ribonucleotide binding and ATPase activity. Moreover, the main KEGG-predicted pathways were ribosome, carbon metabolism and spliceosome (Additional file

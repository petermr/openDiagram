 <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites were propagated in female 6- to 8-week-old Theiler’s Original outbred mice supplied by Envigo UK. The clonal 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> RMgm-928 strain (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Burda et al., 2015</xref>), which expresses mCherry under the control of the hsp70 promoter throughout the life cycle, was used for all 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> transcriptomic data. A Hap2 knock-out 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> strain in the RMgm-928::mCherry background, which does not produce male gametocytes, was used as a control for FACS gating (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Howick et al., 2019</xref>). Mosquito infections were performed in two- to five-day-old 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> or 
 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> through direct feed on mice.

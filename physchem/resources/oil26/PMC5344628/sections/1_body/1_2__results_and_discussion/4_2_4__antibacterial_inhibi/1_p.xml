<p>The antibacterial effect of EOs against the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was established by the agar disc diffusion method, and the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f008">Figure 8</xref>. On Mueller–Hinten (MH) agar plates, the inhibition zones of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> are 64.7 ± 1.2 mm for thyme oil, 27.8 ± 3.4 mm for tea tree oil, 27.8 ± 4.0 mm for clove oil, and 12.8 ± 4.3 mm for rosemary oil. For 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> the inhibition zones are 35.5 ± 4.6 mm for thyme oil, 27.0 ± 3.4 mm for tea tree oil, 19.5 ± 0.5 mm for clove oil, and 15.1 ± 0.5 mm for rosemary oil. The diameters of the inhibition zones in the case of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth are of 69.5 ± 6.4 mm for thyme oil, 22.0 ± 2.8 mm for tea tree oil, and 28.5 ± 2.1 mm for clove oil. There is no inhibition zone for rosemary.

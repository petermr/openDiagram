<p>This work is focused on the cooling step of the age hardening procedure by developing a new measurement technique that enables the measurement of isothermal TTP diagrams by 
 <italic>in situ</italic> DSC, rather than by extensive 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> analysis. This may eventually lead to an optimization of the simulation of cooling during heat treatment simulations in the future.

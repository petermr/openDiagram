<p>Tetracycline hydrochloride, through its conjugated trione moiety (δ+), can interact with the sulfate groups of ι-carrageenan (δ−), practically leading to the highest crosslinking density among the drug-loaded hydrogels, but slightly higher than PC12. The molecular simulation snapshot from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-01544-f010">Figure 10</xref>b seems to confirm this statement, as this molecule has the highest intertwining with the polymer phase. For this hydrogel, the lowest equilibrium swelling values were registered.

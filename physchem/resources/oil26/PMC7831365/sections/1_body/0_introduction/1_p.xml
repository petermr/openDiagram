However, in spite of their importance for animal survival, teeth have been lost independently in multiple mammalian lineages, such as baleen whales and pangolins. In addition, some lineages have lost their outer enamel of teeth, such as pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale, aardvarks and species from Xenarthra (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Davit-B&#233;al, Tucker &amp; Sire, 2009</xref>). Tooth loss and/or enamel loss is one of the most important field for mammalian tooth evolution.</p>

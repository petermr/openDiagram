<p>E-selectin serves as an important link between endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. Elevated cellular E-selectin can be seen in some chronic inflammatory diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and obesity (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A previous study reported that the concentration of sE-selectin is directly correlated with cell surface expression (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Due to the elevated expression of sE-selectin in KD patients (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), we hypothesized that E-selectin may be involved in the KD CAL process. In the present study, we found that KD-CAL+ sera-treated HCAECs exhibited a higher mRNA level and protein level of E-selectin when compared with KD-CAL– group and HC control. The levels of E-selectin were increased in RNA level in this study, and the increase in protein levels were consistent with the change in RNA level, basically excluding the possible false positive caused by sE-selectin in sera. E-selectin is mainly involved in the adhesion process of inflammatory cells; we found that the adherent THP-1 cells of the KD-CAL+ sera-treated HCAECs were significantly increased, which may lead to more severe inflammatory cell infiltration compared to that in the KD-CAL– group. The results indicated that a higher concentration of E-selectin may lead to more serious endothelia–monocyte interaction, which may be related to CAL formation, while ICAM and other molecules might be involved as well. To confirm the role of E-selectin in the adhesion process, we used specific E-selectin siRNA to silence the expression of E-selectin. As a result, the adhesion number of THP-1 cells was significantly decreased compared with negative control siRNA, indicating that the lack of the E-selectin may reduce the endothelia–monocyte interaction, which may be involved in the formation of CAL.

<p id="Par60">It was worth noting that while a lot of assembled transcripts have extended 3′/5′ ends and retained introns, very few peptides are mapped to these untranslated regions. Nevertheless, these UTRs tend to be regulatory elements that function at mRNA level and very little is known about their roles in transcriptional and translational regulation in the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], the results of this work could provide a starting point for further investigation. Furthermore, one high quality novel ORF from the 3′ UTR category was identified, which was differentially expressed between the two stages studied, and the peptide that maps to 3′ end was only observed in oocyst sporozoite despite low protein expression. The extra sequences provided by the 3′ extension are predicted to form a transmembrane helix and could affect the protein structure significantly, which may allow the protein to attach to the membrane and bind to different substrates. One possible explanation is that the parasite may choose to use different protein isoforms depending on the life cycle stage by skipping a stop codon and express the 3′ end, which could be an efficient mechanism to change infectivity for different hosts.

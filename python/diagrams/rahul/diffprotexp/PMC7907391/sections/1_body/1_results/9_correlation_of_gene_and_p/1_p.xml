<p id="Par19">Next, we compared the similarity of gene and protein expressions of the viral entry factors. Unfortunately, expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL were not present in the reverse-phase protein arrays on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. However, immunohistochemistry-based malignant expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL was present in the Human Protein Atlas (

Top expressing tissues were similar on gene and protein levels for ACE2 (colorectal, kidney, pancreas, and stomach), TMPRSS2 (prostate and pancreatic cancers), and CTSL (renal and skin cancers) (Fig.Â

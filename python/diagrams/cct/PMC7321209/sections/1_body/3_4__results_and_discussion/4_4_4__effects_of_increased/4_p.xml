<p>The measured t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times in the 1st weld bead of approximately 2 s show small deviations between the experimental trials with adjusted CTWD. According to the CCT-diagram, the formation of a martensitic-bainitic microstructure with high hardness values &gt; 257 HV appeared for t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times up to 4 s. These cooling conditions were measured from the first to the third layer (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f012">Figure 12</xref>). With increasing structure height and thus longer t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-times, the microstructure consisted of varying proportions of bainite and ferrite (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f013">Figure 13</xref>). The expectable hardness decreased.

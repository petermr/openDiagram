<p>The honeybee genome has been sequenced and RNA interference has already proven to be a successful tool for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of gene function and phenotypes 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Beye1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Amdam2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Based on the good validation of the results between proteins and genes in the network, we also see interesting potential in reverse genetics that indicate the manipulation of genes could determine the fate of the developing larvae.

<p id="p0065">We compared gene signatures generated from cell lines that have been treated with fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, and dexamethasone to matched cell lines in which 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> was genetically knocked down with siRNA ( 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). In this way, the differential gene expression signatures for drug-treated A375 or HEPG2 cell lines were compared to 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown A375 or HEPG2 cell lines, respectively. This allowed us to quantify the degree of similarity between pharmacologically initiated mRNA changes and those resulting from targeted knockdown of a specific gene. In A375 cells, concordance scores quantifying the similarity between drug treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells are as follows: 0.7982 for fluoxetine treated cells, 0.6132 for dexamethasone treated cells, 0.3677 for bupropion treated cells, and 0.4426 for paroxetine treated cells. In HEPG2 cells, concordance scores for the same comparisons are as follows: 0.6139 for fluoxetine treated cells, 0.4554 for dexamethasone treated cells, 0.5435 for bupropion treated cells, and 0.5148 for paroxetine treated cells. Mean concordance scores for these comparisons are as follows: 0.7061 (SD: 0.1303; N: 2) for comparisons of fluoxetine treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells; 0.5343 (SD: 0.1116; N: 2) for comparisons of dexamethasone treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells; 0.4556 (SD: 0.1243; N: 2) for comparisons of bupropion treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells; and 0.4787 (SD: 0.0511; N: 2) for comparisons of paroxetine treated cells and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells.

0: A pseudotype HIV-1-derived lentiviral particles bearing SARS-CoV-2 Spike and a lentiviral backbone plasmid encoding luciferase as reporter was produced in HEK293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2 (ACE2/293T cells), as previously described [ 27].
1: The pseudovirus was then used to infect Vero E6 cells or Calu-3 cells or ACE2/293T cells in 96-well plates in the presence of H 2O or serial concentrations of E-64d, Camostat Mesylate or BLF or HLF.
2: 48 hpi, cells from each well were lysed using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Cat#: E2610, Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and the cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom luminometer plates.
3: The relative luciferase units (RLUs) in each well were detected using Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

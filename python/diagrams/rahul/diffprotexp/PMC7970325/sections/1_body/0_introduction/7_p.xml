<p id="p0035">Here we present the subtype-specific characteristic of DNA repair pathway activation in human thyroid tumors. We performed RNA sequencing on 95 human pathological thyroid biosamples including 17 follicular adenomas, 23 follicular cancers, 3 medullar cancers, 51 papillary cancers and 1 poorly differentiated cancer. The gene expression profiles were annotated with the clinical and histological diagnoses and, for papillary cancers, with 
 <italic>BRAF</italic> gene V600E mutation status. Gene expression data were obtained using the same equipment, reagents, and protocols as for the previously published ANTE database, including six profiles for healthy thyroid tissues [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. DNA repair molecular pathway analysis showed strongly upregulated pathway activation levels for most of the differential pathways in the papillary cancer and moderately upregulated pattern in the follicular cancer, when compared to the follicular adenomas. This was observed in the BRCA1, ATM, p53, excision repair, and mismatch repair pathways. However, the G2/M checkpoint pathway followed the opposite trend. We also analyzed gene expression patterns linked with the radioiodine resistant thyroid tumors (n = 13) and identified 871 differential genes that according to Gene Ontology analysis formed two functional groups: (i) response to topologically incorrect protein and (ii) aldo-keto reductase (NADP) activity. We also found RNA sequencing reads for two hybrid transcripts: one in-frame fusion for well-known 
 <italic>NCOA4-RET</italic> translocation, and another frameshift fusion of 
 <italic>ALK</italic> oncogene with a new partner 
 <italic>ARHGAP12</italic>. The latter could probably support increased expression of truncated 
 <italic>ALK</italic> downstream from 4
 <sup>th</sup> exon out of 28. The differences in DNA repair activation patterns may help to improve therapy of different thyroid cancer types under investigation and the data communicated may serve for finding additional markers of radioiodine resistance.

<p id="Par33">All categories of nORFs analysed in this work except for intergenic ORFs have overlaps with a known gene. The sets of reference genes that overlapped with novel ORFs identified in the oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites, respectively, were extracted and GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these genes using the Analyze tools on PlasmoDB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. InterProScan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] was used instead to predict GO terms in novel ORFs.

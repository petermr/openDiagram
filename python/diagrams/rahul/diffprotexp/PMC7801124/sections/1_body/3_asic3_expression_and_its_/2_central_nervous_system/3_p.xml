<p>Whereas the role of ASIC3 in epilepsy is likely linked to modulation of interneuron excitability and general CNS activity, studies in migraine models have proposed a role for ASIC3 in mediating pain, where cortical spreading depression is thought to generate ischemia and a concomitant drop in extracellular pH. Indeed, application of acid to the dura in rats produces hypersensitivity to facial stimulation, which is ameliorated by blocking ASIC3, moreover, dura-innervating sensory neurones express ASIC3 [

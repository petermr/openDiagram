0: In-solution tryptic-digestion was performed as described previously with certain modifications ( 23).
1: Briefly, 10 g protein from fibroblast lysates (pooled healthy controls and individual patient samples) was reduced in 10 mM DTT for 5 min at 95 C and alkylated with 1/10 volume of 20 mM iodoacetamide, prior to incubation for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.
2: The alkylated proteins were in-solution digested overnight at 37 C by adding 1:50 (trypsin: protein, w/w) of sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega Corporation).
3: The digestion reaction was stopped by adding 1% formic acid.
4: The tryptic-digested peptides were cleaned with HiPPRTM Detergent Removal Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) to remove the residual reagents, and then purified using a Ziptip C 18 micropipette tip (EMD Millipore).
5: Finally, the peptides were dried completely using a speed vacuum (Labconco) and stored at -80 C for further analysis.

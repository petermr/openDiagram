<p id="Par13">In order to validate the differential expression results obtained by RNA-seq, we performed a RT-qPCR analysis of 
 <italic>DcMYB6</italic> and 
 <italic>DcMYB7</italic> and their corresponding lncNATs (
 <italic>asDcMYB6</italic>and 
 <italic>asDcMYB7</italic>). As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the expression of the four genes was detected by RNA-seq and RT-qPCR in all purple samples, being mostly undetected in orange tissues. Moreover, both techniques allowed the detection of gene expression in orange tissues only for 
 <italic>DcMYB6</italic>, displaying significantly lower values than in purple tissues. The comparative RT-qPCR expression of the four genes in purple phloem and xylem tissues is presented in Supplementary Figure

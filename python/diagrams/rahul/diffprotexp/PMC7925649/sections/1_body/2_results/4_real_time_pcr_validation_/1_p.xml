<p id="Par27">We selected 20 genes for qPCR validation of the GSEA analysis (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>). These genes were determined to be statistically significant in our differential gene analysis and they are members of the enriched inflammation and metabolic pathways as reported above. A detailed link between validation genes and differentially enriched pathways is indicated via a circos plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. We emphasized two gene groups based on their corresponding pathways: inflammatory genes and metabolic genes. When comparing the pre-operative samples between the LCOS and No-LCOS groups, there was an up-regulation of 
 <italic>GYPA</italic> (1.76 fold), 
 <italic>CYC1</italic> (1.52 fold), 
 <italic>ALAS2</italic> (1.8 fold
 <italic>)</italic> genes representing the metabolic pathway in patients with LCOS
 <italic>.</italic> On analysis of the post-operative samples between the LCOS and No-LCOS groups, this relationship was reversed with downregulation of metabolic genes such as 
 <italic>CYC1</italic> (0.76 fold) and up-regulation of inflammatory pathway associated genes like 
 <italic>PIK3CB</italic> (1.3 fold). (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

0: For the luciferase assays, the wild-type and mutant PRKAA2 3UTR and the miR-124-3p were amplified by PCR.
1: Luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3-PRKAA2-3UTR-WT, pGL3-PRKAA2-3UTR-MUT, and pcDNA3.1(-)-miR124-3p were prepared.
2: The primer sequences for the amplification of PRKAA2 3UTR were as follows: PRKAA2 3UTR forward: GATCGCCGTGTAATTCTAGAGTGTTGTAAACTC TGAATGTG, PRKAA2 3UTR reverse: CCGGCCGC CCCGACTCTAGATTAGAGTTCACAGTTCTACAACAAC; The 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 10 5 cells/well.
3: After 24 h culture, the plasmids were transfected into 293T cells with the indicated pGL3 firefly luciferase vector and pGL3 Renilla luciferase vector.
4: After 48 h, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, United States) according to the manufacturers protocol.
5: Data were normalized to the Renilla luminescence and presented relative to miRNA-124-3p-NC transfected group.

<p>Although TRAP-based translational profiling and other single-cell- or single-nuclei-RNA sequencing methods provide a massively parallel approach to mRNA expression analyses of individual types of neural cells, these approaches do not account for differential control of protein synthesis, degradation, and post-translational modification. As a result, there often is relatively poor correspondence between transcriptomic and proteomic expression [
 <xref rid="B23-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The poor correspondence between mRNA and protein expression in neural tissues was reinforced by an in-depth proteomic survey of the human brain that compared fold-changes in protein and mRNA levels across brain regions [
 <xref rid="B24-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In general, this study found more pronounced inter-regional differential expression at the protein level which highlights the critical importance of MS/proteomics analyses. Surprisingly, and as noted previously [
 <xref rid="B10-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the proteomes of the two major types of striatal MSNs have yet to be effectively compared. To address this challenge, we have begun to compare the proteomes of D1R versus D2R-containing MSNs from mouse.

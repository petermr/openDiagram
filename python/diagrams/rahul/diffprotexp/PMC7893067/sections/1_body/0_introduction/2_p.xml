 </sup>. The general aim of these studies was to characterize the contribution of each of the nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptomes to the global gene expression profiles. Several studies have demonstrated that although the nucleus and cytoplasm contain overlapping populations of RNA transcripts, there are significant differences between the two fractions, and many coding and non-coding transcripts are unique to one fraction

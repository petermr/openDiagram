<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The major molecules dominating the chemical composition of essential oils are caryophyllene oxide, <italic>&#946;</italic>-spathulenol, Ar-curcumene, neral, and cis-verbenol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). Other products such as <italic>&#946;</italic>-caryophyllene, isoledene, elemene, 1.8-cineole, copaene, and nerol are also present with variable ratios. Unlikely, limonene and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, which are compounds constantly found in<italic> A. citriodora</italic> essential oils distilled in Morocco at proportions of 14% for the first and 3% for the second, are present in the studied essential oils in the present work at very low averaging rates of 0.02% to 0.5%. In fact, the compositions of the essential oils depend on the operating (drying, extraction methods) and on the harvest and the storage conditions [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

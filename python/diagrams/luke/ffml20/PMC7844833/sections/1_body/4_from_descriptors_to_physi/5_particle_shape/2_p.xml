<p>Catalyst particle shape is another important parameter for understanding not only the catalytic processes

 </sup> Differently shaped NPs expose different facets, which can significantly affect the catalyst interactions with adsorbates and reaction intermediates. For example, in studies of CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR over PdH catalysts, Zhu et al. reported significantly higher selectivity toward CO
 <sub>2</sub> conversion to CO for octahedral NPs (exposing (111) facets) rather than for cubic NPs exposing (100) facets.

 </sup> A change in the NP shape also results in a different number of active low-coordinated sites on the NP surface.

 </sup> On the other hand, different particle shapes can also constitute evidence of different particle–support interactions. For example, the flattened, raft-like shape of Pt NPs on Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and TiO
 <sub>2</sub> supports can be a signature of strong particle–support interactions.

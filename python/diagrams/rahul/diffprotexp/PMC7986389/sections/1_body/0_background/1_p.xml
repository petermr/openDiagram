<p id="Par12">Cancer is a genetic disease, but not all genes are related to cancer. By almost universal consensus, cancer is now viewed as resulting from changes in some key regulatory genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At present, researchers have defined several kinds of cancer-related gene sets. One widely used kind of gene set is that of cancer driver genes, which are defined as genes whose mutations increase net cell growth under the specific microenvironmental conditions that exist in the cell in vivo. This kind of gene can be predicted by finding ‘significantly mutated genes’, whose mutation rates are significantly higher than the presumed background somatic mutation rate  [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, since it is difficult to construct a reliable background mutation model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], selecting gold-standard driver genes by frequency-based methods is difficult. Another kind of cancer-related genes are so-called ‘cancer genes’, including oncogenes, which function as positive growth regulators, and tumour suppressor genes (TSGs), which function as negative growth regulators. These genes are directly related to the phenotypes of tumour and normal genes and can be predicted by differential gene expression analyses. However, some ‘dark’ genes play important roles at the network level but are generally ignored by traditional differential gene expression analyses [

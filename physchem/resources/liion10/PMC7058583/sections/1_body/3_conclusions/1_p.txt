0: In summary, the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich composites were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method.
1: PEO with non-shared ether-oxygen electron pairs firstly bridged the separated 2D ultrathin rGO nano-sheets into a remarkable 3D layered spatial structure, and then the MoS 2 nano-flowers were homogeneously grown on the surfaces of rGO hosts by  in-situ conversion.
2: This unique 3D flower-like sandwich structure has more active sites and large volume change accommodation.
3: The 3D flower-like composites highlighted high energy density and remarkable cycling stability, and excellent conductivity.
4: Their discharge capacity was retained at 1036 mA h g 1 even after 500 cycles at current densities of 100 mA g 1.
5: This novel structure design of anode material provides new ideas for improving the electrochemical performances of other metal sulfides.

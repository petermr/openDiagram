 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) towards the HPC anode were measured at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V. A broad reduction peak is found in the first cycle, suggesting the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film on the HPC electrode surface [
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. An obvious cathodic peak between 0.01 and 2.0 V can be found, corresponding to reversible insertion of lithium into the carbon layers and nanopores [
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The intensity of the above cathodic peak in the first loop is much higher than that of the rest, which may be due to the formation of the SEI, the electrolyte decomposition, and the irreversible insertion of Li
 <sup>+</sup> into special sites of carbon material [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f004">Figure 4</xref>b shows the discharge and charge curves from the 1st to 100th cycle of the HPC anode under a current density of 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> in a voltage range of 0.01–3 V. The HPC anode presents the 1st discharge and charge capacities of 1062.5 and 649.2 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The primary coulombic efficiency of HPC anode is about 61.1%. The irreversible capacity loss could be attributed to the formation of SEI, the irreversible lithium-ion intercalation on the new-formed surfaces, and even disordered carbon binder [
 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the first discharge curve, a plateau is found at about 0.5 V and then disappears in the subsequent discharge curves. This phenomenon is also in line with the CV result. The discharge and charge capacities of the 2nd cycle are 662.5 and 641.7 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and the coulombic efficiency increases to 97.7%. Compared with the 50th and 100th discharge and charge curves, they almost overlap with each other, showing an outstanding cycling stability.

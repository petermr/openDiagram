<p id="Par27">We also observe differential chromatin accessibility along the anterior–posterior axis in the 
 <italic>HOXA</italic> cluster (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) as well as differential expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and footprints (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c–f</xref>) of 
 <italic>HOXA</italic> family members. These patterns are also detected in 
 <italic>HOXB</italic>, 
 <italic>HOXC</italic> and 
 <italic>HOXD</italic> clusters (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) consistent with the role of 
 <italic>HOX</italic> clusters in the regionalisation of axial structures

 </sup>. As mentioned above, CDX2 is highly expressed in PSM and has greater coverage of footprints in PSM compared to somite samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>) consistent with its role in posterior axis elongation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. PSM samples correspond to thoracic axial levels and this region is defined by central HOX genes, which are regulated by CDX proteins

 </sup>. CDX2 footprints were found in intergenic accessible chromatin peaks within the 
 <italic>HOXA</italic> cluster (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).

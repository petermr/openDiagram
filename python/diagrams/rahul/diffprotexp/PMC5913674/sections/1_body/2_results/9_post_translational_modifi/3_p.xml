<p>There were also several notable differences occurring in the 106-MtzS line distinguishing it from the other 2 isolates. These include a unique KAc protein band in 106-MtzS at approximately 37kDa, as well as 2 unique, high-intensity protein bands with K-MMe at approximately 30 and approximately 25 kDa. Last, 106-MtzS displayed a divergent pY profile compared to WB- and 713 MtzS, although the 106-MtzR line displayed a more congruent pY profile compared to WB- and 713-MtzR.</p>

0: For Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays, HCC cells were plated in 96-well plates and pretreated by transfection with CPSF1 plasmids or siRNAs.
1: The cells were quantified on five consecutive days by incubating with the CCK8 detection reagent for 2 h at 37C followed by colorimetric reading of absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
2: For the colony formation assay, single-cell suspensions were plated in six-well plates.
3: The culture medium was replaced every 72 h. After 14 days, the cells were fixed in methanol for 10 min, stained with crystal violet, and washed twice in PBS.
4: Images were captured using a digital scanner to count the colonies.

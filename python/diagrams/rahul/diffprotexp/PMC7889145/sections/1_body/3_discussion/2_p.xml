<p>A recent report [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] highlights the need for further characterization of transgenic 
 <italic>Cre</italic> mouse lines, observing that only 36/1631 (2.3%) 
 <italic>Cre</italic> models published in the Mouse Genome Database (MGD[
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>],) have an annotated chromosome insertion location. Furthermore, the authors of this report discovered that insertion sites disrupt the coding sequence of endogenous genes in 21/40 (52.5%) analysed transgenic mouse lines, with frequent large deletions and/or structural variations at the insertion site [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These results demonstrate the importance of identifying 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgene integration sites and the impact this information can have on study results obtained using the mouse models. A variety of approaches can be used to identify transgene insertion sites and include low-resolution cytogenetic approaches such as fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and higher resolution molecular approaches such as targeted locus amplification (TLA) [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and highly parallel DNA sequencing with or without paired reads [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

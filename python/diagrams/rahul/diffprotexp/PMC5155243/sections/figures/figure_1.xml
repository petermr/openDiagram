  <title>Mice kidney protein separation.</title>
  <p>MT−/− and MT+/+ mice were administrated with a single dose of DU (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or equal volume of saline (control). After 4 days, kidney proteins were separated by 2-DE (first dimension, 18-cm 3–10NL IPG strips, second dimension, 12% SDS-PAGE) and visualised by silver staining.</p>

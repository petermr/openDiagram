0: Transthoracic echocardiography with an M-mode transducer (12-MHz phased-array transducer; Sonos 5500, Philips USA, Bothell, WA) was performed by an experienced technician who was blinded to study groups on d 7 and 14 [ 15].
1: After anesthesia, the chest was shaved and mice were placed on a heating pad.
2: At the papillary muscle level, short-axis views of M-mode tracings were recorded through the anterior and posterior left ventricular walls to measure LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd), LV end-systolic dimension (LVESd), and LV fraction shortening (LVFS).
3: LV ejection fraction (LVEF) values were obtained according to the Simpson approach.

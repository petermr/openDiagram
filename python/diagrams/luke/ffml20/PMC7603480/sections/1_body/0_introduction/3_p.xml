<p id="Par5">Notwithstanding, the difficulty lies in knowing which parts of the full network to keep. One would need at least an approximate notion of the reaction thermochemistry (and ideally the kinetics) of the full network, to be able to do this on a rational basis. This information is typically not available. Indeed, not even the topology of the full network is usually taken into account. Instead, state-of-the-art reaction networks are generally built by hand, based on chemical intuition and (sparse) experimental evidence. The frequently observed failure to correctly predict the selectivities of complex catalytic processes with first–principles microkinetics indicates that such ad hoc networks may miss important links

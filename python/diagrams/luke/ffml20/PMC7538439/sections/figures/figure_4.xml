  <title>Radial distribution functions (RDFs) of co-existing solid and liquid.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Atom–atom RDFs, 
   <bold>b</bold> atom–molecule RDFs and 
   <bold>c</bold> molecule–molecule RDFs, with the full length shown on the left and a close-up of the first two neighbour shells on the right. The RDFs show that the liquid can pack more tightly than the hcp solid phase. This is true both at 20 GPa, which is before the turnover in the Clapeyron slope, and at 120 GPa, well into the negative slope region. The higher density of the liquid is most apparent in the molecule–molecule RDF. These RDFs are on good agreement with the RDFs obtained from AIMD simulations

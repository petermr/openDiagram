 <italic>In situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS studies are especially important for deciphering the working mechanism of catalysts including extracting in depth information concerning the interactions between the catalyst and its environment (support, ligands, adsorbates). The disorder effects, discussed above, are just one of the ways how these interactions manifest themselves in XAS data. For small metallic NPs, metal–metal bond lengths can also provide important information. For example, the lifting of the disorder in the near-surface layers observed in Pt NPs in the presence of CO or hydrogen adsorbates results in an increase in interatomic distances, detectable by EXAFS analysis. This means that despite the intrinsic surface contraction, the Pt–Pt bond length in small NPs becomes closer to the bulk value in the presence of H

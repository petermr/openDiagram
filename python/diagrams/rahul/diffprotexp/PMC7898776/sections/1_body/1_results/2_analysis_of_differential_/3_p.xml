<p id="Par35">To identify the metabolites, we used the freely accessible database of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to elucidate the putative function of the metabolites. 44 and 20 irons were identified by MS1 and MS2 level in positive mode respectively, and 24 and 11 irons in MS1 and MS2 level in negative mode respectively. The details of differential ions between the two groups were presented in TableÂ

<p>A TCP assay is based on the ability of bacteria to form biofilms on the bottom of tissue culture plates and is mainly used to identify the formation of bacterial biofilms (Mathur et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Okajima et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Presterl et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Bacteria are grown in cell culture plates, and the quantity of a biofilm is detected by staining the wells with crystal violet according to the correlation between OD values and biofilm formation (Mathur et al.,

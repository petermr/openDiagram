<p>The overall change in the expression of flagellum genes also provided strong evidence for the inference that ammonium and urea were direct nitrogen sources of

 <italic>pasteurii</italic>, as the genes encoding constituent proteins of flagellum were significantly up-regulated in KEGG analyses under culture conditions lacking of ammonium or urea. The flagellum was a special structure that grew on the bacterial cell wall, and the presence of this structure endowed the bacteria the ability of movement. The changes in the expression of flagellum genes under experimental conditions almost certainly served to enhance the accessing ability to nutrients. Based on the above phenomena and results, it could be inferred that both ammonium and urea were the direct source of nitrogen nutrients which were prerequisites for the growth of

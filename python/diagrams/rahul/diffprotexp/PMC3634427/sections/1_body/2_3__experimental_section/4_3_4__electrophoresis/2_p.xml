Ninety micrograms of proteins (2 samples of 30 μg each and 30 μg of internal standard), the volume adjusted to 120 μL with lysis buffer (labeling buffer without Tris and with bromophenol blue) and 2.4 μL of Destreak Reagent (GE Healthcare) and 0.72 μL of IPG buffer 3–10 NL (GE Healthcare) were added and then loaded by cup loading on 24 cm 3–10 NL ReadyStrip™ IPG strips (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA). Prior to the cup loading, the ReadyStrip™ IPG strips were rehydrated overnight with 450 μL of rehydration solution (prepared with 500 μL of Destreak rehydration solution (GE Healthcare) and 5 μL of IPG buffer 3–10 NL (GE Healthcare) [

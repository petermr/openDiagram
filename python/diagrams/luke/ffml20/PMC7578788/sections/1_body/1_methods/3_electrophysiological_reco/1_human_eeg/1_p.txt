0: The experiments were preformed within a purpose-built Faraday cage.
1: EEG signals were captured using 32 active electrodes (ActiCAP, BrainProducts) arranged according to the extended international 10/20 system.
2: Electrode preparation proceeded as per the manufacturers guidance and impedances were reduced to < 5 k with conductive gel (SuperVisc, BrainProducts).
3: Data were recorded at 2500 Hz using a BrainAmp DC amplifier and BrainVision Recorder Software (BrainProducts).

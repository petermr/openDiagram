<p>The three basic elements for the art of medicine are diagnosis, therapeutics, and prognosis. Therefore, after making the correct and early diagnosis, determining the optimal treatment strategies would be important and as a follow-up, one could provide up-to-date information on the patientâ€™s prognosis. Our present investigation also aimed to provide new targets for the design of novel therapies in RCC subtypes and putative biomarkers with prognostic significance. In this study, DIP clusters appear to be strong putative candidates for the prognostic marker in each related subtype. Survival analyses through stratification of patients according to clinicopathological variables such as tumor stage or grade would demonstrate the prognostic power of the potential biomarkers better. However, despite the presence of comprehensive gene expression profiling efforts such as TCGA, transcriptome data with available clinical information is still limited for RCCs, even for the most common subtypes.</p>

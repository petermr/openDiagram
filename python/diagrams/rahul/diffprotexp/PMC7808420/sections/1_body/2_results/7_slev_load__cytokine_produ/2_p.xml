<p>We also evaluated if SLEV infection would affect the number and types of circulating leukocytes in WT (C57BL/6) and IFNγ-/- mice. Blood samples were collected from mock- and SLEV-infected mice at day 7 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9a,b</xref>). Our analysis indicated that mock-infected WT (C57BL/6) and IFNγ-/- mice had normal leukocyte counts and comparable proportions of monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes (

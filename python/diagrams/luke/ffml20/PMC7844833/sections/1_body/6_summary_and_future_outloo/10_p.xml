<p>In addition to time-resolved studies, spatially resolved studies as well as experiments that combine spatial mapping with time-resolved investigations of the catalyst dynamics are also expected to gain importance in the future. This is due to the ability to partially lift one of the most important limitations of the XAS method, its sample-averaging nature. We believe that the potential of such experiments is currently severely underexploited. Despite the fact that proof-of-principle spatially resolved XAS studies of heterogeneous catalysts have been carried out more than a decade ago, the practical application of this approach is still rare. This can be in part attributed to problems of the data analysis. Both time-resolved and spatially-resolved experiments carried out at a modern beamlines can easily result in thousands of spectra and hundreds of gigabytes of data. The capabilities of presently popular XAS data analysis suites are still largely inadequate for even basic systematic analysis and visualization of such data sets. Thus, the progress in this field will be strongly coupled to the progress in the automatization of data processing and interpretation.</p>

<p>Pretreatment of aorta with cyclooxygenase inhibitor; indomethacin (92.95% ± 2.73; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) did not produce any significant difference of vasorelaxation induced by AcEO precontracted with phenylephrine. Therefore, aorta preincubated with endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase inhibitor; thapsigargin (45.34% ± 6.58; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and calcium channel type VOC blocker; verapamil (48.12% ± 8.21; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) produced a sub-maximum inhibitory effect of vasorelaxation induced by AcEO (0.1–100 μg/ml) (Figs.

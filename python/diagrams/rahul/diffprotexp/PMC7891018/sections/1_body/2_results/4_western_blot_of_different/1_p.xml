<p id="Par37">To validate the results of the proteomic studies, we performed Western blot analysis of the differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins ATP5F1, ECHS1, MDH2, and HSPA1L with the TOM40 protein as the control. The results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; the density of the band corresponding to the mitochondrial protein MDH2 was significantly reduced in the H5N1-infected group compared with that in H9N2-infected group (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the densities of the ECHS1 and HSPA1L protein bands were significantly enhanced (P &lt; 0.05, for both). The ATP5F1 band was weak, but the difference was nonsignificant. We performed the same Western blot experiment with total cell protein, and the results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a. There were significant differences between ECHS1 and MDH2 in the total protein.

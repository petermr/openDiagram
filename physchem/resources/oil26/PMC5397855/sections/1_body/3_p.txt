0: Garlic,  Allium sativum Linnaeus (Amaryllidaceae), is a native of temperate western Asia and has been used throughout the world as a food spice and medicine 22.
1: Antimicrobial 23, cardiovascular 24, anticancer 25, hypo- and hyper-glycaemic, and other beneficial properties of garlic have been reported 26.
2: In different studies, garlic essential oil was demonstrated to possess insecticidal activity against  Blattella germanica Linnaeus (Blattodea: Blatellidae) 27,  Lycoriella ingenue Dufour (Diptera: Sciaridae) 28,  Reticulitermes speratus Kolbe (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) 29, and several grain storage insects as  Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae),  Sitophilus oryzae Linnaeus,  Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and  Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) 3031.
3: There are a variety of insecticides that have toxicological properties, deterrents, and repellents used for the control of  T. molitor; however, essential oil of garlic could be an alternative for the control in stored products.
4: Identification of toxic compounds of garlic is important in understanding toxicity as it relates to pest control.
5: In this study, we hypothesized that garlic essential oil and their constituents have insecticidal activity in  T. molitor.

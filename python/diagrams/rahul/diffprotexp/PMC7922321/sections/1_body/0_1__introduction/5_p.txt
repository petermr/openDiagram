0: Malignant gliomas are the most common and lethal primary tumors of the brain.
1: Grading of diffuse gliomas is based largely on the mitotic activity and vascular proliferation states, and molecular markers are also used as diagnostic entities.
2: Still, further molecular information will be important in a more detailed description and categorization of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, in particular for reliable and reproducible classification of grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas [ 20, 21].
3: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), WHO grade IV, is the most aggressive and lethal among all gliomas.
4: High-grade gliomas are composed of a highly proliferative tumor core, with highly invasive cells surrounding them [ 22].

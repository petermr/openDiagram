0: After exposure, cells were scraped and lysed with RLT lysis buffer containing beta-mercaptoethanol.
1: Cell lysates were homogenized using QIA shredders (Qiagen), and mRNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufactures recommended protocol.
2: RNA concentrations were determined with a Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at  80 C. RNA was transported on dry ice to the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core for further processing.
3: Four independent experiments were performed.
4: Each treatment group within a given experiment was performed in triplicate.
5: RNA from triplicates were pooled according to the treatment group within the experiment.
6: In total, RNA was analyzed from 24 cell samples: 4 replicates at 2 time points and 3 treatment groups.

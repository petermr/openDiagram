<p id="Par33">High salinity can severely affect the efficiency of photosynthesis due to decrease in photosynthetic pigments; decrease in unsaturation index, damaged photosynthetic system and ultimately reduction in the photosynthesis. The photosynthetic enzymes such as ferredoxin and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase are important for photosynthesis process but are down-regulated under salt stress

 </sup>. The up-regulation of photosynthetic enzymes Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and ferredoxin in 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic> might indicate the normal functioning of the photosystem under high salt concentrations. It is already established that the unsaturation index of higher plant decreases with an increase in the salinity level

 </sup>. A number of genes are involved in the MAPK pathways which are responsible for the stress tolerance mechanism. One of the previously identified protein namely SOS2 (a ser/thr protein kinase) which interacts with a protein phosphatase 2C was found to be involved in the salt tolerance

 </sup>. Copper-transporting ATPase RAN1 is essential for the biogenesis of ethylene receptor which is a negative regulator of ethylene biosynthesis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, up-regulation of Cu-transporting ATPase RAN1 results into the indirect inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis. In higher plants, the ethylene biosynthesis increases under stress leading to senescence

 </sup>. However, here, the salt tolerance ability of this halophyte may be attributed to inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis.

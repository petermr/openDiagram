<p>The frozen sponge was chopped into small pieces and extracted by repeated sonication in MeOH. The MeOH extracts were combined and evaporated, and the yellow brown residue was adsorbed onto C
 <sub>18</sub> silica gel. The extract-impregnated gel was separated by preparative HPLC on C
 <sub>18</sub>-bonded silica gel with a gradient from 1% aqueous TFA to MeOH containing 1% TFA with one min. timed fractions collected. These fractions were further analyzed by (+)−LRESIMS, and only two groups of fractions (fraction 17–20 and fraction 27) showed prominent ions by MS. Fractions 17 and 18 had ion peaks at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 175 and 265, fractions 19 and 20 had an ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 175 and fraction 27 had an ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 266. These fractions were evaporated and analyzed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. Fractions 17 and 18 contained a mixture of 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyltryptamine. These compounds were separated from each other by recrystallization from MeOH. The supernatant was pure 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyltryptamine, and 
 <bold>1</bold> was obtained as fine needles (18.5 mg, 0.09%). Fractions 19 and 20 were pure 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyltryptamine (34.7 mg, 0.17%) and fraction 27 was pure 
 <bold>2</bold> (1.3 mg, 0.007%).

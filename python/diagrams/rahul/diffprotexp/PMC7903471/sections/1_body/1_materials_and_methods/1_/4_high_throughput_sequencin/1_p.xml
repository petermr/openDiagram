<p>Sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra™ Directional RNA LibraryPrep kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw reads were obtained by Illumina sequencing and high-quality sequences (clean reads) were obtained through a series of data processing procedures such as removing low-quality sequences, de-linking contamination and rRNA including removing reads of joint contamination (the base number of joint contamination in reads was greater than 5 bp, removing low-quality reads (reads intermediate value Q ≤19 accounted for &gt;50% of the total base), removing reads with N ratio &gt;5% and removing reads matched with rRNA.</p>

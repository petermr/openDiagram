<p>Ischemia/reperfusion complicated by delayed neurological impairment is a dynamic pathological process, and the underlying mechanism is complex[

 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the mechanism may be related to microcirculation disturbance, inflammatory mechanisms, cellular necrosis and apoptosis, or biochemical self-destructive factors (such as calcium ion overloading, free radicals, excitatory amino acids)[

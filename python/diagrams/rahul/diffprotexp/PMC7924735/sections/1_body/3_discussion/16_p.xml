<p>While it is true that our study has some limitations, it also opens promising perspectives, including the validation of our approach by analyzing other organisms for which the complete genome has been reported, like 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> and the 43 platyhelminths and 153 nematodes in the WormBase ParaSite. That information would allow us to identify proteins that are shared by various parasites and to design diagnostic methods that prevent a cross-reaction between parasites endemic in the same geographic area.

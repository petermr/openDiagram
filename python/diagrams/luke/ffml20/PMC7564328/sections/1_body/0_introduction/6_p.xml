All in all, CD-MOF has the characteristics of special porous for loading of insoluble drugs, uniform controllable cubic morphology and size for quality control and high portability, which provide the basis for inhalable CD-MOF particles as a potential new carrier for laryngeal administration in the field of laryngeal delivery.

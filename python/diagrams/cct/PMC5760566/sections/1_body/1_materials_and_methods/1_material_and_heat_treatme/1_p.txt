0: The chemical composition of the test steel (SA508 Gr.4N) with elemental composition as per ASME boiler and pressure vessel-section  materialsSA-508/SA-508M specification 17.
1: The chemical composition of the steels is given in Table  1.
2: The carbon content was determined from the GB/T223.69-2008 steel and alloy carbon content.
3: After combustion in the tube furnace, the gas volumetric method was adopted.
4: The concentrations of Al, Ni, Cr, Mo, Mn, V, Ti, Nb were used to determine the multi-element content of GB/T223.79-2007 iron and steel via X-ray fluorescence spectrometry.
5: In the testing standard, the minimum detectable content of P, S, Ti is 0.001%, and the lowest detectable content of Si, Mn, Cu, Al, Nb, Cr, Mo, V is 0.002%.

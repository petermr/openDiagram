 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> secretome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0009104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to identify 167 excretory/secretory proteins in their data set. Using various algorithms, those authors select 9 antigenic proteins and used them to design a diagnostic assay (ELISA) to detect porcine cysticercosis [

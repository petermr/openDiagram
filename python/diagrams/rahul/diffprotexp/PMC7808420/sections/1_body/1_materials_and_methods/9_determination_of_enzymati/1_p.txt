0: Assays to detect the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and N-acetyl--glycosaminidase (NAG) were performed in tissue samples as a measure of leukocyte recruitment into target organs.
1: To measure MPO and EPO activity, tissue homogenates were prepared in 1 mL of PBS containing 0.5% hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) and 5 mM EDTA.
2: Saline/Triton X-100 0.1% v/v was used to process tissues for NAG activity measurement.
3: Test protocols were performed as already described [ 35].
4: Briefly, samples were evaluated for their ability to convert the substrates p-nitrophenyl--glicosaminide (for NAG), 3,3 5,5 tetramethylbenzidine (for MPO) or o-phenylenediamine (for EPO) to generate a colored solution proportional to the amount of enzyme in the sample.
5: Plates for each assay were read at 405, 450 and 495 nm, respectively, and results were expressed as absorbance.

<p>Supplementary Figure S7: Total protein lysate (10μg) from trophozoites exposed for 8 hours to 1, 2 and 4μM TSA, with control flasks exposed to the same volume DMSO as used as a vehicle for TSA. Protein from WB, 713 and 106 MtzS and MtzR lines probed with antibodies again acetylated lysine (KAc) (below). Protein loading was verified after transfer using Ponceau S staining (upper). At 8 hours, MtzS isolates are beginning to show hyper-acetylation of H3 and H4 variants, which is not observed in MtzR lines. Based on this optimization experiment, 2μM of TSA was chosen as a concentration for a longer TSA exposure time course in MtzR and MtzS lines.</p>

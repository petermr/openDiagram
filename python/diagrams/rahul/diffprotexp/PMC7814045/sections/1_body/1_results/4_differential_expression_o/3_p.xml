<p id="Par13">In 2019, Ghulam et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> classified major and minor paralogs in 20 couples of ohnologs (first 20 couples listed in Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>), among the 58 couples of RPGs ohnologs reported in the yeast genome annotation. Interestingly, they showed that, in general, when cells are exposed to stress, the ratio between the major and the minor paralogs gene expression decreases, because of the downregulation of the major paralog and/or the upregulation of the minor one. In Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>, we highlighted a change in paralogs ratio of 3 of the annotated couples
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> (“yes” in Paralog couple shift column). Moreover, considering the remaining couples of paralogs, that were not classified in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>, the ratio changes also in 8 additional couples. In particular, at 45 min the ratio is changed in 3 couples, at 120 minutes in 4, and at 200 min in 6 couples, respectively (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

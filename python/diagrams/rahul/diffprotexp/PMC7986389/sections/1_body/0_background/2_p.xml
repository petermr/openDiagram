<p id="Par13">By using graph theory algorithms, we can find critical vertices to control a network. For example, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] developed a feedback-based framework that provides realizable node overrides that steer a system towards one of its natural long-term dynamic behaviours; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] provided a rational criterion for selecting key molecules to control a system with a feedback vertex set (FVS); [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] proposed a network control strategy to find driver mutations that drive a regulation network from the normal state to a disease state; and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] considered applying minimum feedback vertex sets (MFVS) to real biologically directed complex networks and found essential proteins in both

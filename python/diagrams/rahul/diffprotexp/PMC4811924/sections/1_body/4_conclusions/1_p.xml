<p>Our study suggested that sub-MICs of tylosin could inhibit 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm formation 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We used a robust and reliable comparative proteomic technique (iTRAQ) to compare the abundances of proteins from 1/4 MIC of tylosin treated cells and nontreated cells. Finally, in sub-MIC tylosin inhibiting cells, we identified 96 differentially expressed proteins when the protein had a fold-change of more than a ratio &gt;1.5 or &lt; 0.67 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Our proteomic data suggested general changes in metabolism (such as phosphoglycerate kinase) and surface proteins (such as ABC transporter proteins) involved in biofilm formation. Overall, our results indicated that 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> metabolic regulation, cell-surface proteins, and virulence proteins appear to be of importance in biofilm growth by sub-MIC tylosin treatment. Thus, our data revealed the rough regulation of biofilm formation that might potentially be utilized to manage biofilm infections of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic>.

<p id="Par18">To examine association with particular cellular processes or regenerative events, the TFs were clustered with differentially expressed transcripts and subjected to a functional analysis with GO. Groups 2 and 4 were mostly associated with cell adhesion and cell receptor activity in the membrane, while groups 1 and 3 were involved with biosynthesis and translation. Finally, TFs in group 5 were correlated with proteolytic and structural processes in the cell (see supplementary Table

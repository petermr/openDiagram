<p id="Par26">Furthermore, to interpret the influence of CaO, SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and water on various stiffness components of C–S–H, obtained using the NN-based model, SHAP is leveraged which evaluates the importance of each model features on the model’s output after considering all the possible combinations. From evaluations using SHAP, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) all the stiffness components of C–S–H are dominantly influenced by SiO
 <sub>2</sub> content followed by water and CaO content; (2) the influence of water content is more prominent for shear components. These results suggest that the in-plane movements are primarily controlled by the water molecules, while the normal stiffness along the direction of the interlayers is mainly controlled by the silicate network. Overall, by synergistically integrating high-throughput MD simulations with ML approaches, this paper shows the efficacy of using ML-based approaches to predict the mechanical behavior of C–S–H and this study can be adopted as a starting point towards developing integrated experiment-multiscale simulation-ML-based design strategies for exceptional materials performance.

0: To knock down ETHE1 expression, siRNA targeting ETHE1 was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: The design of the specific siRNA sequences and the experimental methods employed for these experiments were described previously 30.
2: A specific siRNA and negative control siRNA were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China).
3: The specific sequence was 5-CAGGCTGACTTACACATTG-3.
4: A negative control group was set up using a non-specific sequence.
5: Transfection was performed when the cells reached 90% confluence.
6: One hour before transfection, cells were inoculated into 24-well culture plates at a density of 4  10 5 cells/well.
7: Culture medium was used to dilute 2 l of Oligofectamine, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min.
8: After dilution, Oligofectamine was mixed and then incubated with the DNA solution as soon as possible.
9: Cells were incubated in a 37 C incubator under 5% CO 2 for appropriate culture times.
10: The expression of ETHE1 was then detected using western blotting.

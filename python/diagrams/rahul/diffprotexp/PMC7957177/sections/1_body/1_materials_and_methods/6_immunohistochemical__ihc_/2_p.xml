<p>The IHC staining was performed as follows. First, paraffin sections were treated twice with xylene for 10 min each, re‐hydrated through 100%, 95%, 85% and 75% ethanol each for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. The slices were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to remove endogenous peroxidase, washed three times with PBS, boiled in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0) for 20 min for antigen retrieval and washed three times with PBS after bringing to room temperature. After blocking the nonspecific binding site with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min, the slices were incubated with a specific antibody (as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="cam43799-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) overnight at 4°C. The slices were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a sheep anti‐mouse or anti‐rabbit antibody conjugated with HRP (Boster, Wuhan, China) (1:100 dilution in 1% BSA in PBS). The slices were then washed three times with PBS and treated with 3’3‐diaminobenzidine tetra‐hydrochloride (DAB) followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin for 5 min. After being dehydrated through 75%, 85%, 95% and 100% ethanol for 5 min each and incubated in xylene for 10 min twice, the slices were finally mounted with neutral gum. The tissue sections were observed under an Olympus microscope (Olympus Corporation, Japan) and images were taken at 200× magnification using the same light intensity and exposure time. Before we examined the images, we excluded non‐lesional contamination and nonspecific staining sections based on the judgments of the five certified pathologists. Image‐Pro Plus (IPP) image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, USA) was used to analyse the integrated optical density (IOD) value of each image, blinded to the corresponding clinical data.

<p id="Par60">We used the standard procedures for the extraction of total RNAs from WT and MT pseudostems, which involved the use of Spin Column Plant total RNA Purification Kit (Tiandz, Beijing, China) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Further, the RNAsâ€™ purity was assessed, the extracted RNAs were quantified, and their integrity was checked. Following these steps, sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) as reported earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].

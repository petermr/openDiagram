<p>Recombinant GST-tagged PirB proteins (rGST and GST-rPirB) were cloned, expressed (with IPTG induction), and purified, after which the proteins were ascertained by SDS-PAGE analysis. Single bands corresponding to 26 kDa and 75 kDa, representing rGST and GST-rPirB, respectively, were found on the gels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2a</xref>). Next, the puriﬁed rGST and GST-rPirB proteins were used for pull-down analysis to determine their interaction with shrimp hemocyte lysate proteins. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b</xref>, three diﬀerential bands with approximate sizes 40–45 kDa, 30–35 kDa, and 10–20 kDa were observed in the GST-rPirB + hemocyte lysate samples compared with control (rGST + hemocytes lysate). The three bands were excised and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis, followed by a search of the generated LC-MS/MS spectra against the NCBI database (

The search identified 20 putative PirB interacting proteins (Supplementary Table S1). Because the excised protein bands used for the LC-MS/MS analysis had molecular masses in the ranges: 40–45 kDa, 30–35 kDa, and 10–20 kDa, respectively, all proteins within this range (i.e. 10–45 kDa) were selected for further analysis. Based on this criterion, 13 proteins were selected (

  <p>Correlation of differential methylation and differential gene expression in transgenic tobacco associated with the H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> response. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Number of DMCs associated with DEGs. (
   <bold>B</bold>) DMCs profiles of the up/down-regulated genes in different sequence contexts and gene regions. Scale color represents methylation level difference (blue = hypomethylation; yellow = hypermethylation). (
   <bold>C</bold>) DmCs profiles of up/down-regulated genes involved in H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> response in tobacco. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Gene expression profiles (L8/L1) of the genes with DmCs. Scale color represents log2 fold-change expression (red = upregulation, green = downregulation).

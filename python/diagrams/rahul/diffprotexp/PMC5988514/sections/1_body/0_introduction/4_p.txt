0: FV-PTC is hardly characterized and hence diagnosed with FNAB.
1: Thus, sometimes there is a necessity for a second surgical operation to remove the other thyroid lobe when no certain diagnosis is made for FV-PTC cases.
2: Thereafter, the ongoing discussion in FV-PTC among experts resulted in the revision of the nomenclature for noninvasive FV-PTC  [6].
3: The diagnosis of this type is challenging as it is solely based on the nuclei features due to its non-invasive characteristics  [6].
4: This could result in subjective and controversial diagnosis in thyroid pathology.
5: Recently, noninvasive FV-PTC is termed as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) with very low adverse outcome  [6].

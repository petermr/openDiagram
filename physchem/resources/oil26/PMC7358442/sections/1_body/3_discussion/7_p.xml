<p>The main factor that influenced the proportion of activity that was diurnal in our aardvarks was their minimum 24-h body temperature, proposed as an index of nutritional state (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Rey et al., 2017</xref>). Our aardvarks switched to more-diurnal activity after they no longer had sufficient energy to maintain body temperature at night. During periods of negative energy balance, other nocturnal mammals also shift their activity to the daytime, both in the laboratory (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Van der Vinne et al., 2014</xref>,

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lockard, 1978</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Boal and Giovanni, 2007</xref>). The shift to diurnality in response to an energy deficit is more pronounced under cold conditions (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Van der Vinne et al., 2014</xref>), when metabolic costs associated with thermoregulation are highest. Such plasticity of the mammalian circadian system is thought to be an adaptive mechanism that allows nocturnal mammals to conserve their energy (up to 10% in some species, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Van der Vinne et al., 2015</xref>), thereby enhancing their survival (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Van der Vinne et al., 2019</xref>). However, if the shift to diurnality occurs when ambient temperatures are high (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Van der Vinne et al., 2014</xref>), as it did in our aardvark during the summer drought, it would increase their exposure to heat.

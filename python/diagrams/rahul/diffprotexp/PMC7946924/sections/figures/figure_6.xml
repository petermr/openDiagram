  <p>The number of unique miRNAs present in the apical and basal spikelets of either in V1 (SR-159) or V2 (SR-157) during post-anthesis (0, 5 and 10 days) taken together (
   <bold>a</bold>). The unique miRNA present in the apical and basal spikelets of V1 and V2 (
   <bold>b</bold>), miRNAs having target genes in the ethylene pathways in the apical and basal spikelets (
   <bold>c</bold>) and miRNAs having target genes in the auxin pathways in the apical and basal spikelets (
   <bold>d</bold>) arranged separately during post-anthesis (0, 5 and 10 days).

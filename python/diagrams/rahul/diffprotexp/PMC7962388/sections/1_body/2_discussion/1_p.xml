<p id="Par69">Apomixis in 
 <italic>Paspalum notatum</italic> is a genetically heritable trait controlled by a single complex-locus (ACL), which shows non-mendelian segregation against apomixis and a strong restriction of recombination involving around 36 M[bp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The ACL is localized in a chromosome fragment syntenic to subtelomeric segments of rice chromosomes 2 and 12 and maize chromosomes 1 and 3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. This genomic region displays typical heterochromatin features, like the presence of repetitive elements, gene degeneration and cytosine hypermethylation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The complex genomic topography together with the unavailability of a reference genome have seriously compromised the identification of genes controlling the trait by positional map-based approaches. As a consequence, transcriptomic surveys became essential tools for identifying apomixis-related genes in the species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

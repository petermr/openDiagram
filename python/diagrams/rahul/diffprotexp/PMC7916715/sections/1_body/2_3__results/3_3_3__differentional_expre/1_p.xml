<p>The enrichment of the CREIGHTON_ENDOCRINE_THERAPY_RESISTANCE_3 gene set (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) with a role in resistance of breast cancer to endocrine therapy [
 <xref rid="B46-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] indicates differential expression of CNTN1 and the LE genes in CRPCs. To examine this possibility, we have generated LNCaP xenografts in intact (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) and castrated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) NOD/SCID mice. The development of LNCaP tumors resistant to castration (CRPC) was confirmed by tumor regrowth and resurge of serum PSA [
 <xref rid="B41-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In comparison to LNCaP tumors produced in intact mice, LNCaP CRPCs display upregulations of CNTN1 along with five LE genes: TMEM45B, NANS, ARFGEF2, GPR110, and SRD5A3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f006">Figure 6</xref>). These observations are novel and support the concept of potential differential expression of LE component genes following PC progression.

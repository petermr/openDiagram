 <p>Two new fluorescent pteridine alkaloids, tedaniophorbasins A (
  <bold>1</bold>) and B (
  <bold>2</bold>), together with the known alkaloid 
  <italic>N</italic>-methyltryptamine, were isolated, through application of mass directed purification, from the sponge 
  <italic>Tedaniophorbas ceratosis</italic> collected from northern New South Wales, Australia. The structures of tedaniophorbasins A and B were deduced from the analysis of 1D/2D NMR and MS data and through application of 
  <sup>13</sup>C NMR DFT calculations. Tedaniophorbasin A possesses a novel 2-imino-1,3-dimethyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-[1,4]thiazino[3,2-g]pteridin-4(6
  <italic>H</italic>)-one skeleton, while tedaniophorbasin B is its 2-oxo derivative. The compounds show significant Stokes shifts (~14,000 cm
  <sup>−1</sup>) between excitation and emission wavelengths in their fluorescence spectra. The new compounds were tested for bioactivity against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of the malaria parasite 
  <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and the protozoan parasite 
  <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> but were inactive against all targets at 40 µM.

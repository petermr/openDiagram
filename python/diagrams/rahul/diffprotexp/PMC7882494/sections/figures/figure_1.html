 <caption> Differential expression of COL11A1 gene (A) Expression of COL11A1 mRNA across different cancers where red and blue represent the upregulation and downregulation, respectively. (B) Comparative expression of COL11A1 mRNA between colon adenocarcinoma tumor tissue and normal tissue (statistical significance computed by differential analysis, ∗ P &lt; 0.05; ∗∗ P &lt; 0.01; ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001). (C–F) Box plot comparison of COL11A1 expression for TCGA colorectal cancer dataset in panel (C). Colon adenocarcinoma, (D) Colon Mucinous Adenocarcinoma, (E) Rectal Adenocarcinoma, (F) Cecum Adenocarcinoma. (G–J) Box plot comparison of COL11A1 expression for Kaiser colon cancer dataset in panel (G). Colon adenocarcinoma, (H) Colon Mucinous Adenocarcinoma, (I) Rectosigmoid Adenocarcinoma, (J) Cecum Adenocarcinoma. </caption>

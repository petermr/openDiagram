<p>The rapid response and magnitude of the IIR is a critical factor in the ability of the host to respond to infectious viruses. Through its paracrine actions to activate IFN-stimulated genes, type I IFN expression is critical in reducing the initial spread of viruses. However, prolonged or exuberant IIR activation can be also detrimental, leading to cytokine storm syndrome [

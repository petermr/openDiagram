<p>In the present study, differentially expressed proteins associated with the two coronary artery abnormalities, CAD and CAA, within patients with KD were identified using proteomics methods. A total of 51 samples were divided into 17 groups. Each group contained 1 control sample, 1 CAD sample and 1 CAA sample. Three pooled samples (5 control, 5 CAD and 5 CAA) were generated by combining samples from 5 groups and were used for iTRAQ analyses to detect significantly differentially expressed proteins. The other 12 groups were used for western blot validation. In total, 87 and 65 differentially expressed proteins for the CAD and CAA were obtained, respectively, compared with the control.</p>

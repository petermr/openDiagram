<p>This work demonstrates the potential usefulness of this new method of protein identification in 2D gels to characterize a complex sample even when the conditions for MS sequencing are not met. The only major limitation is that genomic data are required. Identifying these proteins, which have not been characterized due to their low expression, could lead to new therapeutic targets and deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of

<p>Studies have shown that protein-coding genes (PCGs) are involved in the activation of pathways or key proteins and play vital roles in the biological processes of pituitary adenomas. For example, Uraki 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b19-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) showed that reducing the expression of MSH6 and MSH2 can directly promote the growth of pituitary tumors through the ATR-Chk1 pathway. Long 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b20-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) suggested that collagen α VI chain interacts with P4HA3 to inhibit pituitary adenoma cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt pathway. The low expression of TGF-β RII may be related to the development and invasion of NFPAs (

 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b22-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) confirmed that the expression of TGF-β1 and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) in recurrent tumors is higher compared with that in primary tumors, suggesting that these PCGs may be related to cell proliferation and recurrence. Compared with non-invasive NFPAs, the expression levels of WIF1 and secreted frizzled-related protein 4 are reduced in invasive NFPAs; thus, WIF1 may be a potential biomarker for the aggressiveness of NFPAs (

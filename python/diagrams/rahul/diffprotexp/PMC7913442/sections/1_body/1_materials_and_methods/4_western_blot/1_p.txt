0: For protein quantification, additional five samples that were cultured in parallel were lysed in lysis buffer (RIPA buffer, catalog #89901, Thermo Fisher Scientific), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (#78420, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and protease inhibitor cocktail (#P8340, Sigma-Aldrich), and Pierce BCA protein assay kit was used for total protein quantification (#23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
1: NuPAGE LDS sample buffer 4X (#NP0007, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and -mercaptoethanol (#6010, Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) were added to cell lysates, and samples were denaturized at 95 C for 5 min.
2: Proteins separation occurred on 812% SDS-PAGE gels and with subsequent transfer to nitrocellulose membranes.
3: Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with blocking solution (BSA, #A30075-100, Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL), and with primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. Membranes were washed three times, then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to infrared fluorescent dyes excitable at 800 nm (IRDye 800CW, Li-COR-USA) to visualize the desired antigens using an 800 nm laser scanner (Odyssey, Licor, USA).
4: Quantification of protein levels was performed by IR fluorescence detection (Odyssey, Licor, USA) and analysis was performed with ImageJ.

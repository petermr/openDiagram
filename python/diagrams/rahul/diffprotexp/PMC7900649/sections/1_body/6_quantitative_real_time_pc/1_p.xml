<p id="Par39">Total RNA was extracted from the GDS01-infected or mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA was synthesized using 3 μg total RNA with the Rever Tra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover Kit (TOYOBO, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. qPCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 10 μl with SYBR Premix ExTaq II Kit (Takara) using a Light Cycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The GAPDH gene was used as a reference gene. Primer sequences in this research are given in Additional file 1.</p>

<p>Cxcl15/lungkine was first identified in lung bronchoepithelial cells and was shown to be a neutrophil chemoattractant up-regulated in various lung inflammation models, including I.T. challenge with LPS and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mice lacking expression of Cxcl15 were more susceptible to 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>) infection, with decreased survival and increased lung bacterial burden compared to infected wild-type mice [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Histologic analysis of the lungs and assessment of leukocytes in BALF revealed that neutrophil numbers were normal in the lung parenchyma but reduced in the airspace at 24 h post 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> infection in Cxcl15 null mice, demonstrating that Cxcl15 is an important mediator of neutrophil migration from the lung parenchyma into the airspace [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The closest human gene to mouse Cxcl15 is pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP, also known as CXCL7) [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Increased PPBP/CXCL7 chemokine expression has been associated with neutrophil activation in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The expression and function of CXCL7 in pulmonary or extra-pulmonary ARDS, however, have not been examined.

<p>Prior to applying data analysis, normalization and gene filtering are used to pre-process the raw read counts that resulted from the sequencing. To account for RNA composition and sequencing depth among samples (single cells), the normalization method “median of ratios” is used through RaceID. This method makes it possible to compare the normalized counts for each gene equally between samples because it takes the ratio of the gene instantaneous median to the total counts for all genes in that cell. The key idea of gene filtering is to highlight the genes that manifest high variation across samples. DIscBIO provides three gene filtering techniques: noise filtering, expression filtering and designed filtering. In case the data include ERCC spike-ins, genes can be filtered based on variability in comparison to a noise level estimated from the ERCCs using an algorithm developed by Brennecke et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For datasets with or without ERCCs, genes can be filtered either based on their gene expression or minimum expression in a certain number of cells, or based on a particular gene list of interest, for instance the genes involved in a desired cellular process. The expression filtering is computed through RaceID using two parameters: Minexpr and Minnumber.

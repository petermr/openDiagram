<p>Several distinct modes underpinning the evolution of compartments and organellar diversity have been proposed. These are based largely on analysis of the membrane trafficking system, which features large paralogous protein families with organelle-specific members such as GTPase and SNARE families, kinesins and others [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>]. Some of these modes can be considered to be ‘expansive’, in the sense that they lead to an increase in the number of compartments. This is exemplified by Rab GTPases that specify and mediate cargo exchange between endocytic and exocytic compartments [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Alternatively, there are many examples of reductive processes, where lineages lose complexity; again, the Rab family is a good example – in many unicellular organisms, for example in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a great many Rab genes have been lost. We termed this process ‘sculpting’, as the new organism is revealed only through the removal of genes. These two examples are comparatively simple to understand in evolutionary terms as they rely on changes to the numbers of paralogs within a gene family [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; but additional mechanisms are also at play and are not always obvious in terms of simple gene counts. These include ‘churning’ whereby paralogs are created and deleted so the overall number remains similar [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; and finally ‘backfilling’ whereby loss of functionality through gene loss is compensated through the expansion of a different gene family [
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>). In principle, the relevance of such modes of evolution extends to all endomembranes, including their sub-domains and functions, at all stages of eukaryotic evolution.

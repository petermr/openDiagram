<p id="Par52">In the present study, two in vitro models were utilized to measure DCVC effects on first-trimester placental gene expression: villous explants and HTR-8/SVneo cells. Due to the limited availability of first-trimester placental tissues, only one experimental comparison was made between the two models, non-treated controls versus 20 µM DCVC treatment for 12 h. Gene-specific expression levels varied considerably between tissues and cells. Treated tissues yielded no differentially expressed genes with an FDR &lt; 0.05, yet thousands were altered with a magnitude logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]. On the other hand, treated cells yielded hundreds of differentially expressed genes meeting FDR criterion, but only half the number of genes were altered with a magnitude logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3] compared to villous explants. These variable results are consistent with the relatively weak calculated correlation between genome-wide differential gene expression in tissues and cells. Differences in these results may be attributed to the tissue model containing multiple non-deconvoluted cell types, versus the cell line model containing only one genetically identical cell type (Campbell et al.

0: The metabolic network is complex, involving many diverse substrates, products, and intermediates in the chemical reactions of metabolism, denoted here as metabolic reactions, and the metabolic enzymes that mediate the reactions.
1: Many metabolic enzymes are regulated not only through availability of substrates but also through feedback regulation by the products or through allosteric mechanisms.
2: In addition, metabolic enzymes are regulated at the level of gene expression and through posttranslational modifications.
3: Thus, obesity-associated dysregulation of metabolic networks in various organs is due to changes in complex networks with many forms of regulation ( Lusis et al., 2008;  Muoio and Newgard, 2008;  Roden and Shulman, 2019).
4: Hence, to comprehensively evaluate the effects of obesity on intracellular regulatory mechanisms requires investigation and integration of omic data of multiple types (transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) and from multiple organs.
5: Few, if any, studies have taken such an integrated, multi-organ approach.

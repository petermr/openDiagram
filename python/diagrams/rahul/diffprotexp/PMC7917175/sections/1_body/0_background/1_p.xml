<p id="Par32">Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a lethal malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of only ~ 10% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is the 7th leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and accounted for 4.5% of cancer deaths worldwide in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since localized pancreatic cancer is largely asymptomatic in the early stages, &gt; 80% of the patients are typically diagnosed in the advanced or metastatic phase, rendering surgical intervention impossible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the patients that undergo complete tumor resection often present with local or distant recurrence within 2 years of operation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other therapeutic strategies, such as combination chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors also have limited efficacy due to intrinsic chemo- and immune- resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, tumor vaccines targeting the ganglioside GD2 and CA-199/KLH have been successful in mitigating PAAD progression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although these vaccines provided a survival benefit of only several months, the results are encouraging enough to explore the potential of PAAD-related vaccines.

 <caption> AS in LF1 distinguishes CA1 and CA3 subfields. a Bar-plot summarizing the proportion of down- and upregulated genes in CA1 versus CA3 that are annotated transcription factors. Among 298 upregulated genes, the overlap with transcription factors ( n = 27) was statistically significant ( p = 0.00844, hypergeometric test). b Heatmap showing normalized read counts of the upregulated transcription factors (rows) for each sample (columns). Each sample is annotated according to region and area (horizontal bars above heatmap). The final number in name indicates the replicate number. c Enrichment map 74 for GO, REACTOME and KEGG functional categories of genes from the top AS events with the largest absolute LF1 loading. Node size is proportional to the number of genes associated with the GO category, and edge width is proportional to the number of genes shared between GO categories. d Overlap of AS events mapped to extracellular regions for each latent factor ( p = 4.43 × 10 −3, two-sided Fisher’s exact test). e Heatmap showing the percent spliced-in (PSI) values of top AS events from LF1. These events include pairs of mutually exclusive cassette exons in Gria1 and Gria2 (rows), which are differentially spliced between CA1 and CA3 regions (compare left CA3 cluster with right clusters). Row names consist of gene name and VAST-TOOLS event IDs. Sample naming is as in Fig. 2b. </caption>

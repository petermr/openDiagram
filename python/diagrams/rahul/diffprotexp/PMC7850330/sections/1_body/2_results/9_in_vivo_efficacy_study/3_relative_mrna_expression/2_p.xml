The Nasal mucosa relative mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1 and TGF-β was significantly increased in positive control group (II) after induction of nasal mucosa inflammation relative to the negative control (I) (

However, after treatment by placebo (III), the relative expression at the end of experiment showed no relative increase or decrease in the marker’s expression in comparison to the positive control (II). Instead, after treatment with the conventional emulsion co-loaded with loratadine and sulpiride (IV), the nasal mucosa relative mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1and TGF-β was significantly reduced relative to the positive control (II). However, nasal mucosa relative mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1and TGF-β in the group treated with the nanoemulsion formulation, F3 (V) displayed a further and highly significant decrease relative to the positive control (

<p>It is known that for most cancers with solid tumors the genes in the above mentioned “target pathways” display somatic mutations and change their protein products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] . In all human tumors, PI3K is known to be as one of the most frequently targeted pathways. Mutation in PI3K pathway components contributes up to 30% of all human cancer and is known to be activated by RAS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is interesting to know that PI3K is a regulatory subunit, which binds to cell-surface receptors and to the RAS protein. Genes and proteins in PI3K and RAS have been investigated as therapeutic targets for many cancers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Here this purely quantitative analysis of the existing protein expression data of three different cancers also reveals the significant alteration of the proteins in PI3K and RAS pathways. Our findings are consistent with this and suggest that continued future efforts be made in this direction.

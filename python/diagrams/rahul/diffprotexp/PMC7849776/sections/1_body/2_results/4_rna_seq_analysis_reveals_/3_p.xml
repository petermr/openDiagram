<p>Genes related to nickel cation binding were highly represented among the upregulated genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(c</xref>)). Along with others, this category included the genes involved in urease operon. Urease is essential for maintaining pH homeostasis in bacteria and upregulated in response to environmental changes, including acidic stress and urea and nitrogen depletion [
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since urease is a nickel metalloenzyme [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], nickel import is essential for urease function. Consistent with this, 
 <italic>nixA</italic> encoding a nickel transporter, a putative urea transporter SAUSA300_2237, and SAUSA300_0231, encoding ABC transporter involved in nickel transport, were highly upregulated (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, YjbH might be necessary for pH homeostasis during acidic stress in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. These results suggested that YjbH is responsible for pleiotropic phenotypes in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, possibly by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of genes from diverse pathways and by the accumulation of Spx.

0: The striatum plays an important role in a wide range of neurological disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, Huntingtons and Parkinsons disease, and drug addiction [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
1: Substance abuse is one of several neurological diseases that involves specific cell types in the brain.
2: For example, psychostimulants such as cocaine block the reuptake of dopamine leading to increased synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitter.
3: Subsequently, this leads to aberrant signaling in specific sub-types of the -aminobutyric acid producing (GABAergic) medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) that comprise 95% of the neurons of the striatum [ 5, 7].
4: Although morphologically similar, there are two large sub-types of striatal MSNs that differ in their projection patterns as well as in their expression of D1- or D2-classes of dopamine receptors [ 8].
5: Although the direct pathway dMSNs express relatively high levels of the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R), indirect pathway iMSNs express high levels of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) [ 8].
6: D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are differentially coupled to either increased or decreased cAMP signaling, respectively.
7: Thus, exposure to psychostimulants results in opposite patterns of phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase of important intracellular targets such as DARPP-32 in intermixed sub-populations of MSNs [ 9].
8: Biochemical analysis of striatum, in the absence of separation of different MSN cell types, leads to an averaging of the increased or decreased signals, and a loss of important information [ 10, 11].

<p>In urine samples, we used Blast2Go and clusterProfiler software to analyze differentially expressed proteins with human as the background library, followed by GO annotations, including BP, CC, and MF (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(c)</xref>). The results of the BP analysis were similar to those for the serum samples, which are consistent with changes in DNA replication and chromosome assembly, and they verify the rapid infinite value added by cancer cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>). However, in CC and MF analyses, urine samples still exhibited changes different from serum. In the CC analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>), the result of urine analysis differed from the serum result, mainly reflecting the fact that in the urine, the vesicle lumens changed significantly in the lung cancer group. In the MF analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(c)</xref>), changes in histone binding and protein heteromerization were consistent with the results in the serum.

<p>The influence of miRNA expression on mRNA–lncRNA crosstalk has been studied in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), comparing two intrinsic subtypes and identifying the “loss” of miR-186-mediated PVT1–mRNA and miR-26b-mediated LINC00240–mRNA crosstalk [
 <xref rid="B151-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] as driver events of ESCC development. The loss of connectivity in ESCC with respect to normal tissue led to the identification of two lncRNAs whose functional relevance has been experimentally validated [

The ceRNA concept has also been central in the analysis of tumour vs. normal co-expression networks in breast cancer, leading to the identification of the lncRNA AC145110.1 that significantly changes its interactions with 127 mRNAs involved in cell growth [

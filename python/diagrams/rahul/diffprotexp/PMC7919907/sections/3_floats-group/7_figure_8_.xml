 <caption>
  <p>Structures of BLF, HLF, and the docking model of heparin dp4 with bovine lactoferricin. (A) Surface electrostatics of BLF (PDB: 1BLF). (B) Surface electrostatics of HLF (PDB: 1LFI). (C) Sequence alignment of the positively charged N-terminal domain of BLF and HLF. (D) Docking model of heparin dp4 with bovine lactoferricin (PDB: 1LFC). The heparin dp4 structure was from PDB 5E9C. (E) Surface view of the docking model of heparin dp4 with bovine lactoferricin. Docking was performed using AutoDock Vina and figures were generated using PyMOL. (F) Proposed antiviral mechanism of LF. The figure was created with BioRender.com.</p>

0: PrP cis associated with heterologous biological processes.
1: In the last few years, various reports have indicated the involvement of PrP c in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
2: Besides this, an effect of PrP c on glycolysis was suggested in several earlier studies [ 6, 7, 8].
3: A recent metabolomic analysis demonstrated reduced glycolysis and glucose utilization in the hippocampus and the cortex of prion-diseased mice [ 2].
4: Moreover, major alternations in mitochondrial metabolism were identified in the brain of sporadic CreutzfeldtJakob disease (sCJD) patients [ 9], which may be a consequence of PrP c loss of function.

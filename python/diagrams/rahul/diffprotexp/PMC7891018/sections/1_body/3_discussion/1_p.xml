<p id="Par39">To date, many researchers have applied proteomics to study whole-cell proteomics during infection with influenza viruses such as H5N1, H3N2, and H1N1. However, we believe that compared with whole-cell proteomics, subcellular proteomics is more capable of identifying early diagnostic markers of influenza virus infection and is more conducive to the analysis of disease-related proteins and observation of the dynamic process of host cell infection with the virus. IAV can induce apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the apoptotic pathway occurs in mitochondria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To study the effect of infection with two different subtypes of influenza virus on the mitochondrial proteome, there is no need to set a blank control. We performed subcellular mitochondrial proteomic analysis of A549 cells infected with H5 and H9 subtype avian influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To better study the process of viral infection of the host, we chose the 24Â h time point to study the mitochondrial protein differences by two viruses with different pathogenicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

<p>Another evaluated curve was at a cooling rate of 0.5 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. We can observe that the initial temperature of martensite formation had a lower value, namely 292 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). With enough increase in the dilatation curve, a small dilatation change was also observed at 480 °C, which represents the beginning of the bainite transformation. According to the dilatation curve, the resulting microstructure is again martensitic with a very low bainite content (

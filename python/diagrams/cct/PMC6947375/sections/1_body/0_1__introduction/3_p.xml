<p>Several spheroidization annealing processes have been conducted to improve the work hardening ability of hypereutectoid steels, including isothermal spheroidization [

 <xref rid="B11-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and cyclic heat treatments [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many factors, such as the history of heat treatment [

 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], can influence the effect of spheroidization annealing. It was reported that the mean diameter of cementite particles could be reduced by suppressing the precipitation of grain boundary cementite and decreasing the pearlite interlamellar spacing of hot rolled steels [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Initial fine pearlite microstructure induces faster spheroidization, and the difference between coarse and fine pearlite microstructures arises from the higher defect density present in the latest [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, the martensitic and bainitic microstructures spheroidize more rapidly than pearlite because the solute carbon distribution is more homogeneous in martensite and bainite, and the diffusion distances needed to form globular carbides are relatively short as compared to the diffusion distances in pearlite [

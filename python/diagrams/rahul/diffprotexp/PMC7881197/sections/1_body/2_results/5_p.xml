<p id="Par39">The genes in MCF7 cells, whose mRNA levels increased or decreased (|log
 <sub>2</sub>fold-change|&gt; 1, p value &lt; 0.05; n = 2815 and 2482) as a result of AS6 treatment were subjected to GO and PPI analyses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–D). We observed some common pathways affected by AS6 between HUMEC and MCF7 cells including membrane trafficking and stress response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>A). On the other hand, unfolded protein response, exocytosis, apoptosis, hypoxia response, and ER stress response pathways were uniquely and significantly increased in MCF7 cells but not in HUMEC (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D–G, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–D). Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>C summarize the PPI network of those genes that were increased, compared to the untreated control. Strikingly, the genes downregulated upon AS6 treatment (n = 2482) greatly affected the cell cycle including mitotic nuclear division, cell division, cell cycle processes, microtubule-based processes, and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase transition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C,D). Other categories are closely related to cell growth and the cell cycle included DNA repair, telomere organization, the centrosome cycle, and regulation of chromosome organization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C,D). PPI analysis intriguingly showed the close relationship of downregulated protein-coding genes for the cell cycle progression/cell growth and genome integrity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>D). These results suggested that AS6 inhibits the cell cycle progression at the level of gene expression, resulting in the reduced cell viability as shown in the cytotoxicity analyses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B,C). Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarize and compare the pathways and representative protein-coding genes differentially affected by AS6 with statistical significance in HUMEC and MCF7 cells.

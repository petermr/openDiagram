<p>Recently, Li‐S batteries have achieved great prospect for their high theoretical specific capacity (1672 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>), which is a magnitude higher than that of the lithiated transition‐metal oxide and phosphate cathode materials used in the state‐of‐the‐art commercial Li‐ion battery.

The application of the all‐solid‐state composite electrolyte seems an effective way to address the above issue.

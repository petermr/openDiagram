<p id="Par33">MCF7 cells were grown in 6 well plates for Western blots and were washed with cold PBS twice and scraped in RIPA buffer (Cell signaling, USA). Protein concentration in each sample was measured through Bradford assay using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad, USA) and spectrophotometry at 595 nm (BMG Labtech, Germany). From the measured protein concentration, a total of 20 µg of proteins per sample was loaded on 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). After blocking with 4–5% skim milk (MBcell, South Korea) in TBST including 25 mM Tris (Sigma, USA), 140 mM NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma, USA), the membrane was probed with indicated primary antibodies. Anti-BUB1B (A300-386A) and anti-BRCA1 (A300-000A) antibodies were purchased from Bethyl laboratories (USA); anti-PLK1 (sc-17783), anti-CDC25A (sc-7389), anti-CDC20 (sc-13162), anti-CHEK1 (sc-8408), anti-CDKN1A (sc-6246), anti-HSP90 (sc-69703) and anti-HSP70 (sc-32239) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA); anti-CCNB1 (#4135) and anti-HIF1α (#14179) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA); anti-ATM (ab78) and anti-MCM4 (ab4459) antibodies were purchased from Abcam; anti-ACTA1 (ACTIN, MAB1501) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). Antibodies were validated for Western blotting by the manufacturers. Antibody were diluted to 1:300–1:2000 in blocking solution for usage as recommended by the manufacturers. For protein detection, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated mouse and rabbit secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076S and 7074S) and signals were detected with EzWestLumi Plus or Western blotting Luminol Reagent (ATTO, WSE-7120L, Japan; sc-2048, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Image J software (National Institute of Health, USA) was used to measure the band intensity of immunoblotting.</p>

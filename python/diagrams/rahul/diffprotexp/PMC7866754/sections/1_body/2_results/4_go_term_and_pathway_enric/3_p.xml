<p id="Par45">For KEGG pathway enrichment, a less stringent cut-off was chosen because otherwise no pathways could pass the filter, which still returned very few enriched pathways (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, the gene set in salivary gland sporozoite is enriched in the pathway for the biosynthesis of an antibiotic, puromycin, where the genes involved in this pathway are all alpha/beta hydrolases. Of particular interest is the BEM 46-like protein, which was shown to modulate the development of sporozoites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and, therefore the associated novel peptides may play a role in the modulation as well.

Up to now, some mechanisms involved in host&#x02013;BVDV interaction are still not fully understood. The discovery of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has provided a new perspective on gene regulation in diverse biological contexts, particularly in viral infection and host immune responses. However, little is known about the profiles and functions of lncRNAs in host cells in response to BVDV infection. Here, we utilized Illumina sequencing to explore lncRNAs profiles in cytopathic (CP) biotype BVDV-infected MDBK cells to further reveal the potential roles of lncRNAs in BVDV infection and host&#x02013;BVDV interaction with integrated analysis of lncRNAs and mRNA expression profiles. A total of 1747 significantly differentially expressed genes, DEGs (156 lncRNAs and 1591 mRNAs) were obtained via RNA-seq in BVDV-infected MDBK cells compared to mock-infected cells. Next, these DE lncRNAs and mRNAs were subjected to construct lncRNAs-mRNAs co-expression network followed by the prediction of potential functions of the DE lncRNAs. Co-expression network analysis elucidated that DE lncRNAs were significant enrichment in NOD-like receptor, TNF, NF-&#x00138;B, ErbB, Ras, apoptosis, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, indicating that DE lncRNAs play important roles in host&#x02013;BVDV interactions. Our data give an overview of changes in transcriptome and potential roles of lncRNAs, providing molecular biology basis for further exploring the mechanisms of host&#x02013;BVDV interaction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>CP biotype BVDV</kwd><kwd>long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)</kwd><kwd>co-expression networks</kwd><kwd>functional enrichment</kwd><kwd>signaling pathway</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001" disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD) caused by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the most important bovine infectious diseases and is found in many cattle-producing countries worldwide. BVDV is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 12.3 to 12.5 kb, similar to classical swine fever virus and border disease virus, belonging to the genus <italic>Pestivirus</italic>, family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. BVDV infection seriously affects respiratory system and digestive system of cattle, thereby compromising the production performance of the herd. The most serious hazard of this disease is the formation of persistent infection (PI) in fetal cattle infected with BVDV during pregnancy, which can cause immune tolerance in cattle [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, PI cattle continuously excrete large amounts of viruses throughout their life process, causing BVDV to spread among the herd for a long time, making it extremely difficult to eliminate, which has resulted in large economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>According to the cytopathic effect (CPE) of BVDV-infected cells, BVDV is divided into two biotypes, cytopathic (CP) biotype, and non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among them, the CP or NCP biotype BVDV strains are divided into BVDV-1, BVDV-2, and atypical BVDV genotypes based on the viral sequence variation with an amino acid homology of approximately 85% [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>]. Epidemiological investigations have showed that these BVDV biotypes and genotypes are widespread in countries and regions with developed cattle husbandry [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In North American, the positive rate of BVDV infection is approximately 9.72&#x02013;26.53%, while in Europe, the rate is 40.82&#x02013;53.47% [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. China has one of the highest BVDV infection rates, with over 46.7% of cattle farms testing positive for the presence of BVDV with a PI rate of approximately 2.2% in the herds [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, an analysis for the epidemiological investigation data of BVDV infection from the major cattle-rearing provinces in China showed that the overall BVDV positive rate was 58.09%, testing for the presence of BVDV-specific antibodies using ELISA [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These findings indicate the serious hazard posed by BVDV to the development of the cattle industry in China.</p><p>In addition to cattle, BVDV can also infect sheep, pigs, deer, and other wild animals [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>]. Although there is currently no effective cure for the disease caused by CP biotype BVDV infection in animals, existing BVDV vaccines contribute to effectively preventing the disease epidemic [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, vaccinated and naturally infected animals cannot be effectively distinguished by serological methods. The identification and elimination of PI livestock to prevent the spread of BVDV is the most widely used strategy today. However, this inevitably results in important economic losses for the farms due to the need to detect and remove PI animals, and underdeveloped countries and regions cannot bear such heavy costs. Thus, the elucidation of the mechanism of BVDV infection and host immune responses is crucial to characterize the pathogenesis of BVDV and to develop vaccines with which to control BVDV infection.</p><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA with a length of over 200 nucleotides (nt). They are located in the cytoplasm or nucleus and play an important role in biological activities and disease development by regulating target genes, thereby affecting gene expression [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although a recent study reported that certain lncRNAs are able to encode small peptides [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], lncRNAs generally lack an efficient open reading frame, such that they do not perform a protein-coding function. LncRNAs tend to fold into thermodynamically stable secondary or higher-order structures that provide multiple sites within the molecule for the binding of proteins. Specific and dynamic interactions can also occur between DNA and RNA through the principle of base-complementary pairing. Some lncRNAs could be cleaved into polyA tails and promoter structures similar to mRNA and are dynamically expressed during tissue organ differentiation [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] followed by formation of a complex and precise gene expression regulatory networks. Many studies have reported the functional activities of lncRNAs in the innate immune system [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], adaptive immunity [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the tumor development process [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and in several human diseases [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Current research indicates that lncRNAs are a key regulator of viral infection and host immune responses involved in host&#x02013;virus interaction [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the profiles and functional activities of lncRNAs in host cells in response to BVDV infection have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>Here, Illumina sequencing was employed to explore the different expression profiles of lncRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells for further investigating the roles of lncRNAs in BVDV infection and host&#x02013;BVDV interaction. The potential functions of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted by lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, which would provide a molecular biology basis for further understanding the roles of lncRNAs in host&#x02013;BVDV interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s0002" disp-level="1"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001" disp-level="2"><title>Cell and virus</title><p>Bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were cultured with high-glucose medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA) at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

The purity, concentration, and integrity of the total RNA was evaluated using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) value of &#x0003e;9.7 and optical density 260:280 ratio of &#x0003e;2.0 were selected for library construction and deep sequencing. For the construction of lncRNA libraries, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) were removed from the total RNA extractions using Ribo-zero TM rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). The enriched messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and ncRNAs were fragmented into cDNA using random primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). With the synthetization of second-strand cDNA, the cDNA fragments were purified by QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) before adding the end-repaired poly (A), and then ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. Subsequently, the second-strand cDNAs were digested by uracil-N-glycosylase, and the digested products were size-selected using agarose gel electrophoresis followed by PCR amplification. Gene sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq<sup>TM</sup> 4000 and bioinformatics analysis was supported by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). The protocol for the transcript analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(a</xref>). Briefly, after filtering the off-machine raw data, clean reads were obtained followed by alignment to the reference genome; Next, use Cufflinks to reconstruct transcripts to obtain the known transcripts and the new transcripts; Next, use CPC, CNCI and other software to predict the coding ability of the new transcripts to obtain the newly predicted lncRNAs; And then, perform analysis of the mRNAs and lncRNAs, respectively; Finally, perform the association analysis of lncRNAs-mRNAs. All raw sequence reads were deposited into the NCBI database as a BioProject (accession no.

And, fisher&#x02019;s exact test and chi-square test were used to determine the significance of the GO terms and pathways. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated to correct the P-value, and only the GO terms and pathways with an adjusted P-value of &#x002c2;0.05 and an FDR &#x0003c;0.05 were selected.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2004" disp-level="2"><title>LncRNA-mRNA association analysis</title><p>LncRNAs are involved in many post-transcriptional regulation processes, where some anti-sense lncRNAs may regulate gene silencing, transcription, and mRNA stability. In order to reveal the interactions between antisense lncRNAs and mRNAs, RNAplex software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAplex.1.html">http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAplex.1.html</ext-link>) was used to predict the complementary correlation of antisense lncRNAs and mRNAs. One of functions of lncRNAs is the cis-regulation of neighboring genes on the same allele. The up-stream lncRNAs that intersect with the promoter or other cis-elements may regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. The downstream or 3&#x002b9;UTR region lncRNAs may have other regulatory functions. For lncRNA cis-regulation analysis, the lncRNAs that had been annotated previously as &#x0201c;unknown region&#x0201d; were annotated again. LncRNAs found less than 100 kb up- or down-stream of a gene were likely to be cis-regulators. The cis target genes were then subjected to enrichment analysis of GO functions and KEGG pathways. For lncRNA trans-regulation of co-expressed gene analysis, which is another function of lncRNAs, the correlation of expression between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes was analyzed to identify the target genes of lncRNAs. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for samples &#x02265;6 and protein-coding genes with absolute correlation &#x0003e;0.9 were then subjected to enrichment analysis of GO functions and KEGG pathways. The enrichment analysis of the GO functions and KEGG pathways were then conducted in protein-coding genes in the network.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2005" disp-level="2"><title>Validation of selected lncRNAs and mRNAs by qPCR</title><p>To validate the accuracy of the Illumina sequencing data, thirteen DE mRNAs, and eight DE lncRNAs were selected at random and examined by RT-qPCR assay with SYBR Green Master (Takara, Dalian, China) on a 7500 real-time PCR system (ABI, USA). PCR primers were designed according to the target mRNAs and lncRNAs using Oligo 7.0 software, whose specificity was evaluated by BLAST analysis and smelting curve analysis of amplicons, and only the primers can be used until amplification efficiency reached 90&#x02013;110%.

Although great progress has been made in the research of BVDV in recent decades and several signaling pathways closely related to BVDV infection have been reported [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref>], the infection and pathogenesis of BVDV are so extremely complex that the relevant mechanisms have yet to be comprehensively characterized. In recent years, lncRNAs have been found to play an important role in regulating viral infection and host immune responses involved in host&#x02013;virus interaction. However, the profiles and functional activities of lncRNAs in host cells in response to BVDV infection have not been elucidated. In this study, we determined the changes in the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells. As a result, differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, providing a new perspective on gene regulation in the host&#x02013;BVDV interactions. Moreover, the expression changes of randomly selected DE lncRNAs and DE mRNAs were confirmed by qPCR assay, indicating the reliability of the Illumina sequencing results.</p><p>The metabolism can provide energy and materials required for all biological processes, such that the balance between catabolic and anabolic pathways is essential to meet various biological needs of living organisms [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that obtain all energy and materials necessary for infection and replication in hosts. Generally, viruses can generate their own suitable intracellular microenvironment for their viral life cycle by altering the host&#x02019;s cellular metabolic network [<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. By analyzing the DEGs, we found that the levels of IGF1R, ACLY, HMGCR, HMGCS1, ACSS2, INSIG1, and LPIN1 genes were significantly up-regulated during the BVDV life cycle. The IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) binds with highest affinity to the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), while ligand binding, in turn, regulates gene transcription, as well as the glucose, lipid, and protein metabolisms, in addition to cell growth and differentiation [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The ACLY gene is related to intramuscular fat deposition in cattle, which is of great significance for improving the quality of breeding beef [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. HMGCR, HMGCS1, and ACSS2 are mainly associated with improved growth performance and meat quality [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;41</xref>]. The lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase (LPIN), also known as the lipoprotein gene, is a family of genes that can bidirectionally regulate the fat metabolism [<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. LPIN1 is a key gene for regulating the formation and differentiation of adipose tissue, and studies have shown that non-expression, normal expression, and over-expression of the LPIN1 gene can cause dramatic changes in fat deposition [<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. INSIG, SCAP, and SREBPs together constitute the INSIG-SCAP-SREBPs transfer system, which is stored in the form of complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum. Intracellular cholesterol can affect the activation of the INSIG-SCAP-SREBPs, which in turn regulates the transcription of low-density lipoprotein receptors. Ultimately, feedback regulates the cellular intake of exogenous cholesterol [<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Significantly, these up-regulated genes are mainly related to the lipid metabolism, indicating that BVDV may alter the host lipid metabolism to promote self-survival during BVDV life cycle. Further investigation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> will be required to confirm these findings.</p><p>In this study, 156 significantly DE lncRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells were obtained, including 72 up-regulated lncRNAs and 84 down-regulated lncRNAs. We found that the location of the lncRNAs in the genome appeared to be nonrandom, indicating a link between lncRNA function and genomic location. Using RNA interference, a previous study found that a group of human lncRNAs act as enhancers to activate their adjacent genes, such as SCL, SNA1, and SNA2 by cis action [<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], demonstrating the co-expression relationship between lncRNA and its nearby protein-coding genes. Other findings have reported that the lncRNA-mediated cis-regulation of adjacent gene transcription is ubiquitous and a major mode in gene regulation of mammalian [<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the cis-regulation of lncRNA is crucial to reveal the biological significance of lncRNAs. In this study, several lncRNAs (LOC112443855, LOC112448807, LOC100847453, and LOC101904128, among others) were identified in cis-regulation with apoptosis-related protein-coding genes during BVDV infection. Autophagy is also a crucial mechanism in host resistance to infection, and several studies have reported that BVDV infection significantly increased cellular autophagy in MDBK cells [<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our Illumina sequencing data also demonstrated that some lncRNAs targeted autophagy-related genes ATG4D, ATG16L1, ATG16L2, and ATG5. Moreover, lncRNA provides more complexity for gene regulatory networks and some lncRNAs function through trans-acting, such as LOC107132573. We also found that the expression levels of several lncRNAs were significantly increased in BVDV-infected MDBK cells, including LOC101902030, LOC107132820, LOC107131785, LOC101905509, and LOC104972797. Moreover, their target protein-coding genes were MRPL14, ESPNL, GABPB1, KIAA0895L, and RIMS2, which were located in trans-position (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).<table-wrap id="t0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Prediction results of trans-target genes</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col width="1*" align="left"/><col width="1*" align="left"/><col width="1*" align="center"/><col width="1*" align="center"/><col width="1*" align="center"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left">mRNAs<hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="center">mRNAs<hr/></th><th align="center">&#x000a0;</th></tr><tr><th align="center">lncRNA_id</th><th align="center">pos_cor_id</th><th align="center">pos_cor</th><th align="center">neg_cor_id</th><th align="center">neg_cor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">XR_808337.3</td><td align="left">XM_024983717.1</td><td align="center">0.992696064</td><td align="center">XM_024994909.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.998651441</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_237807.3</td><td align="left">XM_024983720.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001077128.2</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.989386992</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_001501504.2</td><td align="left">XM_024983720.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001077128.2</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.989386992</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003032689.1</td><td align="left">XM_024983720.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001077128.2</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.989386992</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003031215.1</td><td align="left">XM_024983721.1</td><td align="center">0.998164806</td><td align="center">XM_010817975.3</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.990428328</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003029770.1</td><td align="left">XM_005204988.4</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001014887.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.994701364</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003034054.1</td><td align="left">XM_005204988.4</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001014887.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.994701364</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003031220.1</td><td align="left">XM_005204988.4</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001014887.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.994701364</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003030419.1</td><td align="left">XM_015467281.2</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001014887.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.994701364</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_001501114.2</td><td align="left">XM_015467281.3</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001014887.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.994701364</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_001501115.2</td><td align="left">XM_024997551.1</td><td align="center">0.997605551</td><td align="center">NM_001101148.2</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.994808587</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003032366.1</td><td align="left">XM_024997554.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">XM_002691498.5</td><td align="center">&#x02212;1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_236338.4</td><td align="left">XM_024997554.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">XM_002691498.5</td><td align="center">&#x02212;1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003037170.1</td><td align="left">XM_024997554.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">XM_002691498.5</td><td align="center">&#x02212;1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_233741.4</td><td align="left">XM_024997554.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">XM_002691498.5</td><td align="center">&#x02212;1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_001498511.2</td><td align="left">XM_024978143.1</td><td align="center">0.999999308</td><td align="center">XM_005209141.4</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.984748151</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_003029635.1</td><td align="left">XM_025001654.1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">NM_001046128.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.977564113</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XR_807447.3</td><td align="left">XM_025001664.1</td><td align="center">0.999992755</td><td align="center">XM_024983362.1</td><td align="center">&#x02212;0.985930072</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tfn0001"><p>lncRNA_id: ID of long non-coding RNA.</p></fn><fn id="tfn0002"><p>pos_cor_id: the co-expressed gene id of the largest positive correlation.</p></fn><fn id="tfn0003"><p>pos_cor: the coefficient of the largest positive correlation.</p></fn><fn id="tfn0004"><p>neg_cor_id: the co-expressed gene id with the largest negative correlation.</p></fn><fn id="tfn0005"><p>neg_cor: the coefficient of the largest negative correlation.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
</p><p>KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for DEGs could help to understand the signal transduction pathways that are activated or inhibited in host cells after BVDV infection and provide insights into the interactions between BVDV and its host. Our Illumina sequencing analysis of the alterations in gene expression of BVDV-stimulated MDBK cells provided important data on the specific aspects of molecular pathogenesis and virus&#x02013;host interactions. Previous study has shown that BVDV strain NADL-infected MDBK cells were significantly enriched for target genes of lncRNAs that were involved in host immune responses, such as T cell receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and Jak-STAT signaling pathway [<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which were also found the enrichment of these target genes in the related pathways in our study. Moreover, in this study, we also found that many differentially expressed genes in cytopathic biotype BVDV-infected MDBK cells showed significant enrichment in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, and apoptosis pathway. All of these signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of MDBK cells stimulated by BVDV, providing useful data for the development of novel preventive or therapeutic strategies against BVDV. We also found that the significantly DE cis-and trans-acting lncRNAs contributed to regulation of autophagy signaling pathway, cytokine&#x02013;cytokine receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway associated with the host immune response to BVDV infection. Undoubtedly, the transcriptome data obtained by RNA-seq will help us better understand the molecular mechanism of BVDV infection and host immune responses involved in host&#x02013;virus interaction. Several DEGs detected in BVDV-infected MDBK cells were novel, alternative splicing isoforms, or related to signaling pathways. The expression of virus resistance genes could be part of the mechanisms by which BVDV escapes from the host immune defense system. Our data would provide a useful scientific reference for improving our understanding of the roles of host lncRNAs in the modulation of BVDV replication and pathogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, we profiled the changes in expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was used to identify all the DE mRNAs and lncRNAs. The analysis of BVDV-infected MDBK cells with comprehensive molecular data provided an insight into the roles of lncRNAs in BVDV infection and host immune responses involved in host&#x02013;virus interaction. Moreover, further research is under way to investigate the functions of the DE lncRNAs to explore the mechanisms of BVDV infection and its pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM0629"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_1857572_SM0629.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Guangzhou Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China for the gene sequencing, and the support of bioinformatics analysis, and data uploading.</p></ack><sec id="s0006" disp-level="1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><sec id="s0007" disp-level="1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplemental data for this article can be accessed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2020.1857572">here</ext-link>.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Abe</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Tamura</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Torii</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, et al</person-group>

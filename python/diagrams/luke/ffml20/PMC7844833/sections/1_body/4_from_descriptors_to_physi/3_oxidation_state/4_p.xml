<p>While following the absorption edge position is a convenient tool for qualitatively tracking the changes in the oxidation state, one needs to be careful when applying this approach for quantitative analysis. As discussed in

  <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="other">4.1</xref>
 </xref>, the term “absorption edge position” does not have an unambiguous definition, and different authors use different conventions. One needs to pay especial attention when materials with very different structures are analyzed. For example, for nanostructured materials with different particle sizes, minor shifts of the absorption edge can be difficult to interpret because the particle size plays an important role in determining the edge position. In particular, for NPs, the increase in the Fermi level energy and the increase in the electronic screening lead to blue and red shifts of the X-ray absorption edge, respectively.

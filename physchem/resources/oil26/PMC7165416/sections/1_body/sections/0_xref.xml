<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), and, using site-directed mutagenesis, generated mutants containing derived substitutions. For the degu, hamster, and jerboa, differences in spectral sensitivity between the expressed derived and respective ancestral proteins could be explained by observed substitutions at known critical sites (Y277F, T285A, and A308S). In contrast, the gerbil and elephant-shrew were each characterized by an amino acid substitution at a single critical site (T285A and A308S, respectively). Introducing these residues into the ancestral proteins did not recover the recorded &#955;

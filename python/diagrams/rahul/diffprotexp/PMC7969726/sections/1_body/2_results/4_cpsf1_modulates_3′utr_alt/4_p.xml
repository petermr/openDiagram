<p>To test the correlation between transcript alteration and APA, we combined the analyses of altered mRNA levels and PDUI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Upon depletion, we found that 15 transcripts were filtered with both altered mRNA expression and PDUI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C–E</xref>), including four lengthened (REEP5, ZNF271P, TUBA1A, and MED29) and 11 shortened transcripts. Interestingly, in the 3′ UTR shortened transcripts, three upregulated and eight downregulated transcripts were observed, while 3′ UTR lengthening was upregulated. These included 13 protein-coding and two non-coding transcripts (ZNF271P and ARL6IP6) that were separated into three functions: gene transcription, endomembrane system, and cytoskeleton maintenance (

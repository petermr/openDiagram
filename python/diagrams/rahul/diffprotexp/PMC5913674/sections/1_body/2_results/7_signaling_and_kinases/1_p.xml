<p>Proteins involved in signaling, predominantly kinases, were particularly enriched in WB-MtzR (30 DEPs), which were also detected in protein–protein interaction networks (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). A total of 12 such DEPs were detected in 106-MtzR, of which 5 were shared with WB (6700, 113 456, 17 069, 17 622, 3957), and 1 was shared between 106 and 713-MtzR (3677). The majority of differentially expressed kinases belonged to the uniquely expanded NEK kinase family in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>, with 16, 10, and 2 NEK kinases in WB, 106, and 713-MtzR lines, respectively. Multiple members of the NEK kinase family in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> are missing key catalytic amino acid residues and are predicted not to have catalytic activity [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Seven of the 16 DEP NEKs in WB-MtzR are predicted to lack activity, as are 5/10 in 106-MtzR and 1/2 in 713-MtzR. Interestingly, 4 of the 5 most upregulated NEK kinases in WB-MtzR were considered catalytically inert, as well as the most upregulated NEK in 106-MtzR.

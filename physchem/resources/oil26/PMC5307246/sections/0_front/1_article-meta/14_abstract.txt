0: The chemical composition, main physicochemical properties, and nutritional value of seed flour and seed oil of   Lannea kerstingii were studied.
1: The results indicated that seeds contained 3.61% moisture, 57.85% fat, 26.39% protein, 10.07% carbohydrates, and 2.08% ash.
2: Potassium was the predominant mineral, followed by magnesium and calcium.
3: The essential amino acids were at higher levels than the estimated amino acid requirements of FAO/WHO/UNU except for lysine.
4: Fatty acid composition showed that oleic acid was the major fatty acid, followed by palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acids.
5: Physicochemical properties of the seed oil were melting point, 19.67C; refractive index (25C), 1.47; iodine value, 60.72/100 g of oil; peroxide value, 0.99 meq.
6: O  2/kg of oil;   p-anisidine value, 0.08; total oxidation (TOTOX) value, 2.06; oxidative stability index (120C), 52.53 h; free fatty acids, 0.39%; acid value, 0.64 mg of KOH/g of oil; saponification value, 189.73.
7: Total amount of tocopherols, carotenoids, and sterols was 578.60, 4.60, and 929.50 mg/kg of oil, respectively.
8: -Tocopherol (82%), lutein (80%), and   -sitosterol (93%) were the most abundant forms of tocopherols, carotenoids, and sterols, respectively.
9: Seeds of   L. kerstingii constitute an alternative source of stable vegetable oil and protein for nutritional and industrial applications.

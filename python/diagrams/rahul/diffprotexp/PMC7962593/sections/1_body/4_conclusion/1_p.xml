<p>The present study demonstrated heightened metabolic response and suppressed immune response in patients with sepsis and septic shock. The nine key genes that we identified may be useful for diagnosing sepsis and monitoring its development, while their specific functions and mechanisms in the disease need further study. Indeed, further experimental analysis is needed to validate our major results.</p>

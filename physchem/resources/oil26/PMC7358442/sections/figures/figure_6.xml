  <p>Pictogram illustrating the interplay of different factors influencing aardvark body temperature and activity 
   <bold>(A)</bold> during a non-drought period with green grass and plenty of prey termites and ants available, aardvarks are active at night and maintain high and stable body temperature rhythms; 
   <bold>(B)</bold> during a drought period with sparse brown grass and few prey insects deep in burrows aardvarks are active during the daytime and display low and variable body temperature rhythms.

 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="polymers-12-02048-sch001">Scheme 1</xref> presents the synthesis route of 2,7-CDA. First, DPNA was prepared from o-aminobiphenyl by nitrification reaction. Second, DPNN
 <sub>3</sub> was synthesized from DPNA by azide reaction. Subsequently, the as-obtained DPNN
 <sub>3</sub> was reacted with decalin to form 2,7-CDN by cyclization reaction, which was then reduced to diamine 2,7-CDA. NMR, FT-IR, mass spectra, and elemental analysis were used to characterize the structures of the diamine and intermediate. The NMR, MS spectra of the intermediates DPNA, DPNN
 <sub>3</sub>, and 2,7-CDN and MS spectrum of 2,7-CDA are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">supporting information Figures S4â€“S7</xref>. The NMR results of 2,7-CDA are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The FT-IR spectra of diamine and intermediate are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S8</xref>. The elemental analysis results are shown in experimental section. All these results were consistent with the proposed molecular structure of diamine and intermediate, confirming the successful synthesis of diamine by the mentioned four-step reactions.

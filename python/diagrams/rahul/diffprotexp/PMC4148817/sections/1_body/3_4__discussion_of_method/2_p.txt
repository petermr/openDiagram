0: Despite its common application, accurate protein quantification by Western blotting remains a challenge.
1: Recently, numerous studies have indicated that protein quantification by MS can be robust, accurate and reproducible, and achieve low limits of detection [ 48].
2: We have published several recent papers where our label-free quantitative mass spectrometry platform has been applied, with and without validation [ 11, 12, 13, 19, 24, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53].

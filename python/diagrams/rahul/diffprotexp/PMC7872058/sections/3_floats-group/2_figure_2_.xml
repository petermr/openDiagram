  <p>a) sTREM1 levels measured in BAL samples from IPA and control (Ctrl) patients and stratified based on TREM1 genotypes of gene polymorphisms (rs2234237 and rs2234246). b) Cytokines levels measured in BAL samples from IPA and control patients and stratified based on TREM1 genotypes (rs2234237, rs2234246). Data are presented as box plots, with the bottom and top of the box indicating the first quartile to the third quartile, respectively. The bar within the box indicate the median value and the whiskers above and below the box show the 10th and the 90th percentiles. The dots indicate outliers. p-values were calculated using the Welch’s t-test. **, p &lt; 0.01; *, p &lt; 0.05</p>

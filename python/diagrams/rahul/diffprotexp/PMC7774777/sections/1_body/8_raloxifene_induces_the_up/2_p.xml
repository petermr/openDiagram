<p>We first established that ERα is expressed in the spinal cord and that no difference in ERα levels is observed between sexes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We then performed an unbiased RNA-seq analysis to compare the effect of the 3 most commonly used SERMs, estrogen, tamoxifen, and raloxifene, on gene expression profiles in the mouse spinal cord. Four C57BL6 female and 4 male mice were treated with subcutaneous injections of either vehicle, estrogen, tamoxifen, or raloxifene (2.5 mg/kg) twice a day over 3 consecutive days (a dosing thereafter referred to as acute treatment). On day 4, the spinal cords were harvested (

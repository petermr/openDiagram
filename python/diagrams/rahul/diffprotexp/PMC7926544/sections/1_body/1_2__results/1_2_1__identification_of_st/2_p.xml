<p>To further confirm these findings, we performed co-localization studies. To this end, immunofluorescence was performed in HEK cells co-expressing Myc-NKCC2 and GFP-STCH proteins. Of note, we have previously demonstrated that N-terminal tagging of NKCC2 with myc does not affect the co-transporter trafficking [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, myc-NKCC2 (red) co-localized with STCH (green) and their immunofluorescence staining pattern seems to be limited to a perinuclear ER-like distribution, which is consistent with STCH binding mainly to the immature and ER resident form of NKCC2. In sum, these findings are in accordance with the results of Y2H and co-immunoprecipitation studies and strongly suggest that NKCC2 and STCH interact mainly at the ER.

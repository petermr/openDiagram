<p id="Par33">RNA expression profiles and related clinical information of the CRC patients were acquired from TCGA database. To identify lncRNAs significantly associated with patient prognosis, we used the R package “survival” to perform Kaplan-Meier curve analysis of DElncRNAs. DElncRNAs with

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], we selected key lncRNAs and lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA interaction pairs to build the ceRNA regulatory network. Ultimately, we combined specific lncRNA–miRNA and miRNA–mRNA pairs to establish a prognosis-related network. The established ceRNA network was visualized using Cytoscape v3.6.0 software [

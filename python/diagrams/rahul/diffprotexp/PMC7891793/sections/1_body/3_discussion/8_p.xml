<p>Comparative GO enrichment analysis of whole lists of differentially expressed genes did not reveal any treatment group-specific terms or pathways except for the regulation of transcription in response to stress that was discussed above. Generally, for all treatment groups GO functions corresponding to the immune system were dominant. That includes B cell activation and differentiation, regulation of B cells and antigen receptor signaling. We demonstrated that virus shedding on day 10 was very low [

ADA and also MFNG and/or CMTM7 genes were involved in these functions. ADA and CMTM7 were discussed before and our result suggested that their differential expression was the result of suppression of the adaptive B cell response and, possibly, other immune functions. MFNG gene encodes O-fucosylpeptide 3-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. This protein is part of notch signaling pathway and it has been demonstrated that, besides B cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], it plays some role in Th cell differentiation and its overexpression may cause enhanced Th1 differentiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Expression of this gene was also lower in lung tissue with lesion and all these results together suggest that adaptive immune functions in this tissue type were either suppressed or the presence of lymphoid cells was lower than in lung tissue without lesion.

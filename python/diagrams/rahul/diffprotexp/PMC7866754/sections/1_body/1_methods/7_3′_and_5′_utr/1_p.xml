<p id="Par24">Unlike other well-characterized genomes, information about the untranslated regions of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is relatively scarce [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], where the majority of research has been focussed on coding sequences only. Therefore, the first attempt to extract 3′ and 5′ UTRs by subtracting coding sequence from the genomic coordinates of mRNAs failed, because they are of equal lengths. BEDtools intersect was combined with length filtering to find MSTRG transcripts with complete overlap with a reference gene, and are also longer than the overlapped gene. These transcripts contain extended region on the 3′ and/or 5′ end outside coding sequence and regarded as UTRs accordingly. The UTRs were then translated into protein sequence to check if any peptides can confirm their translation. Similarly, peptides from UTRs need to be in-frame with the parent reference gene to be considered, otherwise moved to the AltORFs category.

<p>Differentially expressed DIU transcripts were next analyzed for network representation, incorporating protein–protein interaction information. In a result that was consistent with the biological pathway and network enrichment analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f005">Figure 5</xref>), four major networks were identified. These included cell cycle checkpoint, metaphase/anaphase, IFN signaling, and IFN α/β signaling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Noted in the pathway enrichment earlier, a number of well-established antiviral IFNs and IFN regulators are seen, including IFN lambda (IFNL1), OAS, MX1, IFIT1, and IRF-1 and IRF-7 (

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. IRF-1 and IRF-7 are NFκB-inducible transcription factors in epithelial cells that cooperate in the regulation of type I and III IFN production [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Taken together, the pathway and network analysis consistently indicate that the IFN pathway undergoes substantial DIU in response to RSV infection.

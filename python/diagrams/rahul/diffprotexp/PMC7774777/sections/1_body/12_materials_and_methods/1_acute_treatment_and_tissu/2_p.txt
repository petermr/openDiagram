0: Spinal cords were isolated by hydraulic extraction, minced with forceps, and flash frozen for later analysis.
1: Tissue was lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors) on ice with roughly a 1:3 volume to volume ratio of tissue powder to lysis buffer.
2: All samples were subjected to probe sonication (Fisher Scientific FB505) with 2 to 3 rounds of 1-second intervals at 20% amplitude on ice.
3: Protein was then cleared by spinning at 20 800 g at 4C for 20 minutes.
4: The soluble fraction was then moved to a new tube and frozen at 20C for later analysis.

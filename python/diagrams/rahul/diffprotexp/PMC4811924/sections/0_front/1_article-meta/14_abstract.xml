  <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> (
  <italic>S.</italic>suis) is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe diseases in humans and pigs. Biofilms of 
  <italic>S. suis</italic> can induce persistent infections that are difficult to treat. In this study, the effect of tylosin on biofilm formation of 
  <italic>S. suis</italic> was investigated. 1/2 minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 1/4 MIC of tylosin were shown to inhibit 
  <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm formation 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>. By using the iTRAQ strategy, we compared the protein expression profiles of 
  <italic>S. suis</italic> grown with sub-MIC tylosin treatment and with no treatment. A total of 1501 proteins were identified by iTRAQ. Ninety-six differentially expressed proteins were identified (Ratio &gt; Â±1.5, 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Several metabolism proteins (such as phosphoglycerate kinase) and surface proteins (such as ABC transporter proteins) were found to be involved in biofilm formation. Our results indicated that 
  <italic>S. suis</italic> metabolic regulation, cell surface proteins, and virulence proteins appear to be of importance in biofilm growth with sub-MIC tylosin treatment. Thus, our data revealed the rough regulation of biofilm formation that may provide a foundation for future research into mechanisms and targets.

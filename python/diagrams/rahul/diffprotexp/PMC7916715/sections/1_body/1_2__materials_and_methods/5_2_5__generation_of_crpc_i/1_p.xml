<p>Xenografts were generated as previously described. In brief, LNCaP cells (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) in 0.1 mL media were mixed with Matrigel mixture (BD) at 1:1 ratio and implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of NOD/SCID mice (6-week-old males; The Jackson Laboratory). Tumor growth were monitored through palpation and measured twice weekly using calipers. Tumor volume was calculated as V = L × W
 <sup>2</sup> × 0.52 [
 <xref rid="B41-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Tumor progression was monitored by serum PSA levels (PSA kit, Abcam, Toronto, ON, Canada). Surgical castration was performed when tumor reached 100–200 mm
 <sup>3</sup> in size. Serum PSA was determined before and after castration. Resurge in serum PSA indicates CRPC growth.

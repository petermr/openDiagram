0: Tissue dissections from male and female littermates from at least three litters per condition were performed as described above and collected in HBSS, immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at 80C until processed.
1: Samples were lysed in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8, 140 nM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40 and 0.25% Triton with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).
2: After sonication, samples were spun down and the supernatant was used for a BCA Bradford assay using the Spectramax 190 plate reader to assess protein concentration using a standard curve.
3: Twelve or 18 g of protein were run on a 10 or 12% Tris acetate gel using the Mini-PROTEAN system (BioRad).
4: Membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (TBS; LiCor) and probed with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4C.
5: Resolved proteins were visualized in two channels using fluorescent secondary antibodies at 680 and 800 nm on an Odyssey Clx infrared imaging system (LiCor).
6: Specific band intensities for all detected antibodies were quantified using the manufacturers software ImageSoft (LiCor) and normalized to GAPDH loading control.
7: Antibodies used were anti-PAX6 (1:250; cat #PRB-278P-100; Covance, Princeton NJ.
8: ), anti-TBR1 (1:500; cat#ab31940; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-CTIP2 (1:250; cat# ab18465; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-CUX1 (1:200; cat#A2213; Abclonal, Woburn, MA) and anti-SATB2 (1:500; cat#ab51502; Abcam, Cambridge, MA).

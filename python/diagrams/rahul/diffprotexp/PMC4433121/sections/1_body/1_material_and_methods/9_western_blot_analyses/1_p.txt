0: Western blot was performed on the depleted cyst fluids from 13 cases analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
1: In addition depleted cyst fluids of cystic PHPT and ATC and total protein extract from the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 were included as references.
2: Proteins were separated in a 10-well 12% NuPage Bis-Tris gel and subsequently blotted to nitrocellulose membrane with 0.45 m pores (Life Technologies, USA) [ 11,  12].
3: The membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat milk solution for 1 h at RT followed by overnight incubation at 4C with primary antibodies: monoclonal mouse anti-CK-19 (sc-6278, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-S100A13 (HPA019592, Atlas Antibodies AB) at 1:100; anti-annexin A3 (HPA013398, Atlas Antibodies AB) at 1:100 or anti-CMBL (HPA036571, Atlas Antibodies AB) at 1:250.
4: Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at RT with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody: goat anti-rabbit at dilution 1:8,000 or anti-mouse at dilution 1:10,000.
5: After application of chemiluminescent substrates for detection of HRP (Life Technologies), membranes were scanned using a luminescent image analyzer LAS-1000plus and protein bands were documented using a LAS-1000 image reader (Fuji Photo Film, Japan).

0: 200 L pipette tips were packed with two punches of sulfonated divinylbenzene (SDB-RPS, Empore) with a 16-gauge needle and conditioned and equilibrated as described above.
1: After loading 3 g peptides, the resin was washed with 50 L 20 mM NH 4HCO 2, pH 10.
2: Then, the peptides were eluted into three fractions with 20 mM NH 4HCO 2, pH 10, containing 15, 30, and 90% ACN and dried in a rotary evaporator and stored at 80 C until needed.

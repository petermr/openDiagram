0:  Histological changes in rats with choline-deficient diet - induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: (a) Normal group (sham): Liver sinusoid and hepatocytes are normal.
1: (b) Vehicle-treated group: Severe vacuolar degeneration and hepatocyte swelling are observable.
2: (c) Positive control: Some sinusoids are swelled but cellular damage is repaired in comparison to vehicle-treated animals.
3: (d) Pimpinella anisum extract 200 mg/kg: Macrovesicular steatohepatitis is decreased and the microscopic view is similar to sham.
4: (e) Pimpinella anisum extract 100 mg/kg: Some hepatocytes are swelled but no necrosis is observable.
5: (f) Pimpinella anisum essential oil 0.5 mg/kg: Vacuolar degeneration is remarkably decreased in comparison to vehicle-treated group )  )  Figure 2)

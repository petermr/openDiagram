<p>The lower LSS left more time to the laser beam to heat the material surface. It is clearly shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f009">Figure 9</xref> that a higher level of hardness was produced with the lower LSS, sample #9. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f006">Figure 6</xref>c and 7a the maximum value of the width and depth of the hardened zone occurred in the lowest LSS. In this study, the maximum surface hardness without material melting was 673 HV.

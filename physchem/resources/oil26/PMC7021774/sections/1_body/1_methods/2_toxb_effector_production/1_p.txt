0: ToxB protein was heterologously expressed via an  Escherichia coli SHuffle strain and purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) as described in See et al.
1: ( 2019).
2: Briefly, the DNA sequence that encodes the mature ToxB protein (GenBank accession PZD27634) (Martinez et al.
3: 2001) was cloned into the pET21a(+) (Novagen) vector using the primers ToxB-sigP_F (5-GGAATTC CATATGAACTGCGTCGCCAATAT-3) and ToxB_R (5-CCG CTCGAGACAACGTCCTCCACTTTGCA-3) that included the engineered  NdeI and  XhoI sites (underlined), respectively.
4: The resulting construct contained the predicted ToxB protein fused to a poly-histidine tag at the C-terminal, and was used to transform the  E. coli SHuffle strain.
5: The SHuffle strain harbouring the ToxB expression construct was grown in Terrific Broth medium and induced with -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 100 M for the expression of ToxB.
6: Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 ml binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 40 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) for the purpose of downstream his-tag purification.
7: Cells were then lysed using sonication of 10-s pulses with 10-s intervals for 1 min (Sonoplus HD 3100, Bandelin, Germany).
8: The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the ToxB protein was purified from the cell extract using HisPur Ni-NTA purification spin columns (Thermo Scientific) by gravity flow according to manufacturers instructions.
9: Purified protein was dialysed in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, quantified via the bicinchoninic acid assay (Smith et al.
10: 1985) and stored in freeze-dried form at  80 C. Prior to infiltration, protein was resuspended in sterile water to a concentration of 200 g/ml.

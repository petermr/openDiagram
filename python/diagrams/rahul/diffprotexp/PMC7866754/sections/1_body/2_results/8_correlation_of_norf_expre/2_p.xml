<p id="Par55">Interestingly, two AltORFs (MSTRG 4605.2 and MSTRG 2092.1) have anti-correlated expression with the parent gene, which are less likely to be a by-product and more likely have regulatory role on the expression of canonical proteins. Moreover, one of the parent genes, PF3D7_1467600 was significantly downregulated in salivary gland sporozoite, where the associated AltORF is uniquely present, suggesting that it may be involved in the downregulation mechanism. InterProScan did not find any functional domains other than transmembrane helices in the two AltORFs, which was common for novel ORFs as previously discussed. Therefore, an attempt was made to infer function from their three-dimensional structures by first predicting the structures using QUARK (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), and then submitting them to the structure-based function predictor COFACTOR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Although there were no significant hits (C-score &gt; 0.4) of the predicted Molecular Function GO terms for MSTRG 4605.2 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>), MSTRG 2092.1 was predicted with nucleic acid binding function. Taken together, binding to the mRNA of canonical gene or to the chromosome could be a mechanism through which this AltORF regulates the expression of canonical proteins.

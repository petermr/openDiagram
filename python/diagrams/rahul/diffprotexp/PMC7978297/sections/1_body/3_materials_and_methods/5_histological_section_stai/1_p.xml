<p>Ovaries were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, P1110, Beijing, China) overnight. Ovaries were embedded in paraffin and 5 µm sections were prepared. Following a standard procedure of gradient rehydration and antigen retrieval, sections were blocked at a room temperature around 20 ℃ for 45 min, then primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4 ℃. The primary antibodies included rabbit polyclonal to MVH (Abcam, ab13840, Shanghai, China), AMHR2 (OriGene, TA323994, Rockville, USA), GDF9 (Abcam, ab93892), and mouse monoclonal to γH2AX (Abcam, ab26350), STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology, #91395, Danvers, USA), and MVH (Abcam, ab27591). The next day, the secondary antibodies (Abcam, Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&amp;L Alexa Fluor 488, ab150077, and Anti-Mouse, ab150113; Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG H&amp;L Alexa Fluor 555, ab150074, and Anti-Mouse, ab150106) were incubated at 37 ℃ for 30 min. After nuclei staining with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich, P4170) or Hoechst 33342 (Beyotime, C1022, Shanghai, China), each slide was sealed with anti-fluorescence attenuation solution (Boster, AR1109, Wuhan, China). Photographs were then taken with a LEICA TCS SP5 II confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). In addition, a single-germ cell without connection to other germ cells was considered as a germ cell in a follicle, while inter-connected germ cells including two or more in number were regarded as germ cells in cysts. Meanwhile, every one of five ovarian sections was counted, and a total of eight to ten sections for each ovary was viewed as one independent biological duplicate.</p>

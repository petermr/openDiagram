0: An individuals phenotype can be strongly impacted by the phenotype or environment of its mother [ 1].
1: Specifically, hormone-mediated maternal effects, in which maternally derived hormones influence offspring phenotype, have been extensively studied in avian species and a primary focus of this work has been on maternal androgens.
2: Females experiencing more social competition tend to allocate more testosterone (T) to developing offspring through egg yolks [ 2 8] and these offspring display increased aggression well into adulthood [ 8 11].
3: Despite the potentially adaptive benefits of generating more aggressive offspring in more competitive environments, the underlying neural mechanisms by which prenatal hormones generate lasting behavioral change is still unclear [ 12].
4: Past work has examined the role the androgen receptor plays in mediating maternal effects [ 13]; however, aggression is regulated by a variety of neural genes expressed across numerous pathways [ 14].
5: Genome-wide approaches would therefore help to clarify the potentially diverse mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of prenatal T on complex behavioral traits.

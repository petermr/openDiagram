<p>These findings are consistent with our previous studies showing that 24 h exposure to the high concentration (10 Î¼g/mL) has little effect on cell function measured as TEER. Conversely the lower concentration of CNTs (100 ng/mL) caused an approximately 40% decrease in TEER [
 <xref rid="B9-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These results are also consistent with studies performed on high resistance renal epithelial cells where both TEER and hormone-stimulated ion transport showed an inverse relationship between CNT concentration and functional effect [
 <xref rid="B10-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We hypothesize that the difference in effect between the high and low dose CNT exposure could be due to the propensity of carbon nanotubes to agglomerate at high concentration. This postulate is supported by analysis of particle size and zeta potential of nanoparticles in previous research in our laboratory [

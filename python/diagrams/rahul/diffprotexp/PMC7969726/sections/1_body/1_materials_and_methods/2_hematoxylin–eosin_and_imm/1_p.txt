0: The HCC TMA blocks were cut into 4-m slices and mounted onto glass slides.
1: These slides were then dewaxed and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol and blocked with a Biotin-Blocking Kit (DAKO, Glostrup, Germany).
2: HE and IHC staining of CPSF1 (1:200, Bethyl, A301-580) were then performed, and the slides were assessed by two independent pathologists who calculated the respective IHC scores.
3: The IHC scores were determined by multiplying the staining intensity by the proportion of stained nuclei.
4: The staining intensity was scored as four grades (0, 1, 2, and 3), which indicated a staining intensity from blank to strong staining.
5: The proportion was scored as five grades (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), which indicated a staining area of 0, 125, 2550, 5075, and 75100%, respectively.
6: The median IHC score was used as the cutoff value to separate patients into high and low CPSF1 expression groups.

0: Xenografts were generated as previously described.
1: In brief, LNCaP cells (5  10 6) in 0.1 mL media were mixed with Matrigel mixture (BD) at 1:1 ratio and implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of NOD/SCID mice (6-week-old males; The Jackson Laboratory).
2: Tumor growth were monitored through palpation and measured twice weekly using calipers.
3: Tumor volume was calculated as V = L  W 2  0.52 [ 41].
4: Tumor progression was monitored by serum PSA levels (PSA kit, Abcam, Toronto, ON, Canada).
5: Surgical castration was performed when tumor reached 100200 mm 3 in size.
6: Serum PSA was determined before and after castration.
7: Resurge in serum PSA indicates CRPC growth.

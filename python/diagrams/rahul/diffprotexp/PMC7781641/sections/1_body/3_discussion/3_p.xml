<p>With regard to Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 research, we find only a single study where the team interfered with Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 channel function using specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and demonstrated a corresponding mitigation of neuropathic pain behaviors in the chronic compression of the dorsal root ganglion (CCD) model [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We also find only a single study implicating T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels in trigeminal neuropathic pain. In this study, the authors use an infraorbital nerve ligation model of trigeminal neuropathic pain and reveal that Cav3.1 channels are critically involved [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the present study demonstrates a truly novel role for Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 channels in a model of trigeminal neuropathic pain.

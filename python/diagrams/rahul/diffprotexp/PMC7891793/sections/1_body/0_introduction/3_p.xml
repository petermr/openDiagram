<p>It has been demonstrated that RSV infection increases expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human alveolar epithelial cells. In a cotton rat (
 <italic>Sigmodon hispidus</italic>) model RSV increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with the peak on day 5 [

This makes COX-2 a good target for therapeutics, helping to minimize potential damage caused by excessive production of prostanoids and alleviate pathological consequences of BRSV and RSV infection. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX inhibitors have the potential to diminish the prostanoid surges that follow RSV infection. Pretreatment with NSAIDs or treatment at 24 hours post RSV inoculation decreases the histopathological changes in a cotton rat model [

 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We have previously shown improved clinical scores, but increased viral load when ibuprofen was administered to calves experimentally infected with BRSV [

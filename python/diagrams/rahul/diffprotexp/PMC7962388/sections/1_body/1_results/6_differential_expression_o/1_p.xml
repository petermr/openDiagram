<p id="Par66">To investigate the nature, the level and the expression timing of transcription factors (TFs) detected in the apomictic and sexual samples, we contrasted our Illumina transcriptomes against the Plant Transcription Factor Database (

Based on the BLASTx top hits, we identified 63,076 (31.67%) transcripts highly similar to TFs, corresponding to 60 different families (29,847 of them with more than a 50% ID), several of which had previously been associated with reproductive development in

 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>, B). For instance, the MYB family shows a high number of members upregulated at premeiosis in apomictic libraries, while a few members are upregulated at anthesis in sexual libraries. Some families, like MYB, bHLH, ERF, WRKY, B3, ARF and AP2 showed a higher number of upregulated members in the apomictic samples across all developmental stages. Moreover, some families (like SAP and NZZ/SPL) presented up-regulated members only in the apomictic samples (not even one member was found upregulated in sexual plants). Moreover, others, like LFY, presented up-regulated members at all stages in the apomictic plant, but only at postmeiosis in the sexual genotype. An interesting case is that of LBD family proteins, which presented a higher number of upregulated members at anthesis in the sexual plant (Additional file

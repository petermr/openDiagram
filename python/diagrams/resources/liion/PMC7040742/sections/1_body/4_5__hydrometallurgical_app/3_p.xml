<p>Hydrometallurgy is the main method for LIB recycling that could separate different valuable elements (namely Co, Ni, Mn, and Li) as single element compounds [

Most processes are selective for each battery chemistry; however, there is a significant number of processes that could be used for mixtures of Co-, Ni-, and Mn-based batteries and only few processes that could be used for all types of batteries, including Co-, Ni-, Mn-, and PO

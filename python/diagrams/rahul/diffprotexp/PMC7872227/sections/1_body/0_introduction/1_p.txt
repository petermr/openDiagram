0: Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) refers to the formation of calcium carbonate precipitation by microbial metabolic activities including urea decomposition, photosynthesis, denitrification, ammonification, sulfate reduction, and methane oxidation [ 1,  2].
1: To date, a variety of microorganisms have been found to achieve MICP by hydrolysis of urea, and this kind of biomineralization has been used in a wide range of applications, including repairing cracks in buildings and roads, curing sands, making self-healing cements, and developing biomineralized materials [ 3 11].
2: Among the urease-producing bacteria,  Sporosarcina pasteurii ( S.  pasteurii) is one of the most common and widely used species in MICP [ 12].

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00891-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows TEM images of powder samples S1 (a), S2 (b), and S3 (c). The TEM image of sample S1 shows agglomerates composed of a dozen smaller particles. The measured particle size distribution of sample S1 gave the mean particle size of ~75.2 nm (+/− 13 nm), while the size of the agglomerate proved to be much larger (approximately 250 nm). The ball-milled sample (S2) possesses of small discrete particles around 29 nm (+/− 6 nm) in size and bigger particle agglomerates approximately 200 nm in size. Sample S3 consisted of irregular particles (c) with a lot of empty spaces between particles, which indicated the porous nature of sample S3. The particle size of ~106.2 nm (+/− 18 nm) and particle agglomerate size of approximately 500 nm were measured (c).

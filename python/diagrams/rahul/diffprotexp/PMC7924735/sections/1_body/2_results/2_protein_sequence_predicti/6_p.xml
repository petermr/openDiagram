 <italic>solium</italic> proteins identified was assessed. Secretion pathways were mapped with two tools widely used for this purpose, SignalP and SecretomeP. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009104.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, most proteins in our cultures were secreted by a non-classical (ER/Golgi-independent) pathway.

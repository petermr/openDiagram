<p>0.9% NaCl solution (saline) was prepared, autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min, and then used as the aerosol solvent. 0.9% NaCl solution without ricin was used on the control group, and ricin-containing saline (ricin concentration at 0.1 mg/mL) was used on the experimental group. Aerosol Generator (TSI3079, TSI incorporated, St. Paul, MN, USA) was connected to Aerosol Diluter (3302A, TSI incorporated, St. Paul, MN, USA) and Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS3321, TSI incorporated, St. Paul, MN, USA). The flow rate was 200 L/h, and the aerosol generation time was 240 s. 30 s after the initiation of aerosol generation, the Particle Sizer was switched on and samples were collected. Samples were collected for 20 s and diluted 1:20 with the Aerosol Diluter. The process was repeated five times. Experiments were performed at 25 °C with humidity of 60%. The Ricin exposure time for experiment subjects was 30 min.</p>

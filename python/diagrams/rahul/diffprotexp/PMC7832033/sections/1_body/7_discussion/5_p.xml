<p>Expression of several genes, assayed on day 0, had high mortality discrimination, including 
 <italic>S100A9</italic> and 
 <italic>IL1R2.</italic> Notably, expression of these genes decreased significantly in surviving patients by day 12, suggesting that the gene expression tracks with clinical condition. Therefore, these genes and their encoded proteins could be considered as candidate biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with melioidosis, and deserve further study in comparison to other clinical and biological prediction tools.

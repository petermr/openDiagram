<p id="Par15">Tensile analysis was conducted using Instron Model 5500 R 1125. Stress–strain curves were obtained for undamaged and air-cut/air-healed (3 h) and air-cut/water-healed (3 h) copolymers. The gauge length and the strain rate were set to 1.0 cm and 40 mm/min, respectively. The average thickness of the films was 0.5 mm. To determine the self-repairing capability of p(MMA/nBA) copolymers, 3 × 1 × 0.025-cm films were damaged in air using a stainless-steel razorblade to obtain cuts with a width of 20 μm and a depth of 50 μm. These films were allowed to heal under ambient and aqueous conditions at 25 °C for up to 150 min. Tensile stress–strain properties of the damaged–healed films were recorded at 30-min intervals.</p>

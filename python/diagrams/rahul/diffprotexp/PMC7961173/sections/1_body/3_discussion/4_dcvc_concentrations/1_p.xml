<p id="Par55">As for any toxicology study, concentrations of the toxicant tested must be carefully selected and justifiable. For the current study, concentrations of 10–20 µM DCVC were used as relevant to potential human exposure levels. The concentrations used in our study are relevant to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 100 parts-per-million (ppm) averaged over an 8-h work day (ATSDR 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2016</xref>). TCE concentrations up to 229 ppm were reported in 80 exposed workers (29% women) wearing aerosolized monitoring devices (29% women) (Walker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2016</xref>). Moreover, female volunteers exposed to the PEL of TCE for 4 h by inhalation had an average peak blood concentration of 13.4 µM for the metabolic precursor to DCVC,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1999</xref>), which is comparable to the concentrations used in this study. Finally, the concentrations that caused differential gene expression in our study are considerably lower than those used previously as high as 1 mM DCVC (Chen et al.

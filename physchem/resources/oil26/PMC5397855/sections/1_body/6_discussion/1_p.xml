<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Insecticidal activity of the garlic essential oil and its compounds against the mealworm beetle, <italic>T. molitor</italic> were determined from the bioassays in the laboratory conditions. Garlic essential oil caused substantial mortality and repellency in larva, pupa, and adult stages. The best results were obtained with concentrations of 16 and 32% in <italic>T. molitor</italic> as reported for other stored grain pests according to the concentration of these products<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The susceptibility of stored pest products such as <italic>S. oryzae, S. zeamais, Sitotroga cerealella</italic> Oliver (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), and <italic>T. castaneum</italic> may vary with the exposure at garlic essential oil applied to the body of these insects or by fumigation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>

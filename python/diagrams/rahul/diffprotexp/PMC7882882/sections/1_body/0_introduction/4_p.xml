<p>The present study aims to screen out the critical PCGs and lncRNAs, which play an essential role in NFPAs recurrence. We obtained differentially expressed PCGs and lncRNAs by performing differential expression analyses of recurrence within 1 year after surgery (fast recurrence group) and after 5 years (slow recurrence group). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and coregulatory networks between lncRNAs and mRNAs were also identified. The hub lncRNA-mRNA modules related to NFPA recurrence were further screen and the enrichment of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was assessed in different pathways by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). In addition, the ability of the hub and module genes [nucleolar protein 6 (NOL6), cyclin dependent kinase 15 (CDK15), Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), SAMM50 sorting and assembly machinery component (SAMM50), collagen type XXIV Î± 1 chain (COL24A1), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) and decapping mRNA 1A (DCP1A)] to predict recurrence and progression-free survival (PFS) time was evaluated in patients with NFPA. These results may help us explore the mechanisms underlying NFPA recurrence, and may also provide future effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the elements and chemical states on the surface of the anode materials, XPS analysis is carried out and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00191-f005">Figure 5</xref>. In the XPS survey spectrum of Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00191-f005">Figure 5</xref>c), the signals of elements of Co, Ni, and Cu can be observed, which was different from those of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00191-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b), as the former has both Cu and Ni elements, and the three transition elements Cu, Ni, and Co will affect the outer electronic structure of each other. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00191-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b, no signal of Ni is found in CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, while the Cu signal was absent in NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, which are as expected. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00191-f005">Figure 5</xref>d–f is the Ni 2p, Cu 2p, and Co 2p spectrum of the anode materials, respectively. There are six peaks in Ni 2p spectrum for NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. The peaks are at 854.2 eV and 871.5 eV of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>, and 855.8 eV and 872.8 eV of Ni
 <sup>3+</sup> for Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. Comparing to the peaks for NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, binding energy of Ni 2p for Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> are stronger. The peak areas mean the relative content of element valence. It’s noted that the peak area of them is various, which shows the relative content of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> is lower in Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. It indicates the amount of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> decreases in the presence of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>. There are four peaks in Cu 2p spectrum for CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, indicating copper is divalent. Six peaks of Co 2p for the three materials can be found, manifesting the cobalt is trivalent and divalent. Similar, binding energy of Cu 2p, Co 2p for Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> are stronger than CuCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, respectively. The peak positions are corresponding to previous reports [
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], indicating that Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> is prepared successfully and Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> reduces the content of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>. The electron density of Cu
 <sub>0.6</sub>Ni
 <sub>0.4</sub>Co
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> in the outermost shell is affected by doping elements.

<p id="Par57">In the stage-specific differential expression analysis (SSDEA), the filtered raw reads corresponding to each developmental stage (premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis, anthesis) were mapped onto the GTA and compared between apomictic and sexual libraries. The highest number of DETs occurred at premeiosis, where, out of 124,569 expressed transcripts, 23,651 (FDR &lt; 0.001, Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; |3|) showed differential representation (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, S1). At meiosis, out of 131,993 total transcripts, 22,830 DETs were identified (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, S2), while at postmeiosis and anthesis, 19,100 (from 139,643) and 17,962 (from 139,460) transcripts were found differentially expressed, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, S3 and S4). Considering the percentage of DETs overexpressed in apomictic plants, the largest number was detected at meiosis (72%) followed by premeiosis (69%), postmeiosis (68%), and anthesis (56%), showing the same tendency observed in the GDEA analysis, in which upregulated transcripts were more abundant in apomicts. A Venn diagram showing the number of transcripts with a significantly different level of expression between the apomictic and the sexual libraries at each developmental stage is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a. This analysis showed 5268 DETs common to all developmental stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of the DETs appeared to be stage-specific. For instance, 5029 (21.30%) DETs were differentially expressed only at premeiosis. Likewise, at meiosis, postmeiosis and anthesis, other 5048 (22.11%), 4792 (25.01%) and 7500 (41.75%) stage-specific DETs were detected, respectively. Interestingly, the highest proportion of stage-specific DETs was detected at anthesis, when parthenogenesis start in most apomictic ovaries. A similar analysis carried out for the antisense transcripts showed 115, 120, and 164 DEATs (FDR &lt; 0.05; Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; |3|) at premeiosis, meiosis and postmeiosis, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>, S1-S3). The largest number of DEATs corresponded to anthesis, since 495 transcripts carrying antisense sequences were detected (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>, S4). Once again, the number of upregulated DEATs was higher than the downregulated ones at premeiosis (59% vs. 41%), meiosis (63% vs. 37%) and postmeiosis (54% vs. 41%). The opposite behavior was observed at anthesis, with 203 (41%) overrepresented and 292 (59%) downrepresented transcripts in apomictic libraries. A Venn diagram showing stage-specific DEATs is provided in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. Thirty-two (32) DEATs common to the four stages of development were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Furthermore, 42, 38, 59 and 396 stage-specific DEATs (i. e., occurring only at one particular stage) were detected at premeiosis, meiosis, postmeiosis, and anthesis, respectively. Here again, a large proportion of stage-specific transcripts, in this case antisense ones, occurs at anthesis, concurrent with the onset of parthenogenesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).

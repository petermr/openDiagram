<p id="Par19">Following common practice, all errors are shown for the total AE, even for the intensive models. Clearly, this is not a completely fair comparison, as the intensive models are trained to minimize the AE/

 <italic>N</italic> may generally be a more appropriate target for fitting and benchmarking

 </sup>. Specifically, fitting on the total AE will selectively favor large systems over small ones, as they offer a larger potential for improvement in the loss function. This also carries over to the FPS selection, as extensive selection will initially focus on larger molecules which are deemed to be more dissimilar than smaller ones. We will see later that this has significant consequences for reaction networks and REs. Nevertheless, based on the data in Fig.Â

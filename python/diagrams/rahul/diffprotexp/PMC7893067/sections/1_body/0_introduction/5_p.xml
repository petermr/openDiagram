 </sup> to purify populations of subcellular RNA fractions from human fetal and adult frontal cortex, as well as fetal cerebellum. We investigate the differences in relative transcript abundance between cytosol and nucleus and highlight genes and gene categories that are over-represented in either compartments. Our results also provide important insight into the subcellular localization of nuclear-encoded-mitochondrial proteins (NEMPs) and non-coding RNA in brain tissue samples.

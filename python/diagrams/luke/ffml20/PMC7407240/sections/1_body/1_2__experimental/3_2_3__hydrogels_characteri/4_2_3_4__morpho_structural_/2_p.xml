<p>A Cannon-Ubbelohde dilution capillary viscometer (viscosimeter constant of 0.0023 cSt/s) was used to determine the relative kinematic viscosity

To overcome the typical behavior of polyelectrolyte polymers (increase of the reduced viscosity with decreasing concentration, due to stronger electrostatic intramolecular repulsions at lower concentration values), the ι-carrageenan and PVA:CAR mixture solutions were prepared in a sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 6.7) [

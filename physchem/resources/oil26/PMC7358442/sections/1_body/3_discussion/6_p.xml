<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The activity pattern of our aardvarks in the Kalahari during non-drought years, when it was not dominated by the need to survive starvation, resembled that of aardvarks in the Karoo (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Van Aarde et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, 1998</xref>), in that when days were long in summer (and therefore the nights were short), the aardvarks counterintuitively were active for longer (&#8764;8 h per day), and almost exclusively nocturnal. During short days in winter, both our aardvark and those in the Karoo (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, 1998</xref>) reduced the duration of activity (&#8764;6 h per day) and aardvarks emerged from and returned to their burrows earlier in the day, particularly when resource availability (as indexed by EVI) was low.</p>

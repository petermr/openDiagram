 </sup> Jeon et al. detected the stability of cationic Zn species during CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR for Zn NPs &lt; 7 nm synthesized via inverse micelle encapsulation.

 </sup> In this case, the Zn K-edge position revealed that the as-prepared particles are completely oxidized. Nevertheless, the XANES and EXAFS features (and hence the materials structure) were different from those in bulk ZnO. Under reaction conditions at −1.1 V versus RHE, these Zn particles were not completely reduced, as suggested by the XANES and EXAFS analysis. In particular, a significant Zn–O contribution was clearly visible in the EXAFS spectra of catalysts under reaction conditions. Cationic species thus may contribute to the observed reactivity.

 </sup> A strong correlation between the particle size and activity was observed, with 6.8 nm NPs exhibiting activity similar to that of bulk Zn and ∼70% CO selectivity, and 1.7 nm NPs displaying four-times higher activity but also a large increase in the H
 <sub>2</sub> production at the expense of CO.

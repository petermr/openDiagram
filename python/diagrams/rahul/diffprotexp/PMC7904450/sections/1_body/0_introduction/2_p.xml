<p id="p0025">Evidence for the role of interleukin 6 (IL6) mediated cytokine storm in the development of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated morbidity and mortality suggests that therapeutic agents which decrease IL6 signal transduction may prevent serious COVID-19 disease outcomes 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Clinical consequences of COVID-19 infection such as multisystem organ failure, intensive care unit admission, and death result from an exaggerated immune response whereby increased IL6 drives a destructive cytokine storm

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Indeed, many infections result in an IL6-mediated cytokine storm that drives negative clinical outcomes. NF-kappaB-mediates increases in the transcriptional expression of the proinflammatory cytokine

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Binding of IL6 to its receptor complex (IL6R) activates the IL6 signal transduction protein (IL6ST or gp130), a subunit of the IL6 receptor complex. IL6ST activation is integral to many intracellular cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathways, including the cytokine storm / cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients

 <italic>,</italic> and clinical data demonstrate that many selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) decrease IL6 signaling activity and reduce hyperinflammatory states

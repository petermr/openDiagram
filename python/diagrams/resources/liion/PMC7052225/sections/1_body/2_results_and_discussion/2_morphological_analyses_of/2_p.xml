<p id="Par28">The SEM images of an LTO self-standing film are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The top (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) and bottom views (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) represent the FB-rich and carbon-rich sides, respectively. As shown in the top-view image, the pores created among the large cellulose fibers is filled with the mixture of modified VGCF and LTO materials. The corresponding C and Ti elemental mappings are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI1</xref>, indicating that carbon and LTO exhibit good dispersion. The bottom view (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) only shows the VGCF–COOH fibers that form a strong carbon mat (which is expected) that is ideal for electron conduction and current collection. The inset shows the intertwined carbon fibers that reinforce the electrode film. Finally, the cross-section of the electrode film presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> shows a carbon-rich area that is approximately 20 µm thick with no (or extremely few) LTO particles. Inside the electrode (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), a composite of well-dispersed LTO particles with interconnected VGCF carbon fibers is observed; this composite permits strong electrode adhesion and good electrical conduction. The chemical mapping of the cross-section of this self-standing film that illustrates Ti and C dispersions inside the electrode is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. A high carbon concentration is effectively located on one side of the self-supported film with the presence of an extremely small amount of titanium. The LTO material is well-dispersed in the bulk of the film, demonstrating that thick film electrodes with high active mass loading can be easily obtained with this technique. Carbon is also well-dispersed, ensuring good electrical conduction throughout the film thickness, as demonstrated by the electrochemical performance of self-standing electrodes presented below.

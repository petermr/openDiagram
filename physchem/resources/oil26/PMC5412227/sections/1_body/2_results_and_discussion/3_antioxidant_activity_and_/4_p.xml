<p>The fact that the essential oil of a plant at the concentrations that is has antibacterial properties has no damaging effect on the Lymphocyte cells is accepted as an indicator to measure the safety in oil consumption in foods (Taherkhani, 2014). These results also suggest lower adverse side effects of the

 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> oil. Neral and geranial are the two stereoisomers of citral. Geranial (also known as citral a) is an 
 <italic>(E</italic>)-isomer and neral (also known as citral b) has a (Z)- configuration. Studies showed anticancer properties of citral (Dubey et al., 1997). Citral was reported to be cytotoxic to P388 mouse leukemia cells at an IC

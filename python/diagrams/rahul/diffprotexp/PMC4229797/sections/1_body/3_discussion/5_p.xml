<p>In the group of infertile patients, we found an increase of a protein with the m/z value identical with that of ceruloplasmin. This protein is a serum ferroxidase that contains over 95% of the copper found in plasma. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> ceruloplasmin is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of a number of different substrates. Ceruloplasmin is a member of the multicopper oxidase family, an evolutionarily conserved group of proteins that utilize copper to couple substrate oxidation with the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water.[

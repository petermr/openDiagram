<p id="Par29">The HMLP does not include quadrupole interactions explicitly—it has “learnt” them. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows what the quadrupole interactions would be, using electrostatic calculation based on the HMLP configurations. The large negative values indicate the prevalence of quadrupole-type ordering: strongest in Phase II. The differences, tens of meV, is of similar magnitude to the phase transformation temperature. The HMLP has learnt that Phase II is stabilised by quadrupole interactions.

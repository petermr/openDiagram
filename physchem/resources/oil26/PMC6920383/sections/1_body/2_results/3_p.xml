<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par20">A total of 166 species were recorded in the mesic grassland, 32 in the semi-arid savannah and 30 in the arid scrubland. Some common species (i.e. occurring&#8201;&gt;&#8201;3 times in a dataset) were non-randomly distributed between microsites (c. 20% of species in semi-arid savannah and the mesic grassland, but 0% in arid scrubland, Supplementary Tables&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.6</xref>). However, of these species only two occurred exclusively at a specific microsite, with the fern species <italic>Cheilanthes viridis</italic> and <italic>Pellaea calomelanos</italic>, occurring exclusively at burrow entrances in the mesic grassland (see Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S.5</xref> for details).</p>

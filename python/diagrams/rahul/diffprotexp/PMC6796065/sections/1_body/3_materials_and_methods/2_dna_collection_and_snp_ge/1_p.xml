<p id="Par17">The subjects for the association analysis between SNPs and protein expression consisted of 27 patients (16 men; mean age, 68.2 ± 15.2 years) and 22 control subjects (14 men; mean age, 63.7 ± 14.4 years). A second replication sample set consisted of 34 subjects (17 men; mean age, 82.4 ± 9.4 years). Genomic DNA was extracted from the frozen cerebellum or occipital cortex and genotyping was performed using HumanCoreExome −24 v1.0 Beadchip on an iScan system (Illumina, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously

 </sup>. Of 128 SNPs derived from 8 dopaminergic system-associated genes [Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1(ANKK1), dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 regulatory subunit 1B(PPP1R1B), protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha (PPP3CA), protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit beta (PPP3CB), protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit gamma (PPP3CC), protein phosphatase 3 regulatory subunit B alpha (PPP3R1), and protein phosphatase 3 regulatory subunit B beta (PPP3R2)] included in the chip, we excluded SNPs with call rates of &lt;95% and minor allele frequencies of &lt;1%; the number of SNPs analyzed thus totaled to 55 (Supplementary Table

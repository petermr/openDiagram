<p>For each curve, after a rapid increase of stress to the highest (peak) value, it begins to gradually decrease towards a steady state with varying degrees of softening, indicating the onset of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). Furthermore, all flow stress curves can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, in which there is a sharp increase in stress up to a critical value, the work hardening dominates. In the second stage, the increase in stress is constantly slowed down to the peak value or the inflection value of the work hardening rate, which corresponds to the increasing influence of dynamic recovery and recrystallization. This effect increases and at some point exceeds the effect of work hardening. The highest peak stress was measured at the strain rate φ’ = 10 s
 <sup>−1</sup> (328 MPa) and the lowest at the rate φ’ = 0.001 s
 <sup>−1</sup> (65 MPa). This means that at the highest rate, the peak stress reached five times bigger value. In the last third stage, two predominant curves can be observed. One is a continuous decrease with a significant DRX mechanism, which occurs especially at the lowest temperature (900 °C) or higher transformation rates (1 s
 <sup>−1</sup>–10 s
 <sup>−1</sup>) in the entire range of deformation temperatures. The second is only a slight flow stress drop due to DRX. This course is especially visible at higher temperatures (1200–1100 °C). This is mainly because under these conditions, the higher speed of the DRX slows down the work hardening. This also shifts the peak and steady stresses to lower values of the true strain.

0: The genus  Aloysia belongs to the Verbenaceae family and consists of approximately 200 species of herbs, shrubs, and small trees which are often aromatic [ 1].
1: The species  Aloysia citriodora Palau or  Lippia citriodora (H.B.
2: & K.) is commonly known as Lemon Verbena, Verbena grass Louise, Arabic tea, and lemongrass.
3: This plant is growing spontaneously in South America, especially in Argentina and Chile.
4: In Morocco, this species is cultivated for more than a century and has been used in folk medicine as herbal tea preparations, for its antispasmodic, digestive, stomachic, sedative, and antipyretic properties.
5: The essential oil extracted from the dried leaves of  A. citriodora is indicated for anxiety, stress, insomnia, some depressions, nervous fatigue, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, tachycardia, rheumatism, enterocolitis, Crohn's disease, anorexia, dyspepsia, intestinal parasites (amebiasis and amebic cysts), and prevention of asthma attacks [ 2 4].
6: The broad range of biological activities of essential oils could be generally correlated to the chemical composition.
7: Therefore, this biological difference can be partly explained by the variation in their chemical composition [ 5].
8: It is well established that sesquiterpenoids and their derivatives are credited with many biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiasthmatic, and antifungal properties [ 6].
9: Thus, structure-activity relationships describe broad classes of activities for the different chemical groups of molecules found in essential oils.

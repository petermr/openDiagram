<p>POAG and post-mortem TMs were analyzed in duplicate (spots/bands) and mean values (±SD) were calculated from these replicates. Individual biomarker expression was provided by GenePix software. The row spot intensity data were entered into a Microsoft Excel database (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and duplicate spots outside the 10% coefficient of variability were refused from the statistical analysis. FDR value of 0.01, as observed. Protein response ratios were defined as the variation in a given marker and a cut-off of two fold (changes) was used for differential expression, in accordance with previously published methods [

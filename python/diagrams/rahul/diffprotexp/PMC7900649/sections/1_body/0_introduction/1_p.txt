0: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alphacoronavirus, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and weight loss in piglets.
1: Before 2010, PEDV was under control by proper vaccine programs [ 1,  2].
2: However, from October 2010, due to the emergence and rapid spreading of the highly pathogenic PEDV variant strains, a large number of suckling piglets in southern China, even in vaccinated herds, presented symptoms such as severe diarrheal disease and higher mortality rates [ 3].
3: Moreover, the high morality in infected neonatal piglets leads to enormous economic loss, making PEDV a huge threat to swine industry.
4: From May 2013, a PEDV variant began to emerge and quickly spread throughout the USA and caused numerous deaths in neonatal piglets [ 4,  5].
5: Henceforth, PEDV has received global attention.

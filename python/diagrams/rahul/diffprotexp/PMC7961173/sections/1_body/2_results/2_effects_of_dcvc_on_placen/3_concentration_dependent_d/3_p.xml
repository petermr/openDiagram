<p id="Par35">Multiple enriched biological and molecular signaling pathways connected to differential gene expression were upregulated by 12-h DCVC treatment. Ten micromolar treatment upregulated 2 pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Twenty micromolar treatments upregulated 9 pathways, 5 of which were involved in response to stress stimuli (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). Representative pathways included unfolded protein response (NES = 2.36, FDR &gt; 0.001) and mTORC1 signaling (NES = 2.16, FDR &gt; 0.001). Moreover, 12–79% of individual genes enriched within each of these pathway gene sets were targets of the ATF4 gene, which codes for a key transcription factor associated with ISR, a branch of the UPR. (Suppl. Table 6). In addition to the response to stress stimuli, upregulated pathways also involve metabolic processes (4), immune processes (2) and proliferation (1).

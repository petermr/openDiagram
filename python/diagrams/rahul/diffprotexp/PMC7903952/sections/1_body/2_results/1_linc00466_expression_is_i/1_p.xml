<p>Previously, increased level of LINC00466 has been linked to malignant characteristics of cancer cells
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> but its role in glioma has not been fully appreciated. Here, we first compared the level of LINC00466 between normal brain tissue and glioma tissue (TCGA-GBM/LGG) and found that LINC00466 was significantly higher in the glioma samples as compared to that in the normal brain (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">B</xref>). The expression level of LINC00466 between GBM and LGG was also compared with the data of TCGA and GTEx databases. The results showed the expression level of LINC00466 has no difference between GBM and LGG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1C</xref>). The results showed that the LINC00466 expression level was higher in glioma tissues compared with paired adjacent tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1D</xref>, P&lt;0.01). For WHO grade, the expression level of LINC00466 was significantly increased in WHO grade (III–IV) compared with WHO grade (I–II) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1E</xref>, P&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of LINC00466 was also elevated in glioma cell lines (LN308, T98G, A172) compared with normal astroglia cell lines (HEB) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1F</xref>, all P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, in order to judge the function of LINC00466 we detected the fraction of LINC00466 and showed that LINC00466 located in both cytoplasm and nucleus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">H</xref>). Overall, these findings indicated that LINC00466 were high expression in glioma and showed the function of ceRNA.

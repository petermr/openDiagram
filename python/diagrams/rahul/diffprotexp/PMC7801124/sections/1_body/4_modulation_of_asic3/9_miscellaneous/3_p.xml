<p>Although not used therapeutically, the small compound NS383 [(3E)-8-ethyl-3-(hydroxyimino)-5-phenyl-1 H,2 ;H,3 H,6 H,7 H,8 H,9 H-pyrrolo[3,2-h]isoquinolin-2-one-3-hydroxy-4-mycinide] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10D</xref>) was observed to inhibit acid-evoked rASIC3 transient currents with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.1 µM (pH 5), the inhibition being pH dependent and greater (Δ40%) at pH 6.8; it should be noted that hASIC3 was not inhibited by NS383 and that the inhibitory effect on rASIC1a currents was more pronounced [
 <xref rid="cit0230" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Interestingly, the in vivo doses of NS383 which produced analgesia (10–60 mg/kg) were not much higher than morphine (3–10 mg/kg, a centrally acting opioid), but much more potent than amiloride (50–200 mg/kg) and acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol, 100–400 mg/kg). Again, NS383, much like NM and Merck’s compound 7d, provides an interesting lead to develop a selective and more potent inhibitor of ASIC3.

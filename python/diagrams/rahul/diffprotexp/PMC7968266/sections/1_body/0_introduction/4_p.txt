0: In our study, DEGs between LMP and EOC were first screened based on three GEO datasets.
1: Then, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were performed for these DEGs.
2: Next, PPI network, ROC, survival and Pearson correlation analysis were utilized to further validate core genes, which show better diagnostic efficiency and higher prognostic value for EOC.
3: Furthermore, the chemical-core gene network was constructed based on 5 core genes, and the top 15 related chemicals for EOC were identified.
4: Finally, we found that all 5 core genes mainly regulate EOC development via the cell cycle pathway by the bioinformatic analysis, which may help to provide new ideas for EOC treatment.

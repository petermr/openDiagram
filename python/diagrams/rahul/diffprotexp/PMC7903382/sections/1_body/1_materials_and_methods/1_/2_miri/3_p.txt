0: In the present experiment, ~20% of the animals died due to hemorrhage and arrhythmia caused by ligation of coronary artery at the early stage of reperfusion.
1: When ventricular fibrillation and bleeding were uncontrollable, euthanasia was performed on animals as humane endpoints.
2: Time points of 30 min for ischemia and 2 h for reperfusion were selected for this animal model is sufficient to result in significant histopathological and functional myocardial injury, which can be confirmed using the results of ECG, cTnI, TTC, H&E and Masson staining ( 30).

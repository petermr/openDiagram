<p id="Par33">So far, the key pathways that have been associated with the stem height are the gibberellic acid (GA) metabolism and signaling, elasticity of the cell-wall of expanding cells, and cross-talk between GA and other hormone metabolism and signaling pathways i.e. auxin, brassinosteroids (BR), and abscisic acid (ABA) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] studied a dwarf mutant of ‘Williams’ banana variety and demonstrated the role of GA in dwarfism. In peach trees, the brachytic dwarfism trait (

 <italic>ent</italic>-Kaurene 19-oxidase, GA12-aldehyde 7-oxidase, GA 20-oxidase, GA 3β-hydroxylase, and GA 2-oxidase have been successfully identified in Arabidopsis, pumpkin, and runner bean [

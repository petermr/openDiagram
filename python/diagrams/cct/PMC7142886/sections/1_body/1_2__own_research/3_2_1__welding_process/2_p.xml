<p>Based on melting tests and assessments of penetration depths, it was possible to determine the range of welding parameters (
 <xref rid="materials-13-01312-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The welding process was performed in the flat position (PA) and horizontal position (PC) with inert shielding gas (helium fed at a flow rate of 20 dm
 <sup>3</sup>/min). The horizontal position made it possible to prevent the outflow of a significant volume of the liquid weld metal formed during the process, which could take place during welding in the flat position. Before welding, the edges of the plates were dried by being heated at a temperature of 65 Â°C. The results of strength tests and changes in structure were referred to the joints made using the MAG method [

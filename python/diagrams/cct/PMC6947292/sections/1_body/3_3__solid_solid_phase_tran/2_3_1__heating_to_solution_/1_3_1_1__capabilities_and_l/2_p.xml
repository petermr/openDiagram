<p>Why are overlapping microstructural reactions a problem in the interpretation of the DSC heating curve? DSC detects (only) the sum of any heat that is released or consumed by the reactions inside the sample. In a theoretical case, a precipitation and a dissolution reaction with equal quantities of enthalpy but opposite algebraic signs may occur, and in this case, the resulting DSC signal would be zero. Thus, a heat flow signal of zero during heating does not necessarily mean that no reactions are taking place. In addition, the peak temperature of a certain heating DSC peak is not necessarily equal to the intensity maximum of the related microstructural reaction [

 <sub>III</sub> in the initial state T651. During slow heating with 0.01 K/s, there are two smaller dissolution peaks B and F at about 200 °C and 330 °C, respectively. In addition to the fact that the peaks shift towards higher temperatures at higher heating rates, the peak areas also substantially increase. It is very unlikely that a diffusion-controlled dissolution reaction increases its transformed fraction if the time available for that reaction is substantially shortened. The phenomenon of increasing peak area can only be explained by a significant variation in the superposition of different reactions. This may be caused by a more severe suppression of the overlapping exothermic precipitation reaction.

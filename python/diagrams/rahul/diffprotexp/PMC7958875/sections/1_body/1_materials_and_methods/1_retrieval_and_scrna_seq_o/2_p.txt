0: P. berghei parasites were isolated from the mosquito blood bolus at 18 or 24 h post infectious feed as previously described ( Howick et al., 2019).
1: Briefly, each midgut was dissected and a lateral incision was made along the gut epithelium to release the contents of the bolus into a small drop of PBS and the midgut tissue was further rinsed with a syringe.
2: The released contents were transferred to an Eppendorf tube stored on ice.
3: Each sample was diluted in an additional 400 l of PBS, filtered with a 20 m filter, and stained with SYBR green (1:5,000) prior to FACS.
4: For the  Pb vector species data set, the contents of five boli were pooled prior to sorting at 18 h ( An.
5: stephensi) and 24 h ( An.
6: stephensi and  An.
7: coluzzii).
8: The 18 h time point was included in our analysis to inform developmental trajectory inference.
9: For the  Pb single-gut data set, parasites were collected from each gut at 24 h post-infection and maintained and sorted as separate samples.
10: Parasites were sorted into lysis buffer in 96-well plates using an Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences) with a 70 m nozzle.
11: Sorted plates were spun at 1,000 g for 10 s and placed immediately on dry ice.

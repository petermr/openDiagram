<p>The survival rate data indicate that 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH-treated MSCs showed a sustained proliferation in CM (
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). After switching to NIM, cells maintained the characteristics of stem cells and continued to proliferate for 4 days. The cell number then decreased. When the cells were incubated in NIM supplemented with either TrkB or Akt inhibitor, the cell number decreased significantly after induction. In the presence of an inhibitor to the PI3K/Akt pathway, cell viability dropped significantly to 60% of its original value after 1 day of induction. However, the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway resulted in a slight decrease in cell viability and BDNF secretion after 5 days. The addition of BDNF to NIM on day 2 reduced cell death to some extent. In the NIM, MSCs ceased to grow 2 days after the induction of neuronal differentiation. When either TrkB inhibitor or Akt inhibitor were present in the NIM, cells underwent apoptosis.

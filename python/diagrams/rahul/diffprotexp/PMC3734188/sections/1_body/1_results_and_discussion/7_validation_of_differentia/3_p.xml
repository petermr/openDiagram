<p>However, the change direction of B2-M and FGF 21 in the model plasma was opposite to that in the model perfusates (FigureÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S3): the relative abundance of these proteins was decreased in perfusates, whereas it was increased in plasma. It is likely that these proteins are not liver-specific proteins and can be secreted by other organs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which may mask their decreased abundance in the liver. These results indicate that liver perfusate-based biomarker discovery should be limited to liver-specific proteins.

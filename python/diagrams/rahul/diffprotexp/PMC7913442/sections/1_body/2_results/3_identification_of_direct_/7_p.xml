<p id="Par39">To complete our comparative analysis with the most recent transcriptomic data, we also intersected our FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> DEGs list (717 genes) to the those DEGs in Weis-Banke et al. (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9). In addition, 29 common genes identified via Chip-seq data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] were also compared to the DEGs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9A, B). Analysis of these genes showed an involvement reproduction and tumorigenesis-related GO pathways like cell-adhesion regulation and negative regulation of wound healing (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9C). Finally, comparing our FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> DEGs (717 genes) to transcriptomic data from aGTC patients published by Benayon et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], we were able to categorize 11 genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), of which at least 3 (TGFB2, POLQ, GLI2) are 
 <italic>bona fide</italic> FOXL2 targets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). TGFB2 is the most consistent FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>-modulated candidate and was present as target and upregulated genes in every analysis performed. These global results of our transcriptomic support the putative key role of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> in aGCT tumorigenesis playing as regulator of oncogene (TGFB2, GLI2, EGR1) and as modulator of ECM genes (HSPG2, SDC4, COL5A1) and chromatin/nucleic acid remodeling (SMARCA4, BAZ2A).

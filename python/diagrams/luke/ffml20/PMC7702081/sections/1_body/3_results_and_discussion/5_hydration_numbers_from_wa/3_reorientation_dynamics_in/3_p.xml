 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A. The 
 <italic>inset</italic> of this figure presents the statistical approach we have adopted to classify bulk‐like and hydration water, which is based on the Empirical Rule, also known as the 68–95–99.7 rule: for a subpopulation to be classified as bulk‐like water the retardation factor must lie within 3
 <italic>σ</italic> of the mean value of bulk‐like water (green domain in Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A). Water molecules in W
 <sub>222</sub>, W
 <sub>22B</sub>, W
 <sub>B11</sub>, W
 <sub>B12</sub>, W
 <sub>B22</sub>, and W
 <sub>B2B</sub> (
 <italic>f</italic>≈1) are within the 2
 <italic>σ</italic> deviation and are classified as bulk‐like water. On the other hand, a slow relaxation dynamics (
 <italic>f</italic> values 2–6 times larger compared to the bulk) is observed for water molecules that are in the first coordination shell of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> (subpopulations W
 <sub>111</sub>, W
 <sub>112</sub>, W
 <sub>122</sub>, W
 <sub>12B</sub>, W
 <sub>1BB</sub>) or in the second coordination shell of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and first coordination shell of Cl
 <sup>−</sup> (W
 <sub>211</sub>, W
 <sub>212</sub>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>B). In particular, W
 <sub>211</sub> and W
 <sub>212</sub> are distributed well beyond the 3
 <italic>σ</italic> deviation (even larger than 4
 <italic>σ</italic>) and contribute, therefore, to the hydration number of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>(aq). The 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>) profiles of the water molecules in the first and second coordination shells of hydrated Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> (isolated ion, no counterions) confirm the long‐range effect of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and short‐range effect of Cl
 <sup>−</sup> on the reorientation water dynamics (Figure S14 in ESI). This result also agrees with a theoretical analysis on individual water entropy around ions, which showed that the rotational entropy reduction of the first solvation shell water molecules near Cl
 <sup>−</sup> is almost half compared to that around Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>.

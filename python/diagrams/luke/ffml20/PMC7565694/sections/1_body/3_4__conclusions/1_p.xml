<p>A intrinsic high-barrier polyimide (2,7-CPI) based on PMDA and a novel diamine (2,7-CDA) containing carbazole moiety was prepared. The 2,7-CPI exhibited high gas barrier, exceptional thermal stability, and good mechanical properties. Using molecular simulations, WAXD and PALS, the barrier performances of 2,7-CPI are compared with those of a structural analogue (2,7-CPPI) and a typical polyimide (Kapton) to reveal the barrier improvement of 2,7-CPI in relation to microstructure. The results showed that 2,7-CPI exhibited compact chain packing caused by the better coplanar structure and more number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which resulted in high crystallinity and low

 <italic>FFV</italic>. Molecular simulations revealed that the chain mobility of the three PIs decreased in the order: Kapton ˃ 2,7-CPPI ˃ 2,7-CPI. The high crystallinity, low free volume, and decreased chain mobility reduced the diffusion and solubility of the gases in the polymer matrix, thus leading to the improvement of barrier performances for 2,7-CPI. The high 
 <italic>FFV</italic> and chain mobility of Kapton increased the gases diffusion and solubility, thus leading to high gas permeability. The excellent comprehensive performances of 2,7-CPI suggest its promising application in micro-electronics encapsulation and high grade packaging industry.

<p>Recruitment of leukocytes including phagocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytes is important for an innate immune response, and this was also decreased. Research has shown that recruitment of leukocytes into the lungs in response to inhaled pathogens is initiated by epithelial signaling, the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), and the production of the chemokine interleukin-8 [

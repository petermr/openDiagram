<p id="Par24">The EBSD orientation maps and grain boundary maps of the SA508Gr.4N steel are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> (QT) and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> (QT-S.C). The samples in the QT state consist of ∼2,600 martensitic blocks of 0.2–14.4 μm. Approximately 1400 bainitic blocks (size: 0.2–31.4 μm) were considered. The samples in the QT-S.C state consist of ∼2400 martensitic blocks of 0.2–12 μm. Approximately 1200 bainitic blocks (size: 0.2–30.4 μm) were considered. The block width and the fraction of HAGBs, determined via statistical analyses, are shown in Table

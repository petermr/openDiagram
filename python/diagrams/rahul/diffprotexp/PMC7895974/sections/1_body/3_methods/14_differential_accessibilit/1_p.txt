0: Analysis of ATAC-seq for differential accessibility was carried out in R (v.3.5.1) 73 using the DiffBind package (v.2.8.0) 32,  33 with default parameter settings.
1: Differential accessibility across samples was calculated using the negative binomial distribution model implemented in DEseq2 (v1.4.5) 74.
2: Computational footprinting analysis was conducted across samples using HINT-ATAC which is part of the Regulatory Genomic Toolbox (v.0.12.3) 42 also using default parameter settings and the galGal5 genome.

<p>In this study, we used immunohistochemistry with antigen unmasking [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to investigate the differential expression of specific GluN2-NMDAR subunits across the dorsal horn in male and female juvenile rats. We found that both GluN2B and GluN2D are predominantly localized to the SDH compared to the DDH in male rats, while only GluN2B is enriched in the SDH of females. In both sexes, GluN2A immunoreactivity is almost exclusively restricted to neuropil, while GluN2B and GluN2D are found in both the neuropil and the soma of dorsal horn neurons. Surprisingly, we discovered that GluN2 subunit expression is not equal across the mediolateral axis of the SDH, with a pronounced preferential expression of GluN2B in the medial SDH of male rats. In a further twist, this differential GluN2B expression was not observed in females, as all three GluN2 subunits were evenly expressed across the mediolateral SDH axis in female spinal cord. We, therefore, conclude that specific GluN2 subunits are differentially expressed across and within dorsal horn laminae, with clear sex-differences in these NMDAR subunit distribution profiles. These results have large implications for understanding potential differential roles of NMDARs in physiological and pathological pain processing between males and females.

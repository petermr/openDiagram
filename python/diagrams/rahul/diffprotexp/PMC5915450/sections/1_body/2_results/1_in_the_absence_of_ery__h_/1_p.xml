<p id="Par13">We used SMD simulations to calculate the pulling force versus time profiles of pulling ErmCL and H-NS through the exit tunnel in the absence of ERY (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). ErmCL has a mean rupture force, denoted

 <sub>max</sub>, of 468.6 pN (95% CI: [442.6, 494.6]), which is lower than the 599.9 pN (95% CI: [585.2, 614.6]) value associated with H-NS (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This result is perhaps surprising because in the presence of ERY, ErmCL’s synthesis is stalled but not that of H-NS

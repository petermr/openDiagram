<p id="Par4">Epidemiological risk factors for the disease have been well-established and include older age, female sex, obesity, joint morphology and injury, and family history. The heritability of osteoarthritis has been estimated to range between 40 (for knee osteoarthritis) and 60% (for hip osteoarthritis)

<p>It is well known that the mammary gland is a central organ for milk synthesis, thus, development and metabolism of the mammary gland will affect the production of milk components such as fat and protein. The uptake and utilization of amino acids by the mammary gland also plays an important role in milk protein synthesis and milk yield [

 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These factors also affect the proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. For example, arginine, as an essential amino acid for newborns and conditionally-essential for adult mammals, is considered a “functional” amino acid in the body. It does not only promote the proliferation and differentiation of mammary cells, but also promotes protein biosynthesis [

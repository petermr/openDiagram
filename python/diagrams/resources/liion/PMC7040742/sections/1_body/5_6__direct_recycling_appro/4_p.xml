<p>Farasis Energy, Inc. developed a selective leaching process during which the shredded cathode is cleaned off residual Cu and Al in the alkaline solution after separation from other components [
 <xref rid="B107-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The solution is made of a complexing agent (5 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>OH) and 1 M LiOH with O
 <sub>2(g)</sub> bubbling to promote oxidation of metallic aluminum and copper. After 12 h, these contaminants are completely solubilized. The patent claims to treat any type of LIB. However, for LFP batteries, pH shall be maintained in a closed region to minimize delithiation of the active material by oxygen while avoiding phase transformation of LFP to iron oxide at pH above 14 [

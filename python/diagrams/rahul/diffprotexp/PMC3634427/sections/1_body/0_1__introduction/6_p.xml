<p>The present work includes a proteomic study on the effects of the different treatments and the effects of these on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> shoots of two potato species. Moreover, we analyzed the amounts of soluble sugars that, combined with the proteomics approach, show some of the metabolites that undergo changes under different preculture conditions. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of combined study (proteomic and targeted metabolites analyses) compares 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> with its frost-tolerant relative, 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic>, to highlight some common and different mechanisms in response to abiotic stress.

0: Ets-1 was found to be overexpressed in breast cancer, which was reported to be associated with poor prognosis [ 10].
1: Ets-1 is not only a critical regulator of invasion [ 10], but is also involved in regulating cancer energy metabolism in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines [ 11].
2: It has also been shown to play a role in telomere maintenance through the regulation of hTERT expression [ 12].
3: T417 phosphorylation of Elk-1, a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily, was found to be associated with the differentiation grade of colonic adenocarcinomas [ 13].
4: Additionally, in high clinical stage prostate cancer, ELK-1, not TCF members ELK3 or ELK4, was found to be associated with disease recurrence [ 14].
5: In fact, ELK1 expression was reported to be higher than ELK3 in many cancer cell lines, including brain, skin, and myeloid tumors and sarcomas [ 15].
6: PKC expression, parallel to cell migration and tumorigenicity, of hepatocellular carcinoma was increased by MZF/Elk-1 transcription factor complex [ 16].
7: The PEA3 subfamily of ETS domain transcription factors was also involved in a number of cancers, such as in lung tumors with MET amplification, and PEA3 subfamily members were found to play a role in migration and invasion [ 17].
8: In colorectal carcinoma, PEA3 was shown to promote invasiveness and metastatic potential [ 18].
9: In ovarian cancer, the loss of repressors of the PEA3 subfamily was shown to cause overaccumulation of ETV4 and ETV5 [ 19].

<p>Comparative functional analysis of the lung tissue in different treatment groups, using gene expression analysis, can give a detailed picture of changes caused by different treatments. Previous transcriptomics study of the lung tissue at the peak of BRSV infection without treatment predicted high production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species activation, lung tissue damage, complement and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, chemokine and cytokine signaling, leukocyte transendothelial migration, cell adhesion and MAPK signaling. These functions demonstrated a coordinated immune defense that occurs in the lung tissue to combat the infection [

Herein we describe results of the analysis of the transcriptome in lung tissue samples, collected at necropsy on day 10 after infection and 7 or 5 days of treatment. We analyzed the influence of potential treatment options with FPI and ibuprofen on the lung tissue of BRSV-infected calves. We have explored how treatments change transcriptomes of lung areas with gross pathological changes when compared with areas of the lung without visible changes. We also compared transcriptomes of both types of the lung tissue between the placebo group (placebo treatment but infected) and all treatment groups, which included treatment with either FPI alone or ibuprofen alone [

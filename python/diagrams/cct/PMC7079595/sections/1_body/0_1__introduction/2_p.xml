<p>The utilization of the beneficial microstructureâ€“mechanical properties relationships is only possible when the knowledge on phase transformation kinetics required for designing the heat treatment schedules is available. Increased Mn and Al additions are new in structural steels. Therefore, there is a need to develop phase transformations diagrams for steels containing new ranges of alloying elements. This should be done combining computational and experimental approaches [

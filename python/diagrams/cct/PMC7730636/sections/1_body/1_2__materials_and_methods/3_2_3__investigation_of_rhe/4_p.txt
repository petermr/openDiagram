0: R and  h are instantaneous radius and height of specimen, and  m is the friction coefficient.
1: Geometrical parameters can by determined according to the amount of barreling for specimen and the friction coefficient then is calculated as  (3)m=Rhb432b33 where  R is the theoretical radius,  h is the final height of the sample after compression, and  b is the barreling factor.
2: The theoretical radius  R can be determined as  (4)R=R0h0h and barreling factor as  (5)b=4RRhh where  R0 and  h0 are the initial dimension of sample,  h is the difference between the initial and final height of the sample, and  R is the difference between the largest and smallest radii of the deformed sample.

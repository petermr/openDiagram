<p>Test steel samples were austenitized at 1000–1400 °C for 3 min and cooled at 2 °C/s on LSCM. The final samples were cut in half and the inside microstructures were observed by OM and SEM, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f004">Figure 4</xref>. At the same cooling rate of 2 °C/s, with an increase in austenitizing temperature, the microstructure morphology exhibited a polygonal ferrite→bainite→acicular ferrite variation trend. The nucleation sites transferred from grain boundaries to intragranular inclusions with an increase in the austenitizing temperature. It is generally accepted that larger austenite grains promote acicular ferrite nucleation. Lee et al. found that the relationship between the acicular ferrite fraction and austenite grain size followed a C-type curve [

The samples were prepared by dissolving in DMSO solution (not more than 50&#160;&#956;L in 5&#160;mL solution) and it was applied in 5&#160;mL brine solution to attain the concentrations of 0.0195 to 10.0&#160;&#956;g/mL. DMSO (50&#160;&#956;L) was used as negative control. Standard vincristine sulphate (VcS) (0.078&#160;&#956;g/mL to 10.0&#160;&#956;g/mL) was used as positive control. Approximately 10 matured nauplii were taken to each vial. The numbers of surviving nauplii were counted after 24&#160;h. The lethal concentrations (LC

<p>The hardness tests of the welded joint revealed that the weld hardness was lower by approximately 40 HV1 in relation to that of the base material (280 HV1). The HAZ hardness was restricted between the hardness of the weld and that of the base material (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-01312-f012">Figure 12</xref>). In the case of MAG welding, hardness increases in the weld area, which is related to the introduction of elements increasing the chart (Ni,Cr,Mo) to the weld. In the HAZ area, there is a decrease in hardness as a result of grain growth and partial recrystallization. The X-ray phase analysis revealed that the weld made using the laser beam was entirely composed of the Feα (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-01312-f014">Figure 14</xref>). The presence of the Feγ phase can be attributed to the presence of austenitic alloying elements, e.g., Ni or C in the weld bed. During laser welding, toughness was very low, i.e., below 20 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. In laser welds made without filler metal, the content of titanium and niobium was much higher than in welded joints made using an arc (filler metal does not contain titanium and niobium). The higher content of hardening components was responsible for the lower toughness of the weld (if compared with that of the base material). The increased content of hardening components was particularly noticeable near the melting area (which was confirmed by a detailed analysis of the chemical composition made using a microanalyzer with an electron probe) (

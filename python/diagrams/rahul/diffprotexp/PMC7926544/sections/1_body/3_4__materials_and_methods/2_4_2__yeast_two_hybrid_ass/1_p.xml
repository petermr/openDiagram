<p>Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening was performed as described previously in details [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, the cDNA fragment encoding the distal region of the NKCC2 C terminus (last 195 aa) was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBKT7-BD and transformed into the yeast strain AH109. AH109 expressing the bait was then mated with the Y187 yeast strain pretransformed with a human kidney cDNA library constructed in the pACT2-AD vector. Mated yeast cells were first grown on low stringency selection plates (−Leu, −Trp, −His) and then on high stringency selection plates (−Leu, −Trp, −His, −Ade). Colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity, and DNA from positive clones encoding the putative interacting proteins was isolated from yeast cells using the RPM yeast plasmid isolation kit (BIO 101 Systems, Illkirch, France). Prey plasmids were rescued by transformation into DH5 α bacteria (Invitrogen) and isolated using a Qiagen kit. cDNA plasmids were then sequenced and assessed using the BLAST program.

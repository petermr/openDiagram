0: Whole tissue total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
1: Briefly, 0.1 mL of whole tissue homogenate was mixed with 0.9 mL of physiological saline (0.9% NaCl), and then 0.1 mL of 15mM pyrogallic acid was added.
2: The activity was measured at 420 nm for 3 min using a multidetection microplate reader (Infinite 200; Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) and expressed as U/mg protein.
3: One unit was determined as the amount of enzyme that inhibited the oxidation of pyrogallic acid by 50%.
4: Experiments for MDA content and SOD activity were performed in triplicate in this study.

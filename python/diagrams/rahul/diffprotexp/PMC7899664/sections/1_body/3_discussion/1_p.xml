<p>In this study, we describe the development and testing of a novel topical 4-MU formulation that results in effective reduction of HA in the murine skin, while observing marked sex-based differences in the dermal response to topical 4-MU application. As we found HAS2 levels to be downregulated by topical 4-MU application; this synthase thus appears to be the most likely target in achieving these effects. With HAS1 as the main synthase involved in HA production by normal human epidermal keratinocytes and HAS2 as the primary isoform in dermal fibroblasts, it appears that these isoforms are differentially regulated by 4-MU topical application, a process which could have influenced our findings (Day and de la Motte 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Malaisse et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Despite this, our work provides important insight into the mechanism of action and cellular players affected by 4-MU in the skin, as the current literature is disparate with mechanisms not completely elucidated (Malaisse et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Some have shown that tissue injury stimulates an increase in HAS2 and −3 expression and thereby HA levels in the dermis: the physical action of application of a topical product or the product itself can initiate a confounding dermal reaction in mice, as in tape stripping experiments, or the apparently inactive constituents of the solution (PG, EtOH) may have functional side effects (Balaji et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Garantziotis and Savani 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, we found HAS2 expression to be downregulated, not upregulated, with no gross changes in mice skin by observation after topical 4-MU application in both male and female mice, making this possibility unlikely and not a major concern in our studies.

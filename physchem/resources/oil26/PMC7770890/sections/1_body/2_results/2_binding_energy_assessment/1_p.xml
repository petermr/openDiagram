Therefore, reliable structure models could be built by homology modeling. On the basis of the experimental structure of the hACE2/S-RBD complex, 20 residues (Q24, T27, F28, D30, K31, H34, E35, E37, D38, Y41, Q42, L79, M82, Y83, N330, K353, G354, D355, R357, and R393) were present at the interface of hACE2 within 4 Å of S-RBD.

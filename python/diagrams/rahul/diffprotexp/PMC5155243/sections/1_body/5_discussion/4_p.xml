<p>After DU exposure, it was most notable that proteins including SOD, ETHE1, and ACY-3 showed decrease in expression, and the reduction in their expression was more significant in MT−/− mice. SOD, also known as liver protein or orgotein, is an important anti-oxidant enzyme in organisms. It is extensively distributed in a variety of organisms including animals, plants, and microorganisms. SOD can remove harmful substances produced during metabolism in organisms, defend and block cell damage caused by oxygen free radicals, and repair damaged cells over time. The pressures of modern life, environmental contamination, a variety of types of radiation, and excessive exercise all cause the production of large amounts of oxygen free radicals; therefore, the status of SOD in the biological antioxidant mechanism is becoming increasingly important. The results of this study suggest that one important mechanism of DU intoxication is to induce a reduction of SOD to increase the production of reactive oxygen species in the body, which further confirm the results of a previous study

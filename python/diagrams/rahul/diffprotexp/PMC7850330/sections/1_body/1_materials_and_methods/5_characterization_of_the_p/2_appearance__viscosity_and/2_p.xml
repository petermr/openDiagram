<p>The prepared nanoemulsions were visually examined by inspecting the transparency on light reflections. Their pH was determined using a pH meter (model 361, Systronics). Viscosity of the prepared nanoemulsions were investigated using a Brook Field Viscometer (LVF 69726) with a UL-adapter. All the investigations were accomplished in triplicate at 25 °C.</p>

<p>Besides, we speculated on the protein interaction networks of the 131 candidate genes through STRING software and described the largest independent protein network comprising of 31 candidate genes using Cytoscape software (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Then, we used 12 topology analysis methods to detect the top 5 hub genes of this largest network by cytoHubba plug-in respectively. We found that both 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> and 
 <italic>MAVS</italic> gene appeared in 8 methods with most frequently (Table S4).

<p>ERK is the up-stream kinase of CREB. If the ERK inhibitor (PD98059) was present in the NIM, the inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway had only a minimal effect on the secretion of BDNF in the first 64 h (

However, in the presence of ERK inhibitor, the cells gradually underwent apoptosis after day 4 but the differentiated cells survived in the NIM without ERK inhibitor. This suggests that inhibiting ERK could also reduce the secretion of BDNF, which is necessary for cell survival.

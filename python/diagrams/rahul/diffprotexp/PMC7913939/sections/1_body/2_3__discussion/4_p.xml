<p>Reduced

 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], where the cellular function of PrP was lost due its conversion to PrP scrapie, and the abnormal imaging patterns detectable in the cerebral cortex of CJD-affected patients are well characterized [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. MCT1 mRNA expression and immunoreactivity were identified as markedly diminished in the same brain area of sCJD as compared to control patients [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, investigating the differential cortical mRNA expression of genes engaged in neuroenergetics seemed to be a relevant issue.

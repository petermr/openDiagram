<p>Another major group of proteins affected by 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants is the histone family. Based on PPI analysis, it was found that the levels of three histone family members, histones H4, H2A and H2B, were strongly upregulated. It was reported that the expression levels of histone proteins and their acetylation were altered in PD brains (
 <xref rid="b56-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to clarify how 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants modulate the expression of these histones.

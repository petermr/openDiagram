0: Echinococcus granulosus infection of the host is a complex dynamic process, which involves the recognition and interaction of a variety of biological molecules, including genes [ 32], and miRNAs [ 33,  38], which are of great significance for understanding the interaction mechanism between the parasite and the host, and for identifying the key factors of immune regulation and immune evasion, since up-regulation or down-regulation of these molecular expressions likely underpin the phenotype changes associated with the different life cycle stages [ 3,  63].
1: If the antigens and candidate vaccine markers specifically expressed in each developmental stage of  E. granulosus can be screened from the perspective of molecular biology, this could provide the theoretical and practical basis for early diagnosis, preparation of new vaccines, and disease-resistant breeding of livestock.

<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>), thereby reducing water loss through evaporative cooling. Such increases in the maximum 24-h and decreases in the minimum 24-h body temperatures result in increases in the amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm. Because an increased amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm, termed heterothermy, is associated with an energy deficit or water deficit or both, it reflects a disruption of the physiological well-being of large mammals in their natural environment (

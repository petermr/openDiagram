 </sup>. More significantly, the TGF-β signalling pathway has multiple functions in mammalian ovary growth in sheep. The differential genes enriched in this TGF-β signalling pathway include AMHR2 and NBL1. AMHR2 belongs to the type II receptor family of TGF-β-related proteins—a serine/threonine kinase that is found in granules and follicle membrane cells. The first step in transformation of follicle development is the activation of primordial follicles. AMH can inhibit the activation of follicles in mouse ovaries and function through the type 2 receptor (AMHR2)

 </sup>. AMHR2 was down-regulated in the ovary of 3-months old Hu sheep and regulated by MSTRG.147351.1 and MSTRG.24344.3, which can effectively reduce the inhibitory effect of AMH on follicular development and promote activation and growth of embryonic follicles.

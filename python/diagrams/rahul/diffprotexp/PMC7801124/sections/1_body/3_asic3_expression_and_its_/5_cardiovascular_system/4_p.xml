<p>With regard to vascular functions of ASIC3, one contributing factor to migraine, as well as hypertension, is impaired activity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) [
 <xref rid="cit0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Interestingly, VSMC isolated from cerebral arteries of mice express ASIC3 albeit to a lesser extent than other ASIC subunits [
 <xref rid="cit0108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] and thus ASIC3 is expressed in cells whose dysfunction is associated with migraine and hypertension. Additionally, VSMCs are also implicated in wound healing, a function that becomes reduced upon silencing of ASIC3 (~30% decrease after 24Â hours) as chemotactic migration was inhibited [
 <xref rid="cit0109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], hence providing further supporting evidence for ASIC3 playing a role in the regulation of VSMC function.

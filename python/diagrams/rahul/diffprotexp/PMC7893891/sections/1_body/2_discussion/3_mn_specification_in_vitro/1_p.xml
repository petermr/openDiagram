<p id="Par82">The transcriptome analysis revealed the underlying molecular changes in differentiation of iPSC to mature MNs. Specifically, we observed that short-term inhibition of TGFÎ² signaling was sufficient to push iPSCs into NSCs and that continuous activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways ensured morphogenesis and cell survival throughout the MN differentiation and maturation process. While the majority of changes were characteristic of neuronal development, deeper analysis revealed the involvement of more unexpected genes as well as unique temporal changes. For example, the oscillatory pattern of 
 <italic>SKIL</italic> gene expression throughout the neuronal cell differentiation process suggests a regulatory feed-back loop that balances survival and cell differentiation programs. 
 <italic>PTCH1</italic>, a Shh receptor gene, is consistently and significantly upregulated from D7 to D28 suggesting a role as a positive regulator in neuronal cell division. Binding of Shh to PTCH1 results in the release of the smoothened protein initiating cell proliferation. Upon ligand binding, PTCH1 is trafficked away from the Shh positive regulator, G-coupled receptor SMO, resulting in downstream signal transduction [

 <italic>PTCH1</italic> by D28 supports the possible inhibition of cell proliferation and subsequent differentiation to neurons. 
 <italic>ARHGAP36</italic> and 
 <italic>CRMP1</italic>, both of which are downregulated simultaneously, encode for Rho GTPase activating protein 36 and collapsin response mediator protein 1, are implicated in semaphorin-induced growth cone and axon guidance [

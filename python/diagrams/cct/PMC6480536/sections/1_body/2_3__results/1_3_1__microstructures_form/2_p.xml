 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f003">Figure 3</xref>. With a low austenitization temperature of 950 °C, large-sized polygonal ferrite (PF) and pearlite were formed at a cooling rate of 0.5 °C/s. Ferrite grains became finer at 1.5 °C/s and bainite or martensite formed at higher cooling rates. With an austenitization temperature above 1050 °C, the microstructure morphology changed greatly. Acicular ferrite began to form evidently and its volume fraction increased with an increase in austenitization temperature. At a lower cooling rate of 0.5 °C/s, grain boundary allotriomorphic ferrite (GPF) still accounted for a considerable volume fraction. At 1.5 °C/s, almost a full AF structure was obtained with an austenitization temperature above 1150 °C. When the cooling rate rose to 15–50 °C/s, complex microstructures of AF–bainite or AF–martensite were formed. AF plates formed firstly at higher temperatures during cooling, and then bainite or martensite packets formed between AF plates.

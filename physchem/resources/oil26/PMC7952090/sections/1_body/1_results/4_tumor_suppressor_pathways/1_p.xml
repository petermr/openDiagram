<p>While duplication of cancer associated genes is common in Afrotheria, the 157 genes that duplicated in the Proboscidean stem-lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) were uniquely enriched in 12 pathways related to cancer biology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Among these uniquely enriched pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) were pathways related to the cell cycle, including ‘G0 and Early G1’, ‘G2/M Checkpoints’, and ‘Phosphorylation of the APC/C’, pathways related to DNA damage repair including ‘Global Genome Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER)’, ‘HDR through Single Strand Annealing (SSA)’, ‘Gap-filling DNA repair synthesis and ligation in GG-NER’, ‘Recognition of DNA damage by PCNA-containing replication complex’, and ‘DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER’, pathways related to telomere biology including ‘Extension of Telomeres’ and ‘Telomere Maintenance’, pathways related to the apoptosome including ‘Activation of caspases through apoptosome-mediated cleavage’, and pathways related to ‘mTORC1-mediated signaling’ and ‘mTOR signaling’, which play important roles in the biology of aging. Thus, duplication of genes with tumor suppressor functions is pervasive in Afrotherians, but genes in some pathways related to cancer biology and tumor suppression are uniquely duplicated in large-bodied (long-lived) Proboscideans (

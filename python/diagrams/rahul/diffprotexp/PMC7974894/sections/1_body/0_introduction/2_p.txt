0: RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are a class of proteins that interacting with a variety type of RNAs.
1: To date, more than 3800 human RBPs were determined in diverse cell types  9- 12.
2: These RBPs establish highly dynamic interactions with other proteins, coding and/or noncoding RNAs, and influence a variety of physiological and pathological processes including cancer  13.
3: Several investigations have shown that RBPs are dysregulated in different cancer types, and can impact on the expression and function of oncoproteins and tumor-suppressor proteins  14- 23.
4: However, it remains largely unclear of the role of RBPs in tongue cancer.
5: Thus, global analysis of the function impact of RBPs will provide better understanding of tongue cancer and new insight into tongue cancer therapy.

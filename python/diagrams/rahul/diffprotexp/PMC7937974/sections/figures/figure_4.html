 <caption> Increased oxidative phosphorylation in Kawasaki disease with coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL+) sera-treated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). (A) HCAECs were treated with deoxyglucose (50 μg/ml) and oligomycin (10 mM) for 12 h. Intracellular ATP content was determined by chemiluminescence apparatus. (B) HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from healthy controls (HCs; n = 6), Kawasaki disease without coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL–; n = 6), and KD-CAL+ ( n = 6) for 4 h. Intracellular ATP content was determined by chemiluminescence apparatus. (C) HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% serum from HC ( n = 6), KD-CAL– ( n = 6), and KD-CAL+ ( n = 6) for 4 h. Mitochondrial Complex I activity was determined in 340 nm with a microplate reader. (D) HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from HC ( n = 6), KD-CAL– ( n = 6), and KD-CAL+ ( n = 6) for 4 h. Mitochondrial gene copy number was measured by qPCR. (E,F) HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from HC ( n = 6), KD-CAL– ( n = 6), and KD-CAL+ ( n = 6) for 4 h. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by JC-1 (monomers green, aggregates red) analyzed by confocal microscopy. (F) Statistical analysis of relative fluorescence intensity (red/green). All samples were normalized to HCAECs with CAL serum treatment or control. The bar graphs are mean ± SEM. * P &lt; 0.05 and ** P &lt; 0.01 compared with the indicated group. </caption>

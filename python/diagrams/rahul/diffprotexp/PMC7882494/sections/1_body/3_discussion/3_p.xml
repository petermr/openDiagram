<p>The genomic alteration and mutation are the major inducers for the initiation and development of several cancers (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Loeb et al., 2008</xref>). In our study, it has been observed that up to 12% mutation that relates to the COL11A1 gene contributes to the development of colorectal cancer with the highest alteration in mucinous adenocarcinoma of colon and rectum (

Collectively, we can postulate that the COL11A1 gene interacts with the neighboring mediators to induce the downregulation of various biological signaling pathways. Enrichment network created through NetworkAnalyst shows GO enrichment of various biological and molecular pathways where the genes significantly associated with extracellular structure organization, collagen fibril organization, protein complex subunit organization, collagen metabolic process, and cell migration (

The PPI networks indicate the RAB31, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL11A1, and VCAN as the most important protein network that likely to be connected and show betweenness among themselves to significantly promote the prognosis of colorectal cancer (

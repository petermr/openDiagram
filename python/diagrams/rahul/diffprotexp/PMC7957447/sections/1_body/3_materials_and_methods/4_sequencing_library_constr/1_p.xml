<p id="Par27">The mRNA library construction was performed as previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In total, 113 transcriptome profiles were generated as follows: (1) rRNA was removed using RNase H; (2) globin RNA was removed using a QAIseq FastSelect RNA Removal Kit; (3) cDNA fragments purified by magnetic beads were successively mixed with End Repair Mix, and A-Tailing Mix by pipetting, followed by incubation; (4) PCR amplification; (5) library quality control and pooling cyclization were conducted. MiRNAs were enriched and purified, followed by adaptor ligation, unique molecular identifier (UMI)-labeled primer addition, and reverse transcription.

<p id="Par18">Pieces (weighing approximately 100 mg) of gray matter tissue from Brodmann area 10 (BA10) as PFC and NAc were isolated from frozen brain. For PFC, gray matter tissue was dissected from the frontal pole. NAc was identified on the frozen coronal slabs corresponding to the anterior one-third of the inferior temporal cortex. These frozen brain tissues were suspended in the 2% SDS solution, incubated for 20 min, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and sonicated for 10 min. Then, the samples were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1.76 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>) so that the final concentration of SDS was below 0.2%. The expression of proteins was determined by using commercial ELISA kits (SEB323Hu for Calcineurin, and SEE017Hu for DARPP-32, Cloud Clone Corp, Houston, TX). The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The expression levels of each protein were normalized against the total protein concentration.

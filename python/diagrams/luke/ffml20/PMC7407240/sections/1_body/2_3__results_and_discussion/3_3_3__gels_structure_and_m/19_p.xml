<p>The electrical conductance variation with the amount of added antibiotic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-01544-f011">Figure 11</xref>b) reveals that except for amoxicillin at pH = 3 (for which the carboxyl groups are ionized), in all cases a decrease in the overall conductance of the system is registered, signaling a degree of ionic interaction between Î¹-carrageenan and the antibiotic.

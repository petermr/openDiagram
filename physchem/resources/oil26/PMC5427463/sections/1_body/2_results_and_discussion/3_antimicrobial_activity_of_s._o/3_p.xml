<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Previous studies reported that there is a relationship between the chemical composition of the most abundant components in the EO and the antimicrobial activity (Deans and Sbodova, 1990[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). In this context, camphor, &#945; -thujone and 1,8-cineole (herein, abundants in SoEO) are well-known chemicals having antimicrobial potentials (Pattnaik et al., 1997[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). &#945;-pinene, 2-&#946;-pinene and limonene also had a strong antibacterial activity (S&#246;kmen et al., 2003[<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). These chemical components exerted their toxic effects against microorganisms through the disruption of bacteria or fungal membrane integrity (Knobloch et al., 1989[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). In addition, the SoEO contained relatively high proportions of oxygenated monoterpenes (Table 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>) and it is well known that essential oils containing high proportions of oxygenated monoterpenes have strong antifungal activities compared to EO relatively rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons or sesquiterpenes (Kordali et al., 2005[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Therefore, the obtained antibacterial and antifungal activities were related to synergistic effects between different major and minor components of the SoEO, suggesting that the SoEO may potentially be useful in food preservation and pest management.</p>

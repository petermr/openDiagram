0: After the strong-cation exchange clean-up, the iTRAQ labeled samples underwent isoelectric focusing (IEF) by using two 24 cm 3.74.9 immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (GE Healthcare).
1: The samples were rehydrated in 8 M urea with bromophenol blue and 1% IPG buffer, subsequently loaded to the IPG strip and run according to previously published protocols [ 15,  16,  24].
2: After IEF, the IPG strip was fractionated to 72 fractions.
3: The obtained fractions were dried using SpeedVac and frozen at -20C until analysis.

 <sup>+</sup> striatal tissues were lysed in 4% SDS and then heated for 15 min at 95 °C. The lysates containing 2–5 μg protein each were separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and proteins were then transferred to PVDF. The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in 0.05%

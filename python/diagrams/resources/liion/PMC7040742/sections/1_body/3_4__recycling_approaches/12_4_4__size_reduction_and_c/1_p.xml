<p>Two main paths can be distinguished for the preparation of spent batteries prior to recycling: The entire cells, modules, or even battery packs are crushed; or the casing of the cells is cut opened, which provides access to the jelly roll. The former method is easier to implement industrially than the second one and is currently used by Recupyl and Retrieve Technology. Al-Thyabat et al. compiled a good review of crushing and screening studies including size-by-size analysis [

 <xref rid="B65-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This could be easily explained using the form factor of the crushed battery components. While the more brittle cathodic and anodic active materials brake into smaller fractions upon crushing, the more ductile metallic or plastic compounds (namely Cu and Al foil and the separator) maintain their flat shape and tend to remain on the mesh of the screen. Typically, a screen size of 0.6 mm appears to be advantageous for size segregation and can be easily scaled-up for industrial applications.

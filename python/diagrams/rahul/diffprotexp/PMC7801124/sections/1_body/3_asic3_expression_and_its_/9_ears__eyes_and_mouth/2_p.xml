<p>With regard to a role of ASIC3 in vision, in the mouse retina ASIC3 has been shown to be widely expressed, including the rod inner segment of photoreceptors, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells [

 <xref rid="cit0145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. This appears to provide a protective longevity role because ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice display retinal rod dysfunction and degeneration [

In addition, ASIC3 is expressed by sensory neurones innervating the eye where it may act to detect pH changes, such as the acidification observed in rabbit glaucoma models, where consistent high intraocular pressure (&gt;70 mmHg) leads to a drop in pH (7.32 to 7.03) [

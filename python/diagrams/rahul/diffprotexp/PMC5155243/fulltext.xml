MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice were administrated with a single dose of DU (10&#x02009;mg/kg, i.p.) or equal volume of saline. After 4 days, protein changes in kidney tissues were evaluated using a proteomics approach. A total of 13 differentially expressed proteins were identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The validating results showed that the expression of aminoacylase-3 (ACY-3) and the mitochondrial ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1) decreased significantly after DU exposure; in addition, the reduction in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was more significant than that in MT+/+ mice. The results also showed that exogenous ETHE1 or ACY-3 could increase the survival rate of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells after DU exposure. A specific siRNA of ETHE1 significantly increased cell apoptosis rates after DU exposure, whereas exogenous ETHE1 significantly decreased cell apoptosis rates. In summary, ACY-3 and ETHE1 might involve in protection roles of MT. ETHE1 could be a new sensitive molecular target of DU-induced cell apoptosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Depleted uranium (DU) is the remaining product after natural uranium is refined and condensed for nuclear fuel-uranium (<sup>235</sup>U). The <sup>235</sup>U content in DU is quite low, instead, DU is mainly composed of <sup>238</sup>U. Because of its high penetrability and low price, DU is widely used in counterweights, radiation-protective clothing, and military activities; however, it may cause serious threats to health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. DU is a heavy metal and can emit &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; particles; thus, it exhibits both heavy metal toxicity and radiotoxicity. The kidney is the major target organ of acute DU exposure, and DU can cause severe necrosis of renal proximal tubule endothelial cells, ultimately leading to acute renal failure or even death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The following mechanisms of action underlie the nephrotoxicity of DU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>: (1) altering ion transport in cells to inhibit the oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria and utilization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP); (2) altering the expression of certain genes (associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and homeostasis); and (3) increasing oxidative stress levels and decreasing anti-oxidation in cells, thus increasing DNA damage and promoting apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DU-induced nephrotoxicity are more complex, requiring in-depth studies to identify valuable sensitive molecular targets. The biological effect of low-dose DU chronic exposure may be different from acute DU exposure. Chronic uranium exposure induced increasing glutathione in rats without any nephrotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Vicente Vicente <italic>et al</italic>. reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> that, chronic uranium exposure could decrease the aminoglycoside toxicity threshold and predispose to acute renal failure.</p><p>For the treatment of DU intoxication, scholars mainly focused on DU decorporation in the body using synthetic chelating agents, and a series of agents have been developed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, there are few drugs with low toxicity that are highly effective in promoting the excretion of DU. Catechol-3,6-bis(methyleiminodiacetic acid) (CBMIDA) has been shown to reduce uranium burden without causing renal damage, but it also has low gastrointestinal absorption and the effect related to pH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>Metallothionein (MT) is a family of low molecular weight, sulphur-containing proteins and plays an important role in metal metabolism and protects cells against the toxic effects of radiation, alkylating agents and oxygen free radicals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> showed that pre-treatment with zinc results in significant detoxification effects in rats with acute DU intoxication. The detoxification mechanism might be associated with the synthesis of MT and enhanced anti-oxidative functions. Further study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> showed that MT-knockout mice (MT&#x02212;/&#x02212;) display significantly higher serum creatinine and urea nitrogen, severe pathological injury, a significant reduction of the activity of anti-superoxide anion free radicals, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and increased levels of malondialdehyde after DU exposure compared with wild-type mice (MT+/+). These results suggested that MT might play critical roles in antagonizing DU-induced nephrotoxicity, leading to new perspectives regarding the prevention and treatment of DU-induced injury. Furthermore, Jiang <italic>et al</italic>. reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> that MT exhibits significant protective functions in nematodes after DU exposure.</p><p>To further study the molecular mechanism underlying the resistance to DU-induced nephrotoxicity conferred by MT and investigate the effects of DU exposure on the expression of proteins in kidney tissues, in the present study, we first performed two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and stained proteins with a silver stain which exhibits higher sensitivity. The obtained gel images were analysed using Image Master 2D Elite 3.01. Then, 2-DE was performed again, and the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The differentially expressed protein spots visible to the naked eye were selected for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to perform peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis, and the PMF results were subjected to searches using the Mascot database. The differences in protein expression in kidney tissues following DU exposure in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice and MT+/+ mice were analysed to investigate the mechanism of action underlying DU-induced nephrotoxicity and the protective function of MT, to obtain many clues regarding DU intoxication and the protection mechanism of MT.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of gel images following 2-DE</title><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced DU sensitivity observed after MT knockout, the differences in protein samples from kidney tissues collected after exposure of MT+/+ mice and MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to DU or normal saline for 4&#x02009;d were evaluated using 2-DE. Typical results of silver staining of 2-DE images of samples in all groups are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. Image analysis was conducted using Image Master 2D Elite 3.01.

Pairwise comparisons between these 4 groups revealed 43 differential points using a 2-fold difference as a cut-off. After the images stained with silver were analysed using ImageMaster 2D Elite 3.01, 17 differentially expressed protein spots visible to the naked eye on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were selected.

According to the changing trends in each group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), these proteins were classified into 7 groups. (1) Under normal physiological conditions, the protein expression levels of ezrin, transthyretin, and ATP synthase-coupling factor 6 in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were higher than in MT+/+ mice. (2) Under physiological conditions, the protein expression levels of phosphotriesterase-related protein, &#x003bb;-crystallin homolog, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, propionyl-CoA carboxylase &#x003b1; chain, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were lower than in MT+/+ mice.

The levels of ACY-3 and ETHE1 in the kidney tissues of MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice both decreased after DU injection, and the reduction in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was even more significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b and c</xref>). These results were consistent with the results of 2-DE. The relevant findings for SOD have been confirmed in previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and the SOD levels in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice significantly decreased compared to those in MT+/+ mice after DU exposure.</p><p>In addition, the results showed that pretreatment with exogenous ETHE1 or ACY-3 protein could increase the survival rate of HEK293 cells after DU exposure, and the effect of exogenous ETHE1 seemed to be more significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Calcein-AM/PI staining also showed that exogenous ETHE1 or ACY-3 protein could reduce the number of dead cells induced by DU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These findings indicated that ACY-3 and ETHE1 might involve in protection roles of MT.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Relationship between DU exposure and the expression of the ETHE1 protein, and role of ETHE1 on cell survival rates after DU exposure</title><p>After a single peritoneal injection of DU into mice at a dose of 0, 2.5, 5, or 10&#x02009;mg/kg, the ETHE1 levels detected in kidney tissues after 4 days gradually decreased with an increase in the exposure dose and uranium accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a and b</xref>), suggesting that ETHE1 might be a DU toxicity-sensitive protein.</p><p>The conclusion based on animal experiments was further confirmed in HEK293 cell experiments. ETHE1 levels changed in a dose- and time-dependent manner after DU exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c and d</xref>). In addition, we found ETHE1 co-localized with the mitochondria in cells, which confirmed that ETHE1 mainly localized to the mitochondria and was a DU toxicity-sensitive protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). To clarify the function of ETHE1 in the nephrotoxicity of DU, we obtained an HEK293 cell line with a low level of ETHE1 expression through siRNA interference. The western blot results confirmed that the expression of ETHE1 protein decreased after siRNA interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction of the survival rate of cells after DU exposure was more significant compared with that in negative control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Application of exogenous MT could still significantly increase the survival rate of cells after DU exposure, and the survival rate of siRNA-ETHE1 cells was lower than that of negative control cells (transfected with a blank vector), suggesting that ETHE1 might be involved in the process of DU-induced nephrotoxicity. In addition, the protection of DU by MT might be partially achieved through the action of ETHE1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effects of ETHE1 on cell apoptosis after DU exposure</title><p>Next, our findings showed that the cell apoptosis rate in HEK293 cells subjected to ETHE1 siRNA interference was higher than that in negative control cells after DU exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a and b</xref>). Calcein-AM/PI staining further verified that DU induced more dead cells in siRNA-ETHE1 cells than in negative control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p><p>A previous study by our group showed that DU exposure could activate the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This study showed that pretreatment with exogenous ETHE1 protein could significantly relieve the DU-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a and b</xref>) and reduce cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). The ultrastructures appeared to be normal under TEM pretreatment with ETHE1 (100&#x02009;ng/ml) alone, and swollen mitochondria and nuclear chromatin concentration and edge accumulation were seen after DU exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Large numbers of apoptotic cells were also observed after DU exposure. However, pretreatment with exogenous ETHE1 protein, apoptotic cells and the severity of mitochondria damage were significantly lower. Therefore, ETHE1 might be involved in DU-induced cell apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>DU is employed extensively in civil and military activities. The kidney is the target organ of DU intoxication. Investigation of the mechanism underlying DU intoxication and the search for effective preventive measures deserve considerable attention worldwide. Previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> by our group showed that MT might have an important preventive function in DU-induced nephrotoxicity. The proteomics approach applied in this study identified a total 13 differentially expressed proteins based on a greater than 2-fold difference in expression and a Mascot search score higher than 64. These proteins included ezrin, ACY-3, ETHE1, transthyretin, ATP synthase-coupling factor 6, phosphotriesterase&#x02013;related protein, &#x003bb;-crystallin homolog, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, propionyl-CoA carboxylase &#x003b1; chain, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sarcosine dehydrogenase, N(G), N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1, and SOD. The functions of these proteins are mainly related to sugar and fatty acid metabolism, electron transport in the respiratory chain, and the anti-oxidative defence system. These results provide new clues for exploration of MT protection from DU.</p><p>MT is metal-binding protein involved in diverse processes, including metal homeostasis and detoxification, the oxidative stress response and cell proliferation. Aberrant expression and silencing of these genes are important in a number of diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> showed that MT might play an important role in antagonizing DU-induced nephrotoxicity, however, Ecker <italic>et al</italic>. showed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> that, yeast metallothionein conferred resistance to copper and cadmium, but not to uranium (data not showed). We think the difference may be related to species, exposure time and concentration. Michon <italic>et al</italic>. reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> that, 5 moles of U (VI) could be complexed by 1 mole of MT. In fact, though MT is the metalloprotein with low binding site density, MT could significantly alleviate depleted uranium-induced nephrotoxicity. In addition, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> MT-1 appeared to be important for DU accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>Under normal conditions, the kidney tissues of MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice exhibit differences in sugar and lipid metabolism and ATP synthesis. Similar to the results of previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, enzymes detected in heart tissues that are involved in lipid metabolism showed differences in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice. A genomics study by Miura <italic>et al</italic>. revealed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> 41 differentially expressed genes between the kidneys of MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice, 11 of which were associated with energy metabolism.</p><p>After DU exposure, it was most notable that proteins including SOD, ETHE1, and ACY-3 showed decrease in expression, and the reduction in their expression was more significant in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. SOD, also known as liver protein or orgotein, is an important anti-oxidant enzyme in organisms. It is extensively distributed in a variety of organisms including animals, plants, and microorganisms. SOD can remove harmful substances produced during metabolism in organisms, defend and block cell damage caused by oxygen free radicals, and repair damaged cells over time. The pressures of modern life, environmental contamination, a variety of types of radiation, and excessive exercise all cause the production of large amounts of oxygen free radicals; therefore, the status of SOD in the biological antioxidant mechanism is becoming increasingly important. The results of this study suggest that one important mechanism of DU intoxication is to induce a reduction of SOD to increase the production of reactive oxygen species in the body, which further confirm the results of a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. On the other hand, these results also suggest that the anti-DU intoxication function of MT is associated with the reduction of SOD levels in kidney tissues.</p><p>There are few available studies on ACY-3. It has been reported that ACY-3 mainly localizes to the cytoplasm of proximal tubule epithelial cells, participates in the detoxification process of foreign substances in kidney, and is associated with nephrotoxicity induced by metabolic products (mercapturic acid)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Many toxic substances can be excreted from the body through the mercapturic acid metabolic pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The mercapturic acid metabolic pathway plays an important role in the protection of kidney functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Masereeuw <italic>et al</italic>. reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> that in the renal proximal tubule brush border, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) is responsible for the secretion of mercapturic acid into the urine. ACY-3 can catalyse the deacetylation of mercapturic acid, and the product of this reaction is non-toxic. However, with the action of cysteine-S-conjugated &#x003b2;-lyase, toxic substances are produced in the kidney. The precise enzymatic reaction in this metabolic process is still not clear. Mouse ACY-3 is composed of 4 homologous monomers. Each monomer is approximately 35&#x02009;kDa. ACY-3 localizes to the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the S1 segment of the renal proximal tubule. The resistance of ACY-3 to toxic substances in the kidney, thereby achieving protection of mitochondria in the S1 segment, can be explained by the following mechanisms: (1) reduction of the chance of activation of cysteine-S-conjugates (the production of toxic substances in the kidney is catalysed by mitochondrial cysteine-S-conjugated &#x003b2;-lyase); and (2) possible maintenance of the mercapturic acid gradient in cells and lumens through interaction with other proteins to promote the excretion of mercapturic acid by MRP2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The results of this study indicated that ACY-3 was present in the kidney tissues of both MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice and that the level of ACY-3 in the kidney tissues of MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was slightly higher than in MT+/+ mice. Upon DU exposure, ACY-3 levels decreased significantly in the kidney tissues of both MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice. The reduction of ACY-3 expression in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was even more significant, with ACY-3 expression being nearly undetectable in these mice. These results suggested that after DU intoxication, the level of ACY-3 in kidney tissues changed significantly; thus, the kidney was more prone to injury. MT could reduce this injury to some extent. Due to the loss of the MT gene, MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibited significantly decrease in ACY-3 expression levels; therefore, ACY-3 might not exert a protective function on DU-induced mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. Thus, MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were more sensitive to DU-induced nephrotoxicity. Further in-depth studies are still required to understand the roles of ACY-3 in DU intoxication and protection roles by MT.</p><p>ETHE1 is a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase discovered in recent years. ETHE1 exhibits a molecular weight of 30&#x02009;kDa and is associated with energy production. The protein is homodimeric and contains a metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase domain. ETHE1 is involved in metabolic homeostasis in mitochondria and can bind to nuclear transcription factors and translocate to the cytoplasm to inhibit p53-induced apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> have shown that a defect in the ETHE1 gene can induce a severe mitochondrial disease (ethylmalonic encephalopathy), causing energy metabolism disorders in cells. The results of this study showed that ETHE1 levels in the kidney tissues of MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MT+/+ mice decreased significantly after DU exposure, suggesting the possibility of increased cell apoptosis. The reduction of ETHE1 expression observed in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was even more significant. In addition, exogenous MT could significantly increase the survival of HEK 293 cells after DU exposure, and the survival rate of ETHE1 siRNA-treated cells was lower than that of the negative control cells (transfected with empty vectors). These results further indicated that ETHE1 is involved in the DU-induced nephrotoxicity process. MT might reduce DU-induced kidney cell injury partially through inhibiting the reduction of ETHE1. The results of this study also suggested that DU exerted its cytotoxicity function and promoted kidney cell apoptosis through the reduction of ETHE1, which might represent a new route of DU intoxication. Further analyses confirmed that ETHE1 mainly localized in the mitochondria and that following DU exposure, HEK293 cells subjected to ETHE1 knockdown through siRNA interference exhibited higher apoptosis rates compared with the negative control cells. Exogenous ETHE1 protein could significantly relieve the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, alleviated the swelling of mitochondria under TEM and reduce cell apoptosis after DU exposure, suggesting that ETHE1 might be involved in DU-induced cell apoptosis and could be a new DU toxicity-sensitive protein.</p><p>In summary, the levels of SOD, ETHE1, and ACY-3 significantly decreased after DU exposure, and this phenomenon was more prominent in MT&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. These results suggested that these proteins might be involved in the process of DU-induced nephrotoxicity, and MT might reduce kidney injury to some extent through altering the concentrations of these proteins. Furthermore, ETHE1 could represent a new DU toxicity-sensitive protein and is associated with DU-induced cell apoptosis.

Frozen kidney tissues were ground into powder under low-temperature conditions. Protein lysis buffer was added at a 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;volume, and tissues were homogenized in an ice bath for 1&#x02009;min using a homogenizer. The resultant homogenates were ultra-sonicated 3 times using 5&#x02013;8 bursts each time. The samples were placed at room temperature for 10&#x02009;min and then centrifuged at 12,000&#x02009;g for 20&#x02009;min at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was collected and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for future use. Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) colorimetry.</p><p>Two-dimensional electrophoresis through isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the first dimension with an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) was performed as follows. A specific amount of protein was accurately aspirated (150&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of protein loaded for silver-stained samples and 1.0&#x02009;mg for Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained samples), and rehydration buffer was added to a final volume of 350&#x02009;&#x003bc;L. After thorough mixing, the samples were loaded into the IPG gel wells between the positive and negative electrodes. The protective membrane of the pre-made IPG gel strip (18&#x02009;cm, pH 3~10, NL) (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) was then removed, and the samples in the gel well were covered with the strip, with the gel side facing downward. The gel strip was slowly pressed down to avoid bubbles. The top of the gel strip was then evenly sealed with 1&#x02009;ml of cover oil. The cover was secured, and IEF was performed in an IPG-IEF apparatus (BioRad). After the IEF step was completed, the IPG gel strip was balanced. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 12%), as the second dimension in 2-DE, was then performed vertically on the PH-balanced IPG gel strip. The settings of the electrophoresis parameters were as follows: 20&#x02009;mA/gel and electrophoresis at a constant current for 40&#x02009;min, followed by 30&#x02009;mA/gel electrophoresis at a constant current until bromophenol blue reached the end of the gel. The gel was then stained with silver nitrate or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (BioRad).</p><p>The stained electrophoresis gels were scanned in an optical image scanner (BioRad) in 256 colours at a resolution of 300&#x02009;dpi. Image analysis was performed using Image Master 2D Elite 3.01 software (BioRad) to obtain the isoelectric point and relative concentration of each protein spot.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PMF analysis of differentially expressed proteins and preliminary identification of proteins through database searches</title><p>Protein spot digestion and protein identification were performed as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The target protein spots in the 2-DE gels were selected and submitted to trypsin digestion using the Montage In-Gel DigestZP Kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). A Bruker REFLEX III MALDI-TOF-MS instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was used for the analysis. The mass accuracy of the mass spectral peak was calibrated using the auto-digestion peak of trypsin. The mass spectrometry data were subjected to NCBI (version 18/09/2010) database searches using Mascot software (version 2.2.04; Matrix Science, London, UK). According to the input protein isoelectric point, molecular weight range, and PMF data, searches for proteins with matching parameters were performed in the database.

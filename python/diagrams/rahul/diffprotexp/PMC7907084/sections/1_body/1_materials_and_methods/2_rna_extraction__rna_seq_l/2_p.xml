<p id="Par9">RNA-seq libraries were prepared following the standard Illumina protocols by Novogene (Beijing, China). In brief, mRNA (at least 3 μg, equally pooled from 5 hens) were enriched from total RNA by poly-A oligo-attached magnetic beads with an integrity value &gt; 8.0. Double-stranded complementary DNA was synthesized with random hexamer primers and purified with AMPure XP beads. Inserts with expected size were concentrated and subjected for transcriptome analyses.</p>

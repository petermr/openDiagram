0: The SEM and XPS analyses were performed by first extracting the electrode samples from the fully discharged graphite/NCM622 pouch cells after cycling and washing 3 with EMC.
1: XPS tests were conducted on a PHI VersaProbe II Scanning XPS Microprobe.
2: The samples were loaded in a glove box and transferred into the instrument through a vacuum transfer vessel.
3: SEM imaging was performed on an FEI Nova NanoSEM 630 SEM instrument.

<p>We applied the low input proteomic-sample preparation workflow to nuclei preparations from either D1 or D2 MSNs freshly isolated from mouse striatal tissue. To our knowledge, this study provides the first proteome analyses of the two major MSN cell types from striatum. On average, ~700 protein groups were quantified with high reproducibility, as shown by the high replicate recall among the four D1 and four D2 biological replicates, i.e., 685 (96%) of the 714 proteins identified in all samples had no missing values in any of the four D1 or four D2 biological replicate samples. Cellular component analyses annotated all 685 protein groups that were identified across all eight TMT analyses without any missing values. These analyses indicated that 360 (53%) of the annotated proteins were found in the nucleus. The finding that the purified nuclei contained 325 proteins that are usually found only in the cytosol (86 proteins) and in other cellular compartments (239 proteins, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, etc.) suggests that the gradient centrifugation and subsequent FANS separation of briefly fixed tissue may not have been sufficient to remove all non-nuclear proteins. </p>

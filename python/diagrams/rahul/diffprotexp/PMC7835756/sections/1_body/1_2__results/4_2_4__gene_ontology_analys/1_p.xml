<p>The gene-ontology analysis applied to the DmCs in protein-coding regions showed enrichment in hypomethylated DmCs on respiratory and energy metabolism (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00178">Figure S2</xref>). In the category biological process, the functions identified were photosynthetic electron transport chain, photosynthesis, photosynthetic light reactions, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, electron transport chain. In the category molecular function, the hypermethylated DmCs were associated with enrichment for the ADP binding process.

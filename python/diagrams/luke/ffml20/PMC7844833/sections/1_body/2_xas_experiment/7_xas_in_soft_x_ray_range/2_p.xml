<p>The high penetration depth of hard X-rays in the XAS method provides obvious advantages for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> studies by ensuring sufficient flexibility in the choice of sample environment geometry and materials used. However, in many cases, spectroscopical investigations in the soft X-ray range (with X-ray energies below 5 keV) can provide important clues about catalyst structure.

 </sup> For example, L-edges (and even M-edges) of transition metals can be accessed in soft X-ray/UHV experiments, which may be more sensitive to the oxidation state of the catalyst than K-edges. This fact was employed by Kornienko et al. for the determination of the oxidation state of Co in CoS

 </sup> and by Cheng et al. and Zhu et al. to determine the Ni oxidation state in Ni-based MOF catalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and urea oxidation reaction, respectively.

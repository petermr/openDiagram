<p>The HPC was obtained from biomass reed flower. The typical synthesis process is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Firstly, 40 mL deionized water (DI-water) was introduced into the 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then, 1 g reed flowers was dispersed in the deionized water. The mixture was heated to 220 °C for 12 h. When the Teflon-lined autoclave cooled to 25 °C, the hydrothermally synthesized product was taken out and centrifugally separated with DI-water. After the products were dried in a drying oven at 80 °C for 10 h, black powders were obtained. Then, 1 g powders and 1 g KOH were mixed evenly and added into 20-mL DI-water with magnetic stirring for 1 h. The mixture was dried at 80 °C for 10 h. In the next step, the compound was multistep calcinated at different temperatures (450 °C for 30 min, 650 °C for 30 min, and 800 °C for 1 h) under Ar protection with a heating rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, so that the products were fully activated and carbonized, creating plenty of pores in different sizes. After the furnace cooled to 25 °C, the products were washed by 10% HCl for 10 min and then washed by DI-water for 5 times. At last, the products were dried at 80 °C for 12 h for further testing.

  <p>GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes for glioma grades. Each glioma grade was clustered as up- and downregulated gene clusters. (
   <bold>A</bold>). GO and (
   <bold>B</bold>). KEGG analysis were performed by clusterProfiler with an adjusted 
   <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05. The gene ratio indicates the number of genes enriched with a corresponding GO or KEGG term among the total gene number introduced into the enrichme.nt analysis.

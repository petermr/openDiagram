0: To validate the expression profile of miRNAs, we selected miRNAs that showed differential expression between JGK 3 and Himchana 1 at S3 and/or S5 stages of seed development based on the smRNAseq data.
1: The expression levels of miRNAs at S3 and S5 stages of seed development in JGK 3 and Himchana 1 cultivars were analyzed via RTqPCR as described previously (Jain et al.,  2014).
2: Total RNA was isolated from these seed tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
3: The total RNA samples were quantified using NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies) and their quality was assessed based on absorbance ratios of 260/280 and 260/230.
4: The miRNAspecific stemloop RT and forward primers, and a universal reverse primer from stemloop region were designed (Table  S1).
5: About 50 ng of total RNA was used to perform reverse transcription with the help of stemloop RT primer for each miRNA using mirVanaTM qRTPCR miRNA Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per manufacturer's recommendations for three biological replicates of each sample.
6: To quantify the expression of each miRNA, qPCR reactions were performed in three technical replicates using cDNA along with miRNAspecific forward and universal reverse primers using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
7: The relative expression levels of each miRNA in the chickpea cultivars were determined as described previously (Garg et al.,  2017).

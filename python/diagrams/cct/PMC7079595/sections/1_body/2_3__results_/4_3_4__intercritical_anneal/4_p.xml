 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f008">Figure 8</xref> presents the LM and SEM microstructures of the analyzed annealing variants. The microstructure, in all cases, is composed of thin layers of ferrite and austenite. As the dilatometry proved, at 720 °C, some fraction of martensite can be identified. In the case of the sample intercritically annealed at 720 °C, martensite laths have a different morphology as it is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f009">Figure 9</xref>. There are two morphologies: one smooth (white), which is retained austenite, and the second one, which is fragmented, corresponding to the martensite.

<p id="Par14">The potential interaction between lncRNAs and the target genes associated with ovary development was constructed in the Cytoscape software. The 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans</italic> regions of lncRNAs were differentially expressed in H1 vs H3 and H3 vs H8 groups. The estimated absolute correlation coefficient values were more than 0.9 with a 
 <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.01 and were subsequently used to study potential roles of the lncRNAs on the mRNAs. The results evidenced that, lncRNA regulates multiple mRNAs (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). By integrating the results of differential mRNAs and functional annotation of lncRNA target genes, several genes closely related to ovarian development were differentially expressed. Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), catenin (cadherin associated protein), ß1 (CTNNB1), anti-Müellerian hormone type-2 receptor (AMHR2), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) were significantly enriched in ovaries of H1 vs H3 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). These genes were enriched in cAMP signalling, ovarian steroidogenesis, TGF-β signalling, PI3K-Akt signalling, progesterone mediated oocyte maturation and oocyte maturation pathways and involved in vesicle development. We also identified fibroblast growth factors 7 (FGF7), prolactin receptor (PRLR), protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), secretion of inhibin A (INHB), and STAR genes in H3 vs H8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). These genes are involved in meiosis I process, oocyte development, oogenesis, islet-like growth factor binding, insulin-like growth factor receptor signal and JAK-STAT signal pathways.

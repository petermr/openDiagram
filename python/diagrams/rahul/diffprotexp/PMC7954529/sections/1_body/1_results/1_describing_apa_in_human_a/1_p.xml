<p>We performed 3' Seq of mRNA from six human and six chimpanzee LCLs, which we have previously used to study a variety of other functional genomic phenotypes, such as ribosome profiling to infer translation levels and mass spectrometry to measure protein levels (

The two cellular fractions serve as biological replicates, which we mainly used to examine the quality of our data (see 'Materials and methods'). By collecting data from isolated nuclei, we were able to capture polyadenylated transcripts before they became undetectable due to other regulatory processes, such as isoform-specific decay (

0: Spectral counting, the protocol in which abundance of a protein is expressed as the total number of tandem mass spectra matching its peptides (peptide spectrum matches, PSM), was used for comparative label-free analysis of heterophil and macrophage proteomes [ 17].
1: For a general comparison of protein abundance between heterophils and macrophages, PSMs belonging to a particular protein from all three groups of chickens, i.e.
2: 18 samples, were summed up.
3: The identification of at least two distinct peptides belonging to the particular protein and the threshold of at least 5 PSMs in at least one sample was required for its reliable identification [ 18,  19].
4: All data were normalized to the total number of PSMs in individual samples.
5: Statistical analysis using a  t test was performed and the proteins with  p value  0.05 and with at least four fold differences in its amounts were considered as significantly different in their abundance between the subpopulations.

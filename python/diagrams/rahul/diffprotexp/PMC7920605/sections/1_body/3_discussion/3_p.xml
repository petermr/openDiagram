<p>We conducted GO and KEGG analyses of differentially expressed m6A methylated genes. Biological processes and pathways related to inflammation, cell characteristics and cell fate, especially the NOD-like receptor single pathway, NF-κB pathway and cell apoptosis were enriched. NOD‐like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) gene polymorphisms have a direct relationship with inflammation in the course of RA. Guo et al
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> found that NLRP3 inflammatory bodies were highly activated in the synovium of RA patients and CIA rats, and the inhibition of NLRP3 could significantly improve the pathological symptoms. The NF-κB pathway plays an important role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Roman JA et al
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> found that NF-κB is differentially activated in RA synovium, and the NF-κB pathway regulates the expression of many inflammatory factors, such as cytokines and cell adhesion molecules, in the synovium and synovial fluid of RA patients. Apoptosis is an active programmed death of cells that maintains the stability of the body.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Both apoptosis and cell proliferation are precisely regulated by genes to ensure the dynamic balance of the number of cells in the body.
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It has been found that the damage to articular cartilage and bone tissue in the process of RA is closely related to the excessive proliferation of synovial cells and insufficient apoptosis.

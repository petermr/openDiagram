0: Nanoemulsions are colloidal systems consisting of two immiscible phases.
1: They are translucent having droplet size around 200  nm.
2: These systems are kinetically stabilized by the aid of surfactants or a mixture of surfactants and co-surfactants (Gurpreet and Singh,  2018).
3: Nanoemulsions have the advantages of controlling the drug release and the possibility of delivering a wide variety of therapeutic agents (Hoeller et al.,  2009).
4: Additionally, they are superior over macroemulsion in having larger surface area and free energy.
5: They also avoid coalescence, flocculation, creaming and sedimentation.
6: Nanoemulsions can be prepared adopting lower concentration of emulsifying agents and thus reducing surfactant-related toxicity (Liu et al.,  2011).
7: Furthermore, these systems have the ability to solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs and thus improve their permeation through mucosa and provide an advantageous formulation for delivering such drugs (Gaba et al.,  2019).

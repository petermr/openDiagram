0: Solubility parameters were determined according to the standardized American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) D 313284 procedure with slight modifications 62.
1: In the experiment, 1 ml of 0.1 mg/ml each PAMAM dendrimers generations 1.0G, 1.5G, 2.0G, 2.5G, 3.0G, 3.5G and 4.0G along with solvents with varied solubility parameters were kept in test tubes.
2: The test tubes were shaken at room temperature for 36 h in a shaker and allowed to stand to attain equilibrium.
3: Visual inspections were conducted for the evaluation of solubility.

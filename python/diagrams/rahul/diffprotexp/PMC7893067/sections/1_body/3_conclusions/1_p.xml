<p id="Par23">Our data provide the first resource for the subcellular localization of RNA transcript in the human brain. We show significant differences in RNA expression for both protein-coding and lncRNAs between the cytosol and the nucleus. We also provide novel knowledge about the subcellular localization of NEMP transcripts, which could provide deeper insights into mitochondrial gene expression regulation. Our data suggest that using cytosol or nuclear RNA as a source for gene expression analysis might bias measurements of transcript levels.</p>

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To face seasonal declines in resource abundance and/or temperature, many endothermic animals have developed the ability to save energy via heterothermy, whereby metabolic rate is substantially reduced and body temperature falls to within a few degrees of ambient (Ruf and Geiser, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In his review, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00436">Geiser</ext-link> outlines the state-of-the-art of ecological, physiological, and life-history correlates of heterothermy. He remarks that hibernation (i.e., hypometabolic states lasting days or weeks), which occurs in mammals from all three subclasses but only in a single bird species, is not as seasonal as commonly thought and is strictly limited to winter in relatively few species. The expression of short bouts of daily torpor (i.e., hypometabolic states lasting a few hours) varies depending on environmental conditions and predation pressure. For this reason, the seasonal expression of torpor is not as clear-cut as commonly assumed and differs between true hibernators and daily heterotherms. Torpor is often associated with cold and seasonal habitats, but it is also common in the tropics and elsewhere at low latitudes. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.00060">Nowack et al.</ext-link> report that the triggers of heterothermy and resulting patterns of metabolic rate and body temperature in low latitude heterotherms are often noticeably different from their high-latitude counterparts. Thus, while the underlying physiological regulation appears to be similar, low latitude species use torpor more flexibly, both in terms of seasonal timing and torpor bout length. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00522">Dausmann et al.</ext-link> explore aspects of the regulation of heterothermy in a tropical species, the lesser hedgehog tenrec (<italic>Echinops telfairi</italic>) that uses torpor throughout the year. Tenrecs use variation in environmental temperature to both passively rewarm from torpor (hence saving energy) and as a <italic>zeitgeber</italic> to synchronize active and resting periods during summer and to time arousals during hibernation. Flexible year-round use of heterothermy is also used by the edible dormouse (<italic>Glis glis</italic>). The seasonal adaptations of this species are reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00423">Ruf and Bieber.</ext-link> The edible dormouse not only adapt to predictable seasonal variation in climate, but also to semi-predictable year-to-year variation in food availability, and day-to-day variation in weather. Edible dormice can hibernate for almost a year and skip reproduction in resource-poor years but breed intensively and show hyperphagia in years when food is bountiful. The switch between these extreme strategies is modulated by future reproductive potential with increased risk-taking behavior as the animals age.</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty-five differential metabolites in PASCs were found compared with SASCs (FC &gt;2.0, FDR &lt;0.05). MetaboAnalysis 3.0 was used to analyze the metabolic pathways of significantly different metabolites. The results showed that the differential metabolites were primarily involved in seven metabolic pathways (

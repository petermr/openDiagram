<p>We observed changes at the mRNA and protein levels for Tyr and Dct and protein for Tyrp1 without 
 <italic>Mitf</italic> gene expression changes, suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms are related, i.e., regulation mediated by sets of miRNAs. Downregulation of tyrosinase gene expression by 5-Brd-2′-dU is not due to incorporating this analog into upstream sequences of the tyrosinase gene. Therefore, the mechanism of pigment inhibition is not elucidated yet [

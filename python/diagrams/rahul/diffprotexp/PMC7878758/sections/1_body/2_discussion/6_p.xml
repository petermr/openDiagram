 </sup> indicating its association during the initial stages of regeneration. Organ and organismal development network pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) were associated with ACTC1, ACTG1, BIN1, CAPZA2 and CAPZB genes/proteins. This pathway identified the family of actins and cytoskeletal proteins involvement during the development along with translational regulators enabling the mechanism to functionalize in an ordered manner. Skeletal and muscular system development network pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e) was associated with CBR1, DLX3, EEF1B2 and DLX3 genes/proteins.

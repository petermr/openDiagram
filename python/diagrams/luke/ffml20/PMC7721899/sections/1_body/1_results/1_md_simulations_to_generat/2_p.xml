 </sup>. It is observed that the computed bulk modulus values are in good agreement with the experimental values which provides confidence in the reliability of the constructed C–S–H structures. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, it is observed that the experimental density values, obtained from literature, are scattered within a large range which can be attributed to the process by which the hydrated samples were dried under various environmental conditions

 </sup>. The densities obtained from MD simulations in the present work lie within the experimentally observed range. The general trend in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and d suggest that both bulk modulus and density decrease with an increase in the Ca/Si ratio. The influence of the composition of C–S–H on the elastic constants, as obtained from MD simulations, is detailed hereafter in the remainder of this section.

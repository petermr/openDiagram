<p>Genetic and clinical observations have highlighted an essential role of type I, type II and type III interferons (IFN-I, IFN-II and IFN-III) in SLE and CLE pathogenesis.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–13</xref> A ‘type I IFN signature’ has emerged as a major risk factor for SLE disease activity.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 14–17</xref> IFN signatures, and myxovirus resistance protein A (MXA), a protein induced by IFN, have been detected in the affected skin of patients with active CLE.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> The central role of IFN-I in CLE pathogenesis is further supported by data showing improvement in disease activity in participants with SLE with active skin disease treated with agents targeting IFN-I (anti-IFN-α or anti-IFN-I α/β receptor).
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> Recently, a humanised monoclonal antibody (BIIB059) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA-2), uniquely expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)—master regulators of the IFN response— showed following treatment a strong association between reduction in MXA expression in skin and reduction in disease activity and demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease activity in CLE.

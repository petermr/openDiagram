   <bold>a</bold>) Selected DSC cooling curves of X5CrNiCuNb16-4 after austenitisation at 1100 째C, 30 min. The DSC peaks between about 1000 째C and 600 째C indicate the quench-induced precipitation of Cu-rich particles, while the strong peak below about 200 째C corresponds to the martensitic transformation.

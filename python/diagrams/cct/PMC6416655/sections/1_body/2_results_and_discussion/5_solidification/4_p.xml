<p id="p0125">From the solidification characteristic curve of high-strength steel with low alloy content (D36 and X65) and high-alloy mould steel as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, the solidification contraction of the high-alloy steel was less than that of low-alloy steel below liquidus and solidus point. This information suggests the improvement of mould taper ensure the strength of primary slab shell. Moreover, the solidus point of high-alloy steel was less compared with low-alloy steel, and their liquid-solid phase temperature range was different (high-alloy steel ≥353 K, low-alloy steel 278–338 K). Therefore, during continuous casting, the strength of primary slab shell would be low.

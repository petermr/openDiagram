<p>In conclusion, we identified 356 high‐confidence miRNAs from different stages of seed development in a small‐seeded and a large‐seeded chickpea cultivar. Integration with transcriptome data of the same stages of seed development in these cultivars showed antagonistic correlation between miRNAs expression levels and/or differential expression of their target genes. Sets of co‐expressed miRNAs were detected and some of them were found to target genes involved in seed size/weight determination. Further, quite a few genes located in the known QTLs associated with seed size/weight were found to be the targets of miRNAs, suggesting their possible role in seed seed size/weight determination. Overall, our study provides new insights into the miRNA‐mediated regulation of seed development and seed size/weight determination in chickpea and provides few candidate genes for further functional analysis. In addition, miRNA data from different stages of seed development can serve as a useful resource for better understanding the biology of seed development in legumes and other crop plants.</p>

0: Reference was made to previously developed protocols  55,  75; proteins from six ovaries were extracted with RIPA lysis solution (Beyotime, P0013C).
1: After denaturation treatment, the protein of each sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Millipore, ISEQ00010, USA) membrane.
2: Subsequently, protein bands were blocked at a temperature of approximately 20 C for 2 h, and the primary antibody was incubated at 4 C overnight.
3: The following day, after three washes, the secondary antibodies were incubated.
4: Finally, a BeyoECL Plus kit (Beyotime, P0018) was used for chemiluminescence.
5: The primary antibodies used for Western blot consisted of MVH (Abcam, ab13840), GDF9 (Abcam, ab93892), LHX8 (Abcam, ab137036), BMPR1A (Affinity, DF6634, Shanghai, China), SMAD3 (Abcam, ab40854), and GAPDH (Affinity, AF7021).

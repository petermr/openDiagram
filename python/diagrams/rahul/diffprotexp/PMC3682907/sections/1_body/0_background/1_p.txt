0: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by demyelination, oligodendrocyte loss, axonal damage and neurodegeneration which results in progressive physical and cognitive disability [ 1].
1: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an autoimmune, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that mimics many of the clinical and histological features of MS, including the presence of cellular infiltrates as well as demyelination and axonal degeneration in the CNS [ 2, 3].
2: As a result, EAE has been widely employed as a model for studying the pathogenesis of MS and for the development of therapeutic approaches to treat the disease [ 4- 8].
3: There is much interest in the role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in human disease including cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases [ 9- 12].
4: A number of studies implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of neuropathology in MS. Decreases in the neuronal mitochondrial metabolite N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) in MS brain have been observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a decrease in NAA appears to precede neuronal atrophy, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may precede neurodegeneration [ 13, 14].
5: Alterations to mitochondrial enzyme activity and damage to mitochondrial DNA have been observed in MS white matter lesions [ 16- 20].
6: In addition, defects in mitochondrial electron transport gene expression and function in normal appearing gray matter (NAGM) in postmortem MS cortex have been reported [ 21, 22].
7: Mitochondrial dysfunction may also play a role in disease pathology in EAE.
8: Increased nitration of components of the electron transport chain leads to decreased mitochondrial activity in EAE [ 15].

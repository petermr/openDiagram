<p>By using the six hub RBPs as variables, we built a nomogram applied for clinical prognostic evaluation. Our study had some advantages over previous reports. Previous studies applied nomogram based on all the types of oral cancer or head and neck cancer, instead of a specific type of cancer 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, which may mask some cancer type specific phenomena due to the heterogeneity. Focusing on a specific type of cancer would produce a more accurate estimate of the risk causing patients' dying 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>. Here, we build a nomogram specifically applied for tongue cancer prognostic evaluation rather than oral cancer or head and neck cancer. Tongue cancer is a prevalent type in oral cavity with aggressive clinical behaviour and relatively low 5-year survival rate 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Prognostic evaluation based on gene expression profile may also provide information about whether the patients will benefit from targeted molecular therapy 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>. Collectively, compared to conventional TNM staging system, using the nomograms based on the identified hub RBPs may effectively improve the prediction of tongue cancer prognosis.

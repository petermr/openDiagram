<p>Many inflammatory mediators induce increases in [Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>]
 <sub>i</sub>, which activate phospholipase A2 (PLA
 <sub>2</sub>), an enzyme that cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce arachidonic acid (AA), the precursor to prostaglandin production. Although the roles of prostaglandins in nociceptor sensitization and pain are well understood, AA can itself have effects upon nociceptor function, including upon ASIC subunits, including ASIC3, i.e. 50 µM AA potentiates the pH 6.9 induced activation of the rASIC3 transient current 2-fold [

 <sub>2</sub> and activates rASIC3 currents at pH 7.4 with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 4.3 µM, an effect that was proposed to involve binding to the non-proton ligand binding site of ASIC3 [

There is also evidence for upregulation of nitric oxide (NO) during inflammation and the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) has been shown to potentiate the rASIC3 transient phase at 100 µM in pH 6.9 solution, an effect that appears to involve direct nitrosylation, rather than intracellular signaling cascades [

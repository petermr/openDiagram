0: The leaf samples collected from control (C - 22  2 C) and HS-treated (T 2 - 38 C, 2 h) wheat  cvs.
1: were used for the 2-DE in order to identify the DEPs.
2: 2D-Xtract kit (G Bioscience, USA) was used for the extraction and purification of total protein from 0.5 g tissue as per the instructions of the manufacturer.
3: Other steps for the Isoelectric focusing (Ist dimension run) and Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (IInd dimension run) were followed as mentioned in our earlier publication [ 20].
4: The 2-D Quant Kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK) was used for the protein quantitation.
5: The IPG strips (18 cm, 310 linear pH gradients) was hydrated with 40 g extracted protein diluted with rehydration buffer and IEF100 instrument was used for the separation of the proteins based on pI value.
6: The image of the protein spots on the gels were scanned using Gel Documentation system (Bio-Rad, USA) and further, IMP7 version 7.0.6 software (GE Healthcare) was used for the image characterization.
7: Based on the relative fold expression, 20 DEP spots (10 each) from HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk were used for the protein identification through MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis.
8: The silver stained spots were picked up and processed for MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis as mentioned in Kumar et al.
9: [ 21] and Kundu et al.
10: [ 22].

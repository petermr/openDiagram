<p id="p0070">Gels (six in total) were stained using Pierce Silver Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The stained gels were scanned using an image scanner (UMAX, Dallas, TX, USA) at 600 dpi. All detected spots were automatically matched by gel-to-gel comparison using the PDquest software version 8.0 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Areas of all detected spots were normalized. Those protein spots with reproducible and statistically significant changes in abundance were considered to be differentially expressed. Only those spots with quantitative changes &gt;1.5-fold in abundance,

<p id="Par6">In the PFC, we found that the expression levels of DARPP-32 evinced a significant decrease in patients with schizophrenia relative to controls (t (40.14) = 2.12, p = 0.040) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and that the expression of CaN tended to increase in patients with schizophrenia (t (40.72) = 1.97, p = 0.056) as compared with controls; the mean of CaN expression in 6 patients with bipolar disorder was higher than that of controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In the NAc, the expression levels of DARPP-32 and CaN showed no significant differences in schizophrenia patients relative to controls (t [23.14] = 1.54, p = 0.138; and t [34.16] = 1.56, p = 0.127; respectively; Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>); by contrast, each mean of two protein expressions in bipolar patients were higher than that of controls respectively (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

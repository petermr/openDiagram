0: Although the successful deployment of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in various fields such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles and electric grid, the efforts are still ongoing to pursue the next-generation battery systems with higher energy densities.
1: Interest has been increasing in the batteries relying on the multivalent-ions such as Mg  2+, Zn  2+, and Al  3+, because of the higher volumetric energy densities than those of monovalent-ion batteries including LIBs and Na-ion batteries.
2: Among them, magnesium batteries have attracted much attention due to the promising characteristics of Mg anode: a low redox potential (2.356 V vs. SHE), a high volumetric energy density (3,833 mAh cm  3), atmospheric stability and the earth-abundance.
3: However, the development of Mg batteries has progressed little since the first Mg-ion rechargeable battery was reported in 2000.
4: A severe technological bottleneck concerns the organic electrolytes, which have limited compatibility with Mg anode and form an Mg-ion insulating passivation layer on the anode surface.
5: Consequently, beneficial to the good chemical and mechanical stability, Mg-ion solid electrolyte should be a promising alternative to the liquid electrolyte.
6: Herein, a mini review is presented to focus on the recent development of Mg-ion solid conductor.
7: The performances and the limitations were also discussed in the review.
8: We hope that the mini review could provide a quick grasp of the challenges in the area and inspire researchers to develop applicable solid electrolyte candidates for Mg batteries.

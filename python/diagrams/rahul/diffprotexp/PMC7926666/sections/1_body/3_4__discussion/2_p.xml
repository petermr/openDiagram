<p>Our study reports the generation of the dPPI networks in RCC subtypes through the implementation of high throughput transcriptome and protein interactome data. The integration of respective RNA-seq datasets and differential interactome approach allowed the identification of dPPIs in different conditions (tumor/normal) in RCC subtypes. The study unveils and compares the dPPIs for each subtype and identifies DIPs through a differential interactome. Further analyses on DIPs may be useful in understanding the tumor mechanisms. For instance, our findings revealed that HspB1 protein is one of the common DIPs for three subtypes. The correlation between HspB1 expression in RCC subtypes and metastasis process has been revealed in previous studies and HspB1 is known to facilitate metastasis by suppressing anti-cancer response such as apoptosis and senescence [

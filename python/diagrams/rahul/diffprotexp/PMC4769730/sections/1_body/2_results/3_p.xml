<p>To better understand ECM metabolism and fibrosis/angiogenesis in glaucomatous TMs, MMPs 2/9/7 and TIMP1 as well as TGFβ1, VEGF were selected for Western Blot, Zymography and real-time PCR analysis. The Western Blot analysis showed as follows: increased expression for MMP2 (+1.39 ± 0.02 folds; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), TGFβ1 (+2.00 ± 0.53 folds; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and VEGF (+2.13 ± 0.41 folds; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); unchanged expression for MMP7 (+0.50 ± 0.39 folds; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05); and decreased expression for MMP9 (−3.71 ± 2.54 folds; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), TIMP1 (−1.43 ± 0.33 folds; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Zymography (a functional test) identified bands of gelatinolytic activity, respectively, at 66 and 72 kDa, corresponding to the active and pro MMP2, respectively, at 80 and 92 kDa, corresponding to the active and pro MMP9 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A high MMP9 gelatinolytic activity was also detected in non-glaucomatous control extracts (post-mortem specimens). Finally, the relative real-time PCR supported (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) the increased expression of MMP2 (+2.53 ± 0.02
 <sub>2log-ratio</sub>), TGFβ1 (+5.27 ± 0.03
 <sub>2log-ratio</sub>) and VEGF (+2.84 ± 0.16
 <sub>2log-ratio</sub>), and highlighted the deregulation of MMP7 (−3.77 ± 0.06
 <sub>2log-ratio</sub>).

<p>However, the adjustment of the CTWD is a simple and highly efficient strategy to affect energy input in gas metal arc welding, respectively WAAM. This can be demonstrated throughout the following Equations (1)â€“(4). It has to be stated that a change of CTWD has no influence on the wire feeding speed and almost no influence on the arc voltage [

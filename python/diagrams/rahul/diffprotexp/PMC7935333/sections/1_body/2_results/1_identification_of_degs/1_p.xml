<p>In this study, we performed a multistep bioinformatic analysis to screen key genes of TNBC, and the flow diagram is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. Firstly, to verify the grouping of TNBC and non-TNBC samples in the four datasets (GSE27447, GSE39004, GSE43358 and GSE45827), we performed PAM50 subtyping, and the heatmaps of each dataset are shown in

 </underline>. According to the result, most of the TNBC samples were of basal-like subtype, and this confirmed the representativeness of the TNBC datasets. Subsequently, we performed a differential expression analysis on the datasets, which contain a total of 77 TNBC and 186 non-TNBC samples. The distribution of the DEGs in each dataset is shown in

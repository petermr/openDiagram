<p id="p0135">Furthermore, when comparing PC + FC versus FA, in addition to the upregulated 
 <italic>ATM and p53 pathways</italic> we also detected upregulated 
 <italic>BRCA1 pathway</italic> and 
 <italic>NCI ATM pathway</italic> with its branch 
 <italic>G1 S transition checkpoint</italic>. In turn, the

 <italic>G1 S transition checkpoint</italic> branch of 
 <italic>NCI ATM pathway</italic> was upregulated, unlike the G2M checkpoint pathway. The 
 <italic>BRCA1 pathway</italic> is responsible for the regulation of DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints and controls multiple DNA repair processes, including homologous recombination, non-homologous end-joining, and single-strand annealing [

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, we conclude that PC + FC have higher activation levels of double strand DNA breaks repair, if compared with FA.

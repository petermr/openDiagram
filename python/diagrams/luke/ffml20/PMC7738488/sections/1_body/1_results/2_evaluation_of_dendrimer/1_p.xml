<p id="Par10">Progress of synthesis and differentiation of full and half-generation of dendrimers were confirmed spectrophotometrically. The synthesis of dendrimers reported here employed the usage of ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate, where, former act as initiator core and later as a repeating unit. The yields of 1.0G, 2.0G, 3.0G and 4.0G were reported to be 95, 92, 84 and 81%, respectively: and 0.5G, 1.5G, 2.5G and 3.5G were 90, 84, 81 and 72%, respectively. The copper sulfate color chelation reactions affirmed the completion of each synthetic step. The copper sulfate on reaction with terminal amine group gave deep blue color signifying the presence of half generation, whereas, reaction with terminal carboxyl group gave purple color distinctly affirming the presence of full generation, Fig.Â

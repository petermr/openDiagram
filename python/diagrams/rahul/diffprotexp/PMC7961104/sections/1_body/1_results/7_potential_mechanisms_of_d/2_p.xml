<p id="p0190">To explore ketone body cycle in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, we added the genes for the monocarboxylate transporters 
 <italic>Slc16a7</italic> to skeletal muscle and 
 <italic>Slc16a6</italic> to liver (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C) (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Newman and Verdin, 2014</xref>). 
 <italic>Slc16a7</italic> expression decreased in skeletal muscle, suggesting reduced capacity for ketone body transport. In contrast, 
 <italic>Slc16a6</italic> expression increased in liver, consistent with the previous report using overnight-fasted 
 <italic>db</italic>/
 <italic>db</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting an increased capacity for ketone body transport. We found that the DEMEs responsible for fatty acid degradation (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A) and ketone bodies (acetoacetate and 3-OH butyrate) production, such as Hmgcl (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase), Bdh1 (D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), and a rate-limiting enzyme of ketone body synthesis Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2), increased in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). This result suggests that the synthesis of 3-OH butyrate is potentially activated in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, although the metabolites for ketone body production, such as acetyl-CoA and 3-OH butyrate, did not significantly change. Further study is necessary to address whether the synthesis rate of 3-OH butyrate is activated in liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. Skeletal muscle exhibited reduced capacity for ketone body uptake (decreased 
 <italic>Slc16a7</italic> expression) and ketone body metabolism as suggested by decreased Bdh1 (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). Despite this increased capacity to produce and release the ketone body 3-OH butyrate by the liver and the decreased use of this ketone body by skeletal muscle from 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, blood concentrations of 3-OH butyrate were unchanged from WT mice.

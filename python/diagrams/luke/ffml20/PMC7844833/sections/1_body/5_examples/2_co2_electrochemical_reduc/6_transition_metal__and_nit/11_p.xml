<p>Interestingly, the structural changes in the oxidation state and local structure of Fe under reaction conditions seem to depend on the N-containing structural motifs in the Fe-anchoring site in Fe-based TMCNS,

 </sup> In this study, two catalysts were prepared, one with pyrrolic-type nitrogen dopants, another with pyridinic-type nitrogen dopants. The N-containing structural motif was controlled by choosing the Fe precursor either with pyrrolic or with pyridinic ligands. It was found from 
 <italic>operando</italic> XANES analysis at the Fe K-edge that under CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions with potentials as negative as −0.4 V versus RHE, the oxidation state of iron in the catalyst with pyrrolic-type motifs remained close to the initial value (ca. 3+) (

  <xref rid="fig31" ref-type="fig">31</xref>
 </xref>c). In the catalyst with pyridinic-type motifs, in turn, the Fe oxidation state was reduced when the potential was applied and was closer to 2+ (
 <xref rid="fig31" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig31" ref-type="fig">31</xref>
 </xref>d). In catalysts with pyrolic structural motifs, the reduction of the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> species was achieved only at potentials of −0.5 V versus RHE and more negative. Similarly as in the study by Leonard et al. described above, the reduction of Fe species was accompanied by the decrease of the Fe–N coordination number.

 </sup> The stability of the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> species, as ensured by the pyrrolic structural motifs, was linked to the superior efficiency of this catalyst for CO production observed at potentials between −0.2 and −0.5 V versus RHE.

<p>Having characterized its phase diagram and addressed the underlying mechanism of phase separation, the solubility of metal oxide in the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH system is investigated. The solubility of three transition metal oxides CoO, NiO, Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and one rare earth oxide Nd
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> commonly found in nickel-metal hydride batteries (NiMH) in a 73.0 wt.% [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl and 27.0 wt.% CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH mixture at 323 K for 24 h is presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05570-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The mixture composition was selected such that a biphasic system could be obtained through the addition of water after metal oxide dissolution, with a 2.7 molar excess of acetic acid relative to the IL. At this composition, the mixture presents a moderate viscosity of 106.7 cP at 293 K which decreases to a manageable 27.7 cP at 323 K (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05570-f004">Figure 4</xref>), an important consideration for the kinetics of mass transport during leaching. The water content of the “dry” mixture is of 1.3 wt.% H
 <sub>2</sub>O as measured by Karl–Fisher.

   <bold> DEHP devastated TGF-beta signal between germ cells and granulosa cells and further impaired follicular assembly. (A)</bold> UMAP plot of separated germ cell and granulosa cell subpopulations. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Dot plot of components of TGF-beta signal (including signal factors, receptors, target genes, and effectors) between germ cells and granulosa cells. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Components of TGF-beta signal between sample groups in germ cells (left) and granulosa cells (right). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Histological section staining of MVH (red) and GDF9 (green) with and without DEHP treatment at PD3. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar = 20 μm. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Detection of MVH, GDF9, and LHX8 protein levels at PD3 with and without DEHP exposure. MVH was used as a loading control to calculate relative protein levels of GDF9 and LHX8. Data are shown as mean ± SD (N represents independent repeats). *

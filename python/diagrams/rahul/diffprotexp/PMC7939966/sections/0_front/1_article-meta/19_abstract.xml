  <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen that survives and proliferates within protists such as 
  <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. in environment. However, intracellular pathogenic endosymbiosis and its implications within 
  <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. remain poorly understood. In this study, RNA sequencing analysis was used to investigate transcriptional changes in 
  <italic>A. castellanii</italic> in response to 
  <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. Based on RNA sequencing data, we identified 1,211 upregulated genes and 1,131 downregulated genes in 
  <italic>A. castellanii</italic> infected with 
  <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> for 12 hr. After 24 hr, 1,321 upregulated genes and 1,379 downregulated genes were identified. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that 
  <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> endosymbiosis enhanced hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and DNA binding while reducing oxidoreductase activity in the molecular function (MF) domain. In particular, multiple genes associated with the GO term ‘integral component of membrane’ were downregulated during endosymbiosis. The endosymbiont also induced differential expression of various methyltransferases and acetyltransferases in 
  <italic>A. castellanii</italic>. Findings herein are may significantly contribute to understanding endosymbiosis of 
  <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> within 
  <italic>A. castellanii</italic>.

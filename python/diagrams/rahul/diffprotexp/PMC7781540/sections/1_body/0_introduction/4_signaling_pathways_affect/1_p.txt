0: Studies probing into signaling pathways ( Figure 1) that are affected by K V1.3 blockers to produce these beneficial reductions in pro-inflammatory microglia functions 24 or 48 hours later have rendered somewhat conflicting results, suggesting that the effects of K V1.3 blockers are dependent on the stimulus and maybe the species.
1: While Fordyce  et al.
2: reported that K V1.3 blockers do not affect p38MAPK phosphorylation in LPS treated neonatal rat microglia [ 16], several other studies using mouse microglia have found that K V1.3 blockers strongly reduce p38MAPK phosphorylation as well as activation of NF-B following stimulation with LPS, AO, Syn Agg or HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 [ 7, 8, 24].
3: In the microglial cell line BV2 K V1.3 has also been shown to regulate S727 phosphorylation of STAT1 [ 26].
4: Interestingly, whether K V1.3 blockers inhibit NFAT translocation, one of the best studied effects of K V1.3 blockers in T cells [ 2, 32, 33] has not been investigated in microglia so far.

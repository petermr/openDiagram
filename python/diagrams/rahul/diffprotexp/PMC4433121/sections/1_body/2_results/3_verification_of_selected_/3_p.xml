<p>The main findings from IHC analyses are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and typical staining patterns are shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. All analyzed proteins were expressed in cPTCs. HBME-1 revealed higher expression in all cPTCs as compared to benign lesions (
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) in which only single positive cells showed a weak immunostaining (p&lt;0.05). Surrounding normal thyroid tissue showed low HBME-1 levels only. CK-19 demonstrated distinct moderate-to-strong expression patterns in 100% of the tumor cells in cPTC cases as compared to benign samples (p&lt;0.05), which were negative (
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), and normal thyrocytes surrounding the cPTCs, which were also negative. S100A13 showed a weak up-regulation in cPTCs compared to benign cases (
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), however the difference only showed borderline statistical significance (p = 0.07). Positive staining for S100A13 was observed in normal thyrocytes surrounding the cPTCs. Immunoexpression of ANXA3 and CMBL were detected in both cPTC and benign samples without being significantly different between the two groups. CMBL and ANXA3 exhibited similar immunostaining patterns in both cPTCs and benign samples, and positive staining for CMBL and ANXA3 was observed in normal thyrocytes surrounding the cPTCs (
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).

0: We have now applied RNA-seq technology to the analysis of intestinal regeneration in our model system, the sea cucumber  Holothuria glaberrima.
1: More importantly, to narrow down the genes involved in the early steps of the regenerative process we made two critical modifications in our experimental strategy.
2: First, we focused on tissues at day 1 and day 3 of regeneration, stages that take place prior to, or concomitant with, the first observed cellular events.
3: Second, regenerating tissues were compared to normal, uneviscerated mesentery.
4: By using this approach, we obtained a real view concerning temporal differential gene expression during early stages of intestinal regeneration.
5: Moreover, we were able to obtain a considerable amount of information regarding novel transcripts that appear to be activated during regeneration.

 <caption> Joint analysis of DEGs and DAMs between WT and MT Aifen No. 1 banana pseudostems. a Joint KEGG enrichment p-value histogram, b Pearson correlation coefficient of DEGs and DAMs in WT vs MT banana pseudostem represented as a nine-quadrant diagram. Black dots = unchanged genes/metabolites, green dots = DAMs with unchanged genes, red dots = DEGs with unchanged metabolites, blue dots = DEGs and DAMs. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is &gt; 0.8 throughout the nine-quadrant graph </caption>

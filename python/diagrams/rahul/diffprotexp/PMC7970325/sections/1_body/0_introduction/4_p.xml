<p id="p0020">DNA damage is one of the major causes that trigger the development of tumors [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, it also is an important focus in chemo and radiation therapy [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. DNA repair mechanisms restore damaged DNA and may have a dual effect on the tumor: they prevent new somatic mutations and may restrict tumor development, but they also restore tumor cells with damaged DNA after chemo and radiation therapy [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, when planning the chemo and/or radiation therapy, the possibility of DNA repair must be taken into account [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Low activities of DNA repair genes can make tumor cells more sensitive to the therapy, but at the same time not-repaired damaged tumor cells can form more new clones of treatment resistant cells [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. High activities of certain DNA repair genes, however, can counteract therapy of tumors [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, the selection of relevant therapy should ideally be based on the state of DNA repair in an individual tumor. Recently, defects in DNA repair were shown to play an important role in the clonal evolution of thyroid cancer [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Currently, the thyroid cancer subtypes need more detailed characterization in terms of molecular aspects of DNA repair. This is probably due to the apparent shortage of publicly available gene expression data associated with histological diagnoses of thyroid tumors [

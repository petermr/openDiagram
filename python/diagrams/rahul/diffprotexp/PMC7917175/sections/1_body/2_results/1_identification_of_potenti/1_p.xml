<p id="Par43">To identify potential antigens of PAAD, we first screened for the aberrantly expressed genes and detected 2459 overexpressed genes that likely encode tumor-associated antigens

 <bold>)</bold>. A total of 8850 mutated genes potentially encoding for tumor-specific antigens were then filtered by analyzing altered genome fraction and mutation counts in individual samples

 <bold>)</bold>. Mutational analysis showed that KRAS proto-oncogene GTPase (KRAS) and tumor protein p53 (p53) were the most frequently mutated genes in terms of both altered genome fraction and mutation counts

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d and e
 <bold>)</bold>. Of note, in addition to KRAS, p53 and diacylglycerol kinase beta in top 10 candidates with altered genome fractions, anoctamin 1, BCL2-like 2-poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 readthrough, brain enriched guanylate kinase associated, chromosome 1 open reading frame 87, chromosome 5 open reading frame 34, fem-1 homolog B, as well as immunoglobulin kappa variable 2D-24, all have the same mutation frequency, indicating the potential genomic interaction among them 
 <bold>(</bold>Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d
 <bold>)</bold>. High mutation counts were observed in titin, zinc finger protein 814, mucin 16, CUB and Sushi multiple domains 2, SMAD family member 4, dynein axonemal heavy chain 11, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha, and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A

 <bold>)</bold>. Overall, 926 overexpressed and frequently mutated tumor-specific genes were identified.

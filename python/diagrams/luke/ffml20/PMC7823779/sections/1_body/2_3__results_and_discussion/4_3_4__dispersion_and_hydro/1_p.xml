<p>The changes in structure affect dispersion performance. Since the preparation methods of GO and NGO dispersion are the same, the affinity of them with different solvents can be compared by the concentration of the dispersion. The result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f006">Figure 6</xref>a) shows that NGO is not as dispersible as GO in an aqueous solution. The dispersibility of NGO in o-DCB is better than that of GO, and NMP could be regarded as an excellent solvent, which is consistent with the hydrophobicity of nitro.

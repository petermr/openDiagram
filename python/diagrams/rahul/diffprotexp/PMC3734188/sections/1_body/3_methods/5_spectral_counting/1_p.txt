0: The spectral count weight (SCW, the proportion of one proteins spectral count compared to the total spectral count for one MS analysis) was used to estimate the relative abundance of one protein in each sample.
1: Each of the pooled perfusate samples from the model and control rats was subject to five MS analyses, as described above.
2: Ten sets of SCW values were obtained for every protein identified in the ten MS analyses.
3: The SCW value was set to zero when a protein was not identified in an MS analysis.
4: The difference between a proteins SCW values in the model and control groups was analyzed for statistical significance with Students  t-test using SPSS software (version 11.5).
5: A  p-value < 0.01 was set as the cut-off for statistical significance.

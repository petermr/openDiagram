<p id="Par44">Furthermore, we compared the binding sites of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> from Weis-Banke et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and identified 12,515 sites differentially bound (q &lt; 0.05) by the two proteins: 10,353 had stronger FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> signal and only 2,162 had stronger FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> signal, confirming strong gain-of-function of the mutated transcription factor. These differential sites were significantly associated with gene expression changes in our HGrC1 model overexpressing SMAD3, such as the striking examples of 
 <italic>TGFB2</italic> and 
 <italic>SMARCA4</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, overexpressed and with stronger FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> binding), and 
 <italic>NFKBIA</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, downregulated and with stronger FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> binding). We also found that these differential sites were more highly enriched at promoters of DEGs that were only regulated in FOXL2-
 <sup>C134W</sup> background (i.e. were not upregulated in the overexpressed FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup>), suggesting that these expression changes were more likely to be due to off target binding of the mutated FOXL2 than binding to canonical sites.

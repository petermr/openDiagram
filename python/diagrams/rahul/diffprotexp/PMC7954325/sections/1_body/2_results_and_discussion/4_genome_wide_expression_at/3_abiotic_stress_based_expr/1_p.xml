<p>Abiotic stress, such as salt, mannitol, water, and heat, can significantly impact the production of the potato crop. Salinity affects plant development and growth through interference with the plantâ€™s physiological system. The FPKM expression values were used to calculate the fold change (FC) and log 2 FC by comparing controls with respective treated samples (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247864.s004">S3 Table</xref>). The comparative analysis showed fifty-five 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> in leaf tissues after treatment with 150 mM NaCl. Out of these, thirteen had an expression of &gt; 2 FC, and thirty-one of 
 <italic>&lt;</italic> 2 FC. However, differential log 2 FC expression analysis showed that only 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 62 and 66 showed positive differential log 2 FC in salt stress condition. 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> that showed negatively differential log 2 FC expression during this salt stress were 
 <italic>StbZIP</italic> 7, 2, 4, 6, 23, 32, 38, 48, 49, 75, and 71. These 
 <italic>bZIPs</italic> could serve as negative regulators during salt stress.

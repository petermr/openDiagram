<p id="Par31">In summary, we utilized the iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics method to outline the consequences of CMS on the rat prefrontal cortex proteome. The unbiased profiles detected several prefrontal cortical protein candidates that were potentially correlated with susceptibility and resiliency to stress-induced anxiety or depression, and thereby provided new insights into the protein dysregulation mechanisms behind CMS in the stressed rats. The present results could serve as an important molecular basis, and enhance our understanding of the physio-pathological differences and similarities of stress-induced depression/anxiety and stress resistance.</p>

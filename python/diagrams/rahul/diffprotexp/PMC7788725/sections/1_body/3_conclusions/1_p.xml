<p id="Par47">LMNA mutations can affect the binding between LMNA or LAP2α-laminA/C complexes and euchromatin DNA. The disorder binding may cause DCM through the changes of CREBBP, PPP2R2B, BMP4, BMP7 expressions, and the dysregulation of WNT/β-catenin or TGFβ-BMP pathways. Our findings demonstrate the significance of WNT/β-catenin or TGFβ-BMP pathways and provide a theoretical basis that CREBBP, PPP2R2B, BMP4, and BMP7 serve as the potential biomarkers in LMNA mutation-associated DCM. By the proposed molecular pathogenesis mechanism, we provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of LMNA mutation-induced DCM, which provides clinical value for its treatment.</p>

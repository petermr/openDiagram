<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 24-well plates. After 24&#8201;h, the cells were treated with essential oil for 24&#8201;h and then lysed with, 10&#8201;&#956;L of 2% Triton X-100. The cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 3000&#8201;rpm for 5&#8201;min at 4&#8201;&#176;C. The supernatant (100&#8201;&#956;L) was mixed with 900&#8201;&#956;L of kit reaction mixture and the enzyme activity was measured in terms of intracellular LDH released into the medium at a wavelength of 340&#8201;nm.

<p>RNA extraction was performed by Proteinase K predigestion and EuroGold TRIfast extraction, according to the manufactures’ procedure (EuroClone, Pero, Milan, Italy). Equivalent total RNAs (170 ng; 260/280 rate &gt;1.8; Nanodrop) were used for cDNA synthesis that were carried out using 50 pM random primers and 200 U Reverse Transcriptase (IM-PROM kit, Promega, Milan, Italy) in a programmable PCR thermocycler (Primus 25 advanced-PCR; Peqlab LLC., Wilmington, USA). SYBR Green PCR amplifications (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were run in a PCR Opticon2 (MJ Research, Watertown, MA), according to a standard protocol. The specific primers used were as follows: MMP2, MMP7, TGFβ1, VEGF, 18S, H3, and β2MG). Negative/positive controls and single-mode melting curves were used to validate the amplifications.</p>

0: H9C2 were cultured under different conditions, digested by trypsin and resuspended.
1: 2  10 5 cells were seeded into the 6-well plate, respectively.
2: After 24 h of cell culture, the medium was replaced with DMEM medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for further culture for 24 h. The diameters of cardiomyocytes were measured by eyepiece microscale.
3: 6 cardiomyocytes with clear morphology were randomly selected from each group to measure the cell diameter by two experimenters independently.
4: All experiments were performed in triplicate.

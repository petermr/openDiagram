<p>The most frequently studied biological networks based on physical interactions are protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks, where nodes are proteins and links indicate direct binding, but the binding of a TF to its targets’ promoters can also be represented in a network. A particular type of biological network is pathways, curated and deposited in repositories such as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], where nodes can be either proteins or small molecules and edges indicate a variety of interactions, among which are enzymatic reactions. Genetic interactions such as synthetic lethal interactions can also be studied as networks [

Additionally, methods have been developed to build a variety of biological networks based on metabolic, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic data (reviewed in [

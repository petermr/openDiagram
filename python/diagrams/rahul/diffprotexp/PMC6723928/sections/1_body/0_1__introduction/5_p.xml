<p>To the best of our knowledge, no reports exist on proteomic studies comparing healthy pulp with inflamed pulp and/or traumatic pulp. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to (1) compare the proteins present in healthy pulp with those in the inflamed pulp or traumatic pulp and (2) identify differentially expressed proteins during disease using 2-DE followed by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.</p>

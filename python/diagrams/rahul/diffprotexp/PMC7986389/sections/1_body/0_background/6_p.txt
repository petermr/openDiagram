0: Furthermore, we consider a variation of the WMFVS method that pays more attention to the total weight of an FVS than to its size; i.e., it finds the maximum-weighted FVS.
1: We call this method WFVS.
2: In the next sections, we can see that WMFVS has a higher precision than WFVS, while WFVS has an advantage in recall.

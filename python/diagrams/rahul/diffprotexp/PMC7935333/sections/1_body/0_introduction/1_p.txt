0: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women and a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide.
1: 1 At present, breast cancer is categorized into four intrinsic molecular subtypes clinically, based on the presence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and ki67.
2: 2 Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 10% to 20% of all breast cancer cases, and is characterized by the lack of ER and PR expression and the absence of HER2 amplification.
3: 3 Compared with other molecular subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC is more commonly diagnosed in young women and is more prone to relapse and metastasis.
4: 46 Moreover, TNBC patients cannot benefit from endocrine or HER2 targeted therapy due to the absence of molecular targets, and this leads directly to poor clinical outcome.
5: Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC pathogenesis.

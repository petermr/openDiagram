  <p>Long-term activity patterns of aardvarks at Tswalu between July 2012 and September 2015. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Daily time of emergence and return to burrow of all study aardvarks in relation to times of sunrise and sunset. Values are averages for all aardvarks (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1 to 5 aardvarks) per day (
   <italic>N</italic> = 1,032 days). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Air temperature at time of emergence from (grey circles) and return to (white circles) the burrows, averaged across all aardvarks per day. The blue line represents minimum 24-h air temperature and the red line represents maximum 24-h air temperature. Temperature data were not available for periods in February 2013, November 2013, January 2014, and April 2014 because of weather station failure. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Duration of 24-h activity averaged across study aardvarks. Activity logger data were not available between March and July 2013 and after June 2015 because of failure of data loggers and deaths of several study aardvarks (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for details).

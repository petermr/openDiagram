<p>Based on our previous results with SLEV infection in ABR-/- mice and on the reduction of SLEV in IFNγ-/- mice brains, we investigated the expression of type I IFN and ISGs in mice after SLEV infection. Mice were again inoculated with SLEV and euthanized on day 7 p.i. for collection of brain samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10</xref>), which were processed and submitted to RT-qPCR to quantify the expression of IFNα4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10a</xref>) and ISGs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10b-f</xref>). We observed that IFNα4 is slightly upregulated in both WT and IFNγ-/- mice on day 7 p.i. but to similar levels between groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10a</xref>). RIG-I was the single ISG evaluated that was significantly upregulated upon SLEV infection, increased in the brains of WT infected mice when compared to WT mock control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10b</xref>). Expression of ISG20 and ISG15 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10c,d</xref>) were comparable to baseline in both infected and control groups, while expression of Mx1 and Mx2 was undetectable in all groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10e,f</xref>). In summary, we observed that the expression of IFNα4 and ISGs in the brains of infected mice at day 7 p.i. are discrete. Expression of ISGs is similar between SLEV-infected WT and IFNγ-/- mice, indicating IFNγ deficiency has little impact on the expression of ISGs in this model.

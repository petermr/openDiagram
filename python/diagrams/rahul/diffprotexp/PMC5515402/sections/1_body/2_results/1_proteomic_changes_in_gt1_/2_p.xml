<p>A total of 6,045 protein spots were detected automatically in the master 2D gel image, of which 84 protein spots were differentially expressed at a p value &lt;0.05. From those 84 spots, only 23 were distinguishable on the preparative gel and picked for protein identification by LC-MS/MS. For easy visualization, white arrows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180409.g001">Fig 1A</xref> show those 23 spots from a representative analytical gel. After DeCyder analysis, spot peaks were generated. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180409.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref> show examples of overexpressed (spot 2674) and underexpressed (spot 5747) protein-containing spots, respectively, during vehicle or AAS treatment.

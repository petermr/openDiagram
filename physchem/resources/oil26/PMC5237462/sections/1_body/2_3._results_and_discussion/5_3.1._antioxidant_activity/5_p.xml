However, previous studies of essential oil species showed menthol as the major compound, in which the radical scavenging activity is associated with the presence of compounds menthone and menthol, both compounds with the presence of the hydroxyl radical (-OH). The species<italic> M. piperita</italic> is described by several authors as a potential antioxidant, and there are also reports of cytotoxic activity. Some authors describe the possible elimination of monoterpene ketones (menthone and isomenthone) and 1,8-cineole in changing the chemical composition of the species [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

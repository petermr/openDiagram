<p>Nonetheless, we acknowledge the general point that it is interesting that the Grey module was associated with MIA at the trait level considering this module is made up of the unassigned genes that did not exhibit strong co-expression with the other modules. We explored this finding during our initial analysis to ensure that this was not due to WGCNA parameters. In other words, we tested if the MIA-associated genes in Grey would be assigned to a specific new module if we changed the module assignment parameters. When we increased the number of modules, the composition of Grey shifted, but the association with MIA remained. Further, increasing the number of modules resulted in over-splitting and some reduced biological coherence of individual modules. We thus elected to use WGCNA parameters that generated modules that effectively captured general trends of developmental expression as well as MIA-associated signatures, as reported in the manuscript. In response to the reviewerâ€™s point, we added text to the Discussion regarding the Grey-MIA association:</p>

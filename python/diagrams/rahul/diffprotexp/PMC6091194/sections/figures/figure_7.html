 <caption> CoIP of putative partners to two proteins exclusively expressed on P3. a Kcnma1 coprecipitates SPARC, while ( b) SPARC coprecipitates Kcnma1 as demonstrated by peptide species of 50 and 135 kDa, respectively. c Ilk coprecipitates Parvin, while ( d) Parvin coprecipitates Ilk as demonstrated by peptides species of 42 and 51 kDa, respectively. Positive control consists of an IP of the protein itself, whereas the negative control consists of pre-incubating lysate with ChromPure rabbit IgG prior to adding beads. The antibody with which each blot was probed appears at the bottom of each panel </caption>

<p>Among the exclusive spots identified by 2-DE image analysis, protein components of the 10 most prominent spots were investigated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). For 2-DE gel mapping, major proteins were identified by mass finger printing. Protein spots excised from 2-DE gels were destained, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), as previously described [

After washing the column with 70% acetonitrile, 100% acetonitrile, and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, samples were applied to the R2, R3 column and eluted onto the MALDI plate (Opti-TOF 384-well Insert, Applied Biosystems) with cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 70% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid [

 <sup>â€“7</sup> Torr. Mass spectra were obtained in the reflectron mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, summed from 500 laser pulses, and calibrated using the 4700 calibration mixture (Applied Biosystems). Proteins were identified from the peptide mass maps using MASCOT (

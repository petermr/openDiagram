0: To validate results of detected miRNAs, six known and nine novel miRNAs were randomly selected.
1: Stem-loop primers for cDNA synthesis were designed by miRNA Primer Design Tool [ 60].
2: Stem-loop pulsed reverse transcription of each miRNA was according to Varkonyi-Gasic et al.
3: [ 61] with few modifications.
4: Briefly, 12 g total RNA was added to 0.5 l dNTP (10mM), 1 l stem-loop primer (10M) ( S1 Table) and desired volume of RNase/DNase-free water to a total of 13.8 l. The mixture was incubated for 5min at 65C followed by 3 min ice incubation.
5: Subsequently, 4 l of 5X first-strand reverse transcriptase (RT) buffer mixed with 2 l DTT and 0.2 l SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, USA) (200U/L) were gently added to yield the final volume of 20 l. Tubes were loaded to thermal cycler for pulsed reverse transcription with initial incubation at 16C for 30 min, followed by 60 cycles of 30C for 30 s, 42C for 30 s and 50C for 1 s. Then, the samples were incubated at 85C for 5 min to inactivate RT enzyme.
6: To prepare PCR reactions, 1 l of cDNA was added to 0.4 l of each primer (10 M), 8.2 l water, and 10 l of PlatinumTM II Hot-Start Green PCR Master Mix (2X).
7: Loaded samples in thermocycler were initially denatured at 94C followed by 3540 cycles of 94C for 15s, and 60C for 30sec.
8: PCR products were resolved electrophoretically on ethidium bromide stained-2% agarose gel immersed in 1 TAE and visualized with Biorad Gel Doc XR instrument (Biorad, USA).

<p id="p0125">To elucidate key mechanisms involved in the differences of metabolic reaction between WT mice and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice in liver and skeletal muscle, we grouped metabolic reactions belonging to the same metabolic pathway and calculated the percentage of activated or inhibited metabolic reactions by Metabolite and by Enzyme Protein layers (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). We focused on pathways representing carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Nucleotide metabolism is separately described in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="fn">supplemental information</xref> (see 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S10</xref>A and S10B). In liver, several carbohydrate metabolic pathways, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the starch (glycogen) metabolism, and TCA cycle, and several lipid metabolic pathways, including fatty acid degradation, had more activating regulations than inhibiting regulations by DEMEs (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C, 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>A, and S7B; see also Figures 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A and 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). This result suggests that these metabolic pathways are activated at the level of protein expression of metabolic enzymes in fasted 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. In skeletal muscle, some metabolic pathways were activated by DEMEs, such as fatty acid degradation and BCAA degradation (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> lower; see also 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). In addition, in both organs, most amino acid metabolic pathways were regulated by DEMs in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. An exception was inhibition of arginine synthesis pathway in the liver, which involved a high percentage of metabolic reactions controlled by both DEMs and DEMEs (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> upper).

<p id="Par32">Enrichment analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] of pathways was performed on 487 upregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and 230 downregulated genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The upregulated genes were highly enriched for gene annotation categories from oncogenic pathways, including Signaling by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases, and Proteoglycans in Cancer, Tissue Morphogenesis and response to growth factor. Interestingly, GO categories enriched for downregulated genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) included pathways often suppressed by oncogenes. These contained Wound Healing and the PID P53 Downstream pathways. Overall these data support the pathognomic role of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>/SMAD3 complex as a driver of specific and selective oncogenic molecular events (Genes and GO categories in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2–4).

0: The laryngeal deposition rate was used as an evaluation index to compare the difference between CD-MOF, SCU@CD-MOF, SCU@DEX@CD-MOF and DEX@CD-MOF by NGI.
1: Firstly, the eight impactor stages were successively covered with 1% dimethicone in  n-hexane solution to prevent the powder from bouncing back.
2: After  n-hexane was dried, about 15 mL of 40% methanol solution was added into the pre-separator.
3: A sample-filled capsule was placed in the inhalation device and the capsule was punctured by pressing the buttons on both sides of the device.
4: The inhalation device was connected horizontally through an adapter to the artificial throat as required.
5: The parameters such as inhalation time were repeated for the measurements of five capsules.
6: After the NGI test was completed, each part was washed with 40% methanol solution and transferred to a volumetric flask and diluted to volume.
7: The concentration of  -CD was determined using HPLC-ELSD (Agilent 1290, Agilent Technologies), with the drift tube temperature of 70 C, the N 2 pressure of 3.2 bar, and the gain of 10.
8: The InertSustain AQ-C18 column (250 mm  4.6 mm, 5 m) was used for separation with column temperature at 35 C. The mobile phase was made up of methanol and water (15:85,  v/ v) at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with 5 L of injection volume.
9: The laryngeal deposition was the ratio of the dose deposited in throat part in NGI to the total dose deposited at all the parts.

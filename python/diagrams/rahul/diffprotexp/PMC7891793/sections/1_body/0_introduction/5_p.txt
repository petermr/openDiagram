0: We have recently performed an experiment to address this hypothesis and have shown that the combination of the antiviral GS1 FPI and the COX inhibitor ibuprofen significantly reduced both clinical scores and viral loads as measured by viral shedding in experimental BRSV infection of pre-ruminant calves.
1: This effect was most apparent when therapy was initiated on the third day after viral infection [ 19].
2: The percent of lung consolidation at necropsy on day 10 after BRSV infection was significantly less in the animals receiving dual treatment beginning on day 3 after infection.
3: The mean lung consolidation scores for treatment groups are presented here in the results section.
4: Histopathological scores for lung sections from each calf were tabulated and also revealed a significant treatment effect for dual therapy beginning on day 3 post infection.
5: Administration of ibuprofen alone increased viral loads, but combined treatment helped to decrease the viral load even more than in the treatment group which received FPI as the sole therapeutic, suggesting that these two therapeutics have a synergistic effect.

 <sub>l</sub>) and immersed into 100 mL of distilled water, respectively, and 100 mL of aqueous media with different pH values (3; 6.5, and 7.3) at room temperature (21 °C) under constant magnetic stirring (50 rpm), to ensure a constant concentration gradient between the gel and the release medium. The pH values were chosen to mimic as close as possible the pH of the gastric fluid (1¨C3), small intestine (6.37–7.04), large intestine (6.63–7.49), and physiological fluid (7.32¨C7.42) [

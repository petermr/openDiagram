0: Our objective was to assess miRNA expression changes and examine whether a coordinated expression of miRNAs and their potential targets are associated with the differential pigmentation and reduction of proliferation in B16F1 melanoma cells exposed to 5-Brd-2-dU and L-Tyr.
1: This work contributes to the knowledge about specific microRNA profiles in B16 melanoma cells under growth suppression and differential pigmentation.
2: L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2-dU induced coordinated expression on potential molecular targets and enhance the hypothesis of microRNAs that affect cellular programs by exerting control over different genes.

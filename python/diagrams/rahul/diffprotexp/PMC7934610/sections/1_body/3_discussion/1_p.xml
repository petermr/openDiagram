<p>Based on previous studies, we speculated that the small intestine of Kazakh sheep with different MHC genotypes was the first line of defense against 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infection, and the immune response mechanism in the intestine might be related to disease resistance. The experimental results confirmed our hypothesis that DEGs related to innate immune response and adaptive immune response were found in different groups of sheep, some of which are worthy of attention.

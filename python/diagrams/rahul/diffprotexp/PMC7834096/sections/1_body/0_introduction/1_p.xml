<p>The outbreak of enterohemorrhagic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) O104:H4 in 2011 in Germany was one of the largest and most severe EHEC outbreaks in recent history with almost 4000 infections resulting in more than 50 fatalities [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since then, research was focused on the strain that caused this unprecedented rate of infection, especially as it affected mainly healthy adults, which is not common for EHEC epidemics [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The severity of symptoms and the high percentage of patients developing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) were attributed to the unusual combination of virulence factors of different 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> pathotypes found in this strain [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Typical EHEC markers include the Shiga toxin (Stx)- and the IrgA homologue adhesin-encoding determinants 
 <italic>stx2</italic> and 
 <italic>iha</italic>, respectively, whereas the most prominent virulence markers of enteroaggregative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (EAEC) include the global virulence regulator AggR-encoding and aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF)-encoding determinants 
 <italic>aggR</italic> and 
 <italic>aggDCBA</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Whole genome analysis revealed a very close relationship of the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain with the prototypic EAEC isolate 55989, which was originally isolated from an HIV-positive patient in the Central African Republic with persistent diarrhea [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5â€“8</xref>]. However, the subtype of the main virulence factor of EAEC, the AAF adhesin, was different in EHEC O104:H4 (AAF/I) when compared to EAEC strain 55989 (AAF/III) [

<p id="Par55">Based on the GTA, we analyzed the expression level of the complete set of sense and antisense transcripts by using the DESeq2 package. Comparisons included: 
 <italic>i</italic>) a global differential expression analysis (GDEA), in which pairwise comparisons concerned the reproductive modes (apomictic vs. sexual) considering all developmental stages together (i.e., involving reads generated from all developmental stages), and 
 <italic>ii</italic>) a stage-specific differential expression analysis (SSDEA) between reproductive modes at each developmental phase (i.e., involving reads generated from each particular developmental stage).

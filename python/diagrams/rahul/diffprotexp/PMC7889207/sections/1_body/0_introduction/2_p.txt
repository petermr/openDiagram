0: Epigenetic processes may contribute to the development of obesity by mediating the effects of environmental exposures on gene expression and energy homeostasis [ 7, 8].
1: DNA methylation is the most extensively studied epigenetic modification and occurs by covalent addition of a methyl group at the 5 th carbon of the cytosine ring, resulting in 5-methylcytosine [ 9].
2: Studies have shown that changes in nutrient cues, such as the consumption of high fat, high sugar diets, differentially modulate DNA methylation of key metabolic genes [ 10, 11].

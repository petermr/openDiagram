<p>Deficits in glucose availability and disruption of mitochondrial functions were also seen in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, an impairment of glycolysis was demonstrated to sensitize human astrocytes to amyloid beta toxicity and to induce amyloid aggregation [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another recent study reported a decreased expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1, MCT2, MCT4) and lactate dehydrogenase A and B (LDH-A and LDH-B) in the brains of double transgenic amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. MCTs are membrane-bound proteins with body-wide distribution, which enable the intercellular shuttling of energy metabolites such as lactate and pyruvate, whereas LDH isoenzymes enable the reversible conversion of pyruvate to lactate and thus play a critical role in glycolytic metabolism. Earlier, we showed that PrP
 <sup>c</sup> overexpression enhances MCT1 protein level in HEK 293 cells [

Interestingly, we also found that LDH-A and LDH-B protein expression levels were markedly increased in the brain of wild-type (WT) vs. Prnp knockout mice when exposed to ischemic (stress) conditions, but exhibited invariable expression under non-ischemic conditions [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-22-01566" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The latter finding is significant in the light of a well-known fact that PrP
 <sup>c</sup> mice exhibit a higher tolerance toward different stress conditions as compared with

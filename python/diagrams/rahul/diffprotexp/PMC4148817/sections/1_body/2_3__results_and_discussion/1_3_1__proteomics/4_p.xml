<p>The Venn Diagram shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-01-00219-f003">Figure 3</xref> compares the individual protein changes and their overlap among all of the nanoparticle exposures. There was no overlap in four categories, which means there were no proteins that changed in all exposures. Clearly, the low concentration (100 ng/mL) showed the highest number of changes and a remarkable overlap between MWCNT and SWCNT. Between the 281 and 282 proteins that had significant fold changes in MWCNT and SWCNT, 231 proteins were the same. At the high concentration, few proteins were differentially expressed, and these showed a lesser degree of overlap. There was also no overlap between the high and low concentrations of the same CNT, so it is the concentration, not the CNT itself that had the most effect on cells.

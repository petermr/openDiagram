<p>Numerous protein features were detected with anti-pY antibodies, indicating many tyrosine kinase substrates in trophozoites (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), which underwent widespread changes upon discontinuation of Mtz exposure. Although a unique pY modification profile was observed for 106-MtzS (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), neither 106-MtzR-P8 nor 106-MtzR-P16 showed the same profile observed in 106-MtzS. However, by the end of 12 weeks, the 106-MtzR line still possessed significant levels of Mtz resistance compared to its MtzS parent. There were multiple protein bands with divergent profiles in MtzR lines between isolates in the absence of drug selection, including 2 bands at approximately 27 and approximately 30 kDa as well as multiple bands clustered between approximately 60–70 kDa, although 1 protein band at approximately 125 kDa increased in intensity in both isolates. Overall, discontinuation of Mtz selection widely altered phosphorylation signaling in both isolates.

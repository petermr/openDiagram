0: Rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) and rat cardiomyocyte cells (H9C2) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
1: Cells were maintained in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM/F12), cultured with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
2: After 24 h, NRK-52E cells were cultured in FBS-free medium for another 16 h, then incubated with or without recombined human transforming growth factor 1 (rhTGF-1) (R&D Systems, MN) at a dose of 5 ng/mL [ 10].
3: Donor NRK-52E cells were incubated with rhTGF-1 for 48 h and maintained in FBS-free DMEM/F12 for another 48 h in experimental group.
4: To generate conditioned medium, rhTGF-1-free medium was collected and sequentially centrifuged at 300, 1,200 and 10,000 g for 5, 20 and 30 min, respectively.
5: The control medium was generated in the same way but without exposing to rhTGF-1 in the first 48 h. Then the recipient cardiomyocytes were incubated with control or conditioned medium and collected for further characterization.

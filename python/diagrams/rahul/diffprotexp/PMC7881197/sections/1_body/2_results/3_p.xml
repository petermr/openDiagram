<p id="Par37">To understand the effect of AS6 on gene expression, we monitored the transcription of critical cell cycle regulatory genes 
 <italic>cyclin B1</italic>, 
 <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, and 
 <italic>p21</italic>. HUMEC and MCF7 cells were incubated with AS6 for 48 h before the reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis (RT-qPCR). In line with the differential cytotoxicity of AS6 to HUMEC and MCF7 cells, expression of 
 <italic>cyclin B1</italic> increased in HUMEC and decreased in MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). 
 <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> decreased significantly to less than 40% of the untreated control, which suggests a possible disruption of the G
 <sub>2</sub>–M cell cycle transition

 </sup> in MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). By contrast, 
 <italic>cyclin D1</italic> was reduced in both HUMEC and MCF7 cells, suggesting a delayed G
 <sub>1</sub>–S transition
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup> upon the treatment with AS6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Interestingly, the mRNA expression level of p21 was increased in MCF7 cells but was unchanged in HUMEC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). p21 is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that arrests G
 <sub>1</sub>, S, and G
 <sub>2</sub> progression by interfering various CDKs including CDK1, 2, 4, and 6
 <sup>

 </sup>. We conclude that AS6 inhibits cell cycle progression through the G
 <sub>1</sub>, S, and G
 <sub>2</sub> phase more extensively in MCF7 cells than it does in HUMEC.

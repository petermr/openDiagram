<p>Since only limiting amounts of protein would be extracted from each of the aliquots of 50,000 FANS-sorted nuclei that were used for TMT labeling, the workflow that was devised incorporated approaches to improve: (1) extraction and digestion of proteins from the nuclei, (2) efficiency of TMT labeling and recovery of the labeled peptides, and (3) small-scale fractionation of the tryptic digests prior to LC-MS/MS/MS analyses. Since PCT has been shown to be a highly reproducible approach for extracting and digesting proteins from as few as 50,000 human cells and as little as 0.2–3 mg of mouse liver, heart and brain tissues [

PCT uses an instrument called a barocycler to apply ultra-high pressures up to 45,000 psi to a sample. Alternation between high and ambient pressures leads to physical disruption of complex tissue samples, extraction, and solubilization of proteins. PCT also enhances and accelerates proteolytic digestion of proteins into peptides [

PCT was carried out in a MicroPestle, which is a novel miniaturized, disposable mechanical tissue homogenizer that fits into the microtube sample container in the barocycler 2320 used in this study. The MicroPestle provides more efficient tissue lysis and protein extraction with smaller lysis and digestion volumes. Previous tests carried out with mouse liver, heart, brain, and human kidney tissues demonstrated that PCT-MicroPestle-extracted proteins yielded 20–40% more MS-ready peptide mass from all tissues tested with comparable high reproducibility as compared to the conventional PCT method [

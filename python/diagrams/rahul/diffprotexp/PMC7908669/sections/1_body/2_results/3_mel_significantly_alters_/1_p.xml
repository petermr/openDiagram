<p id="Par24">For more insights into the mechanisms underlying BMSC differentiation regulated by MEL, changes in the transcriptomes of BMSCs after MEL treatment were also analyzed by deep RNA sequencing in comparison with the control group. A total of 831 mRNAs showed significant differential expression in human BMSCs induced by MEL treatment, including 513 upregulated and 318 downregulated mRNAs (fold change &gt; 1.5; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b). The significant differences in the transcriptomes of BMSCs resulting from MEL treatment were visualized by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and a volcano plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Using GO categorization, we showed that these differentially expressed genes in MEL-treated BMSCs were mainly enriched in the following biological categories: metabolism processes, responses to stimulus, development process, signaling, cellular component organization or biogenesis, localization, immune system process, reproduction process, rhythmic processes, and detoxification (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). We also found that these differentially expressed genes were associated with various KEGG signaling pathways, such as the metabolism, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling, forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling, hippo signaling, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, dopaminergic synapses, cell cycle, and toll-like receptor signaling pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The significant transcriptional alterations further suggested that the effective regulation of BMSC osteogenic differentiation by MEL might be mediated by complex molecular mechanisms.

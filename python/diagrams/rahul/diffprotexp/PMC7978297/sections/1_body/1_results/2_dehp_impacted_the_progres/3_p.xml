<p>In a separate analysis, the DEG lists at PD0 and PD3, that were associated with the DEHP effect, were examined. Results showed that at the pre-stage, the biological process of DEG lists at PD0 and PD3 varied massively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>A), and the difference at the early- and late-stages of PF formation were not distinct (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>B-C). Furthermore, DEHP always impacted the processes of “cellular responses to stress”, “chromatin organization”, “oxidative phosphorylation”, “cytoplasmic translation”, “cellular response to DNA damage stimulus”, and “transcriptional regulation by TP53” throughout both PD0 and PD3 stages. At the same time, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signal, cell cycle, and mRNA processing were all likely associated with DEHP effect on germ cell development.

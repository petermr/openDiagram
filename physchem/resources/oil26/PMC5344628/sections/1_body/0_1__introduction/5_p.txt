0: Consumers are worried about the presence of chemical preservatives, which can lead to benzoic acid by the decarboxylating action of some spoilage microorganisms, and this is considered the cause of many carcinogenic and teratogenic attributes and residual toxicity.
1: Therefore, the studies to find natural and socially acceptable preservatives receive increasing attention by screening the composition and the biological, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities of plant extracts [ 17].
2: Essential oils can prevent fungal growth in food products, which may cause spoilage and result in a reduction in the quality and quantity of food (shelf-life).
3: Most EOs applied directly onto food or in the vapor phase can reduce or stop the colony forming ability of molds.
4: They are also regarded as safe (GRAS) and are accepted by the FDA and by consumers.
5: By their potential antimicrobial/antifungal/antioxidant effects, EOs could be the answer to the current search for environmental solutions and to assuring the microbial safety of food products in active packaging applications [ 18, 19].

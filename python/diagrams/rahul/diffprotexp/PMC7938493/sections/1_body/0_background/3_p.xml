<p id="Par42">Recently, various RBP-related mechanisms in cancer onset and progression have been clarified, including genomic alterations, transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, and posttranslational modifications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, RBPs directly or indirectly affected oncogenic and tumour-suppressive signalling pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, only a few RBPs have been completely studied and identified as vital players in human cancers. For example, PNO1, a novel RBP isolated from the human kidney, functions as an oncogene in urinary bladder cancer by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of urinary bladder cancer cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ZFP36L1, a tandem zinc-finger RBP that mediates mRNA decay, acts as a tumour suppressor to regulate mRNAs involved in hypoxia and the cell cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that IMP3, a member of the insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA binding protein (IMP) family, was significantly upregulated in muscle-invasive BLCA compared to non-muscular invasive tissues and could serve as an independent prognosis predictor for BLCA patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previously, most research mainly focused on the correlation between a single or a limited number of RBPs and BLCA. A comprehensive study of RBPs functions will help us to fully understand their roles in BLCA. Therefore, this study downloaded RNA sequence data and corresponding clinical information concerning BLCA from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to screen for RBPs differentially expressed between tumour and normal samples. Subsequently, a series of bioinformatics analysis methods were performed based on these differential RBPs to finally identify eight independent prognosis-associated RBPs, which were then used to construct prognostic and nomogram survival models. The results of this study might facilitate the development of prognostic assessment models based on RBPs in patients with BLCA.

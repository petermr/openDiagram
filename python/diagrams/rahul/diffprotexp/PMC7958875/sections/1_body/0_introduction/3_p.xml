<p>Single-cell technologies provide the possibility to understand clonally variant transcriptional patterns in unicellular parasites by deconvoluting the contribution of each individual and allowing for precise ordering of parasites in developmental time (

These large changes in expression make it difficult to understand what proportion of variation observed is a result of developmental heterogeneity in a sample versus variable patterns of expression at a single point along this developmental trajectory when using bulk transcriptomic approaches (

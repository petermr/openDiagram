<p id="p0045">To date, mechanisms behind the enhanced stability of Zn-ion batteries with Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>-containing electrolytes are still unclear. Recent reports have provided some clues that Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte can be oxidized, inducing the deposition of active Mn compound on the cathode surface (

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019c</xref>). This suggests that the deposition of Mn compound from the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>-containing electrolytes is also an important phenomenon that deserves more research attention. Such a self-recovery phenomenon resulting from the deposition of Mn compound on the cathode may have a significant effect on the capacity and stability of Zn-ion batteries. However, most of the previous reports evaluated the capacity only based on the weight of the Mn-based cathode. In addition, only the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration in the electrolyte was given, whereas information about the volume of the electrolyte and the Mn ratio (atomic/weight) of the solid Mn-based cathode to the aqueous Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte is lacking. This could lead to an unreliable comparison of the results across different publications. Owing to the potential contribution of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte to the capacity, retention rates of the cathode much higher than 100% were observed in some literature reports where the capacity was calculated just based on the active material at the cathode (

 <caption> Discovery of differential circRNAs in Torin 1-treated SKOV3 cells. A Hierarchical clustering analysis on differential circRNAs between Torin 1 treatment (10 µM) and controls. Heatmaps were plotted according to the 30 most significant differential circRNAs. The “red” and “green” colors suggest upregulation and downregulation, respectively. B Volcano map for the 30 most significant differential circRNAs. C Functional analysis for the 30 most significant deferential circRNAs. D KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the 30 most significant differential circRNAs. </caption>

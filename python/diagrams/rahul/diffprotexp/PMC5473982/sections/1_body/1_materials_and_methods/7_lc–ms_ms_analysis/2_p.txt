0: High resolution (30 000 FWHM at 400  m/ z) MS spectra were acquired for the 3901700  m/ z interval in an Orbitrap analyser with an AGC target value of 1  10 6 ions and maximal injection time of 100 ms. Low resolution MS/MS spectra were acquired in Linear Ion Trap in a data-dependent manner and the top 10 precursors exceeding a threshold of 10 000 counts and having a charge state of +2 or +3 were isolated within a 2 Da window and fragmented using CID.

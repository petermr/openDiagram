<p>Supplementary Data S1: Protein and peptide identifications, TMT reporter ion ratios and protein quantitation and 
 <italic>P</italic>-value significance. Supplementary for TMT1 (WB MtzS vs MtzR) is presented on the first tab, TMT2 (106 MtzS vs MtzR) is presented on the second tab and TMT3 (713 MtzS vs MtzR) is presented on the third tab. These include GL50803_ identifiers, converted “Entrez Gene IDs” for DAVID bioinformatic functional analyses, the geometric mean for fold change and the T-rest 
 <italic>P</italic>-value of significance. A significant 
 <italic>P</italic>-value (&lt;0.05) has been highlighted in yellow. Proteins above the upregulated fold change cutoff are highlighted in red, while proteins below the fold change for downregulation are highlighted in green.

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The vasorelaxant effect of AcEO is obvious, since it succeeded to abolish the contraction triggered by phenylephrine, and produced a complete relaxation of aorta. Indeed, it is well evidenced that phenylephrine stimulates vascular contractions by acting through stimulation of &#945;<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors, which will provoke the conversion of phosphatidylinositol to inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate, leading to the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the intracellular stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In light of these finding, we aimed to highlight the mechanism of action of this vasorelaxant effect, by exploring many cellular signaling mechanisms, including endothelium-dependent and independent pathways.</p>

0: Various studies by other groups confirmed that K V1.3 blockers reduce pro-inflammatory microglia functions when using similar stimuli or stimuli associated with other inflammatory pathologies.
1: For example, in cultured rat microglia activated with the HIV Tat protein or with glycoprotein 120 (gp120) to simulate HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder, K V1.3 inhibition or knockdown with siRNA was found to reduce IL-1, TNF- and NO production and suppressed neurotoxicity [ 24, 25].
2: Using a model of ischemic stroke and oxygen/glucose deprivation of cultured microglia Ma  et al.
3: reported that K V1.3 inhibition shifted the microglial phenotype from a pro-inflammatory M1-like to an M2-like response and reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation [ 5, 6], similar to the above described studies in models of Parkinsons disease [ 8].

<p>Garlic,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. There are a variety of insecticides that have toxicological properties, deterrents, and repellents used for the control of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic>; however, essential oil of garlic could be an alternative for the control in stored products. Identification of toxic compounds of garlic is important in understanding toxicity as it relates to pest control. In this study, we hypothesized that garlic essential oil and their constituents have insecticidal activity in 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic>.

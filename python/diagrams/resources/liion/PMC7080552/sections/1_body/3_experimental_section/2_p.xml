 <italic>Materials Preparation</italic>: The Li metal ribbon (99.9%) was purchased from Wenyuan (Wuhan) Advanced Materials Co., Ltd. and it was rolled into a 0.2 mm thick foil. The Li–B–Mg composite was fabricated by the smelting reaction.

Afterward, the obtained composite was rolled into a 0.2 mm thick foil and 16 mm diameter disks were punched out therefrom as anode electrodes for LMBs. The control sample Li–B composite was also prepared without Mg added. Table S1 (Supporting Information) demonstrates the mass ratios of raw materials.

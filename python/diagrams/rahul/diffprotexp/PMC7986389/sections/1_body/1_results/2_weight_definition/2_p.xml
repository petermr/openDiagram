<p id="Par21">For the genes that appear in the network but have no expression values in the TCGA data (only 143 genes, 2.3% of the network size; these are called weight-loss genes), we gave them default weights of 0 rather than ignoring them; thus, if such a gene is essential at the topological level, it has the potential to be selected as a cancer gene, which may counteract the disadvantage of the traditional differential expression-based methods in dark gene-revealing and missing-data situations. Finally, all 6338 genes in the graph were weighted. The topological structure of the graph remained the same as in the original protein interaction network.</p>

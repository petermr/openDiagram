<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) to generate a 'combined score' for each pathway based on the hypergeometric p-value from WebGestalt, and a correction for expected rank for each pathway. In order to generate the table of expected ranks and variances for this approach, we randomly sampled foreground sets of 10&#8211;5000 genes from our background set 5000 times, and used WebGestalt ORA to obtain a list of enriched terms and P-values for each run; we then compiled a table of Reactome terms with their expected frequencies and standard deviation. These data were used to calculate a Z-score for terms in an ORA run, and the combined score was calculated using the formula

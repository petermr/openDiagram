<p>A thorough conformer search was performed on 
 <bold>1a</bold>, 
 <bold>1a′</bold>, 
 <bold>2a</bold>, and 
 <bold>2a′</bold> using MCMM with the OPLS3 forcefield within the SchrÖdinger Macromodel 2016 software suite operating on Windows 10. All conformers &gt;21.0 kJ/mol from the energy minimum were discarded. The resultant conformational suites underwent DFT geometry optimization in the gas phase using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) functional and basis set in Gaussian 16 [

 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-19-00095" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were used to confirm that the geometry-optimized conformers were true energy minima and to confirm the absence of negative vibrational frequencies. The DFT (GIAO) 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR shielding values were calculated on the geometry-optimized structures using the ωB97xD/6-31G(d) level of theory. The subsequent DFT isotropic shielding values were then Boltzmann averaged across each of the conformational suites [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-19-00095" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and scaled (with carbons attached to sulfur adjusted binomially) using the procedure reported by Kutateladze et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-19-00095" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, the scaled 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR chemical shifts for the structural isomers (
 <bold>1a</bold> and 
 <bold>1a′</bold>; 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>2a′</bold>) were analyzed using the sDP4+ method [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-19-00095" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], however, the ωB97xD/6-31G(d) functional is not inherent to the Grimblat method, therefore a small amount of caution should be applied to this result (see

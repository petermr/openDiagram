<p>Although PirA and PirB toxin proteins are regarded as the key pathogenic factors in AHPND [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], when shrimp hemocytes were treated with recombinant PirA and PirB proteins (His-rPirB and His-rPirA), only His-rPirB was found to enter and detected within cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1b</xref>). Thus, the pathogenic damage induced by VP
 <sub>AHPND</sub> through its secreted toxin proteins is not limited to the gastrointestinal system but extends to other tissues/organs such as hemocytes. This observation is synonymous with the study by Salles 
 <italic>et al</italic>., where the Anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) of 
 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> was shown to bind to an anthrax toxin receptor 1,2 (ANTXR1,2), cell surface receptors of macrophages, to form heptameric pores, to allow it translocate lethal factors (LF) or edema factors (OF) into macrophages [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The PirB toxin is reported to first enter the stomach before being transferred to the hepatopancreas to cause cell sloughing and cell death [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Interestingly, our current data shows that the PirB toxin could be found in hemocytes, which suggest that it might have been transported there or to other tissues from the gastrointestinal system via hemolymph.

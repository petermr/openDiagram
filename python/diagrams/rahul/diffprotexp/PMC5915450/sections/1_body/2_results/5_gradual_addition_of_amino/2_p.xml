<p id="Par21">Using five different starting structures, ten simulation trajectories were simulated to obtain the force-time profiles shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The mean rupture forces of ErmCL and H-NS are 2,242 and 1,359 pN, respectively, indicating that ErmCL is harder to pull through the tunnel (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The non-equilibrium work also leads to a similar conclusion (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Thus, these results are in agreement with our earlier simulations.

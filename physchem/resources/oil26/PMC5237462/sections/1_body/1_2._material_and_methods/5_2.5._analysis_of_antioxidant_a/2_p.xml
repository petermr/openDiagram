The essential oils were diluted in methanol concentrations (5, 1, 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25&#8201;mg&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). For the evaluation, they were added into a test tube of 2.7&#8201;mL of the stock solution of DPPH, followed by addition of 0.3&#8201;mL of the essential oil solution. Meanwhile, the negative control was prepared, this being a mixture of 2.7&#8201;mL of methanol and the methanolic solution of evaluated compounds. After 30 minutes, the readings were taken in a spectrophotometer (Biospectro SP-22) at a wavelength of 517&#8201;nm. For comparison, ascorbic acid was evaluated.</p>

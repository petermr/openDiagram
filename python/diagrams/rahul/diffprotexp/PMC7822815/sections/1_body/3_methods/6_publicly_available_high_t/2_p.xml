 <sup>TM</sup> 2000/2500 platform. Datasets comprised RNA-Seq data on primary samples from 20 patients each with either t(8;21)-positive AML, karyotypically normal AML (KN), inv(16)-positive AML and different rearrangements of the MLL gene (MLLr). Furthermore, they comprised 20 samples each of normal bone marrow-derived CD34-positive cells (BM), umbilical cord blood-derived CD34-positive cells (CB) and mobilized normal peripheral blood-derived CD34-positive cells (PB) (Supplementary Data

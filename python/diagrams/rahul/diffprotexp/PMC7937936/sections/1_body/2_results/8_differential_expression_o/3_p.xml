<p>To validate the gender differences, we then divided TCGA-HNSC data set into two groups by gender. We found no significant correlation between higher or lower immune scores and tumor prognosis in either the male or female groups (

  <bold>Figure S3A</bold>
 </xref>). Within these two groups, respectively, we performed survival analysis based on the high and low expression of the hub genes. Interestingly, in the male group, the expression of all genes was significantly correlated with survival (P&lt;0.005), while in the female group, the expression of all hub genes was not correlated with survival (P&gt;0.05) (

0: In the process of developing a new mouse model utilizing the publicly available  Adipoq-Cre transgenic mouse we discovered strong genetic linkage between our gene of interest,  Adam10, and the  Adipoq-Cre transgene.
1: This prompted our investigations to identify the location of the transgenic insertion site and any possible functional consequences of the genetic change.
2: We identified the genomic insertion site of the  Adipoq-Cre transgene, characterized passenger transgene insertion genes, studied adipose tissue transcriptome changes, and the response of  Adipoq-Cre transgenic mice to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding.

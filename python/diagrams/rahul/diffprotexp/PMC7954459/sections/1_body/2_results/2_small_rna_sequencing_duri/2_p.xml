<p>We sequenced smRNAs from seven successive stages of seed development and leaves from a small‐seeded (Himchana 1 with seed weight of 13.1 ± 0.15 g per 100 seeds) and a large‐seeded (JGK 3 with seed weight of 53.3 ± 1.48 g per 100 seeds) chickpea cultivar. The stages of seed development included embryogenesis (S1–S3), mid‐maturation (S4 and S5), and late‐maturation (S6 and S7) stages as described earlier (Garg et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In total, about 1 billion raw reads were obtained after sequencing representing an average of 34 million raw reads for each sample (Table 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). About 70% of the total reads of different lengths were obtained after removing low‐quality reads and those with adapter contamination (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The high‐quality filtered reads were made non‐redundant, which represented smRNAs (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>a). We detected highest fraction of 24‐nt smRNAs in all the samples analyzed (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>b) as reported in previous studies (Jain et al.,

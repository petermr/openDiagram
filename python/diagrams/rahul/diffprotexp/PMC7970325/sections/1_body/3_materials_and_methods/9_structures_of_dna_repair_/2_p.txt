0: The gene structures and molecular architectures of 38 DNA repair pathways were obtained from the public databases Reactome [ 40], NCI Pathway Interaction Database [ 41], Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [ 42], Biocarta [ 43], and Qiagen [ 44], and manually curated as described in [ 81].
1: Only molecular pathways which include ten or more genes [ 82] were considered in calculations of pathway activation level (PAL) in order to increase statistical accuracy.

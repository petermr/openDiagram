<p id="Par36">cDNA was synthesised from 500 ng of RNA using a Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR was performed on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers (see Supplementary Table

RT-qPCR was normalised to Gapdh mRNA. Three independent experiments each with replicate samples were performed for each RT-qPCR. The delta-delta CT

<p>At desired time points after LPS treatment, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and then euthanized by exsanguination through the abdominal aorta. Left lungs were tied off and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction. Right lungs were lavaged 3 times with 0.6 mL of phosphate-buffered saline +2 mM EDTA + protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). BALF was placed immediately on ice and the cellular components were separated by centrifugation at 500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant from the 1st lavage was used for measurement of BALF total protein (BCA Assay; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA), proteomic analysis and Western blotting. Cells from all three lavages were combined for BALF total and differential cell count (Diff-Quik; Siemens, Newark, DE, USA). Following BALF collection, right lungs were perfused with Z-Fix (Anatech, Battle Creek, MI, USA) through a tracheal cannula at a pressure of 25 cm of H
 <sub>2</sub>O for 10 min followed by fixation in Z-Fix for at least 24 h before processing for paraffin embedding and sectioning.

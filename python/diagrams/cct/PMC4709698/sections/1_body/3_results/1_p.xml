<p>In order to avoid listing a vast number of multicomponent alloys with only slightly varying compositions, we will use a special abbreviation for all alloys investigated in this work. The sample name indicates the expected crystalline mole fraction. “BT48” for example represents a composition, which contains 48% mole of crystals and 52% mole of glass. This estimation is based on the lever rule for the quasi-equilibrium phase diagram

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"/>(cf. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This can then be converted into volume fractions (see methods). BT0 (Ti
 <sub>32.02</sub>Zr
 <sub>30.13</sub>Cu
 <sub>9.01</sub>Co
 <sub>4.84</sub>Be
 <sub>24.00</sub>) hence labels the composition of the glassy phase and BT100 represents the composition of the β-Ti dendrites (Ti
 <sub>60.58</sub>Zr
 <sub>36.11</sub>Cu
 <sub>2.30</sub>Co
 <sub>1.01</sub>) as determined by means of wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS, see

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). As we will see below the volume fraction of these alloys is constant for a wide range of cooling rates. Therefore we do not need to specify a particular cooling rate for these alloys.

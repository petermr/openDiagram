<p>Histological evaluations were performed using H and E staining method [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Normal diet rats showed normal liver histology. In vehicle-treated group, severe vacuolar degeneration and hepatocyte swelling were observed which confirmed the induction of NAFLD. Treatment with 200 mg/kg/day of AE and 0.5 ml/kg/day of AO as well as simvastatin could remarkably decrease macrovesicular steatohepatitis in tissue sections of animals. Other doses of AE and AO showed the positive effect to a lesser extent.

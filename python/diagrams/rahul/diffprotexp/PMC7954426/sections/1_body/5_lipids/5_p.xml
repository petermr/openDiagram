<p>In addition to the lipids described above, 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> can produce three glycolipids, five phosphoglycolipids, and six phospholipids [
 <xref rid="cit0249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. However, the structure of only one glycolipid, 
 <italic>β</italic>-1,6Glc-
 <italic>β</italic>-Gal-DAG, has been fully characterized; it acts as an important antigen during early infections and participates in the immune response [
 <xref rid="cit0257" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. Chiba et al. have demonstrated that human SP-A and SP-D bind to 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> through high-affinity interactions with lipids. The major ligand of SP-A is glycolipid, while that of SP-D is phospholipid [
 <xref rid="cit0265" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0266" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. Interestingly, only SP-A has been shown to be involved in the innate inflammatory response upon 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="cit0265" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. Furthermore, as galactocerebroside has been detected in 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>], it has been postulated that 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>-triggered Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune reaction of both the peripheral and central nervous systems against the galactocerebroside, is strongly associated with anti-galactocerebroside IgG [
 <xref rid="cit0267" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. In short, owing to the complexity of the lipid composition and difficult identification methods, the pathogenic roles of lipids in mycoplasmas remain to be further studied.

0: The detection limit of 0.1 J/g for instance in the Al-Mg-Si system corresponds to a Mg 2Si precipitation volume fraction of about 0.01% [ 116].
1: For comparison, the maximum precipitation heat measured by DSC of 6005A alloys amounts to 12 J/g, and the related -Mg 2Si precipitate volume fraction amounts to 1.15%.

<p>In order to identify the differentially expressed proteins of Caco-2 cells exposed in different forms of Se with the same concentration, 30 protein spots (marked on Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) were obtained from their corresponding 2-DE gels. After in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF/TOF identification, seven significant protein spots were successfully identified as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (E2), glutathione synthetases (GS), triosephosphate isomerase (TSP), T-complex protein 1 subunit zeta (TCPZ), lamin-B1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP F), and superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (Cu, Zn-SOD) (Table  
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The corresponding numbers of the above seven identified protein spots were 8, 29, 10, 18, 21, 20, and 23, respectively (Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The enlarged regions of each protein in silver stained 2-D gels and the spot density of each protein in each treatment and control group are shown in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The MS figures for these seven proteins are listed in Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. According to the order of control, sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se, the expression levels of two proteins (E2 and GS) increased. As for other proteins expression levels, the results were reversed (Figure  
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>a,b,c). At the same time, except for E2, there were no significant differences in other protein expressions between the groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met.

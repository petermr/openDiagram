<p>In general, an accurate DSC analysis of the sample requires at least two measurements: a measurement of a sample versus a reference, and a baseline measurement (inert reference samples on both sensors). The heat flow signal of the baseline measurement is subtracted from the heat flow signal of the sample measurement, and the resulting heat flow signal is corrected for small device-specific asymmetries which, although minimised in the design, can still influence the accuracy when low-heat-flow, high-accuracy measurements are required. Examples of such small asymmetries include slight differences in sensor positions and differences in the sensors themselves.</p>

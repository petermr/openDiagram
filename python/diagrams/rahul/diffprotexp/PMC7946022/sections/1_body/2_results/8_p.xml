 <bold>DNAse treatment significantly disrupts mixed-species biofilm impacting vancomycin distribution</bold>. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was performed using fluorescent vancomycin to visualize the effect of DNAse treatment on vancomycin diffusion through single and mixed biofilms. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells were stained with concanavalin A (ConA; magenta) and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with calcofluor-white (blue). Vancomycin penetration through the biofilms is seen in white and green (overlapping of green in high intensity generates the white color). Compared to untreated 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> single-species biofilm, biofilm z-stack reconstructions demonstrated that DNAse treatment resulted in a more dispersed distribution of vancomycin (green/white) throughout the layers of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm (

 <italic>C. albicans-S. aureus</italic> biofilms resulted in significant disruption in the biofilm structure, and increase in vancomycin presence (green/white) (

0: As an indication of time that had passed since burrowing ceased, a distinction was made between recently abandoned or currently used burrows (hereafter fresh burrows), abandoned burrows, and collapsed burrows (presumed to have been deserted for a longer period than abandoned burrows, see Supplementary Fig.
1: S.1).
2: Hereafter, time since burrowing ceased will be referred to as burrow age for simplicity (i.e.
3: at older burrows, burrowing would have ceased for a longer period than at fresh burrows).
4: In the arid scrubland, data from abandoned and collapsed burrows were combined due to the small sample size for collapsed burrows.
5: Although none of the burrows were occupied during sampling, it is possible that some of the fresh burrows were still sporadically used by medium-sized mammals.

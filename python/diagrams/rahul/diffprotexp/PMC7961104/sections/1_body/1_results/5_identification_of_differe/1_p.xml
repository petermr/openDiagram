<p id="p0135">The blood communicates changes in metabolism and metabolic requirements between organs through circulating metabolites. Through such circulation-mediated communication, the liver and skeletal muscle contribute to systemic metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, we analyzed polar metabolites in the blood of fasted WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice and compared them with the changes in liver and skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref>). We measured the amounts of 108 polar metabolites in the blood of WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, using CE-MS, and identified 26 increased and 31 decreased DEMs in the blood of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A; 
 <xref rid="mmc9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S8</xref>). The increased DEMs in the blood included glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and pantothenate. However, most of the decreased DEMs in the blood were amino acids (Ala, Gly, Arg, and His) and their derivatives (betaine, beta-alanine, anserine, and carnosine) (

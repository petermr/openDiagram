0: Synthetic cDNAs encoding three putative ATP2 orthologs from  P. falciparum (PF3D7_1219600),  P. berghei (PBANKA_1434800), and  P. chabaudi (PCAHS_1436800), and the three Cdc50 subunits encoded per specie:  P. falciparum (PF3D7_0719500, PF3D7_1133300, and PF3D7_1029400),  P. berghei (PBANKA_061700, PBANKA_091510, and PBANKA_051340), and  P. chabaudi (PCHAS_061870, PBANKA_091510, and PBANKA_051340) were ordered to Genscript (Piscataway, NJ).
1: All the cDNAs were codon-optimized by the provider for  S. cerevisiae expression using the proprietary algorithm OptimumGene TM.
2: In all cloning steps, we used the  E. coli XL1-Blue strain and the LuriaBertani medium with the appropriate antibiotic.

0: Potential lncRNA candidates were identified using the following workflow.
1: (1) Transcripts with uncertain chain direction were removed by Cuffmerge.
2: (2) Transcripts length > 200 nt with exon number  2 were selected.
3: (3) Cuffcompare v. 2.1.1. was used to compare different classes of class_code annotated by i, u and x that were retained, which corresponded to intronic, intergenic, and anti-sense transcripts, respectively.
4: (4) Transcripts with FPKM 0.5 were obtained after calculating the expression level of each transcript by Cuffdiff v. 2.1.1.
5: (5) Three tools of CNCI v.2.0 [ 47], CPC v. 2.81 [ 48] and PFAM v.1.3 [ 49] were used to predict the protein-coding potential.
6: After that, Pfam was implemented to exclude transcripts that overlapped with any protein-coding genes.
7: Intersection of these transcripts without coding potential was used as the lncRNA data set.
8: Additionally, mRNAs were obtained from the same RNA-seq libraries in this study.

<p>The obtained UCCRs for 6082
 <sub>I</sub> and 6063 correspond well with the results obtained in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], an UCCR of 1 K/s for 6063 is reported, which is the same as that found in this work for a slightly higher concentrated version of 6063 [
 <xref rid="B128-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. For 6082, Ref. [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reports an UCCR of above 10 K/s. The amounts of Mg and Si in the 6082 variant considered in [
 <xref rid="B23-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] is close to those of the 6082
 <sub>I</sub> in this work, for which we obtained an UCCR of â‰ˆ17 K/s.

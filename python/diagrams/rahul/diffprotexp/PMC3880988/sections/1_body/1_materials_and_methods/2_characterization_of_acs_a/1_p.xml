<p>AC cultures were characterized using monoclonal anti-collagen Type-II (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore, MA, USA); monoclonal anti-collagen Type-I Rabbit (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore, MA, USA) and histological staining of Safranin-O (Sigma-Aldrich Co, USA). MSC cultures were identified through immuno-cytochemistry analysis by determining the surface CD markers: CD29 (Chemicon, Merck Millipore, MA, USA); CD44 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) and CD45 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA).MSC were induced into adipogenic and osteogenic lineage using STEMPRO
 <sup>Â®</sup> adipogenesis and osteogenesis differentiation kits (Gibco), respectively. The cultures were then stained with oil red O (adipogenic cultures) and Alizarin Red S (osteogenic cultures) after 14 days.

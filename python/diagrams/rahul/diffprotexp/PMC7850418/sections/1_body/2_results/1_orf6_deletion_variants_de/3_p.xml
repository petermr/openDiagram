<p>The 7 sequences carrying an ORF6 deletion belong to lineage B1, a lineage widely circulating in Europe (Supplementary Figure 1). There were between 0 and 3 SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) differences among D34 variants, for which 3/6 mutants displayed 1â€“3 SNPs, and between 2 and 4 SNPs between D26 and D34 variants (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

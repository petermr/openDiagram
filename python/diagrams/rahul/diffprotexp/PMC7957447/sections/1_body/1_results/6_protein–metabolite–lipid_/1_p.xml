<p id="Par17">The “cytokine storm” caused by the uncontrolled hyperproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines can be fatal in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The altered inflammatory signaling is accompanied by a specific change in metabolites and metabolic processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Based on the relationships among proteins, metabolites, and lipids, we analyzed the protein–metabolite–lipid networks in 85 samples, with the significant changes during prognosis selected. Metabolites related to tryptophan metabolism, such as melatonin, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and 
 <sc>l</sc>-kynurenine were significantly changed between Clusters 1 and 2. Melatonin, which is synthesized by a precursor provided by tryptophan metabolism, became negative regulation with multiple factors in Cluster 1 compared with Cluster 2. Furthermore, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid and 
 <sc>l</sc>-kynurenine were positively correlated with most compounds in the network in Cluster 1 and associated with increased expression levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3). Considering the essential role of tryptophan metabolism in erythrocyte differentiation, the accelerated tryptophan metabolism in Cluster 1 may contribute to the observed enrichment in the erythrocyte differentiation pathway based on the transcriptomic data [

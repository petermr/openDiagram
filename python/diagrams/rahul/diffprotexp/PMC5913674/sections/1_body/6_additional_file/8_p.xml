<p>Supplementary Figure S5: Total protein lysate from trophozoites (10μg) from WB, 713 and 106 wild type lines was probed with antibodies against the H3 variant (top) and H4 variant (bottom), as well as probed with antibodies again acetylated lysine (KAc) and mono-methylated lysine (K-MMe). Blots have been cropped to 25–10kDa. The H3 variant (∼17kDa) and the H4 variant (∼11kDa) bands correspond to the position of the prominent modified protein bands on KAc and KMme blots, mostly likely the acetylation and methylation histone marks on the H3 and H4 variants.</p>

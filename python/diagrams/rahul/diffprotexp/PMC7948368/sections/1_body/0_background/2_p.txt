0: Currently, non-responder patients can be identified and switched to an alternative therapy at 3 months, but many remain on an ineffective therapy for much longer periods [ 6].
1: Whilst clinical markers explain some of the variability in response, alone they offer insufficient predictive capability [ 7].
2: Ideally, a reliable biological biomarker or panel of biomarkers would be measured in newly diagnosed patients and throughout the treatment time-course to predict and monitor response to therapy.
3: This would aid timely therapeutic switching in patients in whom the treatment is unlikely to be effective but requires the identification of reliable biomarkers and development of a statistical classifier of treatment response.

<p id="Par26">A substantial fraction of in silico translated proteins was similar to native human proteins (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). At the same time, there were also different extended and truncated isoforms of proteins. Such isoforms can potentially include new domains or may lack domains important for proper protein binding, localization and function, with other functional regions remaining unaffected.

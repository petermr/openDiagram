 <caption> The correlation between F max and the nonequilibrium work, W neq, with logBB, logPS, and TPSA for the compounds ( Tables S1 and S6) in the case of the GROMOS54a7 force-field for the DOPC membrane model and pulling velocity v = 0.5 nm/ns ( Table S5). The correlation coefficient R 2 is indicated at the top of each graph. Note that logPS is only available for 8 compounds. </caption>

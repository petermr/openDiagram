<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The GLMM analyses of variables affecting aardvark activity patterns indicate that the daily duration of the active phase of aardvarks was associated strongly and positively with photoperiod and EVI, and weakly but positively with minimum 24-h body temperature and minimum 24-h air temperature (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2A</xref>). The proportion of activity that took place diurnally was associated inversely with minimum 24-h body temperature, minimum 24-h air temperature, photoperiod and EVI (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2B</xref>). Time of aardvark emergence from a burrow relative to sunset was associated positively and strongly with minimum 24-h body temperature and EVI, but not associated with time of sunset or minimum 24-h air temperature (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2C</xref>). Time of return to a burrow relative to sunrise was associated strongly and positively with EVI and minimum 24-h body temperature, strongly and negatively with time of sunrise, and positively but weakly with minimum 24-h air temperature (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2D</xref>).</p>

  <p>Motif analysis and interacting RBPs identified in 3′ UTRs regulated by CPSF1. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Lengthened and shortened sequences of 3′ UTR transcripts regulated by CPSF1 were analyzed using the MEME motif discovery tool, and the significance threshold was set at E-value &lt; 0.05. The motifs were submitted to the Tomtom motif comparison tool for RBP identification. The top three significant RBPs identified are shown. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Lengthened and shortened sequences of 3′ UTR transcripts regulated by CPSF1 were analyzed by TargetScan tool. The APA event number and microRNA target sites are indicated.

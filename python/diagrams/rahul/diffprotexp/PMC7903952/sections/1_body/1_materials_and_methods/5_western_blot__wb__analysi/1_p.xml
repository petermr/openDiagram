<p>The samples of tissues and cells were lysed with Radio Immune Precipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, china). SDS-PAGE was used to separated proteins and proteins were transferred to Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Five percent Bovine Serum Albumin or tris-buffered saline tween (BSA/TBST) were used to block the PVDF membranes. Then, primary antibodies were used to incubate the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Next, 1×TBST (Solarbio, Beijing, china) was employed to wash the membranes at room temperature. Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG was sequentially added into the membranes for incubation for 115 min at temperature of room. Membranes were washed with TBST three times, 20 min each time. Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) was used to visualized proteins bands. The experiment was made in three times.

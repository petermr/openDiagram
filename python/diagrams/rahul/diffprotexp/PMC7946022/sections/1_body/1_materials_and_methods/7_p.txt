0: Vancomycin treatment of mice with single and mixed species catheter infection.
1: To comparatively evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of vancomycin against  S. aureus in animals with single or mixed catheter infections, animals were divided into a control (no therapy) group and experimental (therapy) group; within each group, 3 subgroups were included: implanted with catheters infected with  S. aureus, C. albicans or in combination for a total of 6 groups with 5 animals in each group.
2: Animals in the treated group were administered vancomycin twice daily by intraperitoneal injections (0.25 ml) at 55 mg/kg, and treatment was initiated on the 3 rd day post-catheter implantation and continued for 5 days, then animals were euthanized.
3: Untreated control groups received sterile PBS injections, and mice with  C. albicans mono-infected catheters were also treated with vancomycin as control.
4: Harvested catheters were aseptically fragmented, sonicated in sterile PBS to detach biofilms and cell suspensions were diluted and plated on species-specific chromogenic media for CFU enumeration; each harvested catheter was processed individually.
5: As pilot experiments indicated blockage of the catheters by host tissue and immune cells compromising vancomycin delivery into catheter lumen, therapy experiments were performed using longitudinally cut catheters implanted with lumen facing downwards, in direct contact with the tissue.
6: Experiments were performed on 5 separate occasions and data combined.

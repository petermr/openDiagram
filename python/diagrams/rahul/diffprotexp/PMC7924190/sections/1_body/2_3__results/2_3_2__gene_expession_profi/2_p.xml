<p>Gene Ontology analysis using the STRING database of the 1147 genes that are upregulated and downregulated upon stimulation with AC EFs revealed activation of biological processes that are predominantly responsive to external, chemical, and cytokine stimuli, which in turn subsequently leading to the activation of various pathways, which are shown in 
 <xref rid="genes-12-00299-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A list of genes that are upregulated and downregulated after treatment with AC EFs is shown in

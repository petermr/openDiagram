<p>CVB3 (Nancy strain, USA) was maintained and expanded using Hep2 cells. The viral titer was determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. Mice were randomly assigned to six groups receiving the following treatments: normal mice (Control), VMC mice (VMC), VMC mice with unilateral (right-sided) cervical vagus nerve dissociation without mutilation of cervical vagus nerve (VMC+Sham), VMC mice with vagotomy (VMC+Vag), VMC mice with vagotomy and pnu282987 administration (VMC+V+P), and VMC mice with pnu282987 administration (VMC+Pnu). In preparation for vagotomy, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2% sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and fixed in place on the operating table. After shaving and sterilizing the neck and chest, a one-centimeter incision was made in the middle of the neck, and the tissue was separated. The right cervical vagus nerve was dissociated and cut off, and the incision was sutured. In the VMC+Sham group, the vagus nerve was only isolated from surrounding tissue but was not transected. All operations were performed under anesthesia. After surgery 24 h, all mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 0.1 mL of normal saline containing 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID50 of CVB3 except for the Control group. The Control group was intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 ml saline solution. The day of virus inoculation was defined as d 0. For agonist treatment, mice received intraperitoneal injection of pnu282987 (Pnu, a selective α7nAChR agonist, Sigma, USA, 2 mg/kg/d, 0.1% DMSO) from d 1 to 14 [

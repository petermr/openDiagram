<p id="Par49">In brief, by performing an integrated bioinformatic analysis of three GEO datasets, we identified five core genes with better diagnostic efficiency and higher prognostic value for EOC and we also screened the potential drugs or risk factors for EOC through chemical-core gene network analysis base on them. Moreover, we found that all five core genes mainly regulate EOC development via the cell cycle pathway through the KEGG and GO pathway analysis. However, there are still a few limitations in our study. Since the study is based on data analysis, a large number of clinical samples and biological experiments are urgently needed to verify the results before promoting the clinical application of all five core genes as diagnostic and prognostic indicators or therapeutic targets in future.</p>

<p>These compositional differences of the constituent phases in the case of the ϕ6 mm rod and the other samples also reflect in the DSC traces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The second crystallization event (~740 K) is about 3 K lower for the 6 mm rod compared to the 10 mm, 20 mm rods and the 100 g ingot. This indicates that the composition of the matrix in the 6 mm rod might be slightly different. In addition, the α → β transformation peak (~860 K) detected in the rod having a diameter of 6 mm shifts by about 4 K to lower temperatures (marked by a rectangular). A lower α-to-β transformation temperature generally indicates that the β-Ti dendrites in the 6 mm rod contain a slightly higher amount of β-stabilizers (Cu and Co) than the other samples
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. This is indeed consistent with the EPMA results obtained for the other samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Similar differences are also observed for the DSC curve of the ϕ2 mm rod. However, the almost identical DSC traces of the larger rods (ϕ10 and ϕ20 mm) and of the 100 g ingot suggest that the glass and dendrites are chemically identical in these samples. The composition of the glassy matrix in the 100 g ingot was also obtained by EPMA, which does not allow for the concentration of Be (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The EPMA results was further verified by considering the mass conservation for each element:

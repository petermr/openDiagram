0: For comparative analysis, peptide concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific) and samples from the same group of chickens were pooled.
1: Pooled samples were then labelled using the stable isotope dimethyl labelling protocol as described previously [ 16].
2: Labeled samples were mixed and 3 subfractions were prepared using Oasis MCX Extraction Cartridges (Waters).
3: The samples were desalted on SPE C18 Extraction Cartridges (Empore) and concentrated in a SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific) prior to LCMS/MS.

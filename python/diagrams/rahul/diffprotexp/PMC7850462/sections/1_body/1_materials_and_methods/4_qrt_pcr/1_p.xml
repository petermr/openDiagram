<p>TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used to extract total RNA from blood samples and HK-2 cells. The extraction process of the total RNA from blood samples was as follows. An RNase-free centrifuge tube was added with 0.5 mL of blood and 1.5 mL of TRIzol reagent, and maintained at a still position at room temperature after vibration. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C, 12,000 g/min for 15 min. Supernatant obtained after the centrifugation was transferred to another RNase-free centrifuge tube using a pipette. This tube was added with chloroform (TRIzol:chloroform = 5:1), and placed at a still position for 3 min after 15 s of vortex. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C, 12,000 g/min for 15 min. Supernatant obtained (450 μL) and pre-chilled isopropanol (TRIzol:isopropanol = 2:1) were added into a clean 1.5-mL RNase-free centrifuge tube. The well-mixed liquid was maintained stationary at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C, 12,000 g/min for 15 min. Supernatant was carefully removed, and the remaining sediments were mixed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol prepared with DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate)-treated water, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C, 8000 g/min for 5 min. Supernatant obtained after the centrifugation was discarded, and the tube was put upside down on a clean filter paper for a while. After ethanol volatilization for 2–3 min, the tube was added with 15 μL of DEPC-treated water. The mixture was treated with a water bath at 55–60 °C for 10 min. HK-2 cells collected for RNA extraction were centrifuged at 800 r/min for 3–5 min. The culture medium was discarded, and the cells were mixed with 1 mL of TRIzol reagent. The cell suspension was transferred to a dry EP tube that had been soaked in DEPC-treated water. The tube was placed on ice for 10 min. The remaining process was the same as the extraction of total RNA from blood samples.</p>

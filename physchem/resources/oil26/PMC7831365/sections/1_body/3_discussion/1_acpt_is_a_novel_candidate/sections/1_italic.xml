<italic>ACPT</italic> exons are 11 in placental mammals, which encode 427 amino acids (human ACPT sequence as the reference sequence). Our study collected that four residues (191N, 269N, 330N and 339N) of the extracellular region were for glycosylation, two residues (41H and 289D) directly involved in catalysis (from the UniProt database). In addition, mutation in seven residues were reported that were responsible for AI (

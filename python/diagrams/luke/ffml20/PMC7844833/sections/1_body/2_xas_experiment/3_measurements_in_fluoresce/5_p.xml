<p>Installing additional single crystal analyzers to disperse the fluorescent radiation provides the possibility to measure not just the total fluorescence yield, but the full spectrum of the emitted radiation (with energy resolution of a fraction of eV or better). It allows one to offset some of the above-mentioned issues (e.g., to better remove the background contribution) and enables advanced X-ray spectroscopies, such as HERFD-XAS and RIXS spectroscopy, discussed in

 </xref>. However, the low photon counts that are detected after such an additional energy selection require an especially intense X-ray source or long acquisition times for these methods to work.

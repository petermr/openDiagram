<p>There are two major adhesins in 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic>, MGC1 and MGC2. MGC1 shares higher homology levels with 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> P1 and 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> P140, whereas MGC2 is more homologous with 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> P30 and 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> P32 [
 <xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], indicating that the functions of these adhesins may be similar to those of adhesins in 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. genitalium. M. gallisepticum</italic> can also utilize glycolytic enzymes as adhesins including triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi), Eno and PK [
 <xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Pretreatment with specific antibodies can significantly abrogate 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> adherence or survival 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and similar adhesins have also been found in 
 <italic>M. synoviae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62â€“64</xref>]. Intriguingly, the PDHA and PDHB complex of 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> is deemed to be a Plg-binding protein and the combination of anti-PDHA and PDHB antisera can block the adherence to DF-1 cells [
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Likewise, 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> adhesins PlpA and HIp3 are Fn-binding protein. Apart from the adhesins listed above, there remain numerous adhesins in 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> including GapA, CrmA, PvpA and pMGA1.2 [
 <xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These adhesins are involved in early colonization and systemic infection to varying degrees.

0: Apomixis (i. e., agamospermy) is an asexual mode of plant reproduction via seeds, which generates progenies consisting of exact genetic replicas of the mother plant [ 1].
1: This puzzling trait occurs in at least 326 angiosperm genera, with no clear tendency to any specific group [ 2].
2: The apomictic and sexual developmental pathways are strongly related, since both take place within the ovule and involve common developmental features [ 3].
3: Traditionally, the asexual route was considered to be a deviation from the sexual one, repeatedly emerging during evolution from genetic or epigenetic mutations derived from polyploidization and/or hybridization events [ 4 6].
4: More recently, apomixis and sexuality were hypothetically classified as ancient polyphenic traits [ 7].
5: According to the latter view, the switching from one phenism to the other would be environmentally triggered by epigenetic mechanisms, with full sexual genera/species having lost the capacity to carry on this transition due to deleterious (epi)mutations affecting the molecular switch that connects both pathways [ 7].

<p>In the present study, four TNBC datasets were downloaded from GEO, and a total of 134 DEGs (88 up- and 46 down-regulated genes) were identified. The results of GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the DEGs were associated with various cancer-related functions and pathways, such as cell adhesion, ECMâ€“receptor interaction, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and T-cell immunity. Thereafter, PPI network of the identified DEGs was constructed based on STRING database, and six hub genes were screened out from it using MCC method. Survival analysis and qRT-PCR validation further supported the robustness of the above results.</p>

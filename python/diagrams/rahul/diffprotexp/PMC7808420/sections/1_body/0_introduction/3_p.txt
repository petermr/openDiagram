0: We have previously established a mouse model of SLEV-induced encephalitis in adult immunocompetent mice [ 18].
1: We observed that intracranial SLEV infection induces the expression of both type I and type II IFNs in the brain, together with a plethora of proinflammatory mediators and leukocyte recruitment, culminating in tissue damage and death.
2: IFN responses are typically associated with protection in Flavivirus infections, being explored in the development of potential treatments [ 19, 20] and development of susceptible mouse models [ 21] and studying disease pathogenesis [ 2224].

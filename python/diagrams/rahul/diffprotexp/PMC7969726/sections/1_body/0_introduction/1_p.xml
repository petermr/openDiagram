<p>Liver cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies worldwide, with 841,080 new cases and 781,631 cancer-related deaths reported in 2018 (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bray et al., 2018</xref>). According to GLOBOCAN statistics, the incidence and mortality rate of liver cancer were 905,677 and 830,180, respectively, in 2020. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes approximately 80% of primary liver cancer cases and has extremely poor prognosis. Recent studies have identified many liver-specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that control HCC growth and metastasis, that have been driving research in targeted therapies (

However, the improvement in HCC survival rate is still not acceptable; HCC ranked fourth as a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 2018 because of poor response to systemic therapies. Therefore, it is necessary to continue searching for potential prognostic and therapeutic targets for HCC through enhancing our understanding of its cellular biological processes.

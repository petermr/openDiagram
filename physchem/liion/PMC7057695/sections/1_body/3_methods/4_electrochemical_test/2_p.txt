0: The charge and discharge performance and open-circuit voltage of different SODs were examined by a LANHE CT2001A battery tester.
1: The temperature is controlled by a programmable temperature-controlled incubator.
2: Because the volume of the battery is very small compared with the incubator, we use the incubator temperature to represent the battery temperature.
3: The SOD was adjusted by discharging at 0.1 C.

<p>Interferon production after viral sensing depends on signaling cascades initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRR). RIG-I is a major cytosolic sensor of flavivirus infection, contributing to protective responses in Dengue, Zika and related viruses [

 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and could also be considered as a potential treatment against St. Louis Encephalitis, if RIG-I-activating compounds cross the blood-brain barrier and are nontoxic. Our data indicates that targeting SLEV replication would result in less disease and should be further investigated by testing antiviral compounds over the course of experimental St. Louis encephalitis.

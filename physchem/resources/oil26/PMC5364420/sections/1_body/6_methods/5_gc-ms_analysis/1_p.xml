<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The analysis of the essential oil was performed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 II GC, equipped with a HP-5 MS capillary column (30&#8201;m&#8201;&#215;&#8201;0.25&#8201;mm; film thickness, 0.25&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>m) and a HP 5972 mass selective detector for the separation. The mass selective detector was operated in electron-impact ionization (EI) mode with a mass scan range from <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 30 to 550 at 70&#8201;eV. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1&#8201;mL/min. The initial temperature at 50&#8201;&#176;C, held for 1&#8201;min, ramped at 5&#8201;&#176;C/min to 280&#8201;&#176;C and held for 1&#8201;min. Injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 230 and 300&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed as in the GC-FID analysis. A sample of 1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>L of 1% essential oil was injected manually using a 1:10 split ratio. Most components were identified by comparing their GC retention indices which were determined in relation to a homologous series of <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C8-C24) under the same operating conditions, NIST mass spectral search program (version 2.0, National Institute of Standards and Technology), and mass spectra with publish data. Component relative percentages were calculated based on GC peak areas without using correction factors.</p>

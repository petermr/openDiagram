<p>Differential D1 versus D2 protein expression was highlighted further by carrying out hierarchical clustering of the 87 significantly differentially expressed proteins. These analyses were carried out using Perseus software in which sample groups use a Euclidean distance metric with average linkage. Preprocessing used k-means for data reduction purposes with Z-scores being normalized across sample groups prior to clustering. As shown in the heatmap in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f005">Figure 5</xref>, these analyses succeeded in separating all eight samples into D1 or D2 clusters containing the 40 proteins that are up-regulated and the 47 proteins that are down-regulated in D1 versus D2 nuclei preparations. We note that when all 685 proteins were included in the analyses that hierarchical clustering was unable to separate the eight samples into D1 and D2 clusters.

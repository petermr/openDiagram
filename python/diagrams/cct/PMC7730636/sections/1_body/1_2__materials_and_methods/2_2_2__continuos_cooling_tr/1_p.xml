<p>The process in which homogeneous austenite decays into other structures during continuous cooling is called anisothermal decay of austenite. The resulting CCT diagrams express a graphical representation of this process. The cooling rate, which affects the formation of the final structure, has an analogous effect on the resulting decomposition of austenite [

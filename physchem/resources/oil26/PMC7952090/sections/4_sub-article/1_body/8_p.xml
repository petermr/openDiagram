For most of these genes, such as STK11, CD14, SOD1, and BRD7, all copies are strongly conserved, and lack premature stop codons. We also find that for STK11, CD14, and BRD7, manatees also possess an additional copy with high conservation, suggesting that extant manatees may also have enhanced tumor suppression and stress response. Some of these hits, however, do have premature stop codons. These include the additional copies of MAPRE1, BUB3, and COX20; and some copies of CNOT11, HMGB2, MAD2L1, LIF, and TP53. For TP53, we have previously shown that duplicate copies of genes containing premature stop codons may still serve a functional role in regulating its progenitor's function. As such, and especially in the case of the copies of COX20 and MAD2L1 which are expressed, the presence of a premature stop codon relative to the progenitor gene may not indicate a true pseudogenization and loss of functionality. Some copies, including for CASP9 and PRDX1, contained partial hits with no neighboring or overlapping hits; while these contained no premature stops, they also do not likely contain the totality of the coding sequence of their hits, and thus may represent cases of sub- or neo-functionalization.</p>

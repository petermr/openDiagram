<p>As the ability to aggregate is considered to be an important trait for bacterial survival during host infection [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we compared the aggregative behavior between the different AAF-expressing strains. Bacterial cells expressing AAF/I autoaggregated and showed a very fast sedimentation behavior. Although faster than the AAF/IV expressing strain it was comparable to AAF/III- and IV-expressing isogenic strains, indicating no special aggregation property. Less efficient sedimentation by AAF/IV-expressing bacteria may not necessarily be due to a faster formation of the aggregates, but could as well be due to differences in shape and size of the aggregates. The disturbance of the interaction between AAF on the bacterial surface abolished or decreased bacterial sedimentation.

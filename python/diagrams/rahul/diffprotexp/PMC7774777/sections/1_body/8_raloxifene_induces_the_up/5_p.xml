<p>To further investigate the effect of raloxifene on the proteasome in the spinal cord of females, we examined the differential gene expression of proteasome subunit genes. We found that raloxifene significantly upregulates 22 genes in females (

In males, estrogen also significantly increased the expression of some proteasome subunits, although the effect was more modest than in raloxifene-treated females, both in number of subunits affected (13 vs 22 in females) and fold increase (

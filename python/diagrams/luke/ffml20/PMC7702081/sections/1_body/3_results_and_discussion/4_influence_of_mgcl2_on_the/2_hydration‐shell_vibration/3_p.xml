 <sup>2+</sup> and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, which were defined by the position of the first minimum in the ion‐water radial distribution functions. A previous

 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B displays the appearance of clear fingerprints of the ionic solvation shell in the libration region of the VDOS. Moreover, the HB peaks and the librational part of 
 <italic>in‐shell</italic> water of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> is more structured and shifted to higher‐frequency modes compared to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>. This suggests a stronger water‐water HB network around the magnesium ion. In the first hydration shell of these two cations, the bending H−O−H mode is also blue‐shifted by approximately 50 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> compared to bulk water (ca. 1650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), whereas less clear conclusions can be drawn from the O−H stretching region between 2500 and 4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> of the VDOS (Figure S2 in ESI). An X‐ray spectroscopy study of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>(aq) by Techer and co‐workers assigned the distortions of the pre‐, main, and post‐edge of the X‐ray absorption spectra on the oxygen K‐edge in the vicinity of the ions to the strengthening of the HBs in the solvation shell around Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>.

 </xref> Our 
 <italic>in shell</italic> VDOS analysis agrees with this assignment. Further support to this conclusion is provided by the analysis of the average water‐water distance between the water molecules around Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> (3.0 Å), which significantly shorter than Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> (3.3 Å) (Figure S3 in ESI).

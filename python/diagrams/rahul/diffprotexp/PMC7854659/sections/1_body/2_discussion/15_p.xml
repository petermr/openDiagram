<p id="Par33">Altogether, our data suggest that nutrient restricted animals will later in life be metabolically compromised, leading to long-term consequences probably across generations. Although the genetic basis of fetal programming is still under investigation, our results point to the key role of epigenetic mechanisms driving the genome regulation. We hypothesize that RES fetuses have impaired one-carbon metabolism, as demonstrated by the reduced availability of methionine in allantoic fluid

 </sup>. Further research is warranted to investigate the role of non-coding RNAs and histone modifications in addition to DNA methylation as the mechanisms underlying fetal programming and the transmission of intergenerational effects.

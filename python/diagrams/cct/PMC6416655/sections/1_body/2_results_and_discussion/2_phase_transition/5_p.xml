<p id="p0080">With the use of a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM), the high temperature in situ observation was performed and shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 3</xref>. The photos in the horizontal direction is the phase transition under the same cooling condition, but different temperature. The first one is the time and temperature about to happen the phase transition. The second and third ones are the status of being and after finishing the phase transition. The same phenomenon was observed that martensite phase transition happened at approximately 583 K at the cooling rate of 8, 10, 12 K/s respectively. This experiment makes it clear that the structural transformation of high-alloy steel is within low temperature zone. This temperature zone is the temperature of the continuous casting slab out of caster. Due to the high cracking susceptibility of the martensite phase 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, slow cooling control or cold heap control is required to avoid the appearance of cracking during the continuous casting process.

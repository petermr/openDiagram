0: The samples obtained from ion exchange fractionation were analyzed using NP20 ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA).
1: Each ProteinChip was prepared according to the Ciphergen ProteinChip Application guide (ProteinChip Applications Guide Volume 2).
2: Briefly, 1 L of each sample was applied directly to the ProteinChip array in a randomized manner.
3: After air-drying for 3 minutes, all spots were treated with 1 L applications of matrix (saturated sinapinic acid (SPA) in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile) letting the spots dry between each application.

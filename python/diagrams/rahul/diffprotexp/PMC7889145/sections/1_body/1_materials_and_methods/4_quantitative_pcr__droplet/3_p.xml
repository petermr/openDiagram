<p>Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed using the QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) as per manufacturerâ€™s protocol and published methods [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All reaction preparation was performed in a dedicated PCR hood. ddPCR runs included negative template controls and were run in triplicate. Thresholds were manually set for each sample using acceptance criteria defined during the optimization of each assay. The QuantaSoft Analysis software V1.0 was used to assign positive/negative droplets and convert to a copies per mL format. This data was then normalized to

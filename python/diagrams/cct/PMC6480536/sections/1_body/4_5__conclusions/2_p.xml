<p>(1) With an increase in austenitizing temperature, the continuous cooling microstructures exhibit a polygonal ferrite→bainite→acicular ferrite variation trend. Small austenite grain size promotes grain boundary reaction products such as GBF and bainite. With an increase in austenitizing temperature, the nucleation sites transfer from grain boundaries to intragranular particles.</p>

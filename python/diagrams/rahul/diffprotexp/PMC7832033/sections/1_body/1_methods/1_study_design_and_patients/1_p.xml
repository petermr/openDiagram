<p>A prospective study of whole blood transcriptomic analyses in 97 individuals with melioidosis was conducted at seven hospitals in Northeast of Thailand: Udon Thani Hospital, Nakhon Phanom Hospital, Mukdahan Hospital, Roi Et Hospital, Buriram Hospital, Surin Hospial, and Sisaket Hospital. This study was part of a multi-centre study of patients aged â‰¥15 years who were culture-positive for 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> from any type of clinical samples and admitted to the hospitals between January 2015 and December 2019. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were described previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> were identified by biochemical tests and latex agglutination [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] at the microbiology laboratories of the hospitals and further confirmed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whole blood samples were collected at the time of enrolment (within 24 h of culture results, defined as day 0) and day 5, day 12, and day 28 after enrolment. Clinical information was obtained from the medical records. Mortality of patients was recorded at the hospitals or by phone calls for 28 days of follow-up.

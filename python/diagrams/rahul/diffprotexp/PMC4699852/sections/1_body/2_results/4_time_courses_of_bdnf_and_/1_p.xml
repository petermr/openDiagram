 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> shows the time courses of BDNF secreted by cells in the NIM with and without ERK inhibitor. The level of BDNF secreted by MSCs decreased significantly immediately after induction. However, the differentiating MSCs began to secret BDNF at 24 h post-induction. The inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway had no significant effect on the secretion of BDNF.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The suite of adaptive responses available to aardvarks that has been sufficient to ensure their survival in the past may not be sufficient in the future. In semi-arid zones with summer rainfall, such as the Kalahari, availability of resources is dictated primarily by the timing and amount of rainfall (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Noy-Meir, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et al., 2003</xref>), and delayed onset of annual rains, as projected in the Kalahari under climate change (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Shongwe et al., 2009</xref>), results in low vegetation productivity at a time when conditions are getting hotter and drier. Summer droughts combined with heat waves, as observed in the summer of 2013, will become increasingly frequent in southern Africa as a result of climate change (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Niang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Phaduli, 2018</xref>), as has already been evident during the past decade (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jordaan, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agri-SA, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Ngqakamba, 2019</xref>). Such climatic changes and consequent changes in resource availability might severely impact the persistence of aardvarks if their physiological and behavioural capacity to adapt is exceeded. Extirpation of aardvarks, key ecosystem engineers that provide thermal refugia to dozens of vertebrates (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Whittington-Jones et al., 2011</xref>), might have severe cascading effects for biodiversity in the Kalahari ecosystem.</p>

Days are stacked vertically, data are displayed in 5-min intervals. Black bars represent periods when the aardvark was active (&#8805;5% of maximum activity); white areas represent periods when the aardvark was inactive (&lt;5% of maximum activity); dark grey line is the time of sunset; light grey line is the time of sunrise. For better visualisation of seasonal shifts in nychthemeral rhythms, activity is plotted over 48 h, with two consecutive 24-h periods displayed beside each other.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fphys-11-00637-g003"/></fig>

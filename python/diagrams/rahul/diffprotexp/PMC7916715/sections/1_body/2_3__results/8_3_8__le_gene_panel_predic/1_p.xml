<p>CNTN1 has been reported to associate with poor prognosis in patients with lung, esophageal and oral squamous cell carcinomas [
 <xref rid="B26-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and hepatocellular carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B29-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. CNTN1 upregulation was reported to correlate with worse clinical features in breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B30-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], astrocytic glioma [
 <xref rid="B31-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], thyroid cancer [
 <xref rid="B32-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and stomach cancer [
 <xref rid="B33-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To further analyze the prognostic biomarker values of the LE gene panel, we have determined the panel’s ability to stratify the fatality risk of these cancer types using datasets organized by SurvExpress. Although the fatality event occurred in a small number (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) in a thyroid cancer cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 489), LE gene panel risk score was able to significantly stratify low-risk and high-risk groups (logrank test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 4.8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). The panel risk scores predict poor OS in lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, low grade glioma, and stomach adenocarcinoma, evident by the respective HR values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f013">Figure 13</xref>). The LE gene panel risk scores can significantly separate patients with the individual cancer types into the respective low-risk and high-risk populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f013">Figure 13</xref>). The prediction of poor OS is particularly effective in low grade glioma and stomach adenocarcinoma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f013">Figure 13</xref>). Collectively, these analyses strengthen the biomarker potential of the LE gene panel.

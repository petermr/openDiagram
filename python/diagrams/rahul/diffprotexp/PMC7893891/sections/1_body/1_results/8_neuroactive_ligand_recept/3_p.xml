<p id="Par74">Formation of eMNs was marked by reactivation of genes encoding glutamate receptors which were downregulated at the NSC stage. Gene activity of various ionotropic glutamate receptors peaked when eMNs became mature MNs (D18-D28). Activation of genes regulating the synthesis of various neurotransmitters defined the transition from eMNs to MNs. The transcript levels of the neuropeptide 
 <italic>tachykinin</italic>, and its receptor (
 <italic>TACR3</italic>), were upregulated in MNs. In spinal neurons, tachykinins evoke synthesis and release of ACh, histamine, catecholamines, and GABA. We also detected differential expression of the somatostatin receptor (
 <italic>SSTR1</italic>) indicating that the mature MN population can secrete neurotransmitters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The glucocorticoid receptor (
 <italic>NR3C1</italic>) was upregulated in MNPs and MNs and two new classes of neuroactive receptors were upregulated in the last stage of MN maturation: hypocretin/orexin (
 <italic>HCRTR2</italic>) and prostaglandin E receptor 4 (
 <italic>PTGER4</italic>). Our transcriptomic data indicate that the replacement of ionotropic nAChR (
 <italic>CHRNA3</italic>) and dopamine receptor (
 <italic>DRD2</italic>) expression with adrenergic receptor (
 <italic>ADRA1A</italic>) and mAChRs (
 <italic>CHRM2</italic> and 
 <italic>CHRM3</italic>) marked the formation of mature MNs. The controversial activation of mAChRs and genes encoding excitatory neurotransmitters, including glutamate and catecholamines (ADRA1A), could stem from the formation of a heterogeneous population consisting of parasympathetic and sympathetic MNs.

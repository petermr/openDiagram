<italic>BRD7</italic> genes in the manatee were also well conserved, suggesting that extant manatees may also have enhanced tumor suppression and an augmented stress response. However, some of the duplicate genes in the mantatee genome have premature stop codons suggesting they are not translated into functional proteins, including the additional copies of

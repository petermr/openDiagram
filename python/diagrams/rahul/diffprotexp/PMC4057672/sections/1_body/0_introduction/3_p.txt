0: Rauber  et al.
1: documented more than 750 cases of accidental or deliberate ricin intoxication from castor bean ingestion, with 14 resulting in fatality [ 6].
2: The ingestion fatal dose is 56 castor beans for children and 20 beans for adults [ 7].
3: Although considerably less potent than botulinum neurotoxins and staphylococcal enterotoxins, ricin is still considered a significantly potential biological weapon because of its stability and worldwide availability as a by-product of castor oil production.
4: In addition, it has been associated with several terrorist actions and therefore is a potential bioterrorism agent [ 7].
5: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of U.S.A categorizes ricin as a Category B Agent (the second-highest priority), as it can be moderately easily disseminated, leading to low mortality but moderate to high morbidity.
6: It can be injected into a subject, be used to contaminate food and water, or be dispersed as an aerosol.
7: Ricin poisoning can cause severe tissue damages and inflammatory reactions and can result in death [ 8].
8: The initial symptoms of ricin poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
9: In severe poisoning, the symptoms can progress to gastrointestinal bleeding with necrosis of the liver, spleen and kidney, and even cardiovascular collapse [ 9].
10: If inhaled, ricin can cause death within 3648 h because of the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems [ 10].
11: As a toxin, ricin is not a disease-causing agent.
12: Therefore, it is not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person through casual contacts [ 11].

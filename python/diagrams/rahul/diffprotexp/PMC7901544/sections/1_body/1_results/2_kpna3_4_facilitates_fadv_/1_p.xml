<p>To investigate the role of KPNA3/4 in viral replication of FAdV-4, the KPNA3/4 genes were first amplified and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1, designated as pcDNA3.1-KPNA3 and pcDNA3.1-KPNA4, respectively. And the LMH cells with the knockout of KPNA3 or KPNA4 were generated by using CRISPR-Cas9 technique, designated as KPNA3-KO and KPNA4-KO, respectively. The viral growth kinetics of FAdV-4 in LMH cells with overexpression or knockout of KPNA3/4 were performed. As described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2a</xref>, the over-expression of KPNA3 increased viral titer at early time points, while the over-expression of KPNA4 increased viral titer at all the time points tested. Moreover, the knockout of KPNA3 could slightly inhibit viral replication at early time points, while the knockout of KPNA4 inhibits viral replication at all the time points tested as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2c</xref>. Therefore, the data from the LMH cells with the knockout of KPNA3/4 were consistent with that from the LMH cells with the over-expression of KPNA3/4. The expression of KPNA3/4 in the LMH cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-KPNA3/4 or in the LMH cells with the knockout of KPNA3/4 were confirmed as described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b,d</xref>. These data indicate that KPNA3/4 assists the viral replication of FAdV-4 in LMH cells.

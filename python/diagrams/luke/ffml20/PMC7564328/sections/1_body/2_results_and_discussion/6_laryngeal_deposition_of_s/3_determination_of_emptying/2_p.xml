<p id="p0210">The characteristics of inhalable particles cannot be judged solely by flowability, the aerodynamic performance shall be more reliable. In the formulation design, each capsule contained 10 mg SCU@CD-MOF (2.58 mg SCU per capsule). The results showed that the emptying rate of SCU@CD-MOF was 98.56 ± 0.30% (Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), which fit the requirements of greater than or equal to 90%. It was indicated that slight changes in flowability of SCU@CD-MOF had no effect on the emptying rate under certain circumstances.

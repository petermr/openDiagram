 <caption> The differential gene expression profile of the granulosa cells (Gp and Gd) in F1 follicles. ( A) Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment of genes differentially expressed in the granulosa cells from F1 follicles. The y-axis and x-axis indicate the number of genes in each cluster and the names of clusters respectively. ( B) Scatter plot of enriched KEGG pathways for differentially expressed genes in Gp and Gd granulosa cells from F1 follicles. The rich factor is the ratio of the differentially expressed gene number to the total gene number in a certain pathway. The size and color of the dots represent the gene number and the range of the q-value, respectively. ( C) The heatmap displaying the genes enriched in cell cycle, DNA replication and steroid synthesis in KEGG analysis. The red colour represents the transcript over-expression or up-regulated while the yellow colour represents the transcript down-regulated. ( D) The cell cycle, DNA replication and the steroid synthesis network identified from G1p and G1d granulosa cells based on STRING database. </caption>

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows the simulated heat-affected zone continuous cooling transformation diagram. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f004">Figure 4</xref>a is a SHCCT diagram for coarse-grained HAZ with the peak temperature of 1320 °C, while 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f004">Figure 4</xref>b is for fine-grained HAZ with the peak temperature of 850 °C. Both diagrams indicate that martensite was the main phase. However, the martensite’s start transformation temperature in FGHAZ was higher than that in CGHAZ by 17~31 °C at the same cooling rate, while the finish transformation temperature in FGHAZ was higher than that in CGHAZ by 31~58 °C, with an exception at the t
 <sub>8/5</sub> of 7.5 s. Moreover, the transformation temperature range in FGHAZ was smaller than that in CGHAZ, as shown in

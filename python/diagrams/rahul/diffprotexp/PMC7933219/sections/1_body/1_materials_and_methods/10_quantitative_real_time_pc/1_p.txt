0: Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, United States), and it was reverse-transcribed into cDNAs using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, United States) with Oligo (dT18) RT primers (Sangon, Shanghai, China).
1: Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Master Mixture (TAKARA, Dalian, China).
2: The relative expression levels of the mRNAs were normalized vs. GAPDH expression, and miRNAs were normalized to U6.
3: Comparative quantification was performed using the 2 Ct method.
4: The primer sequences are listed below.
5: (The miRNA primers were purchased from RiboBio Corporation and sequences are displayed by their article number).

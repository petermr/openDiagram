<p>Potato is considered as a model crop for

 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture can be a good system to screen for salinity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-14-04912">30</xref>] in potato. Monitoring the molecular events underlying this tolerance provides important information for breeding programs. Osmotic active compounds, such as sorbitol and mannitol, have been used as 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> stress agents in order to select drought-tolerant genotypes in different crops. Sucrose is known to be a key osmolyte and metabolite, which is involved in drought, as well as cold, tolerance. Sucrose is the major sugar transported in plants, and it plays also an important role as a signaling molecule in regulating gene expression and plant development [

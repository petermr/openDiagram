<p>The results of both GSEA identified common deregulated pathways in both the mutated 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> and high splice groups, namely UPR and protein secretion pathways. The UPR is a key pathway in many cancers that is important in many secretory tissues such as plasma cells due to its protective role in avoiding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced apoptosis.

 </sup> The 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant group had increased splicing aberrations, but we identified signatures of decreased UPR activity. We would expect that there would be an enrichment in these pathways because these splicing aberrations have the potential to increase nonviable transcripts.

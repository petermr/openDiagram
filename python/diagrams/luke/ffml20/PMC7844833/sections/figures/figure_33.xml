  <p>(a, b) Potential-dependent changes in the local structure of dendrimer-encapsulated Pt NPs immobilized on a carbon-paper electrode under ORR conditions in a 0.1 M HClO
   <sub>4</sub> electrolyte saturated either with N
   <sub>2</sub> or O
   <sub>2</sub>. (a) Fourier transformed Pt L
   <sub>3</sub>-edge EXAFS spectra. (b) Corresponding changes in the Pt–Pt (
   <italic>C</italic>
   <sub>Pt–Pt</sub>) and Pt–O (
   <italic>C</italic>
   <sub>Pt–O</sub>) coordination numbers in O
   <sub>2</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolyte. Reproduced with permission from ref (

   <italic>in situ</italic> EXAFS data analysis. The differences between Pt–Pt distances, measured in O
   <sub>2</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolyte are shown. The structure model of Pt NPs obtained from EXAFS-yielded CNs is shown in the inset. (d) Relative expansion of the interatomic distances obtained within the maximum surface bond expansion (surface-restricted expansion) model is compared with the 
   <italic>in situ</italic> cantilever stress measurements. Reproduced with permission from ref (

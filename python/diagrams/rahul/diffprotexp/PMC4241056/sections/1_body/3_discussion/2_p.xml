<p>GS catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of glutathione (γ-glutamyl- cysteinyl- glycine; GSH) from γ-glutamyl-cysteine(γ-GC) and glycine. And γ-GC is an intermediate which is produced by γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) from the amino acid substrates glutamate and cysteine [

This hypothesis was verified in the rat liver, and the results indicated that the increase mediated by Se in the activities of GCS was observed [

In the present study, the expressions of GS in the groups treated with different forms of Se were all significantly higher than those of the control groups. In addition, the GS in the groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met were also significantly higher than those treated with sodium selenite. However, the levels of GS were similar and there was no significant difference between groups of nano-Se and Se-Met. All the different forms of Se may increase the activities of GCS in Caco-2 cells, and nano-Se and Se-Met are more effective than others. The increased production of γ-GC should be attributed to the enhancement of GCS activities and then the expressions of GS were stimulated to adapt the demand of synthesis of GSH from γ-GC and glycine.

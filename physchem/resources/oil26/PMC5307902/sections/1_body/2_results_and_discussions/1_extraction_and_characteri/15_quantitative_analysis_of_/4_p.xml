<p>The F1, F2, F3, and F4 emulsions, which had the highest values of HLB, showed the highest carvacrol content after 180 days. Thus, this showed that the most stable formulations are those which showed higher HLB values and the highest levels of carvacrol. According to studies by Viana, Bohrer,[
 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] the HLB system is based on surfactants, which are amphiphilic compounds whose molecules are in the hydrophilic and lipophilic groups. The higher HLB values are assigned to more hydrophilic surfactants in which the hydrophilic groups are more suitable for the production of O/W emulsions. In fact, the essential oil properties presented a volatility which could explain the difficulty of oil entrapment and retention.

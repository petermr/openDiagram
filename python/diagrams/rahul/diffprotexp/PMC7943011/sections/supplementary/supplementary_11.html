 <caption> Expression of IL2 and COL1A1 in endometrial cancer cells after treatment with metformin or insulin. HEC-1A cells were treated with 0.5 mmol/L metformin or 100 ng/mL insulin. ( A) Expression of IL2 was analyzed with an ELISA kit (HS200; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, MN, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. ( B) Expression of COL1A1 was analyzed with western blot analysis (ab138492; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Data are presented as expression levels relative to the expression in untreated reference cells (log 2FC). (TIF) </caption>

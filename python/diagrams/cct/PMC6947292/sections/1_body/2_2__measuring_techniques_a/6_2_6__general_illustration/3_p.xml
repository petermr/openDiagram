<p>In another frequently used plot, the specific precipitation enthalpy is plotted as a function of the cooling rate. A third type plots the hardness after cooling at various rates and subsequent (mostly artificial) ageing. In several cases, the latter two diagrams are combined into one plot with two ordinate axes. To allow interpretation and comparison with the timescale of CCP diagrams, the cooling rate axis is scaled in descending logarithmic order, i.e., proportional to the duration of cooling.</p>

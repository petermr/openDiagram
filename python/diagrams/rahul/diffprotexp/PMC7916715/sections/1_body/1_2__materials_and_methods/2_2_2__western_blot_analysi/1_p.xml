<p>Cells lysates were prepared in a lysate buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 µg/mL leupeptin, and 10 µg/mL aprotinin. A total of 50 µg of whole cell lysate was separated on SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK), followed by blocking with 5% skim milk at room temperature for one hour. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation, and secondary antibodies incubated for one hour at room temperature. Signals were then developed (ECL Western blotting Kit, Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). Primary antibodies used were anti-CNTN1 (1:200; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MI, USA) and anti-Actin 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TE, USA).</p>

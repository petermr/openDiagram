0: Transgenic B6SJL-TG_SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J (SOD1-G93A) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.
1: SOD1-G93A males were bred with B6SJL NTG females also from the Jackson Laboratories and maintained according to IACUC approved methods.
2: SOD1-G93A and NTG mice (aged 50 days) were implanted with time release pellets (Innovative Research of America) containing either a vehicle control placebo (placebo), 10 mg of raloxifene (for female mice), or 15 mg of raloxifene (for male mice).
3: Body weight was assessed weekly starting the day prior to pellet implantation.
4: Forepaw muscle strength was measured using a digital grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments).
5: Animals were trained to grasp a horizontal grasping ring.
6: During the testing phase, the average of 3 trials recorded at 5-minute intervals was recorded per mouse.
7: The age of death or the age at which institutional guidelines required euthanasia were recorded for each animal and used to construct a KaplanMeier survival curve.
8: An independent cohort of SOD1-G93A and NTG mice was sacrificed at day 60 of raloxifene treatment (ie, 110 days of age), after symptom onset, for biochemical measurements.

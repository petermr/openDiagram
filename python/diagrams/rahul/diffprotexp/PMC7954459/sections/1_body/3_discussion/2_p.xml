<p>MiRNAs are important regulators of gene expression in plants and animals. The role of miRNAs during seed development has been interrogated via genome‐wide approach in some model/crop plants (Li, Liu, et al.,

In this study, we analyzed the role of miRNAs in chickpea seed development and seed size/weight determination via analyzing high‐throughput smRNA sequencing data obtained from a small‐seeded and a large‐seeded chickpea cultivar. We used the major landmark seed development stages along with high sequencing depth to provide a comprehensive list and expression profiling of high‐confidence known and novel miRNAs at different stages of seed development in chickpea.

(b) Vehicle-treated group: Severe vacuolar degeneration and hepatocyte swelling are observable. (c) Positive control: Some sinusoids are swelled but cellular damage is repaired in comparison to vehicle-treated animals. (d) <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> extract 200 mg/kg: Macrovesicular steatohepatitis is decreased and the microscopic view is similar to sham. (e) <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> extract 100 mg/kg: Some hepatocytes are swelled but no necrosis is observable. (f) <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> essential oil 0.5 mg/kg: Vacuolar degeneration is remarkably decreased in comparison to vehicle-treated group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-22-37-g005"/></fig>

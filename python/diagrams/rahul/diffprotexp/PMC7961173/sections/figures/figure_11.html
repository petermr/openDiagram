 <caption> Relationship between placental villous explants and HTR-8/SVneo differential gene expression. In order to characterize the relationship between differential gene expression in first trimester villous explants and HTR-8/SVneo cells exposed to 20 µM DCVC for 12 h, respectively, Pearson’s correlation coefficients ( r) were calculated for the pairwise comparison of logFC values, either for all dually expressed genes (11,913), or ATF4 gene targets only (383). Displayed are correlation plots of logFC in gene expression between tissue and cells for 0 (control) vs. 20 µM DCVC for: A) All genes ( P &lt; 1.0 × 10 –15), or B) ATF4 gene targets only ( P &lt; 1.2 × 10 –9). Pearson’s correlation coefficient values are shown on each respective correlation plot and trend lines are displayed in red </caption>

0: Endoplasmic reticulum is a major site of protein synthesis, transport and folding [ 20].
1: In our analysis, both tandem APA switching genes and differently expressed genes were clustered into protein processing in ER pathway, which suggests that PEDV infection may affect normal function of ER in multiple ways.
2: Ten genes (CANX, DNAJC10, SEC63, UFD1, PLAA, UBE2G2, UBQLN1, BAK1, SSR3, DNAJB11) were selected to detect their dynamic expression with RT-qPCR.
3: The relative expression of related DEGs was confirmed by the RT-qPCR results, which were consistent with the results of SAPAS sequencing (Fig.
4: 5).

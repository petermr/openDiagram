<p>In summary, this is the first demonstration of the interaction of the Fiber-2 of FAdV-4 with KPNA3/4 via its N-terminal 1â€“40aa, and the generation of a novel highly attenuated 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited fowl adenovirus FAV4_Del. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular basis for the pathogenesis of Fiber-2, and give potential targets for developing antiviral strategies and live-attenuated vaccine candidates against the highly pathogenic FAdV-4. However, the exact roles of KPNA3/4 in the hydropericardium symptom caused by FAdV-4, and the attenuated and protective mechanism for FAV4_Del need to be further elucidated.

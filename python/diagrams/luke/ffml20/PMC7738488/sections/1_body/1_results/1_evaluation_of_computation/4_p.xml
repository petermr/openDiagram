<p id="Par9">The detailed effect of the different degree of protonation (i.e., different pH values), was studied by executing simulations of molecules at four different pH levels. The effect of pH was scrutinized using molecular editor, Avogadro, that concede the pH disposition of the molecular environment. All MD simulations were carried out in aqueous solutions under realistic requisites of different pH levels. The assessment of van der Waals spheres was found to be significant in the characteristic determination of dendrimers. These spheres stipulate information in correlation with internal cavities

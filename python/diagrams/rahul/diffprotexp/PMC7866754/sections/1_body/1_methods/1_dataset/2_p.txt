0: As a result, this work focuses on two pairs of transcriptome/proteome generated by Lindner et al.
1: [ 37].
2: The authors produced transcriptomic and proteomic data for oocyst sporozoites from wild-type  P. falciparum parasites (NF54 strain) as well as salivary gland sporozoites, with three biological replicates for each sample type.
3: The reasons for narrowing down to these datasets are threefold: firstly, the original analysis by Lindner et al.
4: only considered annotated genes, leaving room for the discovery of novel ORFs.
5: Secondly, the two life cycle stages analysed correspond to the mosquito-infectious and human-infectious stage, and therefore novel ORFs detected by proteogenomic analysis could help explain the development of human-specific infectivity.
6: Finally, since the datasets were produced in the same laboratory, the conditions should presumably be similar and differential expression is mainly caused by biological differences between the developmental stages.
7: The transcriptomic data was downloaded from the GEO database (Accession #GSM3109291, GSM3109292, GSM3109293 for oocysts sporozoites; # GSM3109294, GSM3109295, GSM3109296 for salivary gland sporozoites), and the proteomic data from PRIDE (Accession #PXD009726 for salivary gland sporozoites, #PXD009728 for oocysts sporozoites).

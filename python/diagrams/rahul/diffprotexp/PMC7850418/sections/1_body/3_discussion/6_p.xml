<p>Most importantly, high plasma levels of PTX3, MCP1, and TNFα in COVID-19 patients have been described as early molecular indicators of adverse disease progression needing intensive care [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, within the context of cytokine storms from acute respiratory syndromes, high plasma levels of CCL2, CXCL10, and TNFα have also been reported [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Consequently, the enhanced expression of 
 <italic>CCL2/MCP1</italic>, 
 <italic>PTX3</italic> and 
 <italic>TNF</italic>α observed after infection with D26 could indicate a heightened disease risk from an NF-kB-driven inflammatory response by an ORF6 deletion variant [
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Although there was no significant difference in disease severity between patients at the GRU-3 hospital unit harbouring D34 ORF6 variant or WT, the small number of patients may have hindered the observation of an increased virulence potential of the deletion variant. In addition, the patient infected by the D26 variant is omitted from our analysis as no clinical data was available. Finally, we could not validate the enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines in patients as plasma samples were not available in this retrospective cohort.

<p id="Par5">Earlier studies obtained transcriptome expression profiles of Tibetan pigs and Yorkshire through RNA-seq data. Among them, 209 genes were screened in TP, including multiple genes related to the formation of muscle fibers. The author speculates that it may play an important role in determining the growth rate and potential weight of pigs after birth

 </sup>. In this study, we used this set of RNA-seq data to explore the potential role of lincRNA on porcine skeletal muscle development. DELs were obtained through pipeline analysis and differential expression analysis, and potential target genes in cis were predicted. A co-expression network of MDRPTG and its corresponding long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) was constructed and used to explore the potential role of DEL in the process of muscle fiber hypertrophy.

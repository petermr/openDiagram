<p>In the present study, using the iTRAQ method, the differentially expressed proteins were selected from the three consecutive stages: oncosphere, adult, and protoscolex of 
 <italic>E. granulosus.</italic> Basic protein information in each group is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>. The identified proteins were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO), COG analysis, and pathway annotation. The results showed that in the molecular function ontology of proteins, the number of proteins (353) enriched in cellular process entries was the largest, accounting for 18.70% of the total, followed by metabolic process and single-organism process, respectively enriched 310 and 193 proteins, each accounting for 16.42% and 10.23%. COG analysis of identified proteins in all sample groups is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.

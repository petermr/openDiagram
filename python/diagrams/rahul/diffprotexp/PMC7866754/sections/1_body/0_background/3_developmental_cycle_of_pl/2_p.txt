0: The progression from one developmental stage to another in  P. falciparum involves drastic changes in gene expression [ 13], and infectivity of the parasites to human hosts can also vary greatly depending on the stage.
1: For instance, while oocyst sporozoites are highly infectious for the mosquito salivary gland, they are non-infectious to mammalian hosts; on the contrary, salivary gland sporozoites exhibit specific infectivity for mammalian liver, but correspondingly loose infectivity for mosquitos salivary gland [ 14].
2: Understanding the mechanism for this switch of infectivity is of great interest, because inhibiting it allows us to prevent infection before the symptomatic phase, which is where malaria intervention efforts using vaccines have been focused on [ 15].

 <caption> Validation of differentially expressed proteins in GT1-7 cells after AAS exposure. (A-E) Representative Western blots of identified proteins from protein extracts of AAS or vehicle-treated cells. (F-J) Densitometry analysis of each protein normalized to β-actin represents the relative protein expression values for (A) Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1), (B) Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3P/GAPDH), (C) Enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH), (D) Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), (E) Protein disulfide-isomerase A6/Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein (ERP/PDIA6). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, unpaired t-test. n = three replicates of three independent experiments for each group. </caption>

0: Due to the limitations of pig genome annotation, this study included background human orthologous genes 61.
1: After transforming the pig gene into a human gene in the Ensembl website, gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Gene and Genomic Encyclopedia (KEGG) 18  20 pathway enrichment analysis were performed in Metascape 21.
2: Subsequent selection of  p value less than 0.05 is a valid result.

0: P3 membranes expressing either PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50B-His or PcATP2-D596N-GFP were diluted up to 5 mg/mL of total protein concentration in solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mg/mL DDM and 4 mg/mL CHS), supplemented with PIC and 1 mM PMSF.
1: After 1 h at 20C under gentle rotation, samples were ultracentrifuged at 125,000   g during 1 h at 4C, and the supernatant (detergent-solubilized proteins) were mixed with the home-made GFP-Trap  beads previously equilibrated with 10 column-volumes of washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mg/mL DDM, 0.1 mg/mL CHS and 0.01 mg/mL POPS).
2: After 2 h at 4C of incubation with gentle rotation, the beads were washed with 20 column-volumes of washing buffer.
3: GFP-Trap  beads with bound PcATP2-GFP-BAD/Cdc50B-10xHis were diluted twice in washing buffer and flash-frozen in liquid-N 2.
4: The concentration of PcATP2-GFP-BAD in the beads was quantified by measuring the GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate, and using purified GFP as reference.
5: The protein content coupled to the GFP-Trap  beads was eluted with 0.2 M glycine buffer pH 2.5 prior analysis by Coomassie-blue staining and western blot.

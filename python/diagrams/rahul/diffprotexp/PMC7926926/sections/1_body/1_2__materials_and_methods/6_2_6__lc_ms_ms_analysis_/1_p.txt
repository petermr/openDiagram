0: To perform Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, HPLC was used to fractionate the tryptic peptides before mass spectrometry analysis.
1: The parameters used for the step gradient were set to acetonitrile (pH 9.0); 832%.
2: Later, we combined the peptides, followed by freeze-drying in a vacuum chamber.
3: EASY-nLC 1200 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was employed to separate dissolved peptides.
4: The liquid phase gradient was set to B (Methanole %); 925% for 30 min; 2535% for 22 min; 3580% for 4 min; 80% for 4 min, while the flow rate was kept constant at 350 nL/min.
5: Orbitrap Fusion LUMOS platform was utilized to perform Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with standard mass spectrometry parameters.

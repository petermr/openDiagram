<p>Although this study explored and identified a potential mechanism for the anticancer effect of RSV on TNBC cells, various limitations exist. First, relatively few samples were used in this experiment, and the results should be verified in larger sample studies. Second, this study used only one triple negative cell line and verified the proliferation and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated by RSV at the gene level, protein level and individual animal level. However, the relationship between RSV and POLD1 requires further elucidation. More importantly, although the anti-TNBC effect of RSV has been clarified, due to poor solubility and bioavailability of RSV, as well as adverse reactions, its clinical use has been restricted. Therefore, making RSV into a drug to better treat breast cancer remains to be studied.</p>

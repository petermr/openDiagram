   <bold>(A)</bold> The relative expression of PRKAA2 was significantly upregulated in the TC-EC model, compared with EC alone. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The prediction of miRNAs targeted at PRKAA2, using miRDB, RNA22, and Targetscan database. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> qPCR analysis of relative expression levels of 4 predicted miRNAs targeted at PRKAA2, in which the expression of miR-124-3p was significantly decreased in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Predicted binding sites within the 3’UTR region of PRKAA2 with miR-124-3p using the Targetscan database. The data are presented as the means ±

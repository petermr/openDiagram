0: Patients diagnosed for NFPA (n=73) who underwent surgical resection at Beijing Tiantian Hospital (Beijing, China) from October 2007 to July 2014 were included in the study.
1: The study inclusion criteria were: i) Patients older than 18 years; ii) MRI/CT showed a sellar region lesion; iii) pathological diagnosis was pituitary adenoma with no hormonal excess and iv) sufficient pre- and postoperative clinical and radiologic data.
2: The exclusion criteria were: i) Patients with functioning adenoma, including tumor which secreted ACTH, prolactin, growth hormone and/or TSH and lead to the corresponding clinical syndromes of hormone excess and ii) history of pituitary surgery or radiotherapy.
3: The patients included 34 men and 39 women, with a median age of 52 years (age range, 2573 years).
4: Out-patient clinic follow-up was conducted, the minimum follow-up time was 4 months, and the median follow-up time was 60 months (range, 498 months).
5: The clinicopathological characteristics of all patients are shown in  Table I.
6: All tumor samples were immediately placed into a sample tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored.
7: Among them, 6 cases of recurrence within 1 year were randomly selected as the fast recurrence group and 6 cases of recurrence after 5 years were selected as the slow recurrence group.
8: The postoperative recurrence of NFPA refers to the increase in the maximum tumor diameter by >2 mm from the day of surgery to the end of follow-up as measured from any direction on magnetic resonance imaging.
9: The histological subtype of tumors was defined according to the World Health Organization 2017 classification of endocrine tumors ( 32).
10: The Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital (Beijing, China) approved the study.

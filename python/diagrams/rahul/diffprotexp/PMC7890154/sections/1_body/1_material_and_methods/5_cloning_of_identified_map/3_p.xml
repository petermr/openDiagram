<p id="par0065">Mining of transcriptome data showed the presence of 21 novel MAPK genes. The identified transcripts were mapped on the 
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> genome sequence available on Ensemble Plants (

The predicted sequences were used for designing the forward and reverse oligo’s using Genefisher2 primer designing software (Table S2). Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cloning were performed as mentioned in Kumar et al. [

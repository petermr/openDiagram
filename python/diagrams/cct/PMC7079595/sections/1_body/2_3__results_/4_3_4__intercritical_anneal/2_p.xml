<p>Differences in austenite stability are clearly detected when treating at 720 °C or a lower temperature of 700 °C. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f007">Figure 7</xref>a, the intercritical annealing at 720 °C is not enough to fully stabilize austenite to room temperature, and martensitic transformation is detected on cooling at 106 °C, which is much lower compared to the M
 <sub>s</sub> measured for variants A and B, at ~325 °C. This means that some stabilization of austenite occurs during annealing.

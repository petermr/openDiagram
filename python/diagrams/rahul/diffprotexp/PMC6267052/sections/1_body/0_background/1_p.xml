<p id="Par12">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease, traditionally characterised by loss of articular cartilage. However, for the knee, in the last years, more and more interest has also been directed towards the meniscus since meniscal damage is strongly associated with development of knee OA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Both articular cartilage and menisci have similar functions, which are to withstand load and to distribute weight across surfaces, but their ultrastructure is somewhat different [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Articular cartilage consists of chondrocytes that produce structural macromolecules, which, together with water, builds up the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the chondrocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These macromolecules are mainly collagens (predominantly type II) and proteoglycans (predominantly aggrecan) as well as non-collagenous proteins and glycoproteins. The meniscus also contains a dense ECM, but unlike articular cartilage, which only has one cell-type, the meniscus contains several different cell-types in its different regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the outer (peripheral) parts of the meniscus, which also contains blood vessels (red zone), the cells are mostly elongated fibroblast-like and in the inner region (white zone), the cells are mostly round chondrocyte-like. In addition, the superficial regions have been reported to host progenitor cells [

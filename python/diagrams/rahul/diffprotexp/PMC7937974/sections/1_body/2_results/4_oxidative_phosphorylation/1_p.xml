<p>To explore the role of OXPHOS in the expression of E-selectin, oligomycin (50 μg/ml), a phosphorylation-specific inhibitor, or DMSO was added when HCAECs were treated with sera from KD patients with different coronary artery outcomes for 4 h. As shown, the expression levels of E-selectin mRNA and protein were significantly decreased after treated with oligomycin (

To examine the role of OXPHOS on intercellular adhesion, HCAECs were treated with sera from KD patients with different coronary artery outcomes with oligomycin (50 μg/ml) or DMSO for 4 h, then incubated with BCECF-AM-labeled THP-1 for another 1 h, and the adherent THP-1 cells were measured with a microplate reader. Cell adhesion was significantly reduced when treated with oligomycin (

0: To obtain good zero-level accuracy, it is important to ensure that symmetry is maintained within the experimental setup.
1: This includes sample and reference heat capacities [ 122, 123], crucible or pan masses/heat capacities, and of course sample positioning and potentially sensor cover placement [ 125].

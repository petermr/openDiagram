<p>Blending PVA with biopolymers (especially polysaccharides) increases the biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and swelling of hydrogels, through the increase in the density of the hydrophilic groups [

 <xref rid="B10-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It also improves the flexibility, hardness, and compression resistance of the PVA-blend hydrogels through the creation of extended crosslinking points in the polymer matrix [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, the addition of polysaccharides with ionized or ionizable groups to PVA, for example chitosan, alginates, carrageenan, pectin, pectinates, or modified cellulose, leads to the formation of hydrogels with new functional properties (antimicrobial materials [

Supplementary, this addition modulates the release of ionic or polar active principles (antibiotics, nutraceuticals, and other drugs) in controlled-release applications, while also extending or improving the performance of the PVA hydrogel matrix in conjunction with the sorption of potentially harmful species (e.g., dyes [

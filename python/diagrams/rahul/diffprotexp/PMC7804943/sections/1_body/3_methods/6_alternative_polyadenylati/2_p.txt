0: To further filter events for MOFA analysis (see below), the following steps were performed.
1: First, genes with total expression of at least 3 transcripts per million (TPM) in 22 or more (out of 24) samples were retained.
2: This ensures that genes are expressed in the majority of samples studied.
3: Second, these genes were further filtered for those whose proximal 3 UTR is expressed by at least 1 TPM in six or more samples.
4: This ensures that there are examples of APA where the proximal 3 UTR is expressed (in comparison to other samples).
5: Finally, we filtered for 3 UTRs with a |PPAU| > 20 between one or more pairs of cell types, where PPAU is defined as the difference between the median PPAU of two cell types.

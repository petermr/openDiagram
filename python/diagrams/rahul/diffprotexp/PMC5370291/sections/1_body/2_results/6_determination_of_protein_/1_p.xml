<p>To confirm the expression changes of proteins in response to TNFα treatment, we performed immunoblotting to determine the expression level of proteins which have been reported associating with cell survival, cell cycle, protein degradation, and energy metabolism. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, we noted that TNFα treatment altered the expression level of 14-3-3ε, α-actinin-1, calnexin, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), cathepsin B, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), gelsolin, and sialidase-1/NEU1, and the changes of these proteins were consistent with the above spectral counting quantitation. Thus, we proposed that the quantitative analysis by MS/MS spectra counting highly correlated with that by immunoblotting.

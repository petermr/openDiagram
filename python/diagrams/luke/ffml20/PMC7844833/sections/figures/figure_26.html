 <caption> (a) Cu K-edge XANES data for Cu catalysts doped with different amounts of boron. (b) Increase of the Cu oxidation state as monitored by the absorption edge position with increasing boron concentration. Results in panels a and b are shown for catalysts after electrochemical reduction by cycling potential 5 times between −0.5 V to −2 V versus RHE. (c) In situ Cu K-edge XANES data collected under CO 2RR conditions (in 0.1 M KHCO 3 electrolyte at −1.1 V versus RHE) show the lack of further changes in catalyst composition and structure.

<p>After 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> stimulation for 2 and 6 hours, the levels of gene expression of several genes related to TLR signaling and the TREM1 pathway inflammatory response were measured by real-time qPCR. Besides cytokines such as IL6, CXCL1, IL1β, and TNFα, we also evaluated gene expression of the receptors TLR2, TLR4, and the adaptor of MyD88.

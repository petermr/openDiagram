<p>The major limitation of the study is the lack of experimental validations of the identified ZINC compounds on the RCC samples or cell lines. Future in vitro studies need to be conducted to evaluate the effects of ZINC compounds identified on cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Moreover, the mechanism of actions of these molecules need to be investigated in detail to elucidate their effect on molecular pathways such as apoptosis and cell cycle. Rather than being considered as a single agent, these compounds can also be regarded as adjuvant therapy to the baseline therapeutics, then, the critical extension of this work would be to learn whether the observations of in vitro studies can be recapitulated by in vivo studies and eventually in clinical trials. Another point that has a crucial role in translation to the clinic is sampling where body fluids are favorable for the detection of the biomarkers. Proteomics studies also need be verified for the proteins exhibiting significantly high diagnostic and prognostic performance for relevant subtypes. Moreover, these biomarkers could also assist oncologists to assist in optimal diagnosis and prognosis management.</p>

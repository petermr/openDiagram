<p>Lactoferrin (LF), a naturally occurring, non-toxic iron-binding glycoprotein present in several mucosal secretions, plays an important role in the first line of defence against microbial infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is known that LF has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a wide range of human and animal viruses including both DNA and RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of LF may have additional benefits in severe infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of an intestinal receptor for the uptake of LF following oral administration [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], resistance to proteolytic degradation by trypsin and trypsin-like enzymes [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and several established oral delivery systems for LF [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], ensures its oral bioavailability.

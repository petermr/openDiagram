<p>Transferases proteins are mainly found to be a participant in metabolic processes i.e., carbohydrate and intracellular amino acid. Among the 12 transferases, there were four up-regulated in non-Se-enriched rice and eight down-regulated proteins in natural Se-enriched rice. CYS and metE proteins were found to have high expression. The former was the up-regulated protein, and the latter was the down-regulated protein. CYS can catalyze plants to synthesize cysteine [

 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-09-00130" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as metE protein expression was found more in Se-enriched rice. Therefore, the carbohydrate and intracellular amino acid metabolism ability of transferase in natural Se-enriched rice were higher.

<p id="Par42">Considering the limited values of common tumor biomarkers in T2DM patients, we next performed SWATH-MS, PRM-MS and ELISA analyses to identify and validate novel biomarkers for the detection of LAC in T2DM patients. The overall strategy and simplified workflow are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. Briefly, 20 samples obtained from 5 healthy controls, 5 T2DM patients, 5 LAC patients and 5 T2DM patients with LAC were submitted for SWATH-MS analysis to identify DEPs specific for LAC in patients with T2DM. These results were next validated by PRM-MS and ELISA analysis. Moreover, the validation set consisting of 20 serum samples from T2DM patients and 20 serum samples from T2DM patients with LAC were collected for ELISA analysis and further validation.

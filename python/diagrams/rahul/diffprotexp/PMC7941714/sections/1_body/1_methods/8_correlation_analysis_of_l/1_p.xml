<p id="Par37">We performed Pearson correlation analysis and selected the positive correlations between the lncRNAs and mRNAs in ceRNA network. Pearson correlation coefficient &gt; 0.4 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 were used as inclusion criteria. Based on the above co-expression relationships, we constructed a ceRNA subnetwork to investigate the potential mechanisms.

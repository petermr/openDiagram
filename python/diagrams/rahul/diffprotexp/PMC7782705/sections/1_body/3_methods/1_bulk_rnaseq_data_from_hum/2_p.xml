<p id="Par30">Metadata obtained from each study was used to classify patients into Control and Alzheimer’s disease groups (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Briefly, for the MSBB dataset, we used patients with Neuropathology Category (NP.1) labeled as “Control” and “definitive Alzheimer”. For the Mayo dataset, we used the “Diagnosis” column of the metadata, selecting only “AD” and “Control” patients. For the ROSMAP dataset, we also used the column “Diagnosis” of the metadata, selecting only “Control” (value = 1) and “Alzheimer with no other conditions” (value = 4). In all those datasets, subjects marked as “AD” showed Braak stage values higher than 4. In the MSBB dataset, CDR scores of AD patients were consistently higher than 2. In the Mayo and ROSMAP datasets, all AD patients had also a definitive diagnosis according to NINCDS criteria. Covariates such as “Postmortem interval (PMI)”, “RNA integrity number (RIN)”, “Age of death”, and “Sex” were balanced among the different groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Chi-square test, p &gt; 0.05). We used RIN and PMI as covariates in our model to control for possible “batch effects” (linear regression). For detailed information of all individual samples used in this study, please refer to Supplementary Table

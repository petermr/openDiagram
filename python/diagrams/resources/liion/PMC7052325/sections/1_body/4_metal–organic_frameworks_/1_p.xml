<p>Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline solids composed of metal ions coordinated by multifunctional organic molecules with a three-dimensional porous structure. The composition and structure of MOFs could be easily adjusted via the rational selection of the metal ion and organic molecule (Rouhani et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Furthermore, they feature poor electrical conductivity and well-defined porous structure, allowing for fast ion diffusion (Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Therefore, MOFs could be promising candidates as ideal ionic conductors for selective transport. Many MOFs have been reported as solid Li
 <sup>+</sup> conductors, with the conductivities as high as 3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at room temperature. In contrast, the work on solid Mg conductors is still few in the field.

<p id="Par38">The protein supernatant from above was directly added to a 30 K spin filter and mixed with 200 μL of 8 M urea in Tris-HCl and centrifuged at 14000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The concentrate was diluted with 200 μL of urea solution and centrifuged at 14000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. Then, 10 μL of 10 X IAA in urea solution was added to the concentrate in the filter and vortexed for 1 min. The spin filter was incubated for 20 min at RT in the dark followed by centrifugation at 14000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. To the concentrate on the filter, 100 μL of urea solution was added and centrifuged at 14000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min then repeated 2X. There was 100 μL of 100 mM ABC solution added to the spin filter and centrifuged at 14000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min then repeated 2X. Then, 0.1 μg/μL of LysC was added 1:100 and incubated O/N at 30 °C. Following incubation, 40 μL of 100 mM ABC solution was added and centrifuged at 14000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and repeated 1X to increase peptide yield. Finally, 50 μL of 0.5 M NaCl solution was added to the spin filter and centrifuged at 14000 x g for 10 min.

<p>In order to develop a quantitative method for tongue prognosis, we integrated the six RBPs signature to establish a nomogram (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). Based on the multivariate Cox analysis, points were assigned to individual variables by using the point scale in the nomogram. We draw a horizontal line to determine the point of each variable and calculate the total points for each patient by summing the points of all variables, and normalize it to a distribution of 0 to 100. We can calculate the estimated survival rates for tongue patients at 1, 3, and 5 years by drafting a vertical line between the total point axis and each prognosis axis, which might help relevant practitioners to develop clinical decision making for tongue patients. The predictive accuracy for the 5-year OS, as measured by AUC, was 0.780 in the TCGA internal validation cohort (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). The nomogram was externally validated by an independent validation cohort of 97 tongue cancer patients from GEO database, and the AUC of the nomogram for predicting the 5-year OS was 0.756 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C). The results demonstrated that the nomogram has good prognostic discrimination ability. In addition, as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C, the nomogram displayed higher accuracy for predicting survival in both cohorts than the TNM staging system. Briefly, the AUCs of nomogram in both TCGA and GEO-validation cohort (0.780; 0.756) were higher than the TNM stage (0.615; 0.553). These results suggested that our nomogram is more accurate and useful for predicting OS of tongue cancer patients compared to the conventional TNM stage.

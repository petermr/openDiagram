0: Reciprocal coIPs were performed as described previously in the coIP section, except antibodies to the coprecipitates, SPARC and Parvin were used to coprecipitate Kcnma1 and Ilk, respectively, from P3 lysate.
1: Antibodies and techniques used in the immunocomplex capture method were as before.
2: Blots were probed with BK polyclonal antibody at 1:400 (Chemicon) and Ilk-polyclonal antibody at 1:500 (Proteintech Group) with rocking O/N at 4 C, followed with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:7500 or with mouse anti-rabbit light chain at 1:15,000 with rocking at RT for 1 h, respectively.
3: Negative controls were as before and positive controls consisted of lysate probed with SPARC and Parvin.
4: Immunoreactive bands were developed as described previously.

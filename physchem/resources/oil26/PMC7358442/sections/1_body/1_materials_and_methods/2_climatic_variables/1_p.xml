<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We recorded the air temperature at the study site at 30-min intervals using a weather station (Watchdog 2700, Spectrum Technologies Inc., United States; data provided by A. Young, Exeter University). From these data, we calculated for each 24-h period the minimum, maximum, and mean air temperatures. We assessed local long-term rainfall over the 33 years, including 30 years preceding our study (1982&#8211;2015; each year starting in July and ending the following June) using FLDAS_NOAH010 data provided via the online data system Giovanni, the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) Interactive Online Visualization and Analysis Infrastructure, developed and maintained by the NASA GES DISC<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Acker and Leptoukh, 2007</xref>). During our study, we recorded rainfall on the study site using an event logger (HOBO Pendant Event data logger, Onset Computer Corporation, United States) and tipping bucket (Davis Instruments Corporation, United States). To assess rainfall during the growing season before our study started, we obtained rainfall data from the rainfall database of Tswalu. The two datasets showed high levels of agreement during overlapping measurement periods. We calculated total rainfall per month for the period January 2012 to December 2015. For the same period, we obtained daily times of sunrise and sunset for the nearest town (Upington, situated 200 km southwest of the study site<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote2">2</xref></sup>), from which we calculated the daily photoperiod.</p>

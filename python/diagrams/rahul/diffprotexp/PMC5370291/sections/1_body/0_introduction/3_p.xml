<p>In this study, we aimed to explore the differential protein expression in response to TNFα by using a label-free quantitative proteomic approach, combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and spectra counting, to identify and semi-quantitate the changes of protein expression in HCC cell HepG2. The identified proteins with significant change were subjected to gene ontology (GO), KEGG annotation analysis, and biological evaluation of the understanding of specific pathways and subcellular processes induced by TNFα.</p>

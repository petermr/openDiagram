0: Raw CEL files were quality control assessed using the Affymetrix Expression Console software (version 1.1).
1: All array files were then processed in the programming language R using Bioconductor packages: The  pd.hta.2.0 package was used for platform design information annotation and the  affy package was used to summarise probe-level data into a single expression measure for each individual transcript and pre-process the data.
2: The  affy package was used to perform normalisation and probe specific background correction before summarising the probe set values into a single expression measure according to default settings.
3: Highly variable probes were used to cluster samples and produce a dissimilarity matrix.
4: The highly variable probes were used to create a cluster dendrogram of samples based on both transcript- and probe-level differences and illustrate how samples cluster to identify any major outliers of which there were none.
5: The PCAmethods library was used to conduct principal component analysis (PCA) to test for run order effects and  limma was used for differential expression analysis.
6: The arrayWeights function in limma was used to assess array quality using default parameters.
7: Differential expression analysis was adjusted for baseline DAS28, age, gender, concurrent DMARD use, and array weights.
8: Pathway analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool (version 33559992) according to default settings.

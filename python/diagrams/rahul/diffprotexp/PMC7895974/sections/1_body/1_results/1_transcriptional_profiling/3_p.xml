<p id="Par8">Previously described somite TFs, such as 
 <italic>NKX6-2</italic>, 
 <italic>NKX3-2</italic>, 
 <italic>ZIC1</italic> and 
 <italic>HES5</italic>, were highly enriched in ES compared to PSM, as well as the gap junction protein GJA5 (Connexin 40). Marker genes important for myogenic (
 <italic>MyoD1</italic> and 
 <italic>ACTC1</italic>) and chondrogenic (
 <italic>PAX9</italic>, 
 <italic>FST</italic>) cell lineages were enriched in MS compared to ES. Markers for chondrocytes (Chondromodulin, 
 <italic>CNMD</italic>), bone homoeostasis (Leucine-rich repeat containing, 
 <italic>LRRC17</italic>) and cartilage (Keratan sulfate proteoglycan Keratocan, 
 <italic>KERA</italic>) were identified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b–d</xref>). Myogenin (
 <italic>MYOG</italic>), a TF involved in differentiation of muscle fibres was enriched in DS compared to MS, as was expression of the neural crest cell (NCC) TF 
 <italic>SOX10</italic>, due to NCCs migrating through the rostral half of differentiating somites. Other genes highly expressed in DS include the serine protease inhibitor, 
 <italic>SPINK5</italic>; Troponin T2 (
 <italic>TNNT2</italic>) and Myomesin (
 <italic>MYOM1</italic>), encoding important proteins of the contractile sarcomere; 
 <italic>CREBRF</italic>, a negative regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and 
 <italic>ZFPM2</italic>, a zinc finger TF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

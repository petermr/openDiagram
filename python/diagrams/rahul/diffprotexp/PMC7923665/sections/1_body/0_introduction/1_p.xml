<p id="Par14">Cerebral arterio venous malformations (AVMs) are an important cause for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and neurological morbidity in young adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The AVM nidus structures consist of abnormal blood vessels whose identity is distinct from normal vascular structures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These lesions can occur in any of the four lobes of the brain, and patients with cerebral AVM present symptoms such as headache, seizures, and hemorrhage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The etiological factors for cerebral AVM development are not clearly understood. Earlier, we have reported that cerebral AVM nidus structures have aberrant expression of genes involved in both early and late stages of vascular development and that nidus structure of AVM co-express artery, vein, and brain capillary markers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Approximately 900 genes have been identified to be associated with the pathogenesis of cerebral AVM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Deregulated genes in AVM are associated with various cellular pathways that include genes regulating endocrine hormones, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory factors, matrix metalloproteinases, and angiogenic factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is unclear whether these genetic defects represent a primary cause for the disease or are a secondary response to disease development. Also, lack of good animal models to demonstrate the features of cerebral AVMs is impeding to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms of AVM [

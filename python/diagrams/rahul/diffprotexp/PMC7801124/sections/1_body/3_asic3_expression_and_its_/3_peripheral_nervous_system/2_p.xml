<p>In rat cutaneous sensory neurones, ~60% exhibit ASIC3-like currents (as identified by sensitivity to the ASIC3 inhibitor APETx2) and responded synergistically to mild acidification, hypertonicity, and arachidonic acid; combinatorial stimuli that also increased nociceptor excitability and produced pain [
 <xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The group went further to show that ASIC3 expression is increased 24 hours after plantar incision, with inhibition of ASIC3 significantly reducing spontaneous, thermal, and postural pain behaviors [
 <xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The role of ASIC3 in pain in general is further supported by ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice displaying a reduced latency to the onset of moderate to high-intensity pain stimuli, in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, hot-plate test and in mechanically induced pain [
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Moreover, injection of acetic acid (pH ~3.5–4.0) or SL-NH2 (a peptide that causes itch) alone to both ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> and WT mice produced no difference in response between genotypes, but a combination of acid and SL-NH2 caused a statistically significant increase in scratching in WT mice compared to ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup>, which was ablated by administration of amiloride; subsequent analysis found that SL-NH2 slows the rate of pH 5.0-induced ASIC3 desensitization which may contribute to itch behavior [
 <xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus overall, these data support the role of ASIC3 in cutaneous pain and itch.

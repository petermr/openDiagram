<p id="Par27">Although neither of the two tetraploid wheat accessions screened here were sensitive to ToxB, the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic>-ToxB interaction has previously been reported in 
 <italic>T. durum</italic>. This was first shown in the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) hexaploid wheat bi-parental mapping population, in which ToxB sensitivity is conferred by the synthetic hexaploid wheat line ‘W7984’ (Friesen and Faris 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). As ‘W7984’ was developed from a cross between 
 <italic>T. durum</italic> variety ‘Altar 84’ (the AB sub-genome donor) and 
 <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> accession ‘CI 18’ (D sub-genome donor), the ToxB sensitivity on chromosome 2BS identified in the ITMI population must have originated from 
 <italic>T. durum</italic>. More recently, QTL analysis of ToxB sensitivity and 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> race 5 isolates in an ‘Altar’ × ‘Langdon’ durum population has demonstrated the role of ToxB sensitivity conferred by the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus with tan spot susceptibility in 
 <italic>T. durum</italic> (Virdi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2016</xref>).

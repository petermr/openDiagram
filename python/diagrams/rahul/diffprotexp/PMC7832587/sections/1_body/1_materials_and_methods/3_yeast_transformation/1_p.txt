0: The different proteins and protein complexes were expressed in the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W3031b Gal4-2 (, leu2, his3, trp1::TRP1-GAL10-GAL4, ura3, ade2-1, canr, cir+) [ 32].
1: For yeast transformation, 5 ml of non-transformed W3031b Gal4-2 strain was cultured in S6 AU minimal media (0.1% (w/v) Bacto TM Casamino Acids, 0.7% (w/v) Yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and with ammonium sulphate), 2% (w/v) glucose, 20 g/mL adenine and 20 g/mL uracil) for 24 h at 28C.
2: Cells were mixed with 1 g of plasmid DNA and 100 g of salmon sperm DNA (denatured at 100C for 5 min and cooled down on ice).
3: After vortexing, 500 L of 40% (w/v) PEG 4000, 100 mM lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 1 mM EDTA and 20 L of 1 M DTT was added.
4: The tube was vortexed again and left overnight at room temperature.
5: The next morning the tube was centrifuged at 350   g for 2 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were re-suspended in 100 L of S6A minimal media (SAU without uracil) and plated on S6A-agar plates.
6: The plates were left in the incubator at 28C for 35 days until the transformed colonies appeared.

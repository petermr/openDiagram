0: Psicheck Luciferase Reporter vectors (Sangon co., LTD, shanghai, china) ligated with Wild-Type (WT) and Mutant-Type (MUT) PPP1R14B/LINC00466 3-untranslated-regions (3UTR) were established.
1: Thereafter, HEK293T cells (Thermo Fisher, USA) were added into 48-well plates for 24 h of incubation.
2: miR-137/NC and PPP1R14B/LINC00466 WT-vector/MUT-vector were co-transfected into cells.
3: Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used to analyze the results.
4: Experiments were repeated at least three times.

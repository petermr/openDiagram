<p> Lipid oxidation involves the formation of hydroperoxides as primary oxidation products which are unstable and may break down to a variety of volatile and nonvolatile compounds as secondary products. Secondary products are responsible for off flavors and some of them can be toxic. Secondary products are determined by measuring the p-anisidine content.

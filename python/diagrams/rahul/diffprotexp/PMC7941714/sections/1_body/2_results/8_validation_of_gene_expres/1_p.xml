<p id="Par48">We used TCGA and GTEx datasets in GEPIA to further validate the differential expression of genes between tumor and normal samples. The expression levels of PLAU, OSBPL3, LOX, VCAN, E2F1, and SRM were upregulated in COAD and READ tissues compared with normal tissues (all 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). However, the expression of COL5A2 showed no differential expression between tumor and normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry results were obtained from the THPA database, and the staining scores were quantified to verify the protein expression levels of the genes. The staining scores for SRM (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0015), OSBPL3 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0263), and VCAN (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0229) were higher in the CRC tissue than normal tissue, whereas PLAU (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0169) showed the opposite pattern. There was no significant difference between the E2F1 staining scores (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.6213) for CRC and normal tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>).

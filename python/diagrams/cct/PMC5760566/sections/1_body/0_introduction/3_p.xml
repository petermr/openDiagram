 </sup>. Generally, the forged RPVs are quenched and tempered, as result, the through-thickness microstructure vary significantly because of the differential cooling rates during quenching. These differing microstructures will lead to heterogeneous mechanical properties along the thickness direction of the RPV. Therefore, an understanding of the microstructure and mechanical properties of RPV steels with different quenched microstructures is essential.

<p id="par0145">Based on the information’s generated from the transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we selected MAPK (transcript_8242; spot ID 28) and MAPK (transcript_2834; spot ID 18) for the cloning. RT-PCR showed amplification of ∼1.6 Kb (transcript_8242) and ∼1.3 Kb (transcript_2834), as visualized on agarose gel (0.8%). Further, the amplified products were cloned, sequenced and submitted in NCBI GenBank with accession nos. KT835664 (MAPK_8242 designated as “
 <italic>MAPK</italic>”) and MK854806 (MAPK_2834 designated as “
 <italic>MAPK-1</italic>”).

0: For the role of LMNA in regulating euchromatin in DCM, we speculate that it may result from the abnormal binding between LMNA alone or LAP2-lamin A/C complexes and euchromatin in myocardial cells.
1: To test this hypothesis, we tried to elucidate the potential biological processes and signaling pathways associated with LMNA mutation-associated DCM through deeply analyzing the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, which were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.
2: Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis were further conducted to assess the potential functions of the differential binding genes.
3: The dysregulated hub genes and associated signaling pathways were also discovered in this study.

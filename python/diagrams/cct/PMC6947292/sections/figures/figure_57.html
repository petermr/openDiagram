 <caption> ( A) Raw 1000 K/s reheating curves for states previously cooled at rates of 10 K/s (first reheating) and 10 5 K/s (second reheating = baseline measurement). ( B) Subtracted measurement curves, i.e., curves measured for the first reheating minus the curves measured for the second reheating, for various cooling rates. The baselines for integration are indicated by dashed lines [ 129]. </caption>

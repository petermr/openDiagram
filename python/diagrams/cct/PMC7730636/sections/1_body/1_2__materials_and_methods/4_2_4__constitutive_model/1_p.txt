0: For this material, we chose a mathematical model based on the Arrhenius equation.
1: This model is represented by the equation [ 28]  (6)Z= expQRT and  (7)  =AFexpQRT where    is strain rate,  A is material constant,  Z is ZenerHollomon parameter,  R is the gas constant (8.314 J/molK),  Q is the activation energy and acts as an indicator of deformation difficulty in the physical deformation theory, and  T is the temperature [ 29].
2: The  Z parameter represents the temperature compensated strain rate, which has been widely used to characterize the behavior of materials in hot working [ 30].
3: F is a function of flow stress and can be described as follows: (8)F=n<0.8exp>1.2sinhnfor all  where  n,  , and   are material constants and can be determined from experimental flow stress data.
4: The material constant   is determined using the parameters n and   defined as [ 31]  (9)n=ln lnT and  (10)=ln T

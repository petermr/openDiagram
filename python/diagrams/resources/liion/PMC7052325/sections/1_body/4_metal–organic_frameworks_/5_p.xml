<p>Despite the promising properties, additional salt contents in excess are required for MOFs solid conductors based on the number of available anion binding sites. Furthermore, activation energies are sometimes higher that what are expected, due to the strong pairing between cations and anions of the salts. Electrochemical stability upon cycling is another challenge for some reported MOFs-based conductors.</p>

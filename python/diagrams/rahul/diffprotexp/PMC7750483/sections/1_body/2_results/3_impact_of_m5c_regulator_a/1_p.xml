<p>Next, we used clinical information in the TCGA database to evaluate the influence of m
 <sup>5</sup>C writers and reader expression on the survival rate in patients with GI cancer. Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis showed that the differential expression of some m
 <sup>5</sup>C writers and reader was significantly related to overall survival (OS) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In this picture, we can find that except the 
 <italic>NSUN7</italic> gene, the survival rates of other genes have significant differences in the different GI cancers. Among them, the 
 <italic>P</italic> value of the 
 <italic>NSUN5</italic> and 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> genes in colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and GC is less than 0.05, and the 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic> gene also has significant differences in colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and PC. Remarkably, high expression of almost all m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators was significantly associated with shorter OS in HCC patients. These results suggest that m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators may play an important role in the survival of HCC patients.

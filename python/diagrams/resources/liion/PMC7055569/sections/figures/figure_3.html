 <caption> a) A rechargeable room‐temperature sodium superoxide (NaO 2) battery. b) Different possible pathways for energy storage in nonaqueous Na–O 2 and Li–O 2 battery. In both metal–O 2 battery formed discharge intermediate (O 2 −) reacts with Li + ion and Na + ion. In both cases, metal superoxide is formed but in case of Li, LiO 2 is unstable and further reacts to form Li 2O 2 whereas, NaO 2 is thermodynamically more stable. Other possible reactions are shown in gray color. Reproduced with permission.[qv: 6c] Copyright 2012, Nature Publishing Group. </caption>

<p>To further confirm 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm formation, the structure of the 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm was identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The biofilm examination relied heavily on SEM. Because of its high magnification, the biofilm microstructure is observed clearly. These findings further confirm that 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> can form biofilms 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although these procedures have their advantages, the TCP procedure lacks specificity and sensitivity because crystal violet stains all of the components of the biofilm and could potentially stain non-biofilm material. More specific and sensitive techniques can be performed to assess each of the individual components. This method is good for screening purposes.

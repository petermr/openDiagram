<p>Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, United States), and it was reverse-transcribed into cDNAs using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, United States) with Oligo (dT18) RT primers (Sangon, Shanghai, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Master Mixture (TAKARA, Dalian, China). The relative expression levels of the mRNAs were normalized vs. GAPDH expression, and miRNAs were normalized to U6. Comparative quantification was performed using the 2

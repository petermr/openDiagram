0: To obtain a dynamic range that covers cooling rates of several orders of magnitude and also allows us to analyse the full temperature range, it is essential to combine several types of DSC device [ 83].
1: In this work, a total of five different DSC devices were used: two relatively slow CALVET-type heat-flux differential scanning calorimeters, a disc-sensor type heat-flux differential scanning calorimeter, a power-compensated differential scanning calorimeter and a chip-sensor-based differential fast scanning calorimeter (DFSC, [ 134]).
2: These devices and their ranges of scanning rates can be seen in  Figure 11A.
3: As is obvious from  Figure 11B, the large variation in cooling rates also causes a strong variation in the sample mass.
4: Large sample masses are crucial for slow scans, since the heat flow signal is proportional to the scanning rate and sample mass.
5: This means that if the scanning rate is very small, the signal can only become strong enough for detection if the sample mass is large.
6: On the other side of the spectrum, small sample masses are essential to allow for fast cooling [ 134].
7: The cooling rate range can be extended in either direction (slower and faster cooling) by indirect measurements [ 117, 129].
8: The basic concept of these extending experiments is the same in either direction, and will be explained in  Section 3.1.3.

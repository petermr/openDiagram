<p>The differences between up-regulated and down-regulated DEPs for some pathways were mesmerizing, as disclosed by GO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00130-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Some pathways like ‘extracellular region part’, ‘viral reproduction’ and ‘nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity’ were found to be expressed only in non-Se enriched rice. The Se responsive differential expressed proteins were mainly associated with diverse cellular functions that were related to cellular process, a main constituent of the cell and cell parts, ionic binding and catalytic activity (

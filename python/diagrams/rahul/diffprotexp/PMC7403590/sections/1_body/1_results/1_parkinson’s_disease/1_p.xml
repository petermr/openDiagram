 </sup>. In 
 <italic>post-mortem</italic> human brain samples obtained from PD patients, Braak stage IV–VI, we observe a decrease in acetylated-tubulin and in acetylated-tau levels in SNpc (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These alterations were not evident in hippocampal or cortical samples indicating a specific effect on the brain structure more affected in PD. Interestingly, phospho-Tau levels were decreased in SNpc and cortical samples. Previous in vitro studies showed that microtubule disassembly induced by mitochondrial dysfunction impairs autophagy and decreases lysosomal activation leading to SNCA aggregation and neurodegeneration

 </sup>. Herein, we observed an increase in LC3II levels and a decrease in Cathepsin D (CatD) levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) in the SNpc. Unexpectedly, we found a decrease in LAMP2A levels in cortical and hippocampus samples. Correlated with autophagic alterations we found SNCA oligomers accumulation in the SNpc and most interestingly Aβ deposition in the hippocampus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Taking into account that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a central contributor for proteostatic dysfunction we evaluated some key ER stress proteins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. We detected that the ER chaperone GRP78 and the transcription factor ATF4 involved in ER stress responses are decreased in PD SNpc (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) indicating ER stress contribution to PD pathophysiology. Regarding synaptic markers, we only observed a decrease in the post-synaptic protein PSD95 in the SNpc (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

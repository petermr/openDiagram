0: Lysates were prepared from 16 P3 and P30 CBA/J mice cochleae sensory epithelia, as described above.
1: Protein concentrations were determined by DC Protein assay (Bio-Rad) and equal amounts of proteins (3 g/lane) from P3 and P30 tissues were resolved on Criterion 415% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences).
2: Blots were blocked at RT for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20] with 4.5% milk and then probed with respective primary antibodies including, anti-Dbn1 at 1:500, anti-Parvin at 1:800, anti-SPARC at 1:1000, and anti-Tmed10 at 1:1000 (all from Proteintech Group) with rocking O/N at 4 C. Beta-actin was used as a protein loading control using anti- actin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam) for detection.
3: Before adding secondary antibody, blots were washed 1X with TBS and 2X with 0.05% Tween/TBS.
4: Membranes were then incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000 with rocking at RT for 1 h. Secondary antibody was removed and blots washed 1X with TBS, 2X with 0.05% Tween/TBS, and a final wash with TBS.
5: Immunoreactive bands were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and Magic Mark XP (Invitrogen) was used as the protein standard to estimate relative mobilities.

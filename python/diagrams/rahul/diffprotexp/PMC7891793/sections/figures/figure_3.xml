  <title>A map of predicted connections among GO terms based on the analysis of differentially expressed genes in lesional lung tissue (LL) vs lung tissue without lesions (LN) is shown.</title>
  <p>Gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (p&lt;0.05) in each treatment group was conducted and results were visualized as a map of predicted connections among significantly enriched GO terms with Kappa threshold of 0.4.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we found 9 key genes that may influence the development of sepsis. Among them, MAPK14, FGR, and CD247 expression may be modified by methylation. MAPK14 has already been identified as a key gene and potential therapeutic target in neonatal sepsis.

 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> FGR proto-oncogene (FGR) is a Src family kinase that is expressed in innate immune cells, including macrophages and granulocytes, and is considered a major signaling molecule downstream of many immune cell receptors.

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice have leukocyte migration disorder, and FGR is involved in the release of proinflammatory mediators.

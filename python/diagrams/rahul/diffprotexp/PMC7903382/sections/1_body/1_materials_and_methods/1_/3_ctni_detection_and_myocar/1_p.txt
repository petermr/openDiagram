0: cTnI level was determined using an Automated Blood or Urine Chemical Analyzer (Vitro 350; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics).
1: H&E staining and Masson trichrome staining were conducted in the myocardial tissue samples in order to observe the myocardial pathology.
2: Heart tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24 h at room temperature and embedded with paraffin, before 4-m thick sections were cut.
3: After deparaffinization by washing with xylene followed by rehydration in a descending ethanol gradient, sections were immersed in hematoxylin for 5-7 min, differentiated in 1% acid alcohol for 2-5 sec and stained with 0.5% eosin for 2 min.
4: After rinsing with distilled water for 30 sec, sections were dehydrated with an ascending ethanol gradient and were cleared in xylene.
5: All procedures were carried out at room temperature.
6: Using a light microscope (magnification x200; Leica DM 4000B; Leica Microsystems, Inc.), pathological changes of myocardial tissues were observed.
7: The procedure of Masson's trichrome staining was similar to H&E staining, which was described previously ( 31).

<p>Solvometallurgy, the extraction of metals from primary and secondary sources using solutions containing less than 50 vol. % of water, can offer complementary advantages to hydrometallurgical processes. These include the potential integration of the leaching and solvent extraction in a single step as well as a greater leaching selectivity compared to acidic aqueous solutions thereby simplifying subsequent purification steps [

For example, simple organic solutions were shown to selectively dissolve gold and platinum group metals with high dissolution rates under mild conditions, thereby providing a more benign alternative to the aggressive aqua regia or cyanidation processes [

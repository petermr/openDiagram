<p id="Par16">We showed here a first whole genome identification and annotation of lncRNAs in carrot by combining a high throughput stranded RNA-Seq based approach with a focused bioinformatic pipeline. Through this process, we identified 6373 novel lncRNAs, as compared to the 915 sequences annotated in the original carrot genome assembly

 </sup>. Moreover, 10% of them (641 genes) can be defined as anthocyanin biosynthesis-related lncRNAs since we found them differentially expressed between purple and orange carrots. In order to assess the presumed function of such lncRNAs, we focused on those showing an antisense relationship with differentially expressed protein coding genes, known (or putatively) involved in carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis and depicted in the precedent paragraph. Additionally, the selected lncNATs had to present a statistically significant Pearson and Spearman correlation with their putative targets to further refine our functional predictions. This led us to identify 19 differentially expressed lncNATs between purple and orange carrots. Interestingly, we found two of these lncNATs (

 <italic>asDcMYB7</italic>) transcribed in opposite direction to 
 <italic>DcMYB6</italic> and 
 <italic>DcMYB7</italic>, respectively. Moreover, 
 <italic>asDcMYB6</italic> and 
 <italic>asDcMYB7</italic> exhibited concordant expression patterns with their corresponding sense transcripts opening the possibility that non-coding RNA antisense transcription is a new player in the regulation of carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis, through 
 <italic>DcMYB7</italic> (and/or 
 <italic>DcMYB6</italic>). This regulation maybe linked to the previously proposed unknown genetic factors

<p>RAN is a member of the Ras family of small GTPases, and it plays a critical role in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of macromolecules through the nuclear pore complex by promoting assembly and disassembly reactions of transport receptors and cargo. Several proteins that were decreased in the RAN signaling pathway, IPO5, KPNB1, KPNA2, are importins and receptors that can bind with nuclear localization signal (NLS) and are involved in the import of proteins into the nucleus, while XPO1 mediates leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-dependent protein transport [

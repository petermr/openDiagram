The mass of undifferentiated cells (blastema) surrounding the injured tissue results in the formation of fully functional replica or imperfect replica&#x000a0;which enacts the phenomenon of epimorphic regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The ability to regenerate a full limb is absent in mammals but urodeles; teleost and anamniotes have the propensity to replace limbs, spinal cords, nervous system, heart, tail and, other body parts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To understand the mechanistic framework of regeneration, research studies have been majorly executed in urodeles amphibians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and teleost fishes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Though amniotes i.e. lizards are closely related to mammals and other vertebrates, limited studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> have been carried towards understanding the molecular mechanism of regeneration.</p><p id="Par3">Lizard capacity to self-detach or amputate their tail in flight response from predators is known as the shedding of the tail or caudal autotomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These stages include exudation of excessive blood loss; minimizing muscle and bone tissue damage; controlled vascularisation; promotes wound epithelium and further unsegmented remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The detachment of tail activates multiple cellular responses which spurts the blastema mediated cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, angiogenesis, remodelling and generating a replacement. Studies related to the patterning of successful regenerated autotomized tail or replica consists mainly of nerve cells networking, unsegmented cartilaginous, muscle cells, blood vessels and differential remodelling of cells which make this an interesting research to comprehend the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with the developmentof regenerated tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. With the elucidation of the genes and their associated proteins involved in regeneration, there can be a possibility of understanding why in human&#x02019;s regeneration is restricted as compared to anamniotes. This also might pave in giving insights into spinal injuries and the fabrication of replacement therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Though many genes or proteins have been known still the underlying mechanisms of these molecules remains ambiguous. In this study for the first time we have used common house Gecko, <italic>Hemidactylus frenatus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> as a model animal to study the genes/proteins associated with tail regeneration particularly during the initial stages of tail regeneration. <italic>Hemidactylus frenatus</italic> have been studied generally for their behavioural, habitat diversification and regenerative abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Lately, molecular and gene-specific studies focus on the role of genes like SOX9, PAX7, BMP, FGF, Wnt, MMP&#x02019;s which are usually associated with regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Thus, the activation and intricate cross-talk of these molecules during the process are still unaddressed and need to be better understood.</p><p id="Par5">In this research, we sought to study the molecular mechanisms of lost tail regeneration process during wound healing and initiation of repair mechanism stage (0-dpa, 1-dpa, 2-dpa, and 5-dpa). The 1&#x02013;5-dpa stage would shed light on involvement of genes or proteins during wound healing and initiation of proliferation/activation of multiple cells initiating blastema formation which eventually leads to the regeneration of tail. The initial stages (i.e. wound healing) are responsible for wound epithelium and initiating apical epidermal cap (AEC) in amphibians&#x000a0;which regulates blastema formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> whereas in lizards- similar to AEC an uncertain apical epidermal PEG(AEP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> forms.

However, this stage-specific study has not been carried out in this species- and it is necessary for deciphering the crucial molecules which kick starts the regenerative mechanism in these amniotes.

Several known and unknown genes/proteins which were identified in this study were also involved in epimorphic regeneration of caudal fin tissue of zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>; arm of brittle star<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and tail of <italic>Hemidactylus flaviviridis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; <italic>Podarcis muralis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Loss of function through downregulation of genes were majorly observed during regeneration at 1 and 5-dpa rather than gain of function of genes. Whereas at the proteome level it was observed that at 1 and 2-dpa, a prominent gain of function through upregulation of proteins widely. An anomalous downregulation of 67% of the identified proteins at 5-dpa impacts a huge loss of function. Validation of 50 genes identified from the transcriptomic analysis confirms the differential regulation of the genes for the biomechanism of regeneration, which is also evident from the hierarchical heat map analysis of the transcriptome and proteome.</p><p id="Par20">The upregulated gene expression analysis were found associated with muscle tissue development and wound healing processes. Previous research works related to tail regeneration in lizards have listed c-myc upregulation plays a vital role in regeneration mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In thisstudy we have listed BIN1 gene responsible for differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> also related to c-myc interaction and expression. This suggests that genes are mostly involved in wound healing phase in the timepoints and presence of BIN1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> gene expression might interact with c-myc in later stages. BIN1 is myc-interacting gene which inhibits the expression of c-myc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This could help in optimal expression of c- myc proliferation in further blastemal and regenerating phases.&#x000a0;This might indicate controlled expression of c-myc is initiated from preliminary stages and would associate with AEP formation or blastemal stage in latter phase. Also, HOX-D13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> gene known for its limb morphogenesis found to be downregulated in all timepoints which interact with shh(another developmental associated gene)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and initiates limb development process. Some other genes like MYOD1, TNNI1, ACTC1 are involved in myogenesis were found to be upregulated in 5-dpa, 2-dpa and downregulated in later timepoints respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This association and regulation of genes explains the biological process of initial tail stump processes which would be leading to the blastemal stage of tail regeneration.</p><p id="Par21">Genes like EPB41, RARRES1, PCLAF, ADRM1,&#x000a0;Hemoglobin subunit-&#x003b2; (HBB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, Myosin binding proteins-H (MYBPH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and mTORC1 were found upregulated most prominently in the early stages of tail regeneration. Based on Gene ontological biological function RARRES1 is associated with negative regulation of cell proliferation, PCLAF is associated DNA repair and regulation of cell cycle, ADRM1 controls positive regulation of growth hormone receptor signalling pathway and MAP3K7 is associated with interleukin-1 mediated signalling pathway. mTORC1 and ANGPT17 genes were found to be involved in transcriptional regulation, homeostasis, cell growth regulation and metabolism. It has been well known that mTORC1 gain of function leads to neural stem cell differentiation and loss of function associated with limitation of differentiation and neuron production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The downregulated TMBIM6 was found to be associated with autophagy and negative regulation of apoptotic process.</p><p id="Par22">The&#x000a0;network/canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes/proteins revealed mostly signalling and metabolic pathways. The major network pathways associated with the tail tissue regeneration are Cell morphology, embryonic development and skin development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) involving DSC1, DSC2, GPI, DSP, NEDD8, CD63 and keratin as major genes/proteins. NEDD8, a ubiquitin like protein involved in cell cycle progression was found to be associated with the regeneration from 2-dpa onwards through upregulation. CD63, a cell surface receptor plays a key role in activation of AKT (Serin/threonine protein kinase) and integrin leading to cellular signalling cascades was found to be upregulated from day 1 of amputation having an important role in regeneration initiation. Keratinisation, cellular differentiation and epithelial cell proliferation were found to be upregulated for the initiation of regeneration from 2-dpa onwards. FERMT2 (Fermitin family member 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and MYO16 were found correlated in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, cell junction assembly and regulation of cell cycle progression based on network pathway analysis. These pathways were found associated with epithelial cell differentiation, cellular morphology, proliferation and development, controlling the cell cycle progression, actin-filament binding for structural integrity, cytoskeleton organization and cellular signalling during the tail regeneration.</p><p id="Par23">Similarly, ADRM1, APOA1, ASPH, ATP2A1, PAIP2, SLC24A6 genes/proteins majorly associated with Cellular assembly and organization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Role of Pabp-interacting proteins (PAIP) have been shown to be involved in differentiation of adult stem cells in testis through the inhibition of translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The cellular assembly and organization network pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) were found associated with the immune response (NFKB complex), cell survival, and Integrin-mediated signalling pathways (APOA1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> indicating its association during the initial stages of regeneration. Organ and organismal development network pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) were associated with ACTC1, ACTG1, BIN1, CAPZA2 and CAPZB genes/proteins. This pathway identified the family of actins and cytoskeletal proteins involvement during the development along with translational regulators enabling the mechanism to functionalize in an ordered manner. Skeletal and muscular system development network pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e) was associated with CBR1, DLX3, EEF1B2 and DLX3 genes/proteins.</p><p id="Par24">This study has identified and associated various genes/proteins and their network pathways for the tail tissue regeneration of lizard which were also found to be associated with epimorphic regeneration of organs in other animals as in <italic>Podarcis muralis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, green anole Lizard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and echinoderms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

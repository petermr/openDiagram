<p id="Par4">Another important aspect to consider is the descriptive relevance of gene expression analysis based solely on the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEG), which fails to detect dynamics in the expression of multiple related transcripts

 </sup>. Recently, new approaches using transcripts-level analysis, so-called differential transcript usage (DTU), enables identification of alternative splicing and isoform switches with the prediction of functional consequences

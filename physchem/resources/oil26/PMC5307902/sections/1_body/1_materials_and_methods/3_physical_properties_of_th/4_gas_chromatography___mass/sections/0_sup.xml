<sup>&#174;</sup>-5MS (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) capillary column (Shimadzu), 30 m long, with a 0.25 mm thickness and 0.25 mm i.d. with Helium at 1 ml/min as carrier gas. Temperature program: injector at 250&#186;C with a column-oven from 60 to 240 &#186;C at 3 &#186;C /min. The retention index (RI) was calculated for all the volatile constituents using an n-alkane homologous series, ranging from C8 to C40, using a linear temperature programmed equation.[

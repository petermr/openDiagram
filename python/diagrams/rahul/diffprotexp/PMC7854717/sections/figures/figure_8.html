 <caption> Significant (p &lt; 0.05) expression correlation and independence of the 57 potassium channel genes with the 49 sodium, calcium and chloride channel genes in ( a) left atrium, ( b) right atrium, ( c) left ventricle, ( d) right ventricle. Red/blue/yellow square indicates that the potassium channel gene labeling the column and the sodium/calcium/chloride channel labeling the intersected row are significantly synergistically/antagonistically/ independently expressed. Numbers above the graphs represent the percentages of synergistic pairs within the gene selection in the indicated chamber. </caption>

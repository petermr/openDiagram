 <xref rid="f3-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> display the top 10 enriched GO entries with the most significant difference in target genes of lncRNAs in each group. In biological processes, target genes were mainly enriched in the metabolic process of substances, including ‘organic substance metabolic process’. In cellular components, target genes were mainly enriched in ‘intracellular part’. In molecular functions, target genes were mainly enriched in ‘binding’. However, target genes do not appear to be mainly enriched in all of the terms listed here. Furthermore, 
 <xref rid="tIV-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="table">Table IV</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f4-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> display the KEGG pathways with the most significant differences in target genes for lncRNAs between the two groups. In the KEGG pathway analysis, the enrichment pathways associated with significant expression of lncRNAs were ‘PI3K-Akt signaling pathway’, ‘endocytosis’, ‘cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction’ and ‘chemokine signaling pathway’.

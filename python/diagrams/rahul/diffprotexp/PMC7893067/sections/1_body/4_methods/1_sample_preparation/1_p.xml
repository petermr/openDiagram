 </sup>. For each sample, 20 mg of frozen tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. Tissue powder was transferred to ice cold 1.5 ml tubes and 200 μl lysis buffer (Norgen) was added. The tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 RPM to separate the cellular fractions. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction and the pellet containing the nuclei were mixed with 400 μl 1.6 M sucrose solution and carefully layered on the top of two 500 μl sucrose solution in two separate tubes. Both fractions were then centrifuged at 13,000-RPM for 15 min (4 °C). The cytoplasmic fraction was collected from the top of the sucrose cushion and the cytoplasmic RNA was then further purified according to Norgen kit recommendations. The nuclear pellet was collected from the bottom of the tube and washed with 200 μl 1 × PBS. The nuclei were collected after another centrifugation at 13,000 RPM for 3 min. The nuclear RNA was purified from the nuclear fraction according to the Norgen kit recommendations. The quality of the RNA extracted from the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was examined using Bioanalyzer (Supplementary Fig.

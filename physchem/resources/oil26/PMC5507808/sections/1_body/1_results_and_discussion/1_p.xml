<p id="Par5">The yield of essential oils of 
 <italic>Pimenta racemosa</italic> was 2.13%, (v/w) during hydrodistillation, and oil was yellow in colour. Chemical analysis by GC/MS of the components of the oil led to identification of 24 components (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) representing 96.4%. The major components of the 
 <italic>Pimenta racemosa</italic> oil were myrcène (25.1%), chavicol (7.5%) and eugenol (51.1%). High proportions of aromatic compounds (56.6%) followed by hydrocarbon monoterpenes (29.9%) were also identified in the essential oil. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presented the results of the physicochemical characteristics of the different groups of fermented fish flour produced. These results indicated that the moisture of fermented fish flour produced was between 13.26 ± 0.11 and 14.06 ± 0.01%, with a pH varying from 6.17 ± 0.02 to 6.22 ± 0.04, and an acidity between 1.16 ± 0.06 and 1.81 ± 0.05%. The results obtained during the evaluation of the nutritional characteristics of the different groups of fermented fish flour produced (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) indicated that fermented fish flour have good nutritional potential, with a protein content varying from 22.96 ± 0.02% and 23.26 ± 0.11%. Fermented fish flours produced were also rich in minerals such as sodium (1.36 ± 0.09–1.46 ± 0.07%), potassium (0.48 ± 0.07–0.69 ± 0.03%), calcium (1.88 ± 0.09–2.04 ± 0.06%) magnesium (0.18 ± 0.02–0.24 ± 0.05%) and iron (0.31 ± 0.08–0.43 ± 0.07 mg/kg). Statistical analyzes revealed that there is no significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between samples analyzed. Results obtained during the evaluation of the microbiological characteristics of the different group of fermented fish flour (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) indicated that the total bacteria count in analyzed sampled was between 10 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> and 8.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> ufc/g. Total coliform, feacal coliform, ASRspores, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, yeast and mould are also detected, with the absence of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>spp in all analyzed sampled. Statistical analyses indicated that there is significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between microbiological characteristic of samples produced by adjunction of essential oil of 
 <italic>Pimenta racemosa,</italic> when compared to the control.

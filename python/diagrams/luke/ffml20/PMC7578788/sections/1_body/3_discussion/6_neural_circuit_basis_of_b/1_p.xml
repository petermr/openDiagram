<p id="Par41">Simultaneous EEG, LFP and multi-unit spiking activity recording in area F5 (ventral pre-motor cortex) of macaques has previously shown an inverse relationship between multi-unit activity and LFP and EEG beta power

 </sup>. Furthermore, studies of non-human primates during motor tasks has revealed that many cortical neurons synchronise their activity to beta rhythms during periods of oscillation, limiting their spiking rate to a narrower range than that present outside of oscillatory episodes

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par10">Three sites were selected in three different biomes in South Africa, spanning a range of annual rainfall: Rietvlei Nature Reserve (c. 720&#8201;mm per annum; mesic grassland), Khamab Kalahari Reserve (c. 330&#8201;mm per annum; semi-arid savannah) and Tierberg Karoo Research Centre (c. 170&#8201;mm per annum; arid scrubland at the border of Succulent- and Nama Karoo, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> for details on these biomes). Data from the arid scrubland and mesic grassland have previously been reported in a different context (see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>). Aardvark occur at all three sites and are the dominant medium-sized (i.e. c. 40&#8211;60&#8201;kg) burrowers across all sites (R. Marais; S. Milton; H. Kilian pers. comm.).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Location of study sites in South Africa.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_55917_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e584"/></fig></p>

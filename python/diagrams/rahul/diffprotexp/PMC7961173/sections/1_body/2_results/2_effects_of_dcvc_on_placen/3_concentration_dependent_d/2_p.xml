<p id="Par34">Similar to 6-h results, both 10 and 20 µM DCVC treatment for 12 h caused significant differential gene expression with substantial overlap. For example, the 15 genes that met both criteria (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) for significant differential gene expression with 10 µM DCVC, were also differentially expressed with 20 µM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Additionally, 10 µM DCVC treatment yielded 17 differentially expressed genes that met FDR &lt; 0.05 criterion only, and 373 genes had a logFC magnitude difference &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3] only (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, Suppl. Table 4). Compared to 10 µM, 20 µM DCVC treatment increased the number of genes with altered expression, yielding 526 differentially expressed genes that met FDR &lt; 0.05 criterion only, 436 genes with a logFC magnitude difference &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3] only, and 301 genes that met both criteria (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, Suppl. Table 4). Among the genes that met both criteria, 113 were upregulated and 188 were downregulated. The three genes with the largest magnitude logFC included, inhibin subunit beta (

 <sup>–04</sup>), 
 <italic>CHAC1</italic> (2.55 logFC [5.9 FC], FDR = 1.25 × 10
 <sup>–09</sup>) and sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine transporter 1 (
 <italic>SLC6A9</italic>) (1.81 logFC [3.0 FC], FDR = 5.46 × 10
 <sup>–04</sup>) (Suppl. Table 4). Although more downregulated genes met both FDR and logFC criteria, the upregulated genes had larger magnitude differential gene expression.

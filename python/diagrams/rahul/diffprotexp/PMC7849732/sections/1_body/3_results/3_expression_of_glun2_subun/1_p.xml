<p>A recent voltage-sensitive dye imaging study in male rats has demonstrated that evoked NMDAR-dependent excitability is not equal across the mediolateral axis of the SDH [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To investigate the potential molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon, we first studied the relative expression of GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D along the mediolateral axis of the CGRP+ SDH in male rats. The intensity of GluN2 immunoreactivity was measured in discrete regions of the medial, central, and lateral portions of the top-most CGRP+ SDH using a blinded approach where only the CGRP fluorescence signal was visible during placement of the small oval sampling windows (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(a</xref>), right) immunoreactivity was visibly homogenous across the mediolateral axis. Surprisingly, GluN2B immunoreactivity appeared to be preferentially localized to the medial region of the CGRP+ SDH, with a fluorescence intensity that progressively declined into the central to lateral SDH regions (

Quantitative analysis revealed a large, non-significant, reduction in the mean OD per area values from medial to central to lateral CGRP+ SDH for GluN2B (p = 0.099, n = 5), while OD values were highly conserved from medial to central to lateral SDH regions for both GluN2A (p = 0.23, n = 6), and GluN2D (p = 0.72, n = 5) (data not shown).

<p>Ywhaz 14-3-3 protein belongs to a highly conserved acidic protein family and has a molecular weight of about 30 KDa. There are seven isotypes in eukaryotic cells, including β, γ, ɛ, ζ, η, σ and τ isotypes. 14-3-3 protein can be synthesized by all organs in but is abundant in the nervous system, distributed mainly in the cytoplasm. Currently over 100 proteins have been found to interact with 14-3-3 protein. Those 100 proteins are involved in cell division, signal transduction, apoptosis and membrane transport. 14-3-3 proteins can inhibit or enhance the activity of target proteins, protect target proteins against protease and phosphatase, and mediate the interactions of two target proteins as either adapter proteins or scaffold proteins [

Our results showed increased expression of 14-3-3 protein, which might be closely related to organ lesions and pathological damages following ricin poisoning. Typical toxic effects of ricin included cell apoptosis and parenchyma organ damage, combining with 14-3-3 protein’s biological functions, our studies thus provided the potential cues to further indentify that if there existed interactions between ricin and 14-3-3 protein.

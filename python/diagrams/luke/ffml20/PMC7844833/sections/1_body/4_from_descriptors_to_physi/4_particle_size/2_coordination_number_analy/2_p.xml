<p>The particle size is one of the critical parameters that determine the catalytic properties of nanostructured catalysts. In many reactions, both in the gas phase and in an electrochemical environment, the catalyst particle size has a strong influence on the catalytic activity due to the increased number of undercoordinated sites or changes in the electronic structure in small NPs.

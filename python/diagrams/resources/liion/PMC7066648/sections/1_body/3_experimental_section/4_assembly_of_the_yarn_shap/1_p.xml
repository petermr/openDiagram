<p>Before the assembly, the SSYs were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone bath for 30 min with an ultrasonic cleaner (PS-40A, 40 kHz, Shenzhen Fukeda Ultrasonic Equipment Co., Ltd.), then washed with deionized water to further remove impurities on the surfaces, and finally oven-dried at 60 °C for 1 h. The assembly of the yarn-shaped LIB is performed in the following steps. The anode and cathode electrodes coated with the gel electrolyte were first twisted by a self-made jig and then soaked in plasticizer solution (EC/PC) at room temperature for 10 min. Later, the battery core including the yarn-shaped cathode, anode, and gel electrolyte was packed in a tube (TG001, diameter of 3 mm) which shrinks upon heating at 100 °C by heating for 1 min. After sealing two ends of the yarn-shaped LIB with a hot melt glue gun (EVA hot melt adhesive, Foshan Yide Adhesive Co., Ltd), the assembled yarn-shaped battery was placed in the glovebox for 24 h to complete preformation. The 7 cm-long yarn-shaped cathode has a loading mass of 40 mg, and the anode has a loading mass of 20.3 mg. The

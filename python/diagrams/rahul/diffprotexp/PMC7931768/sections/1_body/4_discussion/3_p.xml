<p>Our finding that IFN pathway genes recovered by tape harvesting distinguish between CLE-A and CLE-U or HV skin is supported in the CLE transcriptomics literature.
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44â€“50</xref> Many of the IFN response genes with highest ranking fold changes in previous studies are also differentially regulated in this tape-derived RNA study. These include 
 <italic>IFI27, IFI44L, IFI44, OAS1</italic> (blood from participants with CLE),

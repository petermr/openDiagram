<p id="Par51">We identified a potential difference in gene expression between the CI and control groups, representing upregulation of neutrophil-activation- and neutrophil-mediated immunity-associated genes in the CI group compared to in the control group. Moreover, differential expression of immune response and defense response to organism-associated genes and the immune response signaling pathway could be associated with pregnancy outcomes in women with CI. Further studies of a larger independent sample are needed to validate the results.</p>

<p id="Par46">LncRNA targets could be predicted by the correlation or co-expression of lncRNA and mRNA expression levels between samples. Among them, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to analyze the correlation between lncRNA and mRNA among samples, mRNAs with |PCC| ≥0.95 for functional enrichment to predict lncRNAs [

 <italic>P</italic>-value ≤0.05 defined as the significant threshold, significance of the term enrichment analysis was corrected by FDR and corrected

 <italic>RFC5</italic> gene product is part of the Rad17-RFC complex, which is one of the mechanisms of cellular recognition of a radiation insult [
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The complex can dock on fractured DNA or near the site of damaged DNA and initiate downstream signaling, including activation of ATM and ATR kinases [
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Then the ATM and ATR signaling pathways activate downstream effectors and thus regulate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis [

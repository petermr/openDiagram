0: One family of widely used nanomaterials is carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
1: CNTs are hollow carbon tubes made of a single or several concentrically arranged cylindrical graphite layers capped by fullerenic hemispheres, which are referred to as single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT, MWCNT).
2: In addition to many industrial applications, they can be used as scaffolds for cell culture [ 2] or as transporting vehicles for intracellular delivery of bioactive molecules [ 4].
3: The diversity of lengths, aspect ratios, dispersion, surface coating and functionalization of CNTs further enhances their biocompatibility and biomedical application, but also raises concerns about their potential cytotoxicity [ 5].

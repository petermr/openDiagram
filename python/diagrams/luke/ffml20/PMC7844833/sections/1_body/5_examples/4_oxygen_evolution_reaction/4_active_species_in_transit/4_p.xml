<p>Distinguishing between different cobalt oxide structures by EXAFS analysis is often a challenging task. Because the difference in the number and lengths of Coâ€“O bonds in the first coordination shell for different oxide phases is low, such an analysis often relies on the interpretation of contributions of further coordination shells, which, as discussed in 
 <xref rid="sec5.6" ref-type="other">Section 
  <xref rid="sec5.6" ref-type="other">5.6</xref>
 </xref>, can be problematic. Interpretation of EXAFS data becomes especially challenging in a situation common in OER studies, where different disordered oxide phases coexist within the catalyst. Therefore, caution, is needed when a particular feature of the EXAFS spectrum (or a small change in this feature) is attributed to the development of a specific structural motif, and some of the published studies may suffer from the data overinterpretation.

<p>Exploration of the mechanisms involved in the translational regulation of p53 after IR identified the ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26) and the nucleolar protein, nucleolin, as positive and negative regulators, respectively, of this process [

 <xref rid="B5-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], regulates both RPL26 protein degradation and its binding to p53 mRNA [
 <xref rid="B2-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Further, we found that p53 mRNA forms a double-stranded RNA structure created by base-pairing of complementary sequences of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs and that this structure is required for the binding of RPL26 and the regulation of p53 translation after stress [
 <xref rid="B1-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In all, these studies demonstrated the critical extra-ribosomal role of RPL26 in the stress-regulated control of p53 translation.

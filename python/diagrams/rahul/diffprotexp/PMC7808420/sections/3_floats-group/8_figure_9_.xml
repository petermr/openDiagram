   <bold>Leukocyte recruitment to SLEV-infected brains are similar between WT and IFNγ
    <sup>−/-</sup> mice
   </bold>. WT and IFNγ
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice in the C57BL/6 background were inoculated intracranially with 10 PFU of SLEV and euthanized on day 7 p.i. for collection of blood and brain. Blood samples were used for total (a) and differential (b) leukocyte counts. Brain samples were processed and used in assays for indirect detection of the enzymatic activity of MPO (c), NAG (d) and EPO (e). Results are expressed as mean plus standard error of the mean (SEM) and are representative of two independent experiments. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 compared to the respective mock-infected group. Mock = injected with saline

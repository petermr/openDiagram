<p>When viewing the frontier research of these electrodes from a somewhat wider perspective, two kinds of mechanisms seem to dominate, namely intercalation and the conversion reaction.
 <xref rid="anie201914760-bib-0005b" ref-type="ref">5b</xref> Typical commercial electrodes such as LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> and graphite follow the intercalation mechanism in which Li ions intercalate into or de‐intercalate from the electrode host without significantly altering its original structure. Hence, the battery capacity is essentially restricted by the available vacancies in an electrode host to accommodate foreign Li ions. In the conversion‐reaction mechanism, however, Li ions occupy not only the vacancies but also the sites of the metal cations, accompanied by a deposition of elemental metal particles. Because of this, drastic structural transformations may occur upon charge/discharge cycling, even leading to the forming of new phases. Compounds such as transition‐metal oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and fluorides are generally governed by a conversion reaction.

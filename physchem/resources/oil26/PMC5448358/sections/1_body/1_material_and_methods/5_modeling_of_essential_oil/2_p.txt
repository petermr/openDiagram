0: The variables influencing extraction yield were as follows: time, temperature, condensation rate, the state of division of the plant material, the mass ratio of the plant material to water, and water loss from the plant material (Denny,  1991).
1: A model with six variables, even in the case of a firstdegree model, would require 2 6 = 64 experiments (Goupy,  2001).
2: For experimental convenience, some variables were thus kept constant.
3: We considered three variables: the extraction duration (X 1), the residual water content (X 2), and the state of the division of the plant material (X 3).
4: These three factors offered the advantage of being easy to control.
5: Extraction yield (y),  pmenthadienol isomers, and aristolone contents (Z) depend on factors X 1, X 2, and X 3.
6: Mathematically, this is expressed as y or z = f(X 1, X 2, X 3), where y and z are the responses, f(X) is the response function, and X 1, X 2, and X 3 are the factors taken into account.
7: The experiment is designed to determine the effects of certain factors on each response.

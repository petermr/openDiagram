<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The aardvarks spent more time investigating foraging enrichment compared to exploring enrichment, in addition to engaging in more foraging bouts. High rates of foraging enrichment use for short periods of time reflect a natural pattern of foraging for aardvarks. In one night, wild aardvarks can have up to 200 foraging bouts, rarely lasting longer than two minutes per bout [<xref rid="B21-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Food is a primary reinforcer for animals, and foraging enrichment should continue to be reinforcing until the food is depleted. Thus, designing enrichment opportunities that allow for repeated use over longer periods of time promotes a species-typical foraging pattern for aardvarks. Enrichment geared toward habitat exploration may have been less reinforcing as the habitat spaces were well known. Nonetheless, just because enrichment aimed at exploring the environment was used for shorter amounts of time does not mean the goal of this enrichment is any less valuable. Additionally, it is important to note that based on the current data, we cannot dismiss the possibility that exploring enrichment was used less than foraging enrichment because the items chosen to promote exploration, such as the perfumed Boomer balls<sup>&#174;</sup>, were less meaningful to the aardvarks.</p>

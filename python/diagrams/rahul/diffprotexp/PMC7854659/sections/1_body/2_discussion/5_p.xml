  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> found several glucogenic amino acids (AA) differentially abundant in the liver of nutrient-restricted fetuses. Supporting these findings, we identified pathways related to glucogenic AA, such as arginine biosynthesis and tryptophan metabolism. Additionally, the liver is the main hematopoietic organ during pre-natal development

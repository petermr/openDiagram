<p id="p0235">The analysis of trans-omic networks for differentially regulated metabolic reactions can be applied to elucidate trans-omic network using pathological models other than obesity and potentially contribute to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. In the future, assembling larger-scale trans-omic networks for differentially regulated metabolic reactions between healthy and obese individuals by adding to multi-omic datasets will uncover the whole picture of the effects of obesity on systemic metabolic homeostasis.</p>

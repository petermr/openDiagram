0: The current studies extend our previous observations to a bioinformatic analysis of changes that occur in the Calu-3 cell proteome in response to exposure to a physiologically relevant concentration of carbon nanotubes.
1: The current results corroborate the earlier studies showing that there is an inverse dose response relationship between the concentration of CNT and the functional effects on barrier epithelial cells [ 9, 10].
2: Furthermore, the results elucidate the protein molecular basis for a variety of major functional changes in the cells.
3: The quantification and bioinformatic analysis of protein expression changes in response to CNT exposure provides a comprehensive understanding of CNTs effect on epithelial cells as well as a background for future toxicological studies.

<p>There are, however, several points that need some clarification for the proper understanding of the manuscript. It is not clear for me how the subnetworks (pathways) have been defined? I am not sure if they used the g: profiler for this purpose (BTW, what is the justification of using the g: profiler? because it is not among the most cited tools for functional analysis). Or they used the connectivity values (taken from coexpressions) to define the edges? If so, what threshold is used to define a connection?</p>

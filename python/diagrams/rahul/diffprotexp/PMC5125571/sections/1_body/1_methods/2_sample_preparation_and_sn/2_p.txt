0: Embryonated eggs of  O.  viverrini were obtained from the faeces of naturally infected cats by sedimentation technique [ 44].
1: Briefly, the faeces were mixed with PBS and strained though meshes of different sizes.
2: Samples were sedimented and washed several times with PBS until clear supernatant was obtained, and were kept at room temperature (283C) for 1 week to enable full development.
3: Prior to experimental infection, the eggs were examined under light microscopy to determine full maturation by detecting active movement of the miracidium within the egg shell [ 45].

<p>The vast majority of published DSC work on Al alloys involves heating experiments. This is likely to be due to the fact that DSC was originally intended for use during heating, and DSC heating experiments are easier in terms of scanning rate control (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f010">Figure 10</xref>). However, the interpretation of heating DSC curves for age-hardening Al alloys is complicated by severely overlapping endo- and exothermic reactions i.e., dissolution and precipitation reactions [
 <xref rid="B120-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Unfortunately, the superposition of different reactions is rarely verifiable and thus is too often disregarded. As will be shown later, the consideration of DSC heating curves over a wide range of heating rates can help to identify superposition issues. In DSC heating experiments, it is reasonable to choose the maximum temperature to be as high as possible while keeping the sample in the solid state and avoiding incipient melting. This is because the dissolution of the major alloying elements is typically of particular interest for heating experiments. Since the heating rate specific solvus temperature rises with increasing heating rate, high maximum temperatures are preferable. A quantitative analysis of the total enthalpy changes during heating can only be carried out if the heating rate specific solvus temperature is exceeded (see below).

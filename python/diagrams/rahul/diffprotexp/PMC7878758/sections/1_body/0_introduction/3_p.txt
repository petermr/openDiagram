0: Lately, molecular and gene-specific studies focus on the role of genes like SOX9, PAX7, BMP, FGF, Wnt, MMPs which are usually associated with regeneration 20,  27  31.
1: The expression of SOX9 during cartilage formation, PAX7 associating in tissue morphogenesis 28,   31, BMP6 and other protein expressions were known 29,  30.
2: Constitutive expression and regulation of these genes have revealed a significant role during the developmental stages of regeneration.
3: The slight alteration in any of the crucial genes regulation might results in a disrupted replacement 32.
4: Thus, the activation and intricate cross-talk of these molecules during the process are still unaddressed and need to be better understood.

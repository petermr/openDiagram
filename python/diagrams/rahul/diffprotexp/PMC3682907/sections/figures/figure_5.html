 <caption> Protein expression profile for fraction Q6. (A) Scatter plot of scores for principal components 1 and 2 obtained from a PCA analysis showing the segregation of data into EAE and control samples. (B) Heat map obtained from a hierarchical cluster analysis showing the clustering of EAE and control samples into distinct groups. Note also the highly correlated peaks at 3006, 3040, 3266, 4020, and 4272 Da in the lowest node of the heat map suggesting a strong relationship between the peaks. </caption>

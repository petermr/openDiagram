  <title>Protein–protein interaction and parallel reaction monitoring analyses of the differentially expressed proteins.</title>
  <p>The protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of the three groups (depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus, 
   <bold>A</bold>), anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus, 
   <bold>B</bold>), and insusceptible (Insus, 
   <bold>C</bold>)) were constructed based on protein alterations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway term enrichments. Proteins/genes were represented by circular nodes. The KEGG pathway is indicated by the rectangle, shaded based on the 
   <italic>p</italic> value. Higher 
   <italic>p</italic> value is shown in yellow and lower 
   <italic>p</italic> value in blue. 
   <bold>D</bold> Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis of the differentially expressed proteins in the Dep-Sus, Anx-Sus, and Insus groups relative to the control (Cont).

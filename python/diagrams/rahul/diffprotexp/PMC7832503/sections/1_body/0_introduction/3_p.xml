<p>Multiple immunity-related candidate genes have been identified to be risk factors of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, including 
 <italic>CCR5</italic>, 
 <italic>KIR</italic>, 
 <italic>IFTIM3</italic>, 
 <italic>IGHG2</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The most widely studied is the 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> gene, which has been shown to play a role in restricting influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo experiments [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Polymorphisms on 
 <italic>IL-6</italic>, 
 <italic>TLR3</italic>, 
 <italic>SFTPB</italic>, 
 <italic>TNF</italic>, 
 <italic>ST3GAL1</italic> and 
 <italic>GLDC</italic> genes have also been found to be associated with increased risk of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease severity [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16–21</xref>]. In addition, several small-scale genome wide association studies have reported a number of novel susceptibility genes of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outcomes [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>]. Unfortunately, most of these results of the association between specific genetic loci and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease severity are yet to be validated with enough power or repeatable evidences [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In general, an understanding of the host genetic contributions on severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is still limited. A more comprehensive efficient study about host genetic background is required to detect the severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

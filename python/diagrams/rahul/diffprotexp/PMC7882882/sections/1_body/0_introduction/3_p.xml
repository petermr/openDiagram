<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA molecule with a transcript &gt;200 nucleotides in length, and they play an important role in regulating gene expression through epigenetic or posttranscriptional mechanisms; however, they do not encode proteins (

A study have shown that LINC00858 plays a tumor-promoting role in colon cancer by upregulating hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-α and downregulating WNK2 (

 <xref rid="b28-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) showed that the overexpression of lncRNA PAXIP1-AS1 can upregulate KIF14, thereby enhancing human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis in gliomas. Moreover, several studies found that identifying novel lncRNA-mRNA networks using microarray analyses could contribute to exploring the potential molecular mechanisms and prognosis of tumors (

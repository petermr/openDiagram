<p>According to microstructure analysis after continuous cooling [
 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the Al-Mg-Si ageing sequence [
 <xref rid="b37-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the precipitates at high temperatures may be β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si and at medium temperatures β’ (resp. B’), and at lower temperature, precipitates like β” will form. The metastable precipitates moreover will transform with the increasing duration of isothermal soaking towards more stable phases until equilibrium is reached. Such a transformation behavior of metastable phases towards more stable ones with increasing annealing duration was also confirmed by Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="b38-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], who found that “the sensitive temperature range of 6005 aluminum alloy is 280–420 °C with the nose temperature of 340 °C. Microstructure observation indicates that the supersaturated solid solution decomposes and β” precipitates during the initial stage of isothermal holding. With the prolonging of isothermal time, β’ and β form in the alloy”. Such a transformation of phases is well known and generally accepted from investigations on artificial ageing. As a consequence of these considerations, a schematic isothermal TTP diagram of 6xxx aluminum alloys based on our results in 
 <xref rid="f10-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> is illustrated in 
 <xref rid="f12-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>. The above scheme of the TTP diagram is supported by Ives 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="b15-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for the aluminum alloy 2024. In particular, they report that metastable phases after prolonged soaking transform to stable phases.

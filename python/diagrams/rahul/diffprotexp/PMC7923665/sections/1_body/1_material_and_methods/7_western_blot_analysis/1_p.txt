0: From the tissues stored in RNA later solution, whole protein was isolated using RIPA buffer and the concentration of the protein was estimated using Bradfords reagent.
1: Electrophoresis of 40 g/l of protein was carried out in 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
2: The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 to block non-specific binding sites.
3: Primary antibody incubation was carried out for overnight.
4: Initially, the membrane was probed with anti-rabbit ALDH1A2 antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 and later reprobed with anti-mouse GAPDH antibody in 1:5000 dilutions.
5: The band was acquired using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and transferred to Kodak X ray film.

0: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of endogenous non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) that are 2024 nt in length, play crucial regulatory functions in animals and plants by repressing their target genes expression at the transcription or post-transcription level [ 1 4].
1: In plants, the biosynthesis of miRNAs is a multistep pathway that is involved in many genes and enzymes [ 5].
2: Plant miRNA genes are initially transcribed into primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus [ 5,  6].
3: Then, the pri-miRNAs are processed into miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) with stem-loop structures by the DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) and SERRATE (SE) protein complex [ 5 7].
4: Next, these pri-miRNAs are further cleaved into miRNA::miRNA * duplexes under the action of DCL1, HYL1 and SE protein complex, and then the 3  end of the duplexes are methylated by the methyltransferase HUA ENHANCER1 (HEN1) [ 5].
5: After methylation, the duplexes are exported to the cytoplasm by the HASTY protein [ 5,  8].
6: Finally, the miRNA duplex is bound by ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to carry out its function by either cleaving target mRNAs or repressing the translation process [ 5,  9].
7: At present, miRNAs have been identified in numerous plants, and more and more evidence indicates that they play crucial roles in plant growth and development, secondary metabolism, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and signal transduction [ 4,  10 16].

<p>The activation of the nuclear transcription factor CREB is believed to be essential for neurogenesis. In the differentiating cells, CREB was active after the binding of growth factors bFGF and FGF-8 in the induction medium onto cell surface receptors. Binding of these growth factors activates receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which is linked to the downstream MAP kinase signaling cascade (MAPK/ERK signal transduction pathway) and results in the activation of CREB [

 <sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKIV) signaling. The phosphorylation of ERK is the key step in the MAPK/ERK pathway. Phosphorylated ERK activates the phosphorylation of CREB, which initiates CREB-dependent gene transcription. Although the kinetics of CREB phosphorylation by EGF was transient, bFGF induced a prolonged pattern of CREB phosphorylation [

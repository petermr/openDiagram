<p>Previously, we carried out a series of studies to research the relationship between MHC polymorphisms and resistance or susceptibility to CE in native Chinese sheep, including Chinese Merino [
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Duolang [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and Kazakh sheep [
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our previous studies indicated that in Kazakh sheep, when exposed to the same number of parasites, the rate of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infection in the internal organs of sheep with haplotype 
 <italic>MHC Mva</italic>I bc-
 <italic>Sac</italic>II ab-
 <italic>Hin</italic>1I ab haplotype was significantly lower than in sheep without this haplotype. Statistical results and analysis showed that sheep with this haplotype have an increased genetic capability to respond to and subsequently reject 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> when infected. The haplotype 
 <italic>MHC Mva</italic>I bc
 <italic>-Sac</italic>II ab
 <italic>-Hin</italic>1I ab was therefore identified as a genetic marker of CE resistance in Kazakh sheep [
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

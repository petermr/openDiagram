<p id="Par21">After prolonged thermal insulation, clear martensite laths persist in the microstructure and a small fraction of sub-grains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>) is formed. Many sub-grains are formed in the bainite (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). Large carbides are distributed in the martensite lath boundary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>) and small carbons are dispersed in the bainite ferrite matrix (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). The carbides are distributed either on the martensite lath or the bainite ferrite matrix, and will maintain a certain coherent relationship with the matrix. The stress field produced by the precipitates can change the stress distribution at the crack tip and prevent the nucleation and propagation of cracks. However, if the carbide itself is very small and its strength is not high, a dislocation motion occurs and the dislocation concentrated in the carbide forms a crack, which will reduce the toughness of the steel. If the dislocation cannot cut through the carbide, the Orowan bypassing mechanism will not significantly reduce the toughness of the material.

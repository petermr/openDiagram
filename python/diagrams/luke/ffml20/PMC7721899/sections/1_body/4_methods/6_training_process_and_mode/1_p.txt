0: This section describes the training and model fitting (overfitting, underfitting, or balanced) for all the adopted methods.
1: The total data is initially split into a training set and test set by 80:20 proportion.
2: While the test dataset is kept unseen during the model training process, the training set is further split into 80% for training and 20% for validation.
3: Here, to validate the model, a fivefold cross-validation is implemented.
4: The optimum complexity is achieved when the minimum error for both the training error and validation error is achieved.

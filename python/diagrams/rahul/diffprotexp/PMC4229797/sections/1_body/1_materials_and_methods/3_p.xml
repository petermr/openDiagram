<p>The semen samples were centrifuged at 2000 g during 15 min to separate seminal plasma. Prior to seminal protein evaluation, the seminal plasma was centrifuged again at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The semen proteins were measured using NanoDrop
 <sup>®</sup> and after diluting semen samples to 0.5 mg/mL in binding buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.02% Tween 20%, pH = 9.0); the protein profile of the semen was obtained by SELDI-TOF-MS on-spot over a strong anion exchanger ProteinChip
 <sup>®</sup> Q10 array (Ciphergen, Biosystems, CA, USA). All SELDI-TOF analyses have been performed at the Institute for Human Genetics at the University Hospital Jena. The spots were equilibrated three times with 5 μl binding buffer for 5 min and then 5 μl of each sample were added. After incubation for 90 min in a humid chamber, each spot was washed twice with 5 μl binding buffer and twice with 5 μl distilled water. After air drying, the spots were coated with 0.5 μl of energy absorbing matrix (EAM: 20 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid), air dried for 5 min in the dark, and then another 0.5 μl of EAM was applied using the same procedure.

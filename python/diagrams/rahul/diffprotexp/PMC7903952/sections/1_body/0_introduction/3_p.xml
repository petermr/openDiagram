<p>Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent of the imidazoline series, is a first-line chemotherapy drug in clinical treatment of malignant gliomas. After oral administration, it is absorbed rapidly and enters the cerebrospinal fluid through the blood-brain barrier, reaching an effective blood drug concentration in the central nervous system.

<p>Indeed, we found 76 genes with inter-species differences in APA that are also differentially expressed at the protein but not at the RNA level between humans and chimpanzees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In these 76 genes, inter-species differences in PAS usage are enriched at the 3' UTR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 76 genes are likely of functional relevance, compared to all of the genes, with at least one differentially used PAS being enriched for cellular components such as the protease complex and endopeptidase complex. The set is also enriched for processes such as the regulation of DNA-templated transcription and amino acid activation. (For a full list, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, see 'Materials and methods'.) Finally, to assess whether APA contributes to differences in gene regulation by affecting translation efficiency or protein degradation, we asked whether genes with differential protein expression were also differentially translated. Of the 149 genes with significant differences in APA and protein expression, Wang et al. reported translation measurements for 142 (
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). Only 34 genes displayed significant differences in translation efficiency, suggesting that isoform-specific post-translational modification of protein levels is largely responsible for protein-level differences (

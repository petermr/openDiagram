 <caption> Cytosolic and nuclear distribution of lncRNAs (A) MA plot showing global (all tissues) distribution of differentially localized lncRNA genes in the cytosol (blue) and nucleus (magenta). Non-significant lncRNA genes are highlighted as grey. (B) Venn diagram displaying overlapping lncRNA genes differentially localized in the fetal cerebellum (light blue), fetal cortex (yellow) and adult cortex (purple). (C) Strip chart showing localization of significantly cytosolic (blue) and nuclear (magenta) lncRNAs from our data (all tissues combined) and in ENCODE cell lines (baseMean ≥ 10). Only differentially expressed lncRNAs in cell lines overlapping with all-tissue DEGs are shown. Genes that remained consistently cytosolic or nuclear in the brain samples and cell lines are highlighted in gray. </caption>

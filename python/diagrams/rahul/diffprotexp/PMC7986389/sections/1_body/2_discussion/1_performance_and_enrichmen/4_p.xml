<p id="Par40">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> show that, except in MSigDB, WMFVS has the best precision and WFVS has the best recall. In MSigDB, cancer genes are closely related to the differential expression values of genes in breast cancer, leading to a precision of 87.5% for the simple weight-based method (i.e., method (2)). In this case, integration of the network structure may decrease the precision. However, in most cases, it is hard to find such a closely related metric for classification. We can observe that in other data sets, method (2) performs worse than the other methods. The results support the effectiveness of our WMFVS and WFVS methods.

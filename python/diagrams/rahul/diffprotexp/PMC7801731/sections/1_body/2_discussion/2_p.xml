<p id="Par20">The high number of DETs for 1 and 3 dpe (&gt; 8000), contrasts with a previous study of intestinal regeneration in 
 <italic>A. japonicus</italic> where less than 4000 DETs were found

 </sup>. Notwithstanding, these differences can be attributed to the significance criteria established for each study. In 
 <italic>A. japonicus,</italic> an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt; 0.001 was established as threshold for significance, while our study used a value of &lt; 0.05. In fact, using the same significance criteria (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> online), the number of DETs is similar (3587) to those reported in the 
 <italic>A. japonicus</italic> study. Our results are also comparable with a study done in 
 <italic>E. fraudatrix</italic> applying equivalent significance benchmarks (adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) documenting 17,227 DETs in regenerating intestine relative to intact gut

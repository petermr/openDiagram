<p id="Par24">The general trend in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a–d suggests that all the elastic constants are primarily controlled by SiO
 <sub>2</sub> content followed by water and CaO content. While the normal stiffness along the interlayer direction (C
 <sub>11</sub>) shows a relatively lower SHAP value for water, the value increases when the normal stiffness perpendicular to the interlayer direction (C
 <sub>33</sub>) is considered. Besides, the shear components (C
 <sub>44</sub>, C
 <sub>55</sub> (please refer to Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>), and C
 <sub>66</sub> ) show increased contribution from water. This could be attributed to the layered nature of CSH where the in-plane movements are primarily controlled by the water molecules, while the normal stiffness along the direction of the interlayers is mainly controlled by the silicate network (as observed in C
 <sub>11</sub> case). Similarly, for other elastic constants such as C
 <sub>22</sub>, C
 <sub>55,</sub> C
 <sub>12</sub>, C
 <sub>13</sub>, and C
 <sub>23</sub> (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>) SiO
 <sub>2</sub> content primarily dominates followed by water content and CaO content.

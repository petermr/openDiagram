<p id="Par48">Although above studies have found that these 5 genes related to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of EOC, the molecular mechanisms of EOC tumorigenesis still remain unclear. In order to further understand the biological functions of these 5 genes in EOC, we performed the KEGG and GO pathway analysis for them. As a result, we observed that all 5 core genes were mainly enriched in “Cell cycle”, consistent with our previous pathway analysis of up-regulated DEGs in EOC. The results also demonstrate that all 5 core genes have potential value as targets of chemotherapy drugs for EOC, which is based on a universally accepted fact that most of the chemotherapeutic drugs are developed according to their regulation of cell cycle process.</p>

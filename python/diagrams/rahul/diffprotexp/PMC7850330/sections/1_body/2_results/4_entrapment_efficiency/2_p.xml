<p>The EE% of the prepared nanoemulsions was investigated to determine the amount of loratadine and sulpiride loaded in the internal phase (oily phase) of these formulations and the results are displayed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The EE% of the prepared nanoemulsions for both drugs exhibited high values more than 90% with insignificant differences between different formulations (

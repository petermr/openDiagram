From the initial concentration, appropriate decimal dilutions were prepared and aliquots were plated in duplicates on various media. Plate count agar was used for the total bacterial count. Plates were incubated at 30&#160;&#176;C for 72&#160;h. Desoxycholate was used for the total coliforms count and plates were incubated at 30&#160;&#176;C for 24&#160;h. Desoxycholate was also used for the faecal coliforms count. In this case, plates were incubated at 44&#160;&#176;C and the identification was made using EMB (Eosine Methylene blue). Tryptone Sulfite Neomicin Agar was used for Anaerobic Sulfito Reducer (ASR) count and tubes were incubated at 37&#160;&#176;C for 24&#160;h. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> count was performed as described by the standard NF EN ISO 6888-1. The method used for detection of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. is that specified by the standard NF V 08-052. After incubation, the number of colonies was tracked using a colony counter. The number of bacteria expressed as Colony Forming Units per gram (CFU/g) was then determined by calculation, considering the factors of dilution. The method used for detection of yeast and fungi in samples was performed using dilution plating method. 10&#160;g of each sample were separately added to 90&#160;ml of sterile water containing 0.1% peptone water. This was thoroughly mixed to obtain the 10<sup>&#8722;1</sup> dilution. Further tenfold serial dilutions up to 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> were made. One milliliter of each dilution was separately placed in Petri dishes, over which 10&#8211;15&#160;ml of Potato Dextrose Agar with 60&#160;&#181;g/ml of chloramphenicol (PDAC) was poured. The plates were incubated at 28&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;&#176;C for 7&#160;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. All media used for microbiological analysis were prepared as indicated by the manufacturer.</p>

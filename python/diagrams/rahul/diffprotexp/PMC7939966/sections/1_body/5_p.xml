<p>RNA samples from different experimental conditions were sequenced to investigate the endosymbiosis-induced gene expression changes in 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-kjp-59-1-67">Fig. 1</xref>). A total of 7,108 genes whose expressions changed 12 hr pi and 24 hr pi were displayed using a heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-kjp-59-1-67">Fig. 1A</xref>). Genes from each group were colorized based on their expression level. Strongly upregulated/downregulated genes, as indicated by intense red/blue colors, were more prevalent in the 12 hr pi group than the 24 hr pi group. Genes whose expression levels changed more than 2 fold were selected for further analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-kjp-59-1-67">Fig. 1B</xref>). Among the 7,018 genes, 1,211 and 1,131 genes in the 12 hr pi group were upregulated and downregulated more than 2 fold, respectively. Similarly, 1,321 and 1,379 genes from the 24 hr pi group were upregulated and downregulated more than 2 fold, each respectively. Venn diagram revealed that a fraction of the DEGs found in the 12 hr pi overlapped with the DEGs from 24 hr pi group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-kjp-59-1-67">Fig. 1C</xref>). Our results revealed that 2,342 and 2,700 DEGs in 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> at 12 hr pi and 24 hr pi were changed more than 2 fold, respectively. More DEGs were observed at 24 hr pi than at 12 hr pi, which may indicate that more gene involvement is required for survival of 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in the later stages of infection.

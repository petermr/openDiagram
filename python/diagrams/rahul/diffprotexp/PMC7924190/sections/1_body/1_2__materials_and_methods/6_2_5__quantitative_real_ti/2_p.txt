0: The synthesized cDNA was then used as a template for qRT-PCR using the innuMIX qPCR MasterMix SyGreen and qTower 2.0 (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany).
1: The cycling conditions used for amplification were 95 C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 C for 5 s, and 65 C for 25 s. Later, the expression of all genes was normalized to the expression of the corresponding housekeeping gene, GAPDH.
2: The relative amounts of target mRNA in the unstimulated control cells and EF-treated cells were analyzed using the  Ct method, as described previously [ 35].

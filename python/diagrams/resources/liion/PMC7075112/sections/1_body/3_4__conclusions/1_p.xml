<p>Hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) was successfully synthesized by multistep calcination of biomass reed flowers in this work. The HPC anode exhibits a high specific surface of ~1714.83 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup> and a big pore volume (~1.13 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Owing to the advantages of the hierarchically porous structure, the HPC electrode displays good electrochemical property with a discharge capacity of 581.2 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 100 cycles, allowing for a promising prospect of further practical application in the battery industry as one of the effective and cheap alternatives of graphite. Moreover, the HPC anode achieves good rate performance. Even at a large current density of 1000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the specific capacity could also retain at 298.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 1000 cycles. The above property of the as-fabricated HPC reveals its great potential as an LIB anode. This work not only visualizes the possible application of biomass carbon as an anode material for LIBs but also proposes a new route for the preparation of low-cost carbon-based anodes and may promote the development of other porous carbon materials derived from various biomass carbon sources.

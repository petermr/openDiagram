<p>The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of sections routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) according to the WHO classification of thyroid tumors [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Clinical information was retrieved for all cases from cytology and pathology reports and medical records. MIB-1 proliferation index was determined by routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the MIB-1 antibody against the Ki-67 antigen. Expression of thyroglobulin was assessed by IHC in the routine clinical setting. For cPTCs, the tumor size was determined as equal to the diameter of the cyst (for intracystic tumors) or as a sum of the cyst and the extracystic tumor component (for tumors with additional tumor growth outside the cyst).

 <xref rid="f13-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>, the isothermal TTP diagram of EN AW-6005A is plotted again, including the residual hardening potential for additional artificial ageing. Vickers hardness values for different soaking temperatures and durations (the same time-temperature profile as for DSC-measurements, plus artificial ageing; see 
 <xref rid="f8-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) are shown. The residual hardening potential qualitatively supports the DSC measurements. Hardness after ageing decreases with increasing soaking duration, due to the loss of solutes during soaking. The maximum residual hardening potential was found to be 110 ± 2 HV1, which is near the values found after overcritical continuous cooling, where the maximum residual hardening potential amounts to 106 ± 3 HV1 [
 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For high temperatures, the decrease of the residual hardening potential begins after about 120 s. At medium temperatures, the residual hardening potential decreases after 30 s of soaking. At low temperatures, the decrease of potential residual hardening starts after 60 s. After soaking for 60 min, the residual hardening potential is low, and Vickers hardness remains at a minimum level for each soaking temperature.

<p>Conversely, recycling is one of multiple branches of the waste management cycle, which is promoted by environmental agencies worldwide under the “5R’s” acronym. Although the definition of this acronym may vary, the five “R’s” typically stand for reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, and residual management. The flow diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00801-f005">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the 5R’s concept for the life cycle of LIBs starting the manufacturing loop from raw material extraction to battery manufacturing then following with use stage until battery reaches its end-of-life. Zhang et al. proposed a simplified “3R’s” version of the cycle, where the three “R’s” stand for redesign, reuse, and recycle [

0: The validation of synthesis of half and full generation dendrimers was determined by UVVis as well as FTIR spectroscopy.
1: For the differentiation among half and full generation of dendrimer, 0.1% w/v dendrimers solution was stirred with freshly prepared 1% w/v aqueous solution of copper sulphate.
2: To investigate the structural changes in dendrimer, FTIR spectroscopy was used.
3: The samples were prepared in the form of KBr pellet method.
4: It was subjected to 32 scans and scanning ranges from 4000400 cm 1 using FTIR-8400S, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan.

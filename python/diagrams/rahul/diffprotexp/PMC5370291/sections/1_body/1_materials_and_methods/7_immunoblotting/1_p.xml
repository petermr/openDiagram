<p>Cells were collected and lysed in the lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5; containing 1% v/v Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na

 <sub>7</sub>, 10 μg/mL aprotinin and leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich)]. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, the supernatants were collected for protein quantitation using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). The crude proteins (30 μg/lane) were separated in 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After blocking with 3% w/v skimmed milk, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h. The primary antibodies against human 14-3-3ε (No.9635), HMGB1 (D3E5, No.6893), cathepsin B (G60, No.3373), calnexin (C5C9, No.2679), HSP 70 (No.4872), histone H4 (No.2592), and α-tubulin (No.2144) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA, USA); α-actinin-1 (7A4, No. NBP1-48251) and sialidase-1/NEU1 (No.MAB6860) was purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA); and gelsolin (GS-2C4, No.ab11081) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). After washing with PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20, the reacted membranes were incubated with anti-IgG antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Abcam). The detection of the antigen-antibody complex was performed by using ECL reagent (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and luminescence image system (LAS-4000; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

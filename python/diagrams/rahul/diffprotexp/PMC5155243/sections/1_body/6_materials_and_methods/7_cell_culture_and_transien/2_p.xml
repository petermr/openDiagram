<p>To knock down ETHE1 expression, siRNA targeting ETHE1 was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The design of the specific siRNA sequences and the experimental methods employed for these experiments were described previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. A specific siRNA and negative control siRNA were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The specific sequence was 5′-CAGGCTGACTTACACATTG-3′. A negative control group was set up using a non-specific sequence. Transfection was performed when the cells reached 90% confluence. One hour before transfection, cells were inoculated into 24-well culture plates at a density of 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. Culture medium was used to dilute 2 μl of Oligofectamine, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. After dilution, Oligofectamine was mixed and then incubated with the DNA solution as soon as possible. Cells were incubated in a 37 °C incubator under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for appropriate culture times. The expression of ETHE1 was then detected using western blotting.

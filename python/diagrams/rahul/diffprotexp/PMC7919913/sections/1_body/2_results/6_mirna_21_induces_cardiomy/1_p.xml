<p>To further investigate the mechanism underlying the miR-21-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH at the mRNA and protein levels were determined to assess the effects of exogenous miR-21 delivered by MVs in cardiomyocytes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A,B)</xref> displayed that the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH at the mRNA level were decreased after incubation with MVs derived from conditioned medium. To exclude the possibility that effects were caused by factors other than miR-21, miR-21 inhibitor was transfected into recipient cells. As we expected, miR-21 inhibitor abolished the depression of SORBS2 and ENH by MVs. Western blotting analysis also showed that the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH at the protein level were decreased after incubation with MVs derived from conditioned medium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(C,D)</xref>), while transfection of miR-21 inhibitor induced the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH. Furthermore, incubation with MVs derived from conditioned medium resulted in enlarged cell size (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(G)</xref>), whereas the hypertrophic effects of MVs were abolished by miR-21 inhibitor. Taken together, these results demonstrated that MV-secreted miR-21 could be delivered into recipient cells, where they induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy

<p>A serious concern arising from this literature review is the almost complete lack of experimental validations or biological studies following the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of therapeutic targets and fundamental pathways involved in cancer. Proofs of the biological validity of differential co-expression methods are compelling, and multidisciplinary works employing such approaches integrated with experimental molecular studies would be a valuable combination to discover cancer molecular mechanisms.

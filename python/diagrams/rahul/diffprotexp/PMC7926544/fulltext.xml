We previously showed that export from the ER constitutes the limiting step in NKCC2 maturation and cell surface expression. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain obscure. Here, we report the identification of chaperone stress 70 protein (STCH) and the stress-inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), as two novel binding partners of the ER-resident form of NKCC2. STCH knock-down increased total NKCC2 expression whereas Hsp70 knock-down or its inhibition by YM-01 had the opposite effect. Accordingly, overexpressing of STCH and Hsp70 exerted opposite actions on total protein abundance of NKCC2 and its folding mutants. Cycloheximide chase assay showed that in cells over-expressing STCH, NKCC2 stability and maturation are heavily impaired. In contrast to STCH, Hsp70 co-expression increased NKCC2 maturation. Interestingly, treatment by protein degradation inhibitors revealed that in addition to the proteasome, the ER associated degradation (ERAD) of NKCC2 mediated by STCH, involves also the ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation pathway. In summary, our data are consistent with STCH and Hsp70 having differential and antagonistic effects with regard to NKCC2 biogenesis. These findings may have an impact on our understanding and potential treatment of diseases related to aberrant NKCC2 trafficking and expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NKCC2</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>STCH</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd><kwd>Bartter syndrome</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-22-02207"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The electroneutral solute carrier family 12A (SLC12A) transport family encompasses several branches of homologous genes [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; each of them encodes unique cation-chloride co-transporter (CCC). The kidney Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC2), which is encoded by the SLC12A1 gene [<xref rid="B2-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is expressed in the apical membrane of ascending limb of Henle epithelial cells (TAL) and the macula densa [<xref rid="B4-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NKCC2 is the pacemaker of TAL sodium chloride reabsorption which accounts for 20&#x02013;30% of the filtered load of NaCl [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It plays therefore a pivotal role in urinary concentration and regulation of the blood pressure [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given its high reuptake capacity, changes in NKCC2 transport activity can significantly alter renal NaCl reabsorption, leading eventually to disruption of the homoeostasis of salt and water handling [<xref rid="B5-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Such changes in NKCC2 activity may be associated to the co-transporter itself (i.e., gain or loss-of-function mutations) or to alterations in the regulatory pathways that control NKCC2 trafficking and activity [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, loss of function mutations in <italic>SLC12A1</italic> can cause Bartter I syndrome, a rare genetic kidney disease marked by severe natriuresis with normal or low blood pressure, hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidism, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Opposite to genetic inactivation of NKCC2, enhanced NKCC2 activity has been associated with salt-sensitive hypertension in animal models and in humans, in particular African-Americans [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. NKCC2 is the target of loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, commonly used to lower BP [<xref rid="B15-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, a large genetic screening in participants of the Framingham Heart Study revealed that rare and subtle heterozygous mutations of the <italic>SLC12A1</italic> gene, protect against hypertension, further proving that factors regulating the activity of NKCC2 are key determinants of the control of BP in the general population [<xref rid="B16-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All of these data emphasize the important role of NKCC2 in electrolytes homeostasis and blood pressure control in normal physiology and in pathogenesis of Bartter syndrome. Despite the major role of NKCC2 in the regulation of sodium balance and blood pressure, the underlying mechanisms and respective protein networks regulating its transport activity at the molecular level namely in its trafficking, targeting, and turnover remain largely unidentified.</p><p>In eukaryotes, about 40% of the cell&#x02019;s proteins are either membrane bound or secretory and are therefore directed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they endure a dynamic folding environment and withstand the rigorous monitoring of quality-control pathways to reach functional maturity [<xref rid="B18-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Only correctly folded proteins are transferred to the Golgi apparatus for maturation [<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consequently, mature proteins are targeted to their final destination, they are directed to the plasma membrane or in organelles of the secretory and endocytic compartments, or they are secreted from the cell. When the folding process fails, defective proteins are dislocated across the membrane for cytosolic proteasome degradation through mechanisms known as ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) [<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both wild type and mutant variants of membrane proteins with complex topologies are prone to ER quality control and degradation. The chloride channel protein CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), characterized as the first integral membrane mammalian ERAD substrate, is the most extensively studied example [<xref rid="B21-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given its complex and inefficient folding pathway, the vast majority of newly synthesized wild type CFTR protein is selected for ERAD [<xref rid="B21-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], as is the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC [<xref rid="B23-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the thiazide-sensitive NaCl co-transporter (NCC) [<xref rid="B24-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The low folding efficiency is further decreased by mutations as seen in the most frequent mutation of CFTR, (CFTR&#x00394;F508), which is sufficient to retain almost all of the protein in the ER and targeted for ERAD, leading to cystic fibrosis [<xref rid="B21-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. ERAD is a multistep mechanism comprising the recognition, targeting, retranslocation, extraction, ubiquitination, and degradation by the proteasome. In general, the selection of proteins for ERAD involves substrate-specific interactions with molecular chaperones such as shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 40 (Hsp40) families, and with co-chaperones regulators [<xref rid="B25-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similar to ENaC and CFTR, our previous studies provided evidence for NKCC2 as a substrate for an ERAD quality control system [<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We have previously showed that similar to CFTR, the vast majority of newly synthetized NKCC2 protein is retained in the ER and destined for ERAD very likely because the protein is unable to fold correctly limiting therefore its export from the ER and its traffic to the cell membrane [<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In that pathway, the protein lectin OS9, which interacts with the C-terminal tail of NKCC2, can function to promote the degradation of the co-transporter by the proteasome [<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGE-D2), another regulator of NKCC2 biogenesis, recently identified mutated in patients with transient Bartter syndrome by our team, has been also implicated in the ER quality control of NKCC2 [<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Indeed, we previously showed that MAGE-D2 mutations lead to a very severe form of antenatal Bartter syndrome by altering the expression of NKCC2 and its structurally related kidney Na-Cl co-transporter NCC [<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. With this regard, we suggested that MAGE-D2 is very likely to cooperate with Hsp40, a binding partner of NKCC2 and a key modulator of protein folding and stability to regulate the ERAD of the co-transporter [<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although all these data clearly highlight the fact the ER quality control is a critical step in NKCC2 trafficking to the cell surface, very little is known about the specific molecular determinants involved in this process. In this study, we sought to identify additional factors and partners that target NKCC2 for ER-associated degradation and could help to define more the mechanisms by which NKCC2 is subject to ERAD. Here, we identified STCH and the stress inducible Hsp70 (Hsp72/HSPA1A) as two novel binding partners of NKCC2. The stress-inducible Hsp70 (Hsp72/HSPA1A) is commonly simply named Hsp70. STCH is also known as &#x0201c;microsomal stress 70 protein ATPase core&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;heat shock 70-kDa protein member 13&#x0201d; (HSPA13) [<xref rid="B31-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. STCH is constitutively expressed in all human cell types and is induced by incubation with calcium, but not by exposure to heat shock [<xref rid="B31-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast to the extensively studied stress-inducible Hsp70 [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], only few studies have linked STCH to some diseases [<xref rid="B35-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and its major cellular and molecular function has remained poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that STCH and Hsp70 interact with the immature form of NKCC2 mainly at the ER. Importantly, we provide evidence that STCH and Hsp70 differentially regulate the expression of NKCC2 and its disease-causing mutants. Interestingly, we show that STCH promotes efficient ER associated degradation of NKCC2 in a proteasome and lysosome dependent manner, revealing therefore a new molecular pathway in the regulation of the co-transporter. Taken together, these findings may open new avenues in studying the regulation of NKCC2 quality control and in ultimately identifying new &#x0201c;druggable&#x0201d; targets to prevent and/or treat kidney disorders related to sodium balance in general, and type I Bartter syndrome in particular.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-22-02207"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-22-02207"><title>2.1. Identification of STCH as a Novel NKCC2 Binding Partner</title><p>To identify novel NKCC2-binding partners, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of a human kidney cDNA expression library, using a sequence of bait fragments comprising the predicted cytoplasmic C terminus (residues 661&#x02013;1095) of murine NKCC2 termed C1-term (residues 661&#x02013;768), C2-term (residues 741&#x02013;909), and C3-term (residues 898&#x02013;1095) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>A and mentioned in previous studies [<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Several positive clones encoding putative interacting NKCC2 proteins were identified from the screen. Among these candidates, one clone (number # 62) encoding Hsp70-like stress 70 protein chaperone (STCH) was isolated as a novel and specific binding protein of the proximal region (C1-term) of NKCC2 terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). To determine whether STCH interacts with NKCC2 in mammalian cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies. To this end, HEK cells were transiently transfected with Myc-NKCC2 plasmid expressed either singly or in combination with GFP-STCH construct and cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc or anti-GFP antibody. The resultant immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As we previously described [<xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], exogenously expressed NKCC2 in renal cultured cells is detected as two major bands, one of ~130&#x02009;kDa and another of ~170&#x02009;kDa, corresponding to the core/high-mannose and complex N-glycosylated forms of the co-transporter, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, NKCC2 was detected in the precipitation complex containing anti-GFP antibody and obtained from cells co-transfected with NKCC2 and GFP-STCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, <italic>lane 3</italic>), but not from cells transfected only with NKCC2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, <italic>lane 2</italic>), indicating that STCH specifically interacts with NKCC2 protein. Interestingly, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>B (<italic>lane 3</italic>), this interaction between STCH and NKCC2 involves mainly the immature and ER-resident form of NKCC2. Altogether, these results not only confirm the interaction between NKCC2 and STCH revealed by Y2H but also clearly show that STCH interacts mainly with the core glycosylated and immature form of NKCC2 in vivo.</p><p>To further confirm these findings, we performed co-localization studies. To this end, immunofluorescence was performed in HEK cells co-expressing Myc-NKCC2 and GFP-STCH proteins. Of note, we have previously demonstrated that N-terminal tagging of NKCC2 with myc does not affect the co-transporter trafficking [<xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, myc-NKCC2 (red) co-localized with STCH (green) and their immunofluorescence staining pattern seems to be limited to a perinuclear ER-like distribution, which is consistent with STCH binding mainly to the immature and ER resident form of NKCC2. In sum, these findings are in accordance with the results of Y2H and co-immunoprecipitation studies and strongly suggest that NKCC2 and STCH interact mainly at the ER.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-22-02207"><title>2.2. Site of NKCC2 Interaction with STCH</title><p>Previous studies indicated that STCH is localized mainly in the ER [<xref rid="B31-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] which is in line with its interaction with the immature form of NKCC2. To verify this hypothesis, we next compared the subcellular distribution of NKCC2 and STCH with the ER marker calnexin. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, in HEK cells co-transfected with Myc-NKCC2 and GFP-STCH, both proteins largely colocalized with the ER marker calnexin, supporting therefore further the notion that STCH binds to the immature form of the co-transporter and that the main site of interaction between the proteins is the ER. However, the fact that STCH interacts only with the immature form of the co-transporter cannot exclude the possibility that this interaction may also take place outside the ER. Indeed, given that the N-glycan of glycoproteins at the entrance of the Golgi apparatus is still of high mannose type, it is conceivable that the interaction of the two proteins may also take place at the cis-Golgi network. In support of this notion, Sleat et al. reported that STCH protein possesses an N-linked glycosylation site containing Man-6-P which per se, clearly indicates that STCH is not only N-glycosylated but it is also processed at least in the cis-Golgi network [<xref rid="B42-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, lysosomal proteins such as the hydrolases are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and move to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi network, where they are covalently modified by the addition of the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) group [<xref rid="B42-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We sought therefore to further characterize the profile of protein expression and subcellular distribution of STCH.</p><p>To discover the glycosylation status of STCH, lysates from HEK cells overexpressing GFP-STCH were treated with Endo H and PNGase. With this regard, it is worth mentioning that Endo H digestion provides an additional level of specificity in the analysis of Man-6-phosphorylation sites. Indeed, previous studies reported that Man-6-phosphorylation prevents further carbohydrate processing to Endo H resistant structures, and thus the vast majority of Man-6-P-containing glycans are Endo H-sensitive [<xref rid="B43-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In contrast, PNGase F cleaves all N-linked oligosaccharides including complex type sugars that do not contain Man-6-P. Consequently, we anticipated that the major band detected around 94 kDa, corresponding to STCH (60 kDa) tagged with GFP (30 kDa) represents the Man-6 phosphorylated form of STCH and therefore should be Endo H sensitive. Importantly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>B (<bold>upper panel</bold>)<italic>,</italic> the band at 94 kDa (STCH plus GFP) was indeed sensitive to both Endo H and PNGase which is in line with the presence of STCH in the ER and/or its expression as a Man-6 phosphorylated glycoprotein. To confirm these findings, we checked also the glycosylation profile of endogenously expressed STCH in HEK cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>B (<bold>lower panel</bold>) the detected band at 60 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of STCH, was also sensitive to Endo H, which is, again, in agreement with the expression of STCH as an ER-resident protein and/or its processing in the cis-Golgi-network to become Man-6 phosphorylated.</p><p>To further analyze the subcellular localization of STCH, we performed more co-localization studies using Golgi markers GM130 and giantin and the lysosomal marker LAMP2. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C (<bold>upper left panel</bold>), STCH intensively colocalized again with the ER marker calnexin clearly indicating that the main site of STCH expression is the ER. Interestingly, some STCH proteins appear to co-localize also with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, <bold>upper right panel</bold>) and to a lesser degree with the cis/medial Golgi marker giantin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, <bold>lower left panel</bold>), opening therefore the possibility of an additional interaction between NKCC2 and STCH at the cis-Golgi network. Importantly, STCH staining did not colocalize with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, <bold>lower right panel</bold>), which clearly indicates that although some STCH exits the ER apparatus and then become Man-6-phosphorylated in the transitional elements/cis-Golgi apparatus, they are not delivered to the lysosomes. Collectively, these findings provide additional evidence that STCH interaction with NKCC2 takes place mainly at the ER. Moreover, they also suggest that this interaction may additionally occur at the cis-Golgi compartment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-22-02207"><title>2.3. STCH Decreases NKCC2 Stability and Maturation</title><p>To determine the functional implications of STCH-NKCC2 interaction, we first tested the impact of STCH co-expression on total NKCC2 protein abundance. Accordingly, Myc-NKCC2 was transfected singly or with GFP-STCH in HEK293 cells. Then, 48 h post-transfection, total protein lysates were harvested and the protein levels of NKCC2 and STCH were analyzed by immunoblotting, using either anti-Myc or anti-GFP antibodies. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, when increasing amounts of STCH (0.2&#x02013;0.6 &#x003bc;g/well) were co-expressed with NKCC2 (0.2 &#x003bc;g/well), the protein levels of immature and mature forms of NKCC2 expression were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. To better visualize the expression of the immature form of NKCC2 during immunoblotting, we repeated these co-expression studies and performed cell lysis 16&#x02013;18 h after cell transfection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, with 0.6 &#x003bc;g/well, STCH co-expression strikingly decreased the amount of immature and mature forms of NKCC2. As a consequence, total NKCC2 protein abundance was significantly decreased upon STCH co-expression (&#x02212;51%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>The interaction of STCH with the immature form of NKCC2 and the downregulation of the latter are likely due to changes in NKCC2 protein stability and maturation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of STCH on the stability and maturation of NKCC2 using cycloheximide assays. Towards that end, 14 to 16 h after transfection of HEK cells with NKCC2 singly or in combination with STCH, cells were incubated with cycloheximide (CHX, 100 &#x003bc;M) for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h to block protein synthesis. Western blot assay was used to detect changes in NKCC2 protein maturation and degradation rate. During the chase period, under control conditions, the immature form of NKCC2 was progressively converted to a more slowly migrating band, representing the mature form. With this regard, it is worth emphasizing that we previously demonstrated that only the mature and complex glycosylated form of NKCC2 is able to reach the cell surface. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f003">Figure 3</xref>C (<bold>middle panel</bold>), STCH co-expression induced a rapid decay of the immature NKCC2 protein during the chase period. Of note, the decrease in half-life of immature NKCC2 form represents its degradation, as well as its conversion to the mature form of the co-transporter. Importantly, STCH co-expression heavily impaired the glycolytic maturation of NKCC2 by strikingly impeding protein conversion from immature to mature form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, <bold>upper and lower panels</bold>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that STCH promotes efficient NKCC2 degradation and that the immature form of the co-transporter is its preferred substrate, as evidenced by these cycloheximide chase data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-22-02207"><title>2.4. STCH Alters the Expression of NKCC2 Independently of the Expression System</title><p>Because the ERAD system and protein&#x02013;protein interaction may be cell-dependent, we sought to corroborate our findings by conducting the experiments in a second renal cell line, OKP cells. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, immunoprecipitation of STCH followed by immunoblotting for NKCC2 revealed again that the two proteins interact and that their association involves mainly the immature form of the co-transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, <italic>lane 3</italic>). Accordingly, STCH strongly colocalized with NKCC2 in OKP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Moreover, similar to HEK cells, the main site of the interaction appears to be the ER as judged by the intensive colocalization of NKCC2 and STCH with the ER marker calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>C, <bold>upper panel</bold>). Again, although NKCC2 and STCH co-localized mainly at the ER, some of the interaction between the two proteins seems to take place also at the cis-Golgi apparatus as judged by partial co-localization of NKCC2 and STCH with GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>C, <bold>lower panel</bold>).</p><p>To assess the effect of STCH on NKCC2 biogenesis in OKP cells, we used again cycloheximide assay. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>D, STCH overexpression decreased the stability of immature NKCC2 protein which is in agreement with the data described above in HEK cells. Again, the decrease in immature NKCC2 stability in cells overexpressing STCH was associated with a striking alteration in the conversion of the immature to the mature protein form. STCH-induced decrease in the maturation efficiency of NKCC2 was accentuated during the chase period to reach &#x02212;81% at 4 h (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>D, <bold>lower right panel</bold>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that, similar to HEK cells, STCH targets the immature form of NKCC2 to the ER associated degradation pathway in OKP cells, clearly indicating that STCH effects on the co-transporter expression are independent of the expression system. It is of great interest to note that, under identical experimental conditions, the overexpression of SCAMP2 or aldolase B, two others NKCC2 binding partner, had no effect on total NKCC2 protein abundance in OKP cells [<xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], strongly suggesting that the effect of STCH on total NKCC2 protein abundance is specific.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-22-02207"><title>2.5. STCH Induces NKCC2 ERAD in a Proteasome-Dependent and Independent Manner</title><p>Based upon the above findings, we hypothesized that STCH association with NKCC2 promotes endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of immature misfolded NKCC2, leading to a decrease in total expression and maturation of the co-transporter. Accordingly, investigations of ERAD inhibition and consequent probable changes in NKCC2 expression were conducted in cells treated with kifunensine, which inhibits &#x003b1;-mannosidases I (including ER mannosidase I and EDEM) required for the early steps of ERAD misfolded glycoprotein recognition. Towards this end, cells were transfected with Myc-NKCC2 cDNA in the absence (empty vector) or presence of STCH-GFP construct for 5 h before treatment with kifunensine overnight. Again, given that the data described above clearly demonstrate that the immature form of NKCC2 is the preferred substrate of STCH, cell lysis was performed 16&#x02013;18 h post-treatment to better visualize the immature form of the co-transporter during immunoblotting analysis. As can be seen in the upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, kifunensine (KIF) increased total expression of immature N-glycosylated NKCC2, as expected following impaired mannose trimming in the ER. Most importantly, upon treatment with kifunensine, the STCH-dependent decrease of NKCC2 protein level was abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Hence, these data clearly indicate that STCH-enhanced degradation of NKCC2 requires mannose trimming by &#x003b1;-mannosidase I to target misfolded NKCC2 for ERAD.</p><p>It is well known that ERAD involves, in most cases, activation of the proteasome proteolysis pathway and/or the lysosomal machinery. Therefore, to explore the possible implication of proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation pathways in the STCH-induced down-regulation of NKCC2, 16 h post-transfection, cells were treated for 6 h with 2 &#x003bc;m MG132 or 100 &#x003bc;m chloroquine and their lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis. In accordance with our previous work, MG132 treatment significantly increased the protein levels of the immature form of NKCC2 without a notable increase in its mature form, an effect consistent with an ER-associated degradation. Interestingly, in cells overexpressing STCH, MG132 appeared to increase NKCC2 levels and to exert a protective effect against STCH-induced NKCC2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), suggesting that a proteasome-dependent mechanism underlies the STCH mediated degradation of NKCC2. However, MG132 alone failed to completely suppress NKCC2 degradation elicited by STCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f005">Figure 5</xref>B, <bold>lower panel</bold>). Interestingly, in the presence of chloroquine, STCH effect on NKCC2 was also partially inhibited revealing therefore that the lysosomal machinery is also involved in STCH-induced down-regulation of the co-transporter. Accordingly, the combined use of MG132 and chloroquine was able to abrogate the STCH induced downregulation of NKCC2, and to fully restore the expression level of the co-transporter. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that STCH decreases NKCC2 expression by promoting its ERAD in a proteasome and lysosome dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-ijms-22-02207"><title>2.6. Stress-Inducible Hsp70 Interacts Also with NKCC2</title><p>The potential significance of our findings is that the interaction of STCH, a constitutively expressed member of the Hsp70 family, with NKCC2 at the ER and/or cis-Golgi could be very important for the ER quality control and the ERAD of the co-transporter. These findings are of particular interest, because previous reports showed that the cytoplasmic, stress-inducible, and the most studied members of the Hsp70 family Hsp-70-1, commonly called Hsp70, is also involved in the ER quality control of several proteins [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This prompted us to study also the effect of this stress-inducible Hsp70 on NKCC2 biogenesis. Consequently, we first checked whether NKCC2 might also interact with Hsp70. To this end, cells were transiently transfected with Myc-NKCC2 construct either singly or in combination with Hsp70 which is also tagged with Myc. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Hsp70 antibodies, and the resultant immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-Myc. Interestingly, similar to the data obtained with STCH, these CO-IP experiments revealed Hsp70 interacts also with NKCC2 and that the interaction implicates mainly the immature form of the co-transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, <italic>lane 3</italic>).</p><p>To check whether Hsp70 interaction with NKCC2 takes place also at the ER, we visualized the subcellular distribution of EGFP-NKCC2 and Myc-Hsp70 by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, EGFP-NKCC2 (green) co-localized with Myc-Hsp70 (red), indicating that these two proteins share overlapping subcellular localization. Interestingly, similar to STCH, Hsp70 protein displayed also co-localization with the ER marker calnexin, which in agreement with the notion that the interaction engages mainly the immature and ER resident form of NKCC2. Interestingly, in cells co-expressing GFP-STCH and Myc-HSP70, these two NKCC2 binding partners appeared also to share some overlapping subcellular localization. Collectively, these data provide evidence, that similar to the non-inducible Hsp70-like protein STCH, the stress-inducible Hsp70 interacts also with the immature form of NKCC2, an interaction that takes place very likely at the cytoplasmic side of the ER.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-ijms-22-02207"><title>2.7. Differential Regulation of NKCC2 and It Disease Causing Mutants with Exogenous STCH and Hsp70</title><p>The interaction of the stress-inducible Hsp70 with the immature form of NKCC2 opens the possibility for its involvement also in the regulation of NKCC2 biogenesis. Consequently, we next compared the effect of STCH with that of Hsp70 on the expression of NKCC2 protein. To this end, HEK cells were transfected singly with NKCC2, or in combination with STCH or Hsp70. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f007">Figure 7</xref>A, when increasing amounts of STCH or Hsp70 (0.1&#x02013;0.5 &#x003bc;g/well) were co-expressed with NKCC2 (0.1 &#x003bc;g/well), NKCC2 expression was, again, heavily reduced by STCH, whereas it was markedly increased by Hsp70, in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, these data revealed also, that Hsp70 co-expression effect on the mature form of NKCC2 is greater than that observed on the immature form of the co-transporter. Consequently, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f007">Figure 7</xref>B, Hsp70 co-expression increased the ratio of the mature vs. immature form of NKCC2, in a dose-dependent fashion strongly indicating that Hsp70 increases the maturation efficiency of the co-transporter. Hence, these data further support, per se, the notion that STCH induced-downregulation of NKCC2 is specific. Most importantly, they provide evidence that the non-inducible Hsp70-like protein STCH and the stress-inducible Hsp70 differentially regulate NKCC2 biogenesis.</p><p>To further corroborate the notion that STCH and Hsp70 differentially regulate the co-transporter biogenesis, we next compared the effects of STCH and Hsp70 on the expression of A508T and Y998X, two previously reported Bartter syndrome type 1 mutations [<xref rid="B29-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Importantly, when compared to its action on WT NKCC2, STCH co-expression had a more profound effect on A508T and Y998X mutants suggesting that STCH is involved in the ERAD of NKCC2 disease causing mutants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f007">Figure 7</xref>C, STCH and Hsp70 had opposite effects on WT NKCC2 but also on A508T and Y998X.

Endogenous Stress-Inducible HSP70 and STCH Differentially Regulate NKCC2 Expression</title><p>The differential effects of Hsp70 and STCH on NKCC2 biogenesis strongly suggest, per se, that their action on the co-transporter are specific. To further corroborate the differential regulation of NKCC2 by STCH and Hsp70 and the specificity of their effects on the co-transporter, we next examined the role of endogenous STCH and Hsp70 on NKCC2 protein expression. Consequently, we studied the effect of STCH and Hsp70 knockdown on NKCC2 using small interference RNA (siRNA). To this end, a sequential transfection in HEK cells was performed. Cells were first transfected with siRNAs for at least 24 h, before transfection with Myc-NKCC2 plasmids for 48 h. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>, upon STCH knockdown, the steady state level of NKCC2 was increased in a dose dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>A). In contrast, Hsp70 knockdown had the opposite effect by decreasing NKCC2 protein abundance in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>B), illustrating again the specificity of STCH and Hsp70 actions on the co-transporter. Given that a plateau was reached with the dose of 40 pmol of each siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,B), this dose was used to study in parallel the effects of STCH and Hsp70 knock-down on total NKCC2 protein abundance. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f008">Figure 8</xref>C, when the dose of 40 pmol of each siRNA was used, STCH know-down increased NKCC2 protein abundance by 52% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas HSP70 know-down decreased it by 35% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.003), illustrating again the reciprocal control of NKCC2 by STCH and Hsp70. To further support the notion that endogenous Hsp70 promotes NKCC2 biogenesis, we also tested the effect of YM-01, an allosteric inhibitor of Hsp70 [<xref rid="B51-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

Hence, these data are fully in agreement with a role of endogenous of Hsp70 and STCH in the regulation of NKCC2 protein expression.

Discussion</title><p>This study was conducted to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of NKCC2 transit through the ER. Here, we have identified STCH and Hsp70 as two novel interacting partners of the immature and ER-resident form of NKCC2. In contrast to Hsp70, the implication of STCH in the ERAD of misfolded proteins has never been directly investigated. Here, we have found that STCH and Hsp70 differentially regulate the protein expression of NKCC2 and its diseasing causing mutants. Indeed, whereas STCH enhances the ERAD of NKCC2, Hsp70 exerts the opposite effect by promoting the maturation of the co-transporter. Interestingly, the ERAD of NKCC2 mediated by STCH involves both the proteasome and the lysosome pathways. The reciprocal control of NKCC2 stability and maturation by STCH and Hsp70 may open new avenues in the treatment of diseases related to abnormal NKCC2 trafficking.</p><p>Most members of the Hsp70 family belong to the Dnak family and they are recognized to play protective effects through several mechanisms, such as assisting for proper folding of misfolded proteins and degradation of damaged proteins [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B53-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The stress 70 protein chaperone (STCH), a member of the Hsp70 family, is constitutively expressed in all human cell types and shares a high degree of amino acid identity with Hsp70 [<xref rid="B32-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Unlike other members of the DnaK subfamily, STCH contains a unique hydrophobic signal sequence and lacks a carboxyl-terminal peptide-binding domain [<xref rid="B32-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Many studies have associated the <italic>STCH</italic> gene to several brain diseases such as Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, autism but also to gastric cancer [<xref rid="B35-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite these insights in STCH biological functions, the data relying on its role at the molecular level remain scarce. Kaye et al. has identified an interaction between STCH and the ubiquitin-like protein UBQLN2, termed CHAP1/DSK2, which is known to mediate the proteasomal targeting of misfolded proteins for degradation by binding to their polyubiquitin chains and by interacting (via ubiquitin-like domain) with the subunits of the proteasome [<xref rid="B54-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. UBQLN2 plays also a role in the ERAD pathway, providing a link between polyubiquitinated ERAD substrates and the proteasome. Although the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear at this stage, the identification of ubiquitin-linked proteins that bind to a conserved peptide motif within the &#x02018;core ATPase&#x02019; STCH molecule suggests a broader role for this Hsp70 like protein in regulating specialized cellular events. However, whether STCH has a direct role in ERAD of misfolded proteins has never been directly addressed. In the present study, we showed evidence for specific binding of STCH with NKCC2. Most importantly, we showed for the first time, that this interaction is required for efficient degradation of NKCC2 by the ERAD pathway.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that ERAD and export from the ER constitute the limiting step in the maturation and cell surface expression of NKCC2 [<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the present work, the function of STCH in the ERAD of NKCC2 was first suggested by co-immunoprecipitation studies that demonstrated that the interaction involves mainly the immature, ER-resident form of NKCC2. Accordingly, immunocytochemistry studies showed that STCH mainly co-localizes with NKCC2 at the ER. To further support the role of STCH in the ERAD of NKCC2, we have shown that the overexpression of STCH or its inhibition using siRNA approach, was associated with an increase or a decrease in the expression and the degradation of the immature form of the co-transporter, respectively. It is important to note that Bae et al. [<xref rid="B41-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] have identified a positive role of STCH in the modulation of membrane trafficking of two acid/base transporters NBCe1-B and NHE1, by increasing their cell surface expression and activity. It is well known that a single chaperone might be involved in either folding or degrading a given substrate that travels through the ER [<xref rid="B26-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; STCH is no exception and its effect is substrate-dependent. Hence, it may have a protective role for NBCe1-B and NHE1 but a destructive one for NKCC2 during ERAD. Moreover, we have shown that STCH effects on the immature form of NKCC2 were predominantly prevented in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating that STCH targets most of the immature form of the co-transporter to the proteasome-dependent ERAD pathway. Interestingly, full recovery of NKCC2 expression was achieved only by using MG132 combined with chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal function. Thus, we show here for the first time that the lysosome machinery is also implicated in the proteolysis of NKCC2 by playing a complementary role with the proteasome in the degradation of misfolded NKCC2. The role of additional ER quality control mechanisms, defined as ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) pathways, is progressively emerging, as some misfolded proteins evade the ERAD factors for quality control or they can form aggregates that cannot be dislocated across the membrane [<xref rid="B55-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These misfolded ER clients, which are not suitable for ERAD must be cleared from the ER through the lysosome alternative by autophagic or non-autophagic pathways. It has been shown that Hsp70 chaperones have a dual function in protein degradation, as they can select misfolded proteins for either the general protein degradation pathways, the proteasome system, or the lysosome degradation machinery [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Our present data demonstrate that immature NKCC2 is recognized by STCH, a component of the Hsp70 system, and degraded by two different pathways that function in a complementary way to regulate NKCC2 turnover. We believe that our characterization for the first time of the ERLAD as another degradation pathway of NKCC2, as well as ERAD, supports and offers a new mechanistic explanation of the ER quality control of NKCC2. How this is regulated awaits further clarification.</p><p>ERAD machinery has been reported to function primarily in the ER where ER &#x003b1;-1, 2-mannosidase I (ERManI) is capable of initiating the ERAD by promoting the first mannose trimming step of numerous misfolded N-glycosylated protein [<xref rid="B59-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, proteins that exhibit a severe misfolded conformation can traffic to post-ER compartments [<xref rid="B62-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These findings suggest that the ER&#x02019;s ability to retain misfolded proteins is limited and therefore requires a post-ER control system to prevent premature secretion of escaped misfolded immature proteins. Evidence obtained from several studies support the involvement of the Golgi complex as a component of ERAD. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that a number of ERAD substrates undergo vesicular cycling through early Golgi compartments, and that the three-traditional mammalian Golgi-localized &#x003b1;-1, 2-mannosidases (IA, IB, and IC) contribute to the intracellular degradation of misfolded glycoproteins [<xref rid="B63-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Furthermore, ERManI, which was predicted to function in the ER, was also localized to the Golgi complex in mammalian cells, where it contributes to a Golgi-based quality control checkpoint that facilitates the retrieval of captured ERAD substrates back to the ER [<xref rid="B65-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B67-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Interestingly, we have shown in our current study, that upon treatment with mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine, the effects of STCH on NKCC2 expression were abolished. Given the fact that kifunensine inhibits trimming of mannose residues in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the Golgi compartment, these results suggest that the STCH-enhanced degradation of misfolded NKCC2 requires mannose trimming by &#x003b1;-mannosidase I to target ER misfolded NKCC2 as well as escaped misfolded NKCC2 in the Golgi for ERAD. STCH is expected to be mainly located in the ER, a prediction confirmed also by our experiments. However, in contrast to ER resident proteins, STCH does not encode a consensus ER retention signal such as the tetrapeptide KDEL [<xref rid="B32-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] opening therefore the possibility that STCH may exit the ER. In support of this notion, Otterson et al. showed that STCH is localized to the cellular cytoplasm in a pattern that resembled, but was not identical to BiP, an ER resident protein [<xref rid="B32-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Accordingly, we show here that not all STCH related immunofluorescence signal was found in the ER. In fact, the remaining staining was dispersed in a perinuclear Golgi like region. Most importantly, we found colocalization of STCH with GM130, strongly suggesting that in addition to its detection at the ER, this Hsp70-like protein is also present the cis-Golgi network. These findings are of great interest because they are consistent with the expression of STCH as a Man-6 phosphorylated glycoprotein [<xref rid="B42-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and its sensitivity to endo-H digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Indeed, phosphorylation of mannose residues within the 1,6 branch prevents high mannose-type units from being converted to Endo H resistant structures by preventing mannosidase action [<xref rid="B43-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, despite being Man-6 P phosphorylated [<xref rid="B42-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we did not detect any colocalization of STCH with the lysosome marker LAMP2, which clearly indicates that although some STCH proteins exit the ER and then become Man-6-phosphorylated in cis-Golgi apparatus, they were retained in the cis-Golgi network and/or retrieved back to the ER prior to encountering the MPRs in the trans-Golgi. In sum, these observations support a model in which STCH role in the ERAD of immature NKCC2 requires mainly its residence in the ER. Moreover, they open the possibility that STCH contributes not only in the retention and degradation of misfolded proteins at the ER, but also in the retention, the recycling, and ERAD of misfolded proteins that initially escape protein quality control surveillance within the ER.</p><p>Among the members of 70 kDa heat shock proteins, Hsc70 (heat shock cognate protein, Hsp73/HSPA8) and Hsp70 (Hsp72/HSPA1A) have been extensively studied and have distinct biological functions despite their high sequence homology [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B53-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consequently, the roles of Hsp70 and Hsc70 in the ERAD of several transmembrane proteins such CFTR, NCC, ENaC, and HERG have been thoroughly investigated [<xref rid="B24-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Under cellular stress conditions, it is assumed in general that Hsc70 associates with newly synthesized misfolded proteins to induce their ER associated degradation by the proteasome. In contrast, Hsp70 seems to preferentially promote the biogenesis of newly synthesized proteins by facilitating their protein refolding after cellular stress [<xref rid="B68-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In agreement with these notions, several reports demonstrated that Hsp70 and Hsc70 exert opposite effects on the stability and maturation of hERG and ENaC proteins through their association with their immature forms at the ER [<xref rid="B45-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This is of great interest because similar to STCH, Hsc70 is also constitutively expressed [<xref rid="B69-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Hence, we hypothesized that STCH and the stress-inducible Hsp70 may also have differential effects on the stability and maturation of NKCC2. Importantly, we found indeed that similar to Hsc70, the effect of STCH was opposite to that of Hsp70 not only on WT NKCC2 but also on its disease-causing mutants i.e., STCH promotes NKCC2 degradation, whereas Hsp70 promotes the co-transporter maturation. Similar to STCH, the main site of action of Hsp70 appeared to be mainly the ER given that both chaperones associate only with the immature form of the co-transporter. Interestingly, our immunocytochemistry experiments revealed overlap of Hsp70 and STCH, which is consistent with the idea that these two chaperones exert opposite and antagonist effect on the same substrate, which in our case, is NKCC2. Obviously, further studies are required to determine the mechanisms underlying these differential effects and whether these effects are also observed native TAL cells. Of note, while under ER stress conditions, Hsp70 preferentially promotes, in general, the stabilization and proper protein folding of newly synthetized proteins, it promotes actually their degradation under non-stress conditions [<xref rid="B26-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B68-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This is of particular interest because our experimental setting i.e., heterologous overexpression of secretory and membrane proteins (NKCC2) causes ER stress which is therefore consistent with the protective role of Hsp70 during the ERAD of the co-transporter under these conditions [<xref rid="B70-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. With regard to the mechanisms underlying the effect of Hsp70 on protein maturation, it is worth mentioning that Chanoux et al. demonstrated that Hsp70 overexpression increases the association of ENaC with the Sec24D cargo recognition component of coat complex II, which carries protein cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi [<xref rid="B73-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that Hsp70 overexpression stabilizes NKCC2 at the ER and promotes also its maturation and trafficking by increasing its association with Coat Complex II and its exit from Endoplasmic Reticulum. Undeniably, Hsp70 cannot work in isolation to promote NKCC2 biogenesis. Appropriately, one may reasonably postulate that Hsp70 works in concert, sequentially or simultaneously, with other NKCC2-binding proteins and ERAD components such as MAGE-D2 and Hsp40 to regulate the ER quality control and its associated protein degradation of the co-transporter. Indeed, it is well known that the function of Hsp70 in the ERAD pathway involves Hsp40 [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Most importantly, we previously provided evidence that MAGE-D2 protects the co-transporter against ER associated degradation and promotes its maturation and cell surface expression, an effect that is very likely to be mediated by Hsp40 [<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Likewise, given that we previously showed the presence of OS9 mediated ER associated degradation of NKCC2 [<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], one may also postulate that STCH and OS9 work in concert to exert the opposite effect by promoting efficient degradation of the co-transporter and its folding mutants. Obviously, further experiments are needed to uncover the precise mechanisms behind these processes.</p><p>In summary, we identified Hsp70-like STCH and the stress inducible Hsp70 proteins as two novel bindings partners of the immature and ER-resident form of NKCC2. Our results provide evidence that STCH and Hsp70 exert opposite effects on the stability and maturation of the co-transporter. In addition, they show that besides the proteasome-dependent ERAD, the ER quality control of NKCC2 mediated by STCH, involves also the ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation pathway, revealing therefore a new regulatory mechanism governing the co-transporter biogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first report demonstrating that STCH is directly involved in the ERAD of misfolded proteins. Given the dual role of chaperones such as the members of the Hsp70 heat shock family in ERAD pathways [<xref rid="B26-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], an attractive idea is that biochemical and/or molecular manipulation of their cellular levels might allow proper folding, and consequently partial rescue of function of mutant proteins. Accordingly, enhancing the ability of chaperones, such Hsp70 and Hsp40 to stabilize NKCC2 and assist its proper folding might at least partially rescue trafficking of its folding mutants, and consequently restore their function at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, reducing the ability of chaperones, such as STCH and OS9 to promote the ERAD NKCC2, might increase the cellular levels of mutant proteins available to be rescued. Ultimately, the comprehensive characterization and identification of the molecular specific determinants of ERAD NKCC2 might help to provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting co-transporter trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-22-02207"><title>4.

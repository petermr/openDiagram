<p>The interaction of STCH with the immature form of NKCC2 and the downregulation of the latter are likely due to changes in NKCC2 protein stability and maturation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of STCH on the stability and maturation of NKCC2 using cycloheximide assays. Towards that end, 14 to 16 h after transfection of HEK cells with NKCC2 singly or in combination with STCH, cells were incubated with cycloheximide (CHX, 100 Î¼M) for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h to block protein synthesis. Western blot assay was used to detect changes in NKCC2 protein maturation and degradation rate. During the chase period, under control conditions, the immature form of NKCC2 was progressively converted to a more slowly migrating band, representing the mature form. With this regard, it is worth emphasizing that we previously demonstrated that only the mature and complex glycosylated form of NKCC2 is able to reach the cell surface. As shown in

 <bold>middle panel</bold>), STCH co-expression induced a rapid decay of the immature NKCC2 protein during the chase period. Of note, the decrease in half-life of immature NKCC2 form represents its degradation, as well as its conversion to the mature form of the co-transporter. Importantly, STCH co-expression heavily impaired the glycolytic maturation of NKCC2 by strikingly impeding protein conversion from immature to mature form (

 <bold>upper and lower panels</bold>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that STCH promotes efficient NKCC2 degradation and that the immature form of the co-transporter is its preferred substrate, as evidenced by these cycloheximide chase data.

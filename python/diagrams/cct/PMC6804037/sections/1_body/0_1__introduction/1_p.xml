<p>Surface transformation hardening processes are developed to produce wear-, corrosion-, and fatigue-resistant surfaces in order to enhance the lifespan for numerous industrial applications. There are several methods in order to improve surface properties. Among these processes, induced heat treatment and flame heat treatment are methods to improve steel surface hardness and wear resistance. While used for various industrial utilizations such as welding [

Hence, laser surface transformation hardening (LSTH) is a precise method because it offers controllable heat in the selected area in order to produce hardened surface layers. Moreover, the type of laser and the choice of material can influence the hardening process.

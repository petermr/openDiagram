<p>Finally, the integration of various data types can build upon co-expression networks to infer the sources of variability responsible for the observed differential co-expression. As represented in the simplified model of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09461-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the loss of co-expression between a transcription factor and its target can be accounted for by intervening regulatory mechanisms, such as the transcription factor post-translational modifications, mutations and its association with alternative co-factors or epigenetic control (DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs), not necessarily leading to a detectable differential expression at the mRNA level. Adding this information to the model helps, on one side, to explain the molecular processes involved in the co-expression change and, on the other side, to identify the functional correlates of less experimentally accessible regulatory layers (e.g., protein phosphorylation).

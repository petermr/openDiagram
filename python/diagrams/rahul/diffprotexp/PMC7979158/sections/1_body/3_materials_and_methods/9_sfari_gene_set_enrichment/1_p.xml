 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp17">Supplementary file 17</xref>. High confidence risk genes, annotated as ‘gene-score’ 1 and 2 were selected, and their orthologs were found using getLDS function from the biomaRt R package (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Durinck et al., 2005</xref>). Overlap of up- and downregulated DE genes with SFARI ortholog genes was calculated and plotted using a custom R script. Statistical significance of overlap was tested with hypergeometric test using the following R script: sum(dhyper(t:b, a, n - a, b)):

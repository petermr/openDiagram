<p id="Par28">Another sequence difference that might be important is that H-NS contains a positively charged residue K at position 6 that experiences a repulsive interaction with ERY which also carries a positive charge +1e (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This repulsive electrostatic interaction might facilitate H-NS bypassing of ERY. Thus, a nascent peptide containing residues that have a charge opposite to that of the macrolide might be more likely to be arrested. Taken together, the results and implications of this study could be tested by making mutations in the nascent chain that alter its hydrophobic or charge characteristics at residue positions that experience the largest force in our simulations.

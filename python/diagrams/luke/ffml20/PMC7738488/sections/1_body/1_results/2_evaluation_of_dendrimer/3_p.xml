<p id="Par12">The synthesis of dendrimer was overseen by usage of UV–Visible spectroscopy. The variation in λmax values perceived from half-generation to full generation i.e. from 290 to 270 nm impart the structural modification of PAMAM (Polyamidoamine) dendrimers, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The proportional correlation between absorption and number of chromophoric units explicate the alter in the intensity of the absorption band with the growing generation. This manifests the conformation of synthesis of dendrimers.

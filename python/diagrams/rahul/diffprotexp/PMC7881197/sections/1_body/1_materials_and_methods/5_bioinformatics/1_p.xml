<p id="Par31">Sequenced reads were trimmed to remove portions of poor sequenced quality (Phred score &lt; 20) and/or contaminated adapter sequences using Trim Galore (version 0.6.4;

Trimmed reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg38 assembly) using STAR (version 2.7.3a)

Hierarchical clustering of genes in the heatmaps was conducted by the average linkage algorithm with the one-minus pearson correlation metric. GO and PPI analyses of DEGs were performed using Metascape

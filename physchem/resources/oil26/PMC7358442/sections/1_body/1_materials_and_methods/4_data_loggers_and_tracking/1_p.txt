0: We implanted two data loggers and one tracking transmitter into each aardvark (total mass of implanted equipment 300 g,<1% of aardvark body mass; see  Supplementary Table S2 for dimensions of all implanted devices).
1: Transmitters and data loggers were covered with inert wax (Sasolwax 1276, Sasol Ltd., South Africa) and sterilised in formaldehyde vapour before implantation.
2: The tracking transmitter (Africa Wildlife Tracking, South Africa) allowed relocation of aardvarks in the field with a directional antenna and receiver kit (Three-Element Folding Yagi Antenna, R1000 Receiver, Sirtrack, New Zealand).
3: A temperature-sensitive data logger recorded abdominal body temperature in each aardvark (20122013: DS1922L Thermochron iButton , Dallas Semiconductor/Maxim Integrated Products, United States; resolution 0.0625C; 20132015: DST centi-T, Star-Oddi, Iceland; resolution 0.032C).
4: Loggers were set to record temperature at 5-min intervals.
5: Each temperature logger was calibrated in an insulated water bath against a high accuracy thermometer (Quat 100, Heraeus, Germany) over a temperature range of 2842C in increments of 2C before implantation.
6: We confirmed the reliability of temperature readings by re-calibrating all loggers after their removal.
7: After calibration, the biologgers measured body temperature to an accuracy of better than 0.1C.

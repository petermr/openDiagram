<p>In alkaline media, Pd alloys can be used for ORR without protective Pt shells. For example, pure Pd, PdCu and PdPt alloy NPs were investigated by Castegnaro et al.

 </sup> Analysis of the coordination numbers extracted from EXAFS data together with Cowley’s short-range parameter (see 
 <xref rid="sec5.5.2" ref-type="other">Section 
  <xref rid="sec5.5.2" ref-type="other">5.5.2</xref>
 </xref>) were used to confirm the random distribution of the constituent metals. In turn, electrochemically prepared Pd–Au core–shell NPs were studied by Price et al. via

 </sup> The NPs were prepared by two electrochemical methods: (i) conventional Cu underpotential deposition (UPD) followed by a replacement of Cu with Pd, and (ii) by a Cu UPD-mediated process.

 </sup> While no significant dependency of the NP structure on the applied potential was observed, significantly larger mixing of Pd and Au in the NP surface layer was observed for the NPs prepared via the Cu-UPD-mediated process.

Hereafter, &#8220;time since burrowing ceased&#8221; will be referred to as &#8220;burrow age&#8221; for simplicity (i.e. at older burrows, burrowing would have ceased for a longer period than at fresh burrows). In the arid scrubland, data from abandoned and collapsed burrows were combined due to the small sample size for collapsed burrows. Although none of the burrows were occupied during sampling, it is possible that some of the fresh burrows were still sporadically used by medium-sized mammals.

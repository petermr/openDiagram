<p id="Par40">Two-dimensional electrophoresis allows differential distribution of many protein isotypes. After data redundancy removal, we found that 16 proteins were upregulated and 16 were downregulated in the H5N1-infected group compared with those in the H9N2-infected group. However, further validation of the subcellular localization of some proteins is needed. Among the identified mitochondrial proteins, 6 mitochondrial proteins were downregulated and 2 mitochondrial proteins were upregulated in the H5N1-infected group compared with those in the H9N2-infected group.</p>

Oils and fats have important roles in cooking, frying and salad dressings or in food formulations; they make an important contribution to our diet and our health. Omega-3 (&#969;<sub>3</sub>) fatty acids such as linolenic acid, and omega-6 (&#969;<sub>6</sub>) fatty acids such as linoleic acid, are essential fatty acids; thus, they must be supplied through foods. Today, most of the oils consumed in our daily diet such as corn, sunflower, rice bran and grape seed oils have a high amount of &#969;<sub>6</sub>fatty acids and therefore, lead to &#969;<sub>6</sub>:&#969;<sub>3</sub> ratio increases ranging from 8-12:1; however, this ratio should be 4:1.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>

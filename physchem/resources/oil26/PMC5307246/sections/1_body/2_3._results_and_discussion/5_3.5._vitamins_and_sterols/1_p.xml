<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Vitamin E includes four isomers (<italic>&#945;</italic>, <italic>&#946;</italic>, <italic>&#948;</italic>, and <italic>&#947;</italic>) of tocopherol and four isomers (<italic>&#945;</italic>, <italic>&#946;</italic>, <italic>&#948;</italic>, and <italic>&#947;</italic>) of tocotrienol. The contents of total and individual tocopherols and tocotrienols of<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>. The results revealed the presence of the three tocopherols (<italic>&#945;</italic>, <italic>&#948;</italic>, and <italic>&#947;</italic>). &#914;-Tocopherol and tocotrienols were not detected in the oil. Total amount of tocopherols was 578.60&#8201;mg/kg, which was similar to that reported for<italic> L. microcarpa</italic> and higher than that recorded in grapeseed oil (140.60&#8201;mg/kg), peanut oil (398.60&#8201;mg/kg), and olive oil (216.80&#8201;mg/kg) [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>&#947;</italic>-Tocopherol was the most abundant, with a value of 82% of the total tocopherol content, followed by <italic>&#945;</italic>-tocopherol (12%) and <italic>&#948;</italic>-tocopherol (6%). The antioxidant activity of tocopherols decreased in the order of <italic>&#947;</italic> &gt; <italic>&#948;</italic> &gt; <italic>&#945;</italic> &gt; <italic>&#946;</italic> [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The significant quantity of <italic>&#947;</italic>-tocopherols found in<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil could contribute to its high oxidative stability.</p>

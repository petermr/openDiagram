<p>P3 membranes were solubilized as described in the previous section and 200 µL of the detergent-solubilized supernatant was injected in a Superose 6 10/300 GL gel-filtration column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) Glycerol, 0.1 mg/mL DDM, 0.02 mg/mL CHS. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) experiments were performed in an ÄKTA
 <sup>TM</sup> purifier chromatography system (GE healthcare) with a fluorescence detector (FP-4025, JASCO) connected “in line” with the column. The excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorescence detector were set, respectively, to 460 and 520 nm. FSEC chromatograms were plotted using Plot2 software and data was normalized.

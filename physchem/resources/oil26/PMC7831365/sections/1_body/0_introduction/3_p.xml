<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It has been reported that <italic>ACPT</italic> was lower expressed in testicular cancer tissues compared to normal tissues and is regulated by steroid hormones (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Yousef et al., 2001</xref>). Besides, <italic>ACPT</italic> is also expressed in the brain and acts as a tyrosine phosphatase to modulate signals mediated by ErbB4 (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Fleisig, El-Husseini &amp; Vincent, 2004</xref>). But, it is interesting to note that <italic>ACPT</italic> is expressed in secretory-stage ameloblasts (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Seymen et al., 2016</xref>), which can induce odontoblasts differentiation, mineralization of dentin, and amelogenesis (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, there are some increasing evidences that homozygous missense variants of <italic>ACPT</italic> would lead to AI (e.g., c.226C&gt;T, p.Arg76Cys; c.746C4T, p.P249L) (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Seymen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2017a</xref>). These evidences suggested that <italic>ACPT</italic> play an important role in amelogenesis.</p>

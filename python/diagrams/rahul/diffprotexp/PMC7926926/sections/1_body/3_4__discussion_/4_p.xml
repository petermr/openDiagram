<p>The up-regulation of several DEPs emphasized a network of regulatory processes to cope with the Al stress in SL-inoculated masson pine. Furthermore, the expression patterns of genes governing some of the above-mentioned proteins also confirmed the positive regulatory roles of these proteins. Our results are consistent with the various studies reporting the involvement of these genes in abiotic stress responses conditions in different plants [

However, we also identified several proteins, including ABI3-interacting protein 2, Tyrosine-tRNA ligase, water deficit stress-inducible protein LP3-2, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 5, tripeptidyl-peptidase 2 isoform X1, and xyloglucan endotrans- glucosylase/hydrolase 1, which were down-regulated in LB-04 vs. LB-0. In contrast to our results, previous reports showed elevated expression of these proteins under abiotic stress conditions [

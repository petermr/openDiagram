The lipid content of pathogen is decreased after treating with MPE. The total lipid contents of <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> after incubation with MPE at MIC and MFC for 120 min were 120.1 &#177; 3.5 and 80.4 &#177; 4.6 mg/g dry weight, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of control (160.2 &#177; 3.8 mg/g dry weight).</p>

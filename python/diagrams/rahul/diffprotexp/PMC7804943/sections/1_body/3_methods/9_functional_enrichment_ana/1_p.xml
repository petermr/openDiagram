 </sup>. Genes enrichment sets were compared to a background of expressed genes. Structured controlled vocabularies from Gene Ontology, as well as information from the curated KEGG and Reactome databases were included in the analysis. Only functional categorizes with more than five members and fewer than 2000 members were included in the analysis. Significant terms were summarized using Enrichment Map

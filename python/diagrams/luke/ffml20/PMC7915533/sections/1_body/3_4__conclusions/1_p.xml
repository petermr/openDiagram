<p>Analysis of a sponge 
 <italic>Tedaniophorbas ceratosis</italic> collected from the Australian south Pacific coast led to the isolation of two highly fluorescent alkaloids, tedaniophorbasins A and B. Both possess skeletons that are novel. Tedaniophorbasin A possesses a novel 2-imino-1,3-dimethyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-1
 <italic>H</italic>-[1,4]thiazino[3,2-g]pteridin-4(6
 <italic>H</italic>)-one skeleton, while tedaniophorbasin B is the 2-oxo derivative of tedaniophorbasin A. Their structures were supported by comparison of experimental and DTF-calculated 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data. Both compounds were inactive at 40 ÂµM when tested for antiplasmodial, anticancer, and antitrypanosomal activity. This study highlights the fact that the south Pacific region contains marine genera that, to date, have not been investigated, and that these marine organisms hold the potential to contain novel chemistry. Futures studies of south Pacific marine organisms will undoubtedly lead to further discoveries of novel chemistry.

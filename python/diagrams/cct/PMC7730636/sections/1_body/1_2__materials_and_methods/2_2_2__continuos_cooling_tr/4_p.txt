0: Phase transformation studies were carried out using DIL805A/D dilatometer (TA Instruments, Milford, MA, USA), and the critical transformation points (temperatures) were determined according to [ 22, 23, 24].
1: The heating rate was 1 Cs 1 with holding time 30 min.
2: at an austenitizing temperature of 850 C. The cooling rate ranged from 100 Cs 1 to 0.01 Cs 1.
3: Cooling regimens used for construction the CCT diagram of AISI 4340 steel are shown in  Figure 2.

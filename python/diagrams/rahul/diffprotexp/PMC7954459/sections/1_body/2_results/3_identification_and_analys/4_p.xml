<p>Next, we analyzed features of miRNAs, including GC content and minimum free energy (MFE) that may determine their secondary structure. The GC content was about 30–40% in the identified miRNAs (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>b). A similar proportion of GC content was found in miRNAs detected from vegetative organs in chickpea (Jain et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Moreover, most of the predicted miRNAs showed low MFE, suggesting their high stability (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>c). About 21% of miRNAs identified in this study were found to be conserved between seed stages and vegetative tissues/organs reported in previous studies (Jain et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Srivastava et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). A comparative analysis revealed that a small fraction (&lt;10%) of chickpea miRNAs were conserved in other plant species (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). The low level of conservation may be due to the adoption of stringent criteria for the identification of miRNAs according to the new guidelines (Axtell &amp; Meyers, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) in our study.

NAFLD is categorized into two main types including simple steatosis (fatty liver) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The former is usually considered as a benign condition, whereas the latter has severe complications such as inflammation, hepatocellular injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Today, NAFLD is one of the most popular chronic liver disorders, especially in developed countries, with a prevalence of 20%&#x02013;30%, which is estimated to be increased due to the unhealthy pattern of diet rich in high-fat and high-carbohydrate foods.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Intake of lipogenic sugars including fructose and sucrose, trans-fatty acids and saturated fats as well as insulin resistance is demonstrated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The current treatment approaches for the management of NAFLD include lifestyle modification, antioxidant therapy, oral antidiabetics, lipid-lowering agents, surgical interventions, and in the end stage of hepatic injury, liver transplantation; however, not all of the mentioned choices provide acceptable result and are not always well tolerated by patients in long-term use.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Medicinal plants have been widely used for different indications by people all over the world.

CDD causes less production of very LDL-C which results in TAG accumulation in liver tissue and provides a suitable model for the assessment of drugs in NAFLD.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, both AE and AO showed positive effects toward the reduction of weight gain compared with vehicle-treated group.

All treatment groups represented reduced serum levels of TC, LDL-C, and TAG and increased HDL-C level. As one of the treatment approaches for NAFLD are antihyperlipidemic agents, it could be concluded that AE and AO can protect fat accumulation in liver tissue through modulation of lipid profile.

In the present study, measurement of serum levels of oxidative damage biomarkers including FRAP, LPO, TTM, and MPO demonstrated that anise fruit extract as well as essential oil could improve antioxidant defense mechanisms. As a result, anise fruit is not only useful due to its ability to modify lipid profile but also represents observable <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant activity, thus has a dual action against the disease progression.</p><p>Histopathological investigations also confirmed less vacuolar degeneration and macrovesicular steatohepatitis in the tissue sections of animals treated with high doses of AE and AO. Hepatic enzymes including AST and ALT were increased in animals fed with CDD. Treatment with AE and AO as well as gold standard drug, simvastatin, significantly reversed this increase in comparison to vehicle-treated group. Jamshidzadeh <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that different extracts and essential oil of anise fruits have hepatoprotective activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Anise fruit decreased CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats as well as hepatoma cell line.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The main chemical compounds of essential oil were trans-anethole (89.24%), &#x003b3;-himachalene (2.89%), and methyl chavicol (2.72%). Samojlik <italic>et al</italic>. showed the major constituents of anise essential oil were trans-anethole (87.96%) followed by &#x003b3;-himachalene (3.17%), cis-isoeugenol (2.21%), and linalool (1.78%).[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In another study on chemical composition of essential oil, anethole accounted for 88.1% of identified constituents, followed by pseudo-iso-eugenyl-2-methyl butyrate (4.15%), and &#x003b3;-himachalene (4.15%).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Trans-anethole showed hepatoprotective activities in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice with reduction of serum ALT, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and interleukin 6 levels. Increased in nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), release of high-mobility group box-1 into the extracellular milieu, and the interactions between IRF-1 and histone acetyltransferase p300 after ischemia/reperfusion were attenuated by trans-anethole. Moreover, trans-anethole suppressed increases in toll-like receptor-4.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Using the animal model of CDD-induced fatty liver disease, the present study confirmed the traditional use of <italic>P. anisum</italic> extract and essential oil in NAFLD. This effect was demonstrated by the measurement of weight gain, lipid profile parameters, hepatic enzymes, and histopathological assessments of liver tissue. Further mechanistic studies as well as clinical trials are mandatory to prove the efficacy of the plant extract and essential oil as a treatment for NAFLD in human subjects.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study has been partially supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Grant No. 93-04-159-28029.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>

<p id="Par29">Paired-end, raw neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma RNA-seq data were downloaded from syn4939902. Sequencing lanes were merged, followed by alignment with STAR (v2.7.0f) to b37 (downloaded from the GATK resource bundle—

Alignment was performed using default parameters with the following modifications: -twopassMode Basic, -outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate, and -quantMode GeneCounts. Reverse-stranded gene counts were read into R (v3.6.1) using edgeR (v3.27.14), excluding sample 2-025 due to sample quality. Gene counts were restricted to known, protein coding genes and lincRNA. Samples were further filtered to genes that had greater than 1 count per million (CPM) in at least 3 samples. Libraries were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values method. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the prcomp function (v3.6.1) on the filtered log2 CPM and plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1).

0: Cerebral arterio venous malformations (AVMs) are an important cause for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and neurological morbidity in young adults [ 2].
1: The AVM nidus structures consist of abnormal blood vessels whose identity is distinct from normal vascular structures [ 15].
2: These lesions can occur in any of the four lobes of the brain, and patients with cerebral AVM present symptoms such as headache, seizures, and hemorrhage [ 10,  13].
3: The etiological factors for cerebral AVM development are not clearly understood.
4: Earlier, we have reported that cerebral AVM nidus structures have aberrant expression of genes involved in both early and late stages of vascular development and that nidus structure of AVM co-express artery, vein, and brain capillary markers [ 32].
5: Approximately 900 genes have been identified to be associated with the pathogenesis of cerebral AVM [ 22].
6: Deregulated genes in AVM are associated with various cellular pathways that include genes regulating endocrine hormones, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory factors, matrix metalloproteinases, and angiogenic factors [ 22].
7: It is unclear whether these genetic defects represent a primary cause for the disease or are a secondary response to disease development.
8: Also, lack of good animal models to demonstrate the features of cerebral AVMs is impeding to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms of AVM [ 14].

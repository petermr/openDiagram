 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the expression profiles of the two BAD-tagged versions of PcATP2, alone, or co-expressed with each of the three 
 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-encoded Cdc50 proteins. 
 <italic>S. cerevisie</italic> carries at least six different biotynilated proteins, and some of them are also detected in our western blots when using the Avidin HRP-conjugate probe (see control experiment in lane 9, and figure legend of 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for description)[
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, the position of the bands of the different 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> biotynitaled proteins did not overlay the ones of the BAD-fused PcATP2. PcATP2 displayed a slightly different electrophoretic mobility depending on the position of the BAD tag (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), previously observed in other P4-ATPases tagged as well with the BAD at either of the two extremities [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Also, BAD-PcATP2 displayed two electrophoretic bands, suggesting either a cleavage near the C-terminal end or two different electrophoretic mobilities of the same construct (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8). Western blot analysis also revealed that the three putative PcCdc50 proteins were also co-expressed with both BAD-PcATP2 and PcATP2-BAD (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, bottom panels). We observed that the intensity of the electrophoretic mobilities of BAD-PcATP2 are influenced by the presence of the PcCdc50 proteins since the lower (or fastest) band became practically the only one when co-expressed with PcCdc50A (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, lane 8). PcCdc50A displayed two electrophoretic mobilities, suggesting protein glycosylation events typical of Cdc50 proteins (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). Overall, when either BAD-PcATP2 or PcATP2-BAD were co-expressed with each of the PcCdc50 proteins neither the electrophoretic pattern nor the intensity of the PcATP2 bands changed substantially. We discontinued working with PcCdc50C because of its low detection yield compared with the other two Cdc50 subunits.

<p id="Par39">Then, NetworkAnalyst was used to screen the related chemicals for the 5 core genes. Meanwhile, the chemical-core gene network was drawn with the software of Cytoscape. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a, the interaction network includes 5 core genes and 300 chemicals. Moreover, we found that most chemicals were related to CCNB1 (degree score = 246), AURKA (degree score = 86), and KIF20A (degree score = 67) (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a), followed by ASPM (degree score = 63) and KIF23 (degree score = 52) via ranking the top 20 nodes in the network by cytoHubba. Furthermore, the top 15 chemicals screened by Cytoscape were found to be related with all five genes (Fig.

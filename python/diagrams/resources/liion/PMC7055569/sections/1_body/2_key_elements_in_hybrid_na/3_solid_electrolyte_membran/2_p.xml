<p>A solid electrolyte membrane separates the metallic Na compartment dipped in an organic electrolyte with the aqueous compartment to improve the safety in the hybrid Na–air cells. The solid electrolyte membrane should not only block the oxygen diffusion and promote the transport Na
 <sup>+</sup> cations, as found in polyelectrolyte membranes (e.g., Nafion); but additionally, blocks even the diffusion of water from one to the other compartment (which is not the case in Nafion). Thus, it would be fair to say that the solid electrolyte membrane is a very crucial component of the cell. In most of the studies related to hybrid Na–air battery, NASICON was used as solid electrolyte membrane to separate aqueous and nonaqueous compartments. The abbreviation NASICON arises as NA from sodium (Na), S from super, I from ionic, and CON from conductor; which typically refers to a family of solid ceramics with general formula Na

 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> NASICON was first synthesized by Hong
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> and Goodenough et al.[qv: 34g] in 1976. The transport of ions is caused by hopping of Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions among interstitial sites of the NASICON crystal lattice.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> The resulting Na
 <sup>+</sup> ion conductivity reaches on the order of 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>; which is comparable to liquid electrolytes. NASICON can be synthesized by different synthetic methods such as solid state chemical synthetic route, sol–gel route, hydrothermal method, combustion method, and spark plasma sintering methods.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> Generally, NASICON crystallizes in rhombohedral structure for all compositions except (1.8 ≤ 
 <italic>x</italic> ≤ 2.2) where it crystalizes in monoclinic polymorphs. The conductivity of NASICON is higher for monoclinic crystal lattice (
 <italic>x</italic> = 2). The performance of hybrid Na–air battery in terms of overpotential gap, power density, and cyclic stability will certainly depend on the stability and ionic conductivity of NASICON in alkaline and acidic medium. NASICON‐based materials are known to be stable in moist environment, however, they tend to form hydronium on the surface of NASICON by ion exchange when hot water is used.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> There is no direct study on the stability of NASICON in alkali electrolyte but after carefully inspecting the literature, NASICON appeared durable.

 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> The ceramic film showed no change or deterioration in morphology in 1

However, the authors did not carry out any spectroscopic study to investigate the change in crystal phase or chemical bonding. Later, Khan et al. carried out NASICON's stability test by performing its XRD before and after galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles and found no changes in phase of NASICON.

 <sc>m</sc> HCl) (Figure

 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> NASICON is a good choice for separator as solid electrolyte in hybrid Na–air cells, yet it has limitations for charging cells at higher current densities due to its limited ionic conductivity. Also, an interfacial layer can be formed between the organic electrolyte and NASICON which enhances the overall resistance of the electrolyte and total internal resistance of cell. To understand the details of the process associated with NASICON requires more in‐depth investigations; for that purpose, operando spectroscopic methods will give powerful insight.

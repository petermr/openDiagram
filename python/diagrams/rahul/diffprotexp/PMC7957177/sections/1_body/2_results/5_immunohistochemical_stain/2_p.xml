<p>To confirm the significance of the up‐regulated and down‐regulated genes, we used the IHC staining to determine the 4 top up‐regulated genes (CDKN2A, KRT17, SYCP2, NEFH) and the 4‐top down‐regulated genes (CRISP3, CRISP2, DSG1, PTG) for verification of protein expression, and Ki67 as control. All eight genes, the positive responses were not good as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="cam43799-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, only the repeatability of KRT17 and CRISP2 were good. These results suggested that KRT17 and CRISP2 may be used to differential different histological grades.

<p>Maxquant was used to process raw data files [
 <xref rid="B28-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Default settings were used unless otherwise specified. Briefly, peptide spectrum match and protein false discovery rate (FDR) were set to a minimum of one unique peptide for identification and 1%, respectively. Fixed modifications were set to carbamidomethyl for cysteine, and variable modifications were set to methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation. Matches between runs were enabled with a default match time window of 0.7 min and alignment window of 20 min. The MS/MS spectra were matched against the mouse Uniprot FASTA database with canonical and isoform sequences. Search results and TMT reporter ion intensities were exported as text files. Statistical analysis was performed with Perseus 1.6.0.7 (Max Planck Institute of biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) [
 <xref rid="B29-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and in-house R scripts (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.r-project.org/</uri>). Proteins identified by site, reverse, and potential contaminants were filtered in Perseus prior to further analysis. Proteins with missing values in any of the four D1 or four D2 biological replicates were filtered out before differential expression analysis.

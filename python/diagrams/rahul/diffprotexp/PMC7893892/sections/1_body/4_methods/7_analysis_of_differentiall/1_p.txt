0: The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped (FPKM) value was used to estimate the expression levels of transcripts (lncRNAs and mRNAs) [ 50].
1: For experiments with three biological replicates, the R package DEseq2 was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts after a negative binomial distribution [ 51].
2: LncRNAs and mRNAs with  P-value< 0.05 and a fold change (FC) > 2.0 were considered as differentially expression between two groups of data.

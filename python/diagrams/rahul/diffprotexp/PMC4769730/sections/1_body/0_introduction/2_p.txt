0: To date, the mechanism and the molecular basis responsible for structural, biochemical, and functional changes occurring in glaucomatous TM are poorly understood [ 26,  27].
1: Several studies have been performed to identify systemic and local biochemical risk factors and some novel protein/antibody profiles have been prospected as potential targets to counteract the degenerative effects in POAG, in addition to the IOP [ 3,  4,  28].
2: Recently, the protein microarray approach has highlighted, most resourceful than conventional approach, some candidates (biomarkers) for POAG, pertinent to routine diagnostic applications/monitoring of treatment efficacy or to target therapy [ 18,  29,  30].

    <bold>Additional file 1: Table S1.</bold> Differentially expressed transcripts in adalimumab good-responders between baseline (pre-treatment) and 3-months of adalimumab treatment. The annotation for each probe was retrieved from the Affymetrix array manifest [MacDonald JW (2017). pd.hta.2.0: Platform Design Info for Affymetrix HTA-2_0. R package version 3.12.2]. Transcripts with a positive fold-change exhibited increased expression at 3-months compared to baseline. Transcripts with a negative fold-change exhibited reduced expression at 3-months compared to baseline.

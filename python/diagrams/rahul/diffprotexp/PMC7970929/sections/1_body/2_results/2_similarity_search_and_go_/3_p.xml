<p id="Par16">KAAS server was used for functional annotation of these 18,953 unique transcripts and anthocyanin biosynthesis (1 transcript) was seen as the least in terms of the number of homologous transcripts (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The most abundant transcripts were observed for pathways of protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (900 transcripts) and ribosome (981 transcripts). KEGG enrichment for most common terms has been shown in Supplementary file

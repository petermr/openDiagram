<p>To further explore the differences of differential metabolites of ASCs among the three adipose deposits, we analyzed the differential metabolites of SASCs vs. EASCs and SASCs vs. PASCs and found that compared with SASCs, there were 143 common differential metabolites between EASCs and PASCs (FC &gt;2.0, FDR &lt;0.05) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Pathway analysis revealed that the unique differential metabolites in EASCs involved one carbon pool by folate, methane metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, porphyrin, and chlorophyll metabolism (

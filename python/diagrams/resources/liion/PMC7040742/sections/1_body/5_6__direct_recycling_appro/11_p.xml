<p>A pulsating voltage method for relithiation was developed by Zhu et al. [
 <xref rid="B220-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. The spent cobalt oxide was exposed to a very short (500 ns) high-voltage pulse at a frequency of 150 Hz in a 0.1 M LiOH aqueous solution. Upon pulsed electrical discharge, the suspended LCO underwent a structural change, which fixed cation disordering accumulated during cycling and supposedly improved Li
 <sup>+</sup> intercalation properties. The resulting LCO did not reach a satisfactory electrochemical discharge capacity, at 127 mAh/g at 0.2 C [

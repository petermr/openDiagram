0: As per our previously described protocol 23, the FASP-based method with 10-kD ultrafiltration centrifuge tubes was employed for protein digestion.
1: Briefly, the lysates were diluted using urea buffer (150 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 8 M urea).
2: The denatured proteins were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark.
3: After centrifugation, the proteins were washed two times using the urea buffer.
4: Subsequently, the proteins were digested overnight at 37 C with trypsin.
5: The resulting digests were collected by repeated centrifugation and washing.
6: The peptide solution was then dried in a Speed Vac.

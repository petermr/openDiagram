0: The study was carried out between July 2012 and September 2015 at Tswalu, a private nature reserve in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa (S 2714, E 2222).
1: The dominant vegetation type comprised Kalahari thornveld ( Acocks, 1988) and shrubby Kalahari dune bushveld on the plains ( Low and Rebelo, 1998).
2: The aardvark study site was dominated by Gordonia duneveld vegetation ( Tokura, 2016).

4: African wild dogs ( Lycaon pictus) were introduced in 2014.
5: Tswalu is situated within an area that is predicted to become hotter and drier under future climate change ( Engelbrecht et al., 2015), and already experiences low and highly variable rainfall, including sporadic droughts ( Thomas et al., 2007).
6: The majority of rain falls between December and April ( Davis et al., 2010;  Tokura, 2016).
7: The hot season in which air temperatures peak at 35C lasts from November to February, which overlaps with the period during which rainfall typically occurs.
8: The cold season in which air temperatures frequently drop below zero lasts from June to September and typically coincides with the driest period.

 <caption> ( A) Quasi-binary phase diagram for Al-Mg 2Si (adapted from [ 5]). ( B– D) DSC cooling curves for three different alloys for which the applied solution treatment resulted in an incomplete dissolution. ( E, F) DSC cooling curves for two different alloys for which the applied solution treatment resulted in complete dissolution. In ( D, F), the same alloy is considered, although cooling started from two different temperatures: 540 °C and 560 °C. The mass fractions of Mg and Si for the different alloys are stated. </caption>

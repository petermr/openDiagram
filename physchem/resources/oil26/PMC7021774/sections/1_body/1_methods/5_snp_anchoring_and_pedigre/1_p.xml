 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>) by BLASTn (Altschul et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1990</xref>). Where BLASTn hits of equal match were identified on multiple chromosomes, genetic map position (Gardner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) was used to assign hits to chromosomes. Wheat pedigree information was obtained from Fragley et al. (

<p>The obtained results show that heating from the initial martensite microstructure into an interctitical region is a preferred heat treatment for the 5% Mn steel, as it is much easier to retain austenite for the intercritically processed material as compared to the case of coiling or isothermal bainitic treatments. Results showed that intercritical annealing at 720 °C allowed partial stabilization of austenite, and still, some fresh martensite was detected on cooling at the final stage. On the other hand, intercritical annealing at 700 °C allows for such carbon enrichment in the newly formed austenite that it is retained at room temperature with no sign of martensitic transformation. It has been also shown that prolonging the annealing time, for as long as 5 h, does not influence the thermal stability of retained austenite, and the only difference found with extended time is a mild effect on the size of the resulting microstructure. </p>

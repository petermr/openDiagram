0: The  in vitro antibacterial activity of the tested sample was carried out by disc diffusion method.
1: The inoculum suspension containing 1  10 7 CFU/mL of bacteria was spread on nutrient agar medium uniformly.
2: The sample was dissolved and then loaded on 6 mm sterile individual discs.
3: The loaded discs were placed on the surface of medium and the diameter of zone of inhibition (ZOI) was measured after 24 h of incubation at 37 C. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericide concentration (MBC) of sample were determined according to the method as previously described 39.

0: To measure steady-state gene expression levels, Salmon 31 was used to measure transcript abundance, based on mouse (mm10) GENCODE whole transcript annotations 69.
1: Gene-level abundance was then computed by adding the estimated read counts mapping to each transcript isoform using the R package tximport 70.
2: To perform differential gene expression analysis between pairs of neuronal subtypes, DESeq2 37 was applied on the gene-level counts estimated from above.
3: Differentially expressed genes are defined as those with a  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$|{\mathrm{log}}_2\,\phi | \, > \, 1$$\end{document}log2>1 and FDR < 0.05, where  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\phi$$\end{document} is the fold change between a pair of subtypes.

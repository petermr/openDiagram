BioSample = SAMD00061094, BioProject = PRJNA244; BioSample = SAMN10102199, BioProject = PRJNA492407) and gene expression levels were calculated for each sample.

 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed using BLAST by searching the KEGG database (

 <italic>P</italic>-value less than 0.05 were regarded as significant. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the DEGs was performed using Multi Experiment Viewer (

<p>Based on scan data, the aardvarks spent significantly more time investigating the foraging enrichment (mean ± SE: 19.14 ± 2.24% of time) compared to the exploring enrichment (2.60 ± 0.31% of time;

Foraging enrichment was used the most during PM observations (55.31 ± 7.08% of time) compared to exploring enrichment (4.58 ± 1.02% of time). During MID observations, use of enrichment was similar between the two enrichment goals (foraging: 1.56 ± 0.57% of time; exploring: 1.56 ± 0.06% of time), but during AM observations, exploring (1.65 ± 0.63% of time) was used more than the foraging (0.55 ± 0.29% of time) enrichment. Rates of enrichment use followed a similar pattern. Time spent using and event counts for using the individual items also varied significantly among the three time periods (F

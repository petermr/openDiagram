  <p>Quality control of RNA sequencing profiles. A - fastQC per base quality score for sample TC76. The plot was drawn using fastQC software. B - fastQC per sequence quality score for sample TC76. The plot was drawn using fastQC software. C - plot for principal component analysis in normalized gene expression space (lg(RPM)) for all RNA sequencing profiles investigated. The plot was drawn using graphics package in R language. D - hierarchical clustering of all RNA sequencing profiles based on Euclidian distance in normalized gene expression space (lg(RPM)). The plot was drawn using pheatmap package in R, clustering algorithm “ward.d2”.</p>

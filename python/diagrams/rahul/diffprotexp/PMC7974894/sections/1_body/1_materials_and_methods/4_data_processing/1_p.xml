<p>To identify the differently expressed genes (DEGs) between tongue normal and tumor tissue, we used the negative binomial distribution method. The Limma package (

The Limma package was based on the negative binomial distribution. It fits a generalized linear model for each gene and uses empirical Bayes shrinkage for dispersion and fold-change estimation. All raw data was preprocessed by Limma package and excluded genes with an average count value less than 1. In addition, we also used Limma package to identify the differently expressed RBPs (DeRBPs) in view of |log2 fold change (FC)|â‰¥1 and false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.05.

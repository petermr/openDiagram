<p>APA is an important molecular mechanism with regard to both the evolution of gene regulation and physiological traits. On a long-term evolutionary scale, both 3' UTR length and the proportion of genes exhibiting APA have scaled with genome size and complexity. The expansion of APA is believed to have introduced biological complexity independent of an increase in the number of distinct genes (

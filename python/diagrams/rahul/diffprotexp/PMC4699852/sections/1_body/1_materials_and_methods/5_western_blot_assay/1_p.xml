<p>During the course of differentiation, MSC cultures were sampled for the assay of cellular signaling proteins. A western blot assay of ERK (ERK1+ERK2), phosphorylated ERK, TrkB, β-actin, and phosphorylated CREB was performed using the standard protocol. Developed films were scanned and quantitative analysis was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA). The proportion of phosphorylated protein to total protein or the proportion of protein of interest to β-actin was normalized to the undifferentiated group. The antibodies mouse monoclonal to β-actin, rabbit polyclonal to TrkB, rabbit polyclonal to mouse, and goat polyclonal to rabbit were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Rabbit anti-CREB phosphospecific antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1&amp;2 phosphospecific antibody, and mouse anti-MAP kinase (ERK1+ERK2) antibody were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primary antibodies of ERK, phosphorylated ERK, TrkB, β-actin, and phosphorylated CREB were used at 1/500, 1/1500, 1/400, 1/5000, and 1/1500 dilutions, respectively. Two secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HR and rabbit polyclonal to mouse IgG-HRP, were used at 1/5000 dilutions.</p>

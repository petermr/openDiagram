<p id="Par12">We also found that several SNPs of the gene encoding DRD2 and CaN were associated with DARPP-32 or CaN protein expression in postmortem brains. In particular, the polymorphism of protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit gamma (
 <italic>PPP3CC</italic>), a gene encoding the CaN γ-catalytic subunit, was previously found to be relevant to schizophrenia. Genetic studies revealed a significant association between genetic variations of

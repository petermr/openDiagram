<p>Following the review request, we quantified Ki67+ cells and performed new SOX2 IHC. The revised results are consistent with reduced progenitor cell findings we reported in the initial submission, with the new data improving the strength and rigor of this analysis. Specifically, we found significantly reduced Ki67+ cell counts and reduced VZ-specific Sox2
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts in in MIA-exposed group. The new data has been incorporated into Figure 4 and is described in the revised text below:

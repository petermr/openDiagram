<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In endothelium-intact aorta (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), steady tension was evoked by Phen (1&#160;&#956;M), then, AcEO (10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>&#8211;10<sup>&#8722;1</sup> mg/ml) was cumulatively added to the Krebs solution. The contribution of endothelium, muscarinic receptor and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM complex formation in the vasorelaxation-induced effect was checked out by the application of experiments described by Monteiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Denuded rings (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) were obtained by gentile rubbing of the lumen of aorta with a plier curved end, and the denudation was verified by the absence of any degree of relaxation caused by carbachol (10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> M), then, AcEO (10-4&#8211;10-1&#160;mg/ml) was cumulatively added. In another set of experiments, endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1&#160;&#956;M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Calmodulin binding to NOS blocker calmidazolium chloride (10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>&#956;M; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) for 20&#160;min prior the contraction with Phen (1&#160;&#956;M), then, the cumulative concentration&#8211;response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.</p>

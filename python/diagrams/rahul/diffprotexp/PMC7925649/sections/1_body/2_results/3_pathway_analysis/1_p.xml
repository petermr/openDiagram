<p id="Par25">Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed on each of the four different comparisons in order to gain insight into the pathways and mechanisms which may regulate LCOS. When comparing pre-operative samples between patients who developed LCOS versus patients who did not (No-LCOS), there was a down regulation of genes controlling inflammatory pathways (IL signaling, PDGF, NOTCH1, NGF, GPCR) and an up-regulation of genes controlling metabolic pathways (heme metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, protein metabolism including amino acid and derivatives, fatty acid metabolism, TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport chain). This relationship is reversed in post-operative samples comparing gene profiles in patients who develop LCOS vs those who do not. Specifically, there was an up-regulation in genes controlling inflammatory pathways and a downregulation of genes controlling metabolic pathways (Fig.Â

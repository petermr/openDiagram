0: We analyzed the network of interactions between proteins by using the STRING and Cytoscape software.
1: The STRING database is a meta resource, including both physical and functional interactions ( Jensen et al., 2009).
2: STRING can be reached at  http://string-db.org/.
3: The minimum required interaction score is set to medium confidence and select all active interaction sources.
4: Cytoscape is a public software that can integrate models of biomolecular interaction networks ( Shannon et al., 2003).

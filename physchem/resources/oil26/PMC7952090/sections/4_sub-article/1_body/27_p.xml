<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As we note in section &#8220;Pervasive duplication of tumor suppressor genes in Afrotheria,&#8221; 17.8% (10/56) of the pathways that were enriched in manatee (1.11-fold IBM, 0.89-log2 RICR) are related to tumor suppression. Manatee also was enriched cancer pathway percentages above background with respect to its gene set sizes, i.e., expected enrichments based on random sampling of small gene sets (shown in Figure 3B). Thus, manatee shows the expected patterns of tumor suppressor gene duplication during the evolution of larger body sizes. In addition, in the recently-added text regarding manual curations in response to Point 1, we highlight how some of the genes in Figure 4C are also highly conserved in Manatee in addition to Elephant.</p>

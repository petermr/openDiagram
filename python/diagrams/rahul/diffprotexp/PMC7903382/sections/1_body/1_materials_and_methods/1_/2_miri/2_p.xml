<p>In the model group, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated 2-mm below the left atrial appendage for 30 min and then reperfused for 2 h, while sutures were placed without LAD ligation in control operations. The reperfused rats were considered as the animal model of MIRI. Sham-operated age-matched rats served as controls. During the experiment, the electrocardiogram (ECG) of animals was monitored using a electrocardiogram machine (model no. ECG-2303B; Guangzhou Sanrui Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.) at the following time points: Before the operation, ischemia for 0, 15 and 30 min, reperfusion for 0 min, 30 min and 2 h. After reperfusion for 2 h, 150 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital via intraperitoneal injection was used for euthanasia and the confirmation of euthanasia was decapitation. Then, the hearts were collected for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and Masson staining. At the end of reperfusion, the rats were deeply anesthetized, blood (~1 ml) samples were collected from the aorta for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) detection before euthanasia.</p>

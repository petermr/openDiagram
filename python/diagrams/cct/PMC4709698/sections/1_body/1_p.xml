<p>Similarly, the glass-forming ability (GFA) of the glassy matrices of Zr/Ti-based BMGCs is often also limited and the critical casting thicknesses are known to be generally below 20 mm

Therefore, developing novel BMGCs comprising a glassy matrix with an exceptional high GFA is needed from a practical point of view and, simultaneously, a more advanced and detailed understanding of the solidification process in these particular BMGCs is required in order to produce novel BMGCs with custom-made microstructures.

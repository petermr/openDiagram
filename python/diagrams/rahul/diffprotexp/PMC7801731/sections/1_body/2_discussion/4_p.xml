 <italic>A. japonicus</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> and our data revealed no parallelism. All genes in up-regulated and down-regulated lists were different. Additional disparity was found in 
 <italic>E. fraudatrix</italic> study. Although there are some differences in the evisceration and regeneration process of this species that might explain the differential gene expression, its regeneration process also involves dedifferentiation of cells within the mesenteric tissue, thus a certain degree of similarity would have been expected. Nonetheless, DETF identified in 
 <italic>E. fraudatrix</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> were not found in our study, or if present, their differential expression showed no correlation. Examples of this expression discrepancy: EGR1, TCF24 and SNAI2, upregulated in 
 <italic>E. fraudatrix</italic>, downregulated in 
 <italic>H. glaberrima</italic>.

  <p>Validation of proteins expressed in pooled fibroblast samples of healthy controls, and in fibroblasts from patients with Parkinson's disease carrying 
   <italic>GBA</italic> and 
   <italic>PARK2</italic> variants. (A) Representative western blots of ANXA2, RPL18 and COL1A1 in the GBA group. (B) Representative western blots of TUBB, COL1A1 and ANXA2 in the PARK2 group. ACTB was used for normalization of protein loading in each sample. (C and D) Relative ratios of protein expression levels obtained from western blot and label-free quantitative proteomic analyses. All protein levels were normalized to those of the pooled healthy control fibroblasts. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of at least two independent experiments. 
   <sup>*</sup>P&lt;0.05, 
   <sup>**</sup>P&lt;0.01 vs. control. PD, Parkinson's disease; GBA, acid-β glucosidase; PARK2, parkin; WB, western blot; label-free, label free quantitative proteomics.

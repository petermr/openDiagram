<p>For the hydrogel containing κ-carrageenan (PC12K), in comparison with PC12 (containing ι-carrageenan) the swelling degrees are 10–15% higher. The increase in swelling rates could be due to a looser packing of the macromolecular PVA:CAR assembly (κ-carrageenan has only one sulfate group per repeating unit, thus presenting a lower susceptibility for inter- and intramolecular interactions, i.e., lower gel contents, coupled with a lower crosslinking density ν and mesh size ξ, as seen in

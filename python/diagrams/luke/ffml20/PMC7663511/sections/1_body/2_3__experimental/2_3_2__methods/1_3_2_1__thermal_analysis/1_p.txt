0: The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of pure DOX was recorded using Netzsch DSC 204 F1 Phoenix in the temperature range 20600 C and heating rate of 5 deg/min.
1: The thermogravimetric analysis experiments were carried out in non-oxidizing (100% nitrogen) or oxidizing (5% oxygen, 95% nitrogen) atmosphere at the heating rate of 10 deg/min using TA Instruments Q50.
2: The temperature range of the experiments was 25800C for the nitrogen atmosphere and 25900 C for the oxidizing atmosphere.

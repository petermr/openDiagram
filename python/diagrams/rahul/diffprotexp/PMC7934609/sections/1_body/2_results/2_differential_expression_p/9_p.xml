<p>Oncosphere vs. protoscolex: 346 differentially expressed proteins were characterized, of which 167 are up-regulated and 179 are down-regulated. Metabolic pathways showed that proteins are involved in pathways including metabolic, dilated cardiomyopathy, focal adhesion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and phagosome (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> represents partial significant differential expression proteins, which were putative HSP20 related protein, actin-binding and Severin family group-like protein, and serine protease inhibitor. Following GO analysis, partial representative GO terms of differentially expressed proteins were assigned as “oxidoreductase activity” and “structural molecule activity” (

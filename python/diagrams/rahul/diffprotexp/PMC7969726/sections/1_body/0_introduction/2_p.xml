<p>Post-transcriptional regulation is a common and vital regulatory mechanism that contributes to the diversity of gene expression. Owing to the rapid development of next-generation RNA sequencing, various post-transcriptional alterations in RNA processing have been discovered. In eukaryotic cells, the maturation of primary messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) involves 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) modification, removal of introns by splicing, and 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA). Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a general and evolutionarily conserved mechanism of transcriptional modification that involves endonucleolytic cleavage and addition of a polyadenosine tail of 200–250 nucleotides that generates different lengths of the 3′UTR from a single gene (

Instead of affecting the protein-coding region, the 3′ UTR region contains many recognition elements for microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that affect the subcellular localization, intracellular trafficking, degradation, and translation rate of the transcripts in different cellular contexts (

<p>Additionally, another study with metastatic melanoma cells showed that metastatic melanoma cells initiated the disruption of endothelial cell–cell junctions and promoted the formation of intercellular gaps in endothelial monolayers in as few as 10 min of direct coculture. In contrast, non-metastatic melanoma cells do not disrupt the endothelium after direct contact for longer periods of time. A major difference between metastatic and non-metastatic melanoma cells is the ability of the former to interact with the endothelium via the secretion of cytokines and receptor–ligand interactions, which can mediate transendothelial migration (

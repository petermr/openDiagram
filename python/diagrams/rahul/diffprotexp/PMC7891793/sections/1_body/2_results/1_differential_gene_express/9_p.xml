<p>KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed 4 pathways significantly enriched when only differentially expressed genes were used as an input data. Two pathways relevant to this study are “primary immunodeficiency” and “complement and coagulation cascades.” Genes ADA and CD8A are associated with the primary immunodeficiency and both had reduced expression in lesions of the lung. Complement and coagulation cascades included the following differentially expressed genes: C1QA, C1QB, CR2, PROS1. All these genes had significantly lower levels of expression in lung tissue with lesions.</p>

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Counts of initiating affiliative interactions were not significantly related to the time in the study (F<sub>1,219</sub> = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.857) or the total amount of time an aardvark used enrichment (F<sub>1,219</sub> = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> = 0.92). However, the stated goal of the enrichment provided significantly influenced the counts of affiliative interactions initiated, with 0.30 &#177; 0.09 affiliative interactions per 20 min with exploring enrichment and 0.18 &#177; 0.04 affiliative interactions per 20 min with foraging enrichment (F<sub>1,221</sub> = 12.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There was also an overall effect that with higher counts of enrichment events, the higher the level of affiliative interactions (F<sub>1,221</sub> = 11.68, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.10]). The initiation of agonistic interactions was not related to the stated goal of the enrichment (F<sub>1,45</sub> = 1.22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.27), time in the study (F<sub>1,220</sub> = 2.47, <italic>p</italic> = 0.12), or count of enrichment events (F<sub>1,219</sub> = 1.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29). However, total time engaged with enrichment was related to initiating agonistic interactions (F<sub>1,220</sub> = 7.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, exp(<italic>b</italic>) = 0.99, 95% CI [0.99, 1.00]). The more time that aardvarks spent with enrichment, the fewer agonistic interactions were observed, although the effect was relatively minor based on the coefficient estimates.</p>

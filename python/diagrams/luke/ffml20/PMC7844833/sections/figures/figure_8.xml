  <p>Zn K-edge EXAFS data fitting for a Zn foil using a conventional approach and RMC simulations. Experimental EXAFS and model spectra extracted following both approaches are compared in panel a, while the Zn–Zn RDFs obtained by both approaches are shown in panel b. Despite the fact that conventional EXAFS fitting provides almost as good description of the 1st coordination shell contribution as advanced RMC simulations, the number of nearest neighbors (the area under the 1st RDF peak) is underestimated by the conventional approach by ∼50%. In addition to providing a more accurate RDF, the RMC analysis allows also fitting contributions of more distant coordination shells. Experimental data and RMC simulations taken from ref (

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Increased attention on environmental enrichment is part of a broader shift towards emphasizing animal welfare in zoos and aquariums. Enrichment has been defined as &#8220;a process for improving or enhancing zoo animal environments and care within the context of their inhabitants&#8217; behavioral biology and natural history&#8221; [<xref rid="B7-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the past, enrichment was mainly item based and focused on five to eight broad categories (e.g., feeding, tactile, olfactory) with the goal of providing enrichment from every category [<xref rid="B8-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although an item-based system of enrichment provides animals with events of varying degrees of stimulation, there can be a lack of understanding as to whether these events are functionally significant to the animal in question [<xref rid="B10-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mellen and MacPhee [<xref rid="B12-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] proposed that zoos and aquariums should instead develop goal-based enrichment frameworks that promote species-appropriate behaviors and mitigate undesirable behaviors with the objective of improving an animal&#8217;s welfare. </p>

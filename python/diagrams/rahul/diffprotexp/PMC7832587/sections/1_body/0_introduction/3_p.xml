<p>Most P4-ATPases form heterodimeric complexes with members of the Cdc50/LEM3 protein family, and this association is essential for trafficking of the P4-ATPase/Cdc50 complex [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and for activity [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The recent Cryo-EM structures of four P4-ATPases in complex with their respective Cdc50 subunits have revealed the structural basis of P4-ATPase/Cdc50 association [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23–28</xref>] 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes three putative Cdc50 proteins (annotated as Cdc50A, Cdc50B and Cdc50C) also well conserved in 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. Gene-disruption of either of these putative Cdc50 proteins affects parasite’s progression in the blod stages [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A recent study in 
 <italic>P. yoelii</italic> has shown that Cdc50A interacts and stabilizes the GCβ/Cdc50A complex, mandatory for the gliding motility and midgut traversal of the ookinetes in the mosquito vector and, consequently, for parasite’s transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Also, its related Cdc50A homolog in 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is mandatory for bringing its GCβ partner to the plasma membrane prior cellular egression [

0: For each individual sample measurement, a corresponding baseline measurement needs to be performed [ 75, 113, 121], and this measurement should be made promptly.
1: This is particularly true for power-compensated devices, as their baseline behaviour drifts more strongly with time [ 126] than that of heat flow calorimeters.

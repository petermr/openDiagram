<p id="Par22">Long cycling experiments at C/10, C/2, 1 C, or 2 C rates are also recorded after several cycles of formation at different C rates for PTCDA/Li, graphite/Li, LTO/Li, LFP/LTO, LFP/graphite, and PTCDA/graphite batteries. The prelithiation of the PTCDA cathode is performed in a coin cell with a lithium anode by discharging at C/24 from the OCP to 1.5 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. It is followed by a chronoamperometry experiment where a constant potential of 1.5 V is maintained for 3 h. The coin cell is thereafter disassembled, and the prelithiated PTCDA cathode is recovered to be assembled with a graphite anode.

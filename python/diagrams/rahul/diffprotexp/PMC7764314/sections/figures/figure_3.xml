  <p>Methods for differential co-expression. Left: two conditions are compared. Right: with “global network” approaches, the overall differential network is built; “module-based” methods identify groups of differentially connected nodes; the “single-gene” approach searches for pairs of genes changing connections (differential edges) or single genes changing connectivity within the network (differential hubs).</p>

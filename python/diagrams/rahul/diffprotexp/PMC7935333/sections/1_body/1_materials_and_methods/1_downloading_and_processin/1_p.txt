0: Microarray datasets (GSE27447, 13 GSE39004, 14 GSE43358 15 and GSE45827 16) were downloaded from GEO (URL:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) database for differential expression analysis.
1: The inclusion criteria for the microarray datasets were as follows: (a) samples containing TNBC and non-TNBC tissues, (b) primary tumors with no adjuvant treatment, (c) the total RNA samples for transcriptome testing, (d) expression profiling by the array as the study type, and (e) Homo sapiens as the organism.
2: The probe names were annotated to Entrez ID according to the corresponding GEO platform files.
3: Detailed information of the four microarray datasets is shown in  Supplementary Table 1.

<p>The optimization of interface between cathode and SCE is another important research hotspot for the practical application of the all‐solid‐state lithium battery.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">94</xref> Similar to the interface at the anode side, solid–solid contact exists between cathode materials and solid electrolyte, which leads to large interfacial impedance. Besides, since the cathode is low ion‐electron‐conducting continuum, constructing mixed conducting network in cathode is quite significant to achieve high electrochemical performance of all‐solid‐state lithium battery, especially at a high cathode material loading.

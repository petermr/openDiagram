0: Differentially expressed genes with a logFC magnitude difference > 0.35 were grouped together by treatment based on temporal expression patterns (upregulated, downregulated or no change) for the two treatment durations (6 and 12 h).
1: There were a total of 8 groups within each DCVC concentration: consistent responders (up  up and down  down) temporary responders (up  down, and down  up) early responders (down  no change and up  no change), late responders (no change  up and no change  down.
2: Groups that contained > 100 genes were tested for enrichment on the Enrichr platform (RRID: SCR_001575) (Chen et al.
3: 2013; Kuleshov et al.
4: 2016) for transcription factors (TRRUST) (Han et al.
5: 2018) and histone modifications (ENCODE-2015) (Davis et al.
6: 2018; Encode Project Consortium  2012).

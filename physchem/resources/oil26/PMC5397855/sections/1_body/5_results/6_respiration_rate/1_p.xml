<p>The respiration rate (μL of CO
 <sub>2</sub> h
 <sup>−1</sup>/insect) of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> was significantly different for garlic essential oil and compounds with concentrations estimated for the LC
 <sub>90</sub> values in larva (F
 <sub>3,71</sub> = 6.84, P &lt; 0.001), pupa (F
 <sub>3,71</sub> = 44.35, P &lt; 0.001), and adult (F
 <sub>3,71</sub> = 10.45, P &lt; 0.001). Respiration rate observed between 1 and 3 h were different in larva (F
 <sub>2,71</sub> = 4.95, P &lt; 0.001), pupa (F
 <sub>2,71</sub> = 12.75, P &lt; 0.001), and adult (F
 <sub>2,71</sub> = 58.23, P &lt; 0.001). The interaction treatments and time in was different in larva (F
 <sub>3,71</sub> = 10.45, P &lt; 0.001), but was not different in pupa (F
 <sub>3,71</sub> = 0.15, P = 0.932) and adult (F
 <sub>3,71</sub> = 3.19, P = 0.041). In general, garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl sulfide reduced the respiration rate of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> at 1 and 3 h after exposure (

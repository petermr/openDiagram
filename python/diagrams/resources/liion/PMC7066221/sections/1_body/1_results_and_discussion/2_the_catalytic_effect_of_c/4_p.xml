<p id="p0105">For SS electrode, with the onset voltage at ∼1.85 V, an oxidation peak centered at ∼2.05 V was observed (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Without any Mn compound on the original electrode, this process can be attributed to the oxidation of the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte. After scanning to 2.3 V, the electrode (denoted as ▪ in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B–4D) was collected and characterized with XPS. The Mn 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> profile of the sample indicates that the deposited Mn compound was mainly in high valent states of +3 and +4 (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). For the SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> electrode, two additional peaks centered at ∼1.65 V and ∼1.80 V were identified, which could be ascribed to the oxidation of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte and the further oxidation of Mn compound (e.g., from +3 to +4) on the solid electrode (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). The Mn 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> profile (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C) of the SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> electrode after scanning to 1.85 V (denoted as ★) shows that the chemical state of the deposited Mn compound was very similar to those of SS and SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> after scanning to 2.3 V (denoted as ▪ and ▲). XRD profiles of the SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> after scanning to 1.85 and 2.3 V (denoted as ★ and ▲) indicate that their phase strutures are similar to those of the layered δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S11</xref>). As presented in the digital photographs (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D), the major color and texture changes of the SS electrode and SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> electrode before and after the LSV scan to a certain voltage also provide visual support for the deposition of the Mn compound.

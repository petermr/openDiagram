 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/Li half-cell from the third to tenth cycle in the precycle stage at 0.1 C. It can be seen that after 10 cycles of precycling, the interface of the electrode is gradually stable. In particular, the discharge curve of the 4.7 V plateau is highly coincident, which indicates that the battery is stable, and the next step of thermodynamic parameter measurements can be carried out. It can be seen from the figure that the discharge capacity of the 4.7 V high-voltage plateau is about 115 mA h g
 <sup>â€“1</sup>, accounting for 80% of the total discharge capacity, which is also the focus of this paper (compared with a 4 V slope stage).

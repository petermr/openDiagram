<p>To discover the glycosylation status of STCH, lysates from HEK cells overexpressing GFP-STCH were treated with Endo H and PNGase. With this regard, it is worth mentioning that Endo H digestion provides an additional level of specificity in the analysis of Man-6-phosphorylation sites. Indeed, previous studies reported that Man-6-phosphorylation prevents further carbohydrate processing to Endo H resistant structures, and thus the vast majority of Man-6-P-containing glycans are Endo H-sensitive [

 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In contrast, PNGase F cleaves all N-linked oligosaccharides including complex type sugars that do not contain Man-6-P. Consequently, we anticipated that the major band detected around 94 kDa, corresponding to STCH (60 kDa) tagged with GFP (30 kDa) represents the Man-6 phosphorylated form of STCH and therefore should be Endo H sensitive. Importantly, as shown in

 <italic>,</italic> the band at 94 kDa (STCH plus GFP) was indeed sensitive to both Endo H and PNGase which is in line with the presence of STCH in the ER and/or its expression as a Man-6 phosphorylated glycoprotein. To confirm these findings, we checked also the glycosylation profile of endogenously expressed STCH in HEK cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>B (
 <bold>lower panel</bold>) the detected band at 60 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of STCH, was also sensitive to Endo H, which is, again, in agreement with the expression of STCH as an ER-resident protein and/or its processing in the cis-Golgi-network to become Man-6 phosphorylated.

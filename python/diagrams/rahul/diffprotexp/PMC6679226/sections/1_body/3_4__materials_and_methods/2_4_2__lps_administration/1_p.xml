<p>For I.T. instillation of LPS (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O111:B4; List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA, USA), mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (150/10 mg/kg) and intubated with a 22G catheter (EXEL International, Los Angeles, CA, USA) using the Biolite mouse intubation kit (BioTex, Houston, TX, USA). LPS reconstituted in sterile saline at 0.05 mg/mL was administered into the lungs through the 22G catheter at a final dosage of 0.1 mg/kg. For I.P. administration, LPS at 1 mg/mL in sterile saline was injected I.P. to achieve a final dosage of 5 mg/kg (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). Mice receiving vehicle (sterile saline) alone I.T. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) or I.P. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were used as the controls. In addition, another cohort of mice was treated with I.P. saline (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3, 48 h) or I.P. LPS (5 mg/kg, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) and sacrificed at different time points following treatment (24, 48 and 72 h, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 per time point).

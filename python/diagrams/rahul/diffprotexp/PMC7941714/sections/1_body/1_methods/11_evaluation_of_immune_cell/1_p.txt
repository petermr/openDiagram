0: Normalized gene expression data were uploaded to TIMER2.0 ( http://timer.cistrome.org/) [ 22], a website that provides comprehensive evaluation and analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, to estimate the relative abundance of 22 immune cell types based on the CIBERSORT algorithm.
1: To evaluate the correlation between lncRNA and immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, CRC samples from the TCGA database were divided into high and low lncRNA expression groups.
2: The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to compare the differences in immune cell infiltration between the high and low lncRNA expression groups.

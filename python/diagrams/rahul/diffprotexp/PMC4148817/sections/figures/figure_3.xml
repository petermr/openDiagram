 <caption>
  <p>Venn diagram illustrating common identities of the proteins altered in response to 24 h CNT exposure. Overlaps of identical significantly altered protein expressions after exposure to two different concentrations (10 Î¼g/mL, 100 ng/mL) of either SWCNT or MWCNT are indicated by the numbers inside each of the different compartments.</p>

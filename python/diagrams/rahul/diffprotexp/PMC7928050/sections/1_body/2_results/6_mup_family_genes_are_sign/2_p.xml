<p>Mups are proteins mostly found in rodentsâ€™ urine that a transcribed in a sex-dependent way. Literature describes behavioural and pheromone effects of these proteins. Moreover, they have been associated to energy metabolism and glucose homoeostasis in rodents. In humans close functional or sequence homologs have not been found. Members of the lipocalin family in humans however, are closely related to the mup in mice[

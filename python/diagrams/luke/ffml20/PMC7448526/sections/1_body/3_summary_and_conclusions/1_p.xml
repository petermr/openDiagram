<p>Our study of the methanol loading dependent methoxylation in zeolite H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al ≈ 25) pores under ambient conditions has enabled us to probe simultaneously methoxy species and reaction products. The assignments of infrared vibrational frequencies of methoxy and hydrogen bonded methanol have been supported by QM/MM simulations, which are consistent with the experimental DRIFTS data. Both experiment and simulation show that the methoxy bands at around 940, 1180, 2868–2876 and 2980–2973 cm

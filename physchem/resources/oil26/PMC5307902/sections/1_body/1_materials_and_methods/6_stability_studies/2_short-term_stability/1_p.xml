<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The short-term stability was evaluated by the micro-emultocrit technique (MET).[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The formulations were stored in closed containers at room temperature and were not homogenized before testing. The heparin-free capillary tubes were filled to 75% with each formulation and placed in a micro-centrifuge (Quimis, model Q10.500, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil) at 10,500 rpm for 10 min. The evaluation was realized at room temperature on the storage days 1 (D1), 30 (D30) and 90 (D90). After the centrifugation cycle, the IC calculations were performed in accordance with (equation 2). The short-term stability realized by the micro-emultocrit technique revealed not only, that the emulsion stability was highly influenced by the gravity acceleration, but also managed to predict influences provided in the HLB values. The Stability measurements were made in triplicate for each of the three days.</p>

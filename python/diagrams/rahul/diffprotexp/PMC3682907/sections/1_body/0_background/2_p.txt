0: Proteomic profiling has been successfully employed in the discovery and identification of biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases [ 23, 24] and in the analysis of mitochondrial proteomes in disease [ 12].
1: A number of studies utilizing proteomic approaches to investigate the differentially expressed proteins in MS and EAE have been reported [ 25- 33].
2: Proteomic profiling is a rapidly developing technology that may provide clues to the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of these diseases.
3: A variety of approaches are available for the analysis of proteomes, including 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and Differential Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) [ 34- 36], liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS), where label-free [ 37] as well as ICAT [ 38] and iTRAQ [ 39] labeling strategies are available for quantitative work and differential analysis [ 40], and Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-MS) [ 41- 44].

0: R package Seurat v3.1.2 was used for data pre-processing, and parameters were set and adjusted according to the features of captured transcripts in each sample.
1: Doublets were examined by DoubletFinder v2.0.3 with its default threshold value of 0.075  70.
2: Meanwhile, a double-check for every type was executed to discard cells with abnormal gene expression (for example, cells that were over-high in a number of unique detected genes, or cells within a single-cell type but with highly expressed specific marker genes in other cell types).
3: The four objects were integrated via Anchors (an integration strategy between single-cell datasets for identification of cell pairwise correspondences and constructing atlases into their shared space)  71; through normalization, datasets scaling, and test for optimal parameter combinations of dim.use and resolution, clustering was generated with a series commands of FindNeighbors, FindClusters, and RunUMAP.
4: In addition, the FindAllMarkers function was applied to identify marker genes in clusters, while gene differential expression analysis was performed with default parameters; the significantly expressed genes (DEGs) were defined with |avg_logFC| > 0.25 and p_val_adj< 0.01.

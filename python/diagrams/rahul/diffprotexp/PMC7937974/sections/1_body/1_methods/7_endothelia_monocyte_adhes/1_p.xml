<p>The HCAECs were seeded into 12-well plates, cultured to 100% fusion. THP-1 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM). The fluorescently labeled THP-1 (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well) cells were added into HCAECs, then incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Suspended THP-1 cells were removed with Hank's balanced salt solution with HEPES buffer (HHBS), cell lysis buffer was added, and scraped. The images were collected under a fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence intensity was measured at microplate reader excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 530 nm, respectively.

0: C57BL/6J strain mice, used only for single-cell sequencing, were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China).
1: For biochemical experiments, CD-1 mice were purchased from Jinan Pengyue Experimental Animal Breeding Co. Ltd (Jinan, China).
2: The mice were raised in cages with  ad-libitum food and water, a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle at a constant temperature (24 C) and humidity.
3: Females were mated with reproductive males around 17:00 h. The following morning, a vaginal plug indicated a successful mating, and the time was recorded as 0.5 dpc.
4: At 16.5 dpc, mice were treated with 40 g/kg body weight DEHP via oral gavage once a day.
5: Postnatal female pups (birth on 19.5 dpc) at 0 and 3 days (PD0 and PD3) were sacrificed for subsequent isolation of ovarian tissue.
6: In accordance with national guidelines, all the murine experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethical Committee of Qingdao Agricultural University.

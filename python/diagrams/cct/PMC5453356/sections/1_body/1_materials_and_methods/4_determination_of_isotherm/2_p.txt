0: The aim of this work is to create isothermal TTP diagrams based on  in situ DSC measurements.
1: Therefore, the characteristic time values of the precipitation reaction,  i.e., the start and end of the reaction, must be evaluated from heat flow curves like those shown in  Figure 4C.
2: However, due to the initial critical dead time mentioned above, as well as the flat course of the heat flow curves at the end of the analyzed time period, a well-adapted further evaluation is necessary.
3: Two options have been developed to characterize the precipitation kinetics for the TTP diagrams: The first is to determine the heat flow peak-time and to plot the corresponding time/temperature values in a time-temperature diagram.
4: If needed, straight lines were fitted to the peak flanks.
5: In those cases the intersection point of the lines was evaluated as the peak-time ( Figure 6).
6: This method is relatively easy and fast.
7: However, uncertainties occur with the decreasing peak-sharpness of the heat flow, and only one single time value results for each measured curve.

<p>Supplementary Figure S9: Growth improvements in MtzR lines during 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture upon discontinuation of drug selection. Isolates were subcultured twice weekly to ensure consistent culture conditions, media availability and time in culture between the 2 lines (106-MtzR, 713-MtzR). Left axis shows the fold increase relative to MtzS parents in seed volume required for MtzR lines to compensates for lower growth rates/growth defects, while the right axis reflects the % confluence of adhered trophozoites averaged across the two subculture passages for that week. During Mtz selection in week 0, lower confluence and higher seed values were required. Upon discontinuation of drug selection, confluence and growth improved, and lower seed volumes required.

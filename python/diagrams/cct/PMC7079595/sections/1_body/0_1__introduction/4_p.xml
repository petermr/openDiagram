<p>The reasons why austenite remains in the microstructure are different for hot-rolled steel sheets and cold-rolled steel sheets. Thus, once hot rolling in the austenitic field has been applied, either coiling [

 <xref rid="B1-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is usually applied so austenite is retained in the final microstructure as part of its incomplete transformation on final cooling. On the contrary, the cold-rolled medium-Mn steels require intercritical annealing as a final heat treatment step [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In such cases, the austenite is formed upon heating conditions. These three possible heat treatment routes are simulated in the present work.

 <caption> Overview of the DIscBIO pipeline showing its four successive sections. ( a) Pre-processing the raw read counts with and without ERCC spike-ins. ( b) Cell clustering and pseudo-time ordering. During this step clusters can be evaluated and visualized in PCA plots and tSNE maps with a possibility to detect outlier cells. ( c) Identifying differentially expressed genes by SAMseq and binomial counting statistics. ( d) Identifying biomarkers through decision trees, networking and gene enrichment analysis. </caption>

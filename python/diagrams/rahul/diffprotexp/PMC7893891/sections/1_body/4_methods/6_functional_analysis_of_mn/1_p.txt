0: Cells were seeded on MEA chips, either in 60MEA200/30iR-Ti arrays or 24-well Plate with PEDOT Electrodes on Glass, 24 W300/30G-288 (Multichannel Systems).
1: MEAs were coated with poly-D-lysine and vitronectin.
2: Before recording, the MEA chips were moved to the MEA2100 system (MultiChannel Systems) equipped with temperature control and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before recording.
3: The data were acquired using Multi Channel Experimenter or Multiwell Screen (MultiChannel Systems) at a sampling rate of 20 kHz for 2 min at 37 C. Data were filtered using Butterworth band pass filter with 200 Hz cutoff frequency and threshold of 5 x SD were set to minimize both false-positive and missed detection.
4: The representative electrodes were selected for analysis of mean spike frequency and percentage of spikes in the burst.

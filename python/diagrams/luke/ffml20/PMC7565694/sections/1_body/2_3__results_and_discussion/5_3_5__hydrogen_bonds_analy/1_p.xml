<p>Intermolecular interactions play an important role in chains packing. The radial distribution functions (RDFs) were calculated to study the intermolecular H-bonding interactions in PI matrices. In theory, the hydrogen bonds between ‒NH‒ of carbazole and O=C‒ of imide rings could be formed in the 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI matrices, while no hydrogen bonds could be formed in Kapton. The radial distribution functions (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Intermolecular interactions can be classified into H-bonding, strong and weak van der Waals’ forces, corresponding to the distances between atoms of 2.6~3.1, 3.1~5.0, and above 5.0 Å, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f005">Figure 5</xref>, there were peaks appearing in the range of 2.6~3.1 Å, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds in 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI. Notably, 2,7-CPI exhibited higher 
 <italic>g(r)</italic> value than 2,7-CPPI in that range, indicating the larger number of hydrogen bonds in 2,7-CPI compared to that in 2,7-CPPI. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f006">Figure 6</xref> presents the hydrogen bonds formed in the simulation cell of 2,7-CPI, confirming the existence of the above-mentioned hydrogen bonds. Statistical results showed that 49 and 60 hydrogen bonds were formed in the 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI systems, respectively (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), while no hydrogen bonds were found in the Kapton system. The cohesive energy density (CED) of the three PIs systems were calculated by molecular simulations and shown in 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The 2,7-CPI showed the highest CED among the three PIs, probably owing to the more number of hydrogen bonds formed in 2,7-CPI matrix. The strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding of 2,7-CPI contributed to its close chain packing. The low CED value of Kapton was also a reason for its loose chains packing.

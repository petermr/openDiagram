<p id="par0155">The coding sequence of MAPK-1 (1.1 kb) was cloned in pET28a (+) vector (EMD Biosciences) and transformed in BL-21 (DE3) strain of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The recombinant MAPK protein was expressed by inducing with 0.9 mM concentration of isopropyl β-
 <sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) which showed the maximum induction. The expressed recombinant protein was purified and loaded on to SDS-PAGE in order to check the purity along with the control (vector without candidate MAPK gene). Recombinant MAPK protein showed band of ∼40.2 kDa as visualized on the gel (

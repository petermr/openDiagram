<p>While generally considered less active than Fe-based TMNC materials, Co-based TMNC catalysts are believed to exhibit higher stability for ORR.

 </sup> revealed important differences in the behavior of Fe- and Co-based TMNC materials: unlike in the case of Fe, XAS spectra for Co-based TMNC catalysts showed practically no changes with applied potential in the range relevant for ORR, suggesting a significantly less pronounced structural change upon their interaction with adsorbates. At the same time, more pronounced differences in the Co K-edge XANES spectra could be detected when the spectra were collected in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated versus N
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolytes. This suggests that Co-based sites are less prone to adsorb oxygen species and form Co–O bonds only in an O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolyte.

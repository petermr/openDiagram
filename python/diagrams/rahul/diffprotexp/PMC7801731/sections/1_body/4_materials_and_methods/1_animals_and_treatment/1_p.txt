0: Sea cucumbers were collected from the northeastern rocky coast of Puerto Rico 73.
1: Evisceration was carried out by an intracoelomic injection of 0.35 M KCl.
2: Subsequently, the organisms were left in salt-water aquaria for 1 and 3 dpe to undergo regeneration.
3: Uneviscerated animals kept under the same conditions and for the same lengths of time as the eviscerated animals were used as controls.
4: Prior to dissection, animals were anesthetized by immersion in ice-cold water for 45 min.
5: A dorsal incision was made to expose the internal cavity of the organism and allow dissection of the mesentery separated from the body wall and intestine.
6: In the case of non-eviscerated organisms, the intestine was separated from the mesentery that remained attached to the body wall and removed using small surgical scissors.
7: The mesentery was obtained throughout its length from the anterior end of the animal (next to the esophagus) to the posterior end (next to the cloaca).
8: Dissected tissues were placed in RNAlater (Sigma, USA) solution and stored at 4oC until the RNA extraction was performed.

0: Polymicrobial infections caused by a combination of microorganisms are responsible for significant mortality and morbidity [ 13].
1: Biofilm-associated mixed infections, such as those on indwelling medical devices, are particularly challenging to treat due to their inherent heterogeneity, which can be further amplified by synergistic inter-species interactions [ 1, 46].
2: Therefore, understanding the molecular inter-species interactions will greatly aid in designing novel therapeutic strategies targeting mixed biofilm infections, specifically those involving fungi and bacteria.

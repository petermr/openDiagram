<p id="Par32">For the role of LMNA in regulating euchromatin in DCM, we speculate that it may result from the abnormal binding between LMNA alone or LAP2Î±-lamin A/C complexes and euchromatin in myocardial cells. To test this hypothesis, we tried to elucidate the potential biological processes and signaling pathways associated with LMNA mutation-associated DCM through deeply analyzing the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, which were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis were further conducted to assess the potential functions of the differential binding genes. The dysregulated hub genes and associated signaling pathways were also discovered in this study.</p>

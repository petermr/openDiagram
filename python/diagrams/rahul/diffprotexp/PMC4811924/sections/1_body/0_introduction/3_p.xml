<p>Apart from surgical intervention (when applicable), antibiotics are the main option for the treatment of biofilm infections (Bjarnsholt et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Previous studies showed that macrolides successfully inhibited 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> biofilm formation and reduced its virulence when used at sub-inhibitory concentrations (Fujimura et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In addition, a sub-minimal inhibitory concentration of erythromycin can inhibit 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm formation (Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Tylosin, a macrolide antibiotic produced by 
 <italic>Streptomyces fradiae</italic>, is widely used as a veterinary medicine. However, there is still not much effective research of sub-MIC tylosin inhibiting biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. suis in vitro</italic>.

1: A p-value was calculated as the probability that a  2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom was more extreme than the G statistic for that protein.
2: The BenjaminiHochberg method was used to correct for false discovery rates from multiple hypothesis testing, where a protein needs to satisfy the criteria of both G-test and FDR < 5.0% to be called differentially expressed.

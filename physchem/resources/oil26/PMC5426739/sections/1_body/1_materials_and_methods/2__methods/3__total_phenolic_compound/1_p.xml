Total phenolic content (TPC) was determined using the Folin&#8211;Ciocalteau reagent and caffeic acid for calibration curve by spectrophotometer (CECIL, Aquaris 1100, England) at 725 nm according to Capannesi <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> TPC was determined by calibration curve which was achieved from defined concentration of caffeic acid absorbance, and the final results were reported as mg caffeic acid/kg of oil.</p>

<p>Opossum kidney cells (OKP cells) were grown in DMEM complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 U/mL) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For DNA transfection, cells were grown to 60–80% confluence on plastic culture dishes and then were transiently transfected for 5 h with plasmids using Lipofectamine plus kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). For protein degradation assays, transiently transfected cells were treated with MG132 (2 μM) or chloroquin (100 μM) for 6 h prior to cell lysis.

<p>Another trend that we believe will be increasingly important in future 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS applications is the focus on time-resolved studies. As demonstrated in this Review, tracking the processes taking place in functional materials is within the possibilities of current XAS instrumentation when the characteristic times are on the order of seconds. Such experiments can provide important information about atomic rearrangements and in some cases the charge exchange in an electrochemical system and corresponding changes in the electronic structure of the catalysts. Time-resolved studies can also reveal the presence of short-lived intermediate species, identify reaction rate limiting steps, and, in general, provide clues about the catalyst working mechanisms. In principle, much faster processes can be tracked by XAS by relying on pump-and-probe approaches. There are already some known successful examples, where synchrotron-based XAS was used to monitor the dynamics of excited states in photocatalysts on the time scale of hundreds of picoseconds.

 </sup> However, the requirement for reliable and highly reproducible reaction initiation currently limits the applicability of these approaches in heterogeneous catalysis.

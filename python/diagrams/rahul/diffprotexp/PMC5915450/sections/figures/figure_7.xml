  <p>Force decomposition into electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the nascent chains and ERY or the ribosome in the simulations in which non-bonded interactions are turned on as residues enter the exit tunnel. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Non-bonded interaction force at 
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>max</sub> between ErmCL’s residues ERY or the ribosome. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Non-bonded interaction force at 
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>max</sub> between H-NS’s residues and ERY or the ribosome. Above each data point the ‘+/−’ signs indicate, on average, whether the force was attractive or repulsive, respectively. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

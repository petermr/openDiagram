0: To study the  in vitro release of loratadine and sulpiride from the prepared nanoemulsions, a dialysis bag method was adopted (Sood et al.,  2014).
1: 4  mL sample was loaded into a dialysis bag of cellulose membrane (14  kDa molecular weight cutoff).
2: The bag was dipped in a beaker containing 100  ml phosphate buffer solution, pH 6.8    0.5 kept at 37    0.1  C and stirred at 50  rpm for 12  hours.
3: 2  ml samples were removed at appropriate time intervals.
4: Loratadine and sulpiride amounts were determined by measuring spectrophotometric absorbance at 395 and 218  nm respectively.
5: The resultant release profiles were compared to those obtained from the individual raw loratadine and sulpiride.
6: Statistical analysis of the release data has been carried out using similarity factor, f2 whereas the release profiles were compared to a reference (Shah et al.,  1998).

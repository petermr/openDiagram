<p>On the 11-13th day after inoculation with tumor cells, the model and control rats were subjected to isolated liver perfusion. The procedure for isolated liver perfusion was similar to that described in a previous publication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The perfusion conditions were in accordance with the standards proposed by Bessems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The perfusate medium was freshly prepared Krebs/Henseleit- bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) saturated with a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide (95:5). Perfusion flow was mantained at a rate of 3 ml/min.g liver weight. The perfusion temperature was maintained at 37°C.

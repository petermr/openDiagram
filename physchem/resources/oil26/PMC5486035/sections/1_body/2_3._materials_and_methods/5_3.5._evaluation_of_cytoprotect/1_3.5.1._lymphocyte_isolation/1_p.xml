Blood samples were diluted with equal volumes of balanced salt solution, layered over Histopaque-1077 in centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 400&#215; <italic>g</italic> for 30&#8211;40 min at 25 &#176;C. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer was removed with a pipette and washed by centrifugation. The PBMCs were passed through a Percoll gradient according to Repnik et al. [<xref rid="B39-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] to enrich the fraction in lymphocytes. Lymphocytes (viability &gt; 90%) were counted on a haemocytometer and suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin G and streptomycin. Cell concentration was adjusted to 1 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL.</p>

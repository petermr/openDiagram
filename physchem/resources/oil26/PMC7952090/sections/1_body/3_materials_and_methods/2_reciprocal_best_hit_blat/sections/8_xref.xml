<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kent, 2002</xref>) as our algorithm of choice, as this algorithm is sensitive to highly similar (&gt;90% identity) sequences, thus identifying the highest-confidence homologs while minimizing many-to-one mapping problems when searching for multiple genes. RBH performs similar to other more complex methods of orthology prediction and is particularly good at identifying incomplete genes that may be fragmented in low quality/poorly assembled regions of the genome (

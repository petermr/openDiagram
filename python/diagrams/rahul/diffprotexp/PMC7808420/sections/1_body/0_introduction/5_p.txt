0: Here we report that type I and type II IFNs have distinct roles in experimental SLEV infection.
1: We observed that type I IFNs are crucial for the control of SLEV replication and disease development.
2: In contrast, IFN deficiency confers a slight protection to SLEV-infected mice.
3: Susceptibility to SLEV infection is associated to failed ISG induction, including of the innate immune sensor RIG-I.

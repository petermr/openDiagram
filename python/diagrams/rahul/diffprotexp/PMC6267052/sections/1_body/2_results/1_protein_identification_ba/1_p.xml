<p id="Par21">A total of 673 proteins were identified in the DDA analysis, of which 358 proteins had at least two unique peptides and could be identified in at least three of the samples. A full list of these 358 proteins can be found in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1. Out of these, 307 were common between meniscus and articular cartilage, while 40 proteins were unique to the meniscus samples and 11 proteins were specific to articular cartilage (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Out of the 358 proteins, 196 were classified as extracellular matrix (ECM), of which 170 were common between meniscus and articular cartilage. Among the ECM proteins, 17 proteins were found in meniscus only (e.g. collagen IV, both alpha 1 and 2 chains, high mobility group protein B1 and nidogen-2) and 9 proteins in articular cartilage alone (e.g. collagen XI, both alpha 1 and 2 chains, matrilin-3 and serine protease HTRA3) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

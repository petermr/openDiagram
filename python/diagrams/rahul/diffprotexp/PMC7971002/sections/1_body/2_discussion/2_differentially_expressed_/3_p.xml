<p id="Par24">Our KEGG pathway analysis was consistent with the GO analysis. The miRNA and lncRNA target genes were significantly enriched in Rap1 signalling, PI3k-Akt signalling, olfactory transduction, cell adhesion and CAMs biosynthesis pathways. The PI3k-Akt signalling pathway induces transcription of target genes to mediate angiogenesis, cell invasion, metastasis, proliferation and apoptosis

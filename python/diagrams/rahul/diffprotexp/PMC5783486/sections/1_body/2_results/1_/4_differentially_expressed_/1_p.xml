<p>The functions (i.e., biological processes) of these differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using ClueGO, a Cytoscape plug-in that integrates GO terms (
 <xref rid="b12-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Pie charts were used to display the differences in the distribution of functional categories for differentially expressed proteins between KD patients with CAD and CAA (
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). For the CAD vs. control comparison, 9 enriched processes were observed; however, only 4 processes were enriched in the CAA vs. control comparison. These results are presented as bar charts in 
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, which use the same color scheme as that of the pie charts. Analysis of the biological processes, as summarized in the two pie charts, notably demonstrated that the wound healing response and lipoproteins are involved in CAD and CAA. In a combined analysis of the corresponding CAA/CAD bar charts and pie charts, the main differentially expressed proteins were involved in the wounding response, and lipoprotein and cholesterol-associated processes, indicating that KD patients with CAA may suffer more harmful attacks in the coronary arteries or surrounding areas.

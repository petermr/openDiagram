0: In our previous study we showed that heterophils and macrophages increase in the spleen of chickens when intravenously infected with  Salmonella Enteritidis ( S. Enteritidis) [ 7].
1: Next we characterized the gene expression at the tissue level in the whole spleen and expression of selected transcripts was tested in sorted leukocyte subpopulations [ 6].
2: However, none of this provided general data on the protein expression in chicken heterophils and macrophages.
3: Although intravenous infection of chickens only partially represents specific  Salmonellachicken interactions which are mixed up with a general response to bacteremia caused by Gram negative bacterium, this way of infection represents a model for the understanding heterophil and macrophage functions during early response to infection.
4: In the current study we therefore isolated heterophils and macrophages from chicken spleens by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), purified proteins from these cells and identified them by mass spectrometry.
5: This allowed us to (1) characterize the total proteome of heterophils and macrophages, (2) define proteins which exhibited differential abundance in chicken heterophils compared to macrophages and (3) identify proteins that changed in abundance following the intravenous infection with  S. Enteritidis in either of these populations.
6: Since we also included a group of chickens which was vaccinated prior to challenge, we also addressed whether there are any proteins specifically expressed by the macrophages or heterophils from the vaccinated chickens.
7: Using this approach we identified over one hundred proteins characteristic of either chicken heterophils or macrophages which allowed us to further refine their function in chickens.

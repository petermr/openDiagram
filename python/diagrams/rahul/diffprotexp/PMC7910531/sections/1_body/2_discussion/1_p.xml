<p id="Par17">To date, deep molecular profiling of cells of relevance to osteoarthritis has been absent from large-scale efforts such as GTEx, ENCODE and RoadMap, in part because of the challenges associated with low cellularity and high ECM content of cartilage

 </sup>. Here, we address this gap by the systematic study of paired low-grade and high-grade cartilage and synovium tissues from 115 patients with osteoarthritis to provide the first deep molecular QTL map of cell types directly involved in disease. These data are made publically available (see Data availability). We identify genotype-dependent, divergent patterns of gene regulation between diseased and healthy cartilage, and between cartilage and synovium, that underline the biological specificity of disease stage and cell type when investigating regulatory variant function.

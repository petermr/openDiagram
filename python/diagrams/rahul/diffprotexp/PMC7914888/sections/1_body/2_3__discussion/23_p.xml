<p>This bioinformatics approach based on experimental data of differential expression of miRNAs could facilitate the establishment of new hypotheses associated with a differential expression profile, whose expression as a whole could be related to the synchronous regulation of gene expression in particular cellular programs. Recent evidence suggests a possible epigenetic reprogramming by transcriptional modification of miRNA expression profiles [
 <xref rid="B108-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Based on the results in this experimental model of induced growth suppression and differential pigmentation, cells may reprogram a reversible phenotype through the coordinated and reciprocal regulation of their transcriptome. It is tempting to speculate a possible coordinated response under the stimulus of genotoxic or metabolic stress described above. This response involves the global reprogramming of patterns of miRNA expression and miRNAs relative antagonism.

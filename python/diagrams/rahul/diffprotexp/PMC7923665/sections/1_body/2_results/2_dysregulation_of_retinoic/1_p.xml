<p id="Par31">To understand the molecular changes in the cerebral AVM nidus structures, we performed pathway analysis with transcriptome data sets and found a distinct pattern of differential gene expression in AVM tissue compared to control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The highly deregulated genes belong to a subset of retinoic acid-responsive genes, particularly MGP, SERPINE1, COL1A1, SPP1, MAFB, SERPINA3, COL3A1, and CYR61 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). We validated the expression changes using qRT-PCR analysis and found a significant upregulation of retinoic acid response genes such as COUP-TFII, GGTP, THSP-1, GLUT1, and EGR in cerebral AVM nidus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). To identify the master regulator of these changes, we analyzed the expression of ALDH1A2, a key rate-limiting enzyme of retinoic acid signaling pathway by qRT-PCR analysis in 10 AVM nidus and 10 control samples. The results have identified a significant upregulation of ALDH1A2 protein in cerebral AVM nidus compared to control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). To validate these findings, we have isolated endothelial cells from five AVM nidus tissues and analyzed the expression of ALDH1A2 gene. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that ALDH1A2 gene is upregulated in endothelial cells isolated from AVM tissues than normal brain capillary endothelial cells isolated from control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). We have studied the expression of ALDH1A2 in the protein levels of AVM nidus and control tissues and found consistent upregulation of ALDH1A2 protein in AVM nidus tissues than in control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, e). To substantiate further, we performed the immunohistochemical analysis for ALDH1A2 in cerebral AVM and control tissues. It is evident that there is an elevated expression of ALDH1A2 in the blood vessels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, c), and surprisingly, we have found increased levels of ALDH1A2 in the surrounding astrocyte cells in AVM tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, c). Further, we have performed an immunofluorescence analysis with ALDH1A2 antibody in the AVM and control tissues and observed that AVM-associated blood vessels had an elevated expression of ALDH1A2, whereas very less expression was observed in control tissue vessels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, e). Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses of cerebral AVM nidus confirms the upregulation of ALDH1A2, a key rate-limiting enzyme of retinoic acid signaling pathway, which in turn controls the many angiogenic genes in the vascular system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The deregulation of ALDH1A2 in AVM nidus proposes potential changes in vasculogenesis that may lead to the development of cerebral AVMs.

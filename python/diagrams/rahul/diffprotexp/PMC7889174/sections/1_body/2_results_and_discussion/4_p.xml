<p>Importantly, targeting to the NE of many of these proteins has been verified experimentally as, in spite of having at least one TMD, some of these proteins do not localize to the NE but rather to the nucleoplasm or nucleolus [
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Interestingly, some NEA proteins can be detected by microscopy at the nuclear periphery in some cell types/tissues but not in others, which has led to the concept that different tissues contain distinct pools of protein complexes that alter the localization of NEA proteins [
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], making prediction of NE localization even more challenging. Although most of the proteins in our cohort reside in the NE, some of them have shown nucleoplasm localization, such as UTP15, Noc4l, Noc2l, Wdr33, Wdr75, Tmem74 [
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Interestingly, some NEA proteins have been localized in different regions of the nucleus, e.g. lamin A, which typically localizes to the nuclear rim but in recent years a highly mobile nucleoplasmic pool of lamin A has been detected [
 <xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78â€“80</xref>], although the mechanisms regulating this state of lamina-independent lamins remain obscure. Further examples are Tmem214 and Tmem70: Tmem214 is simultaneously identified as a protein [
 <xref rid="cit0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], an ER transmembrane protein [
 <xref rid="cit0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and further confirmed to localize to the inner nuclear envelope [
 <xref rid="cit0083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]; Tmem70 has multiple isoforms and is traditionally considered an inner mitochondrial membrane protein partaking in the assembly of the ATP synthase [
 <xref rid="cit0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], but has also been identified as a NET [
 <xref rid="cit0083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].

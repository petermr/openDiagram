<p id="Par20">The microstructure of the SA508Gr.4N steel after the step-cooling heat treatment is shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. As Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows, the carbides in the martensite are diffuse and small (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>), and those in the bainite are discontinuous and disperse (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). The carbides in martensite are fine and uniformly distributed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>); on the other hand, the carbides distribution in bainite is not uniform and larger carbides were present (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). The distribution of carbides on the grain boundaries causes their embrittlement, promoting the fracture of the material along the grain boundaries. The grain boundary carbides in bainite are coarser than those in martensite, and larger carbides will reduce the critical fracture stress and decrease the toughness of the material.

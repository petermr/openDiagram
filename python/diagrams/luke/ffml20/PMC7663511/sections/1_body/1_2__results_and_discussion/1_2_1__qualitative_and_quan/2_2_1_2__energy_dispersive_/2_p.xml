<p>Elemental analysis of pristine MWCNTs provided the contents of nitrogen and oxygen that can be attributed to imino or amino groups; they can also come from hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. The detection of nitrogen is the evidence for the presence of imine or amine groups, while the detection of oxygen confirms the presence of hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. As can be seen, the chemical modification caused an increase in the content of oxygen after treatment with nitric acid from 0.94% to 2.79% that confirms the increase in the number of â€“COOH and -OH groups. The adsorption of DOX on MWCNTs led to the increased content of nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine because of their presence in this drug. Furthermore, a marginal amount of sodium (1.42 wt %) was detected, which came probably from the PBS buffer.</p>

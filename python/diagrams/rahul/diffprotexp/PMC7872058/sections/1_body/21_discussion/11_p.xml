<p>Collectively, our data provide evidence for a potential diagnostic value of sTREM1 in IPA. Initial findings on TREM1 functionality suggest that the impact of TREM1 SNPs in IPA should be further investigated. In addition, we showed a role of TREM1 on antifungal host defense against 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> in a murine model of IPA. TREM1 deficiency in mice, increased susceptibility to infection in an immunosuppressed murine model of IPA. Based on our findings, we can suggest that TREM1 deficiency mediates susceptibility against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> in mice due to a delayed innate and adaptive immune responses and impaired pro-inflammatory cytokine response.

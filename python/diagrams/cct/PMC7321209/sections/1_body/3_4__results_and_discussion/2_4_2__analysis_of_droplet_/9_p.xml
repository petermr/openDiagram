<p>Furthermore, WAAM with increased CTWD of 44 mm and adapted welding velocity is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f009">Figure 9</xref>dâ€“f. Thereby, the reduced short circuit frequency (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f008">Figure 8</xref>) affected the wetting behavior and near net shape properties. Thus, a stable welding process and the formation of layers with equal geometrical properties could be achieved with low welding velocities up to 0.4 m/min (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f009">Figure 9</xref>d,e). Thereby, surface roughness as well as the curvature at the structure beginning were slightly affected. As a result, requirements for near net shape quality in WAAM could be met with an increased CTWD of 44 mm.

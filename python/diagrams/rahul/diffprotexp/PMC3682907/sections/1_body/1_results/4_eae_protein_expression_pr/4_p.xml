<p>Principal component analysis allows us to explore patterns and identify the most important sources of variation in large datasets. Principal component analysis computes a set of orthogonal directions called principal components. The first principal component is the eigenvector of the covariance matrix which has the largest eigenvalue and accounts for the greatest variation in the data. The second principal component (i.e. with the next largest eigenvalue) is the eigenvector, orthogonal to the first principal component, which accounts for the next most variance, and so on. The contribution of each principal component to a particular protein expression profile is given by the principal component score. The first several principal components often account for much of the variability in the data and indicate which features most contribute to this variability, while the principal component scores relate that variability to each sample.</p>

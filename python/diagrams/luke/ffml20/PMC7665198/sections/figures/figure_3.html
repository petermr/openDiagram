 <caption> The results and analysis of MD simmulations in the presence of variable amounts of water. a– g p(MMA/nBA) copolymers surrounded by H 2O molecules ( R w = 0, 1:4, 1:2, 3:4, 1:1, 4:3, and 2:1); A1/A2/A3–G1/G2/G3 illustrates the results of MD simulations: A1–G1–A3–G3 are image-extracted macromolecules from MD simulations: A1–G1 are copolymer backbone, side groups, and water, A2–G2 are backbone atoms and water, and A3–G3 are backbone units. </caption>

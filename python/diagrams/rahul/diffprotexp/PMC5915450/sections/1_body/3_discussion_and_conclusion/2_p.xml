<p id="Par27">Other sequence features might also contribute to the differential impact of ERY. In ErmCL, residues 6I, 8 V and 9I of ErmCL are highly hydrophobic (with hydropathy indices for V and I of 4.5 and 4.2, respectively

 </sup>) suggesting hydrophobic interactions might be important to ERY-driven ribosome stalling. Moreover, the average per-residue hydropathy index of ErmCL (25.2/9 = 2.8) is larger compared to H-NS (20.3/12 = 1.7). This suggests the possibility that the higher the hydrophobicity of the nascent peptide the greater the likelihood of arrest by ERY. This notion is supported by experimental data

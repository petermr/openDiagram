<p>Many gene lists have been proposed in different studies, but drawing a general conclusion from such scattered studies is, at the moment, impossible. Therefore, to make the most of these methods, meta-analyses comparing results from published research or systematic analyses on independent datasets and with different methods should be performed. In particular, very little research has been devoted to the comparison of the methodsâ€™ performance, with a few exceptions. The most comprehensive comparison of network-based approaches showed the highest performance of z-score and entropy-based methods, while local and hybrid single-gene methods proved superior to global single-gene methods in identifying disease-related genes [

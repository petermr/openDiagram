<p>Given the apparent impact of PAS usage on protein translation, we next considered direct measurements of protein expression data from 3391 genes in LCLs from humans and chimpanzees (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2013</xref>). Using summary statistics from this study, we found 1263 genes to be differentially expressed at the protein level between the species (FDR of 5%). As the protein measurements are restricted to these 3391 genes, we do not have enough power to ask if genes with inter-species differences in APA are also more likely to be differentially expressed at the protein level. However, we did find a positive correlation between the absolute value of 3' UTR ΔPAU and the standardized number of ubiquitination sites for the same gene (Pearson’s correlation, R = 0.15, p=5.0×10
 <sup>−7</sup>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, see 'Materials and methods'), consistent with the observation that 3' UTR PAS are targets for the regulation of protein decay (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Dubnikov et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Ravid and Hochstrasser, 2008</xref>). Thus, we next focused on the 506 genes with significant inter-species differences in protein expression and an absence of corresponding differences in transcript expression levels that we also tested for differences in APA. Khan et al. reasonably hypothesized that inter-species differences in translation could account for the emergence of differences in protein expression levels when there are no regulatory differences at the RNA level, but they were unable to point to specific mechanisms. These genes are particularly interesting in the context of our current study, because APA which results in changes to 3' UTR length may be more likely to result in differences in protein expression without affecting the expression level of the mRNA.

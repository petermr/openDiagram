<p>Metallothionein (MT) is a family of low molecular weight, sulphur-containing proteins and plays an important role in metal metabolism and protects cells against the toxic effects of radiation, alkylating agents and oxygen free radicals
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our previous study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> showed that pre-treatment with zinc results in significant detoxification effects in rats with acute DU intoxication. The detoxification mechanism might be associated with the synthesis of MT and enhanced anti-oxidative functions. Further study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> showed that MT-knockout mice (MT−/−) display significantly higher serum creatinine and urea nitrogen, severe pathological injury, a significant reduction of the activity of anti-superoxide anion free radicals, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and increased levels of malondialdehyde after DU exposure compared with wild-type mice (MT+/+). These results suggested that MT might play critical roles in antagonizing DU-induced nephrotoxicity, leading to new perspectives regarding the prevention and treatment of DU-induced injury. Furthermore, Jiang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> that MT exhibits significant protective functions in nematodes after DU exposure.

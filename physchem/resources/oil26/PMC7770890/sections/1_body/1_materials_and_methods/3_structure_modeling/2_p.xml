<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Pairwise sequence alignments between hACE2
and the other ACE2 orthologs were extracted from the MSAs and trimmed
accordingly, as hACE2 was not full-length in the template complex
(PDB ID: 6M0J).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> The trimming should not affect binding
analysis because it was shown that the protein&#8211;protein interface
is unabridged in the experimentally determined hACE2/S-RBD complex
structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> We utilized Modeller v9.24<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> to build
the initial putative complex models. Each model was first optimized
with the variable target function method with conjugate gradients
using parameters <italic>library_schedule = autosched.slow</italic> and <italic>max_var_iterations = 300</italic>, and then refined
using molecular dynamics with simulated annealing (SA) using parameter
settings <italic>md_level = refine.slow</italic>. The whole cycle
was repeated two times and was not stopped unless the objective function
was &gt;1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> (parameter settings: <italic>repeat_optimization
= 2</italic> and <italic>max_molpdf = 1e6</italic>). For each ACE2/S-RBD
pair, 100 initial Modeller complex models were constructed.</p>

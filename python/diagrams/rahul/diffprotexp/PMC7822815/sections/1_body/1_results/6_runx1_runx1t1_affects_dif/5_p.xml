<p id="Par33">Alternatively, loss of RUNX1/RUNX1/T1 binding can also result in a repression instead of an activation of alternative TSSs as in the case of 
 <italic>LIMS1</italic>, where repression of TSS2 led to a substantially decreased level of LIMS1 protein isoform e (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Thus, similar to canonical regulation of transcription, RUNX1/RUNX1T1 can both repress and activate alternative TSSs.

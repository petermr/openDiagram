<p id="p0025">Systemic metabolic homeostasis is regulated not only by metabolism in each organ alone but also by inter-organ metabolic cycles, such as those between the liver and skeletal muscle, in mammals (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gancheva et al., 2018</xref>). Various metabolites produced by these organs are released into the circulation and affect the metabolism of other organs. Especially, during the fasting period, glucose and ketone bodies generated in the liver serve as essential energy sources for extrahepatic organs (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lehninger et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, lactate and alanine from the extrahepatic organs, like the skeletal muscle, work as substrates of glucose generation (gluconeogenesis) in the liver, which are known as Cori's cycle and glucose-alanine cycle, respectively (

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Felig, 1973</xref>). However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms controlling these inter-organ metabolic cycles are not fully understood.

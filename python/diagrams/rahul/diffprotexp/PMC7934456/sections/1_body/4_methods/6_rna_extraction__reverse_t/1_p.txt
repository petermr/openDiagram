0: Referring to the reagent manufacturers instructions, we extracted total RNA from kale type oilseed rape using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), resuspended the RNA in RNase-free water, and treated it with RNase-free DNase I (Thermo Fermentas).
1: After digestion treatment with DNase I, PCR amplification was used to confirm the elimination of DNA contamination.
2: We then reverse transcribed the digested RNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers (Thermo Fermentas) to obtain cDNA.
3: cDNA was amplified on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche) using SYBR Green I with gene-specific primers.
4: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche) using a SYBR Green I Master PCR kit with gene-specific primers to detect the expression of kale type oilseed rape genes [ 65].

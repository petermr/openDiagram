  <p>Principal component analysis of 2-DE gel electrophoresis data. Scores graphs combining proteomic maps (variables) and spots from different groups (observations) were constructed. Principal components analysis clustered the nine silver-stained expression maps into three different groups. Principal component 1 was 48.37% from the modulated proteins and principal component 2 was 42.84% from the modulated proteins. Color dots represent sample group: MSC (magenta), cMSC (blue) and AC (violet).</p>

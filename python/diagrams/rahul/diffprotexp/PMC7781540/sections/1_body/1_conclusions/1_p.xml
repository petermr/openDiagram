<p>While it is certainly challenging to sort out the contributions effects on cells of the peripheral immune system, particularly on memory T cells and monocyte derived macrophages, make to the beneficial effects of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers on inflammation in the CNS, it is clear that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 plays important roles in regulating membrane potential, preventing depolarization and controlling calcium signaling events that subsequently lead to microglia activation and inflammatory mediator production. We would like to suggest that from a therapeutic perspective it is probably desirable to inhibit K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 in multiple immune system cell types. However, it would be intellectually very satisfying and helpful for therapy development to clarify what the major cellular target of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitors is and whether therapeutics need to be brain penetrant in order to exert optimal ameliorating effects in CNS diseases. These questions should ideally be addressed both pharmacologically by testing brain penetrant small molecules side by side with peripheral restricted petidic K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitors or anti-K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 antibodies [

 <xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] in animal models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. It would further be highly informative to compare the effects of conditional K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 deletion in microglia, monocyte derived macrophages and different T cell subsets to the effects of drug treatment to gain a more detailed understanding of the role of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 in neuroinflammation and the cellular target of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibitors. However, we believe that at the cellular level the fundamental role of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 will always be what was first described in T cells, namely regulation of membrane potential and calcium influx and subsequent activation of calcium dependent transcription factors. What sometimes does not get stressed enough in this respect, is probably that K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3’s biophysical properties like its half-activation voltage and its relatively slow inactivation [
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], perfectly “qualify” the channel to resist membrane depolarizations and thus enable K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 to not only regulate SOCE, as was described 30 years ago in T cells, but also P2X receptor mediated calcium influx.

<p>According to solution-diffusion mechanism, permeability coefficient (

 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the permeability coefficients of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PIs. The simulated permeabilities of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PIs showed similar trends as the experimental results (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), validating the feasibility of simulations for gas transport analysis. The permeability coefficients of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PIs decreased in the following the order: Kapton ˃ 2,7-CPPI ˃ 2,7-CPI, which was in agreement with the trends of diffusion and solubility coefficients. It can be seen that the reductions of diffusion and solubility coefficients of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in 2,7-CPI gave rise to the decreases of permeability coefficients. Consequently, the barrier performances of 2,7-CPI were enhanced. The high gas barrier of 2,7-CPI was mainly ascribed to its high crystallinity, low free volume, and poor chains mobility.

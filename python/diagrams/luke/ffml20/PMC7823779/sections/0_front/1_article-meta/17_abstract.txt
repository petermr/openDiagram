0: In order to synthesize a novel two-dimensional energetic material, nitrated graphene oxide (NGO) was prepared by the nitrification of graphite oxide to make a functional modification.
1: Based on the morphological characterization, the NGO has a greater degree of curl and more wrinkles on the surface.
2: The structure characterization and density functional theory calculation prove that epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the edge of graphite oxide have reacted with nitronium cation (NO  2+) to produce nitro and nitrate groups.
3: Hydrophobicity of NGO implied higher stability in storage than graphene oxide.
4: Synchronous simultaneous analysis was used to explore the decomposition mechanism of NGO preliminarily.
5: The decomposition enthalpy of NGO is 662.0 Jg  1 and the activation energy is 166.5 kJmol  1.
6: The thermal stability is similar to that of general nitrate energetic materials.
7: The hygroscopicity, thermal stability and flammability of NGO prove that it is a novel two-dimensional material with potential applications as energetic additives in the catalyst, electrode materials and energetic devices.

 <caption> Identification of the circulating tumor cell (CTC) sub-populations, clustered based on the median expression of all genes in at least 10% of the cells. ( a) tSNE map visualizing clusters of circulating breast cancer cells identified with k-means clustering. ( b) The plot from ( a) with cells colored based on their pseudo-time ordering. ( c) A heatmap portrayal of cell-to-cell distances; cluster centers were ordered by hierarchic clustering. ( d) The plot from ( a) with cells colored based on their ESRP1 expression. ( e) The plot from ( a) with cells colored based on their TFAM expression. ( f) The plot from ( a) with cells colored based on their MALAT1 expression. </caption>

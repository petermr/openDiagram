0: Ischemia/reperfusion complicated by delayed neurological impairment is a dynamic pathological process, and the underlying mechanism is complex[ 123].
1: Several studies have shown that the mechanism may be related to microcirculation disturbance, inflammatory mechanisms, cellular necrosis and apoptosis, or biochemical self-destructive factors (such as calcium ion overloading, free radicals, excitatory amino acids)[ 34], however, the precise mechanism of ischemia/reperfusion injury is poorly understood.
2: Therefore, this study used differential proteomics to analyze the change in expression of related proteins after spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury.

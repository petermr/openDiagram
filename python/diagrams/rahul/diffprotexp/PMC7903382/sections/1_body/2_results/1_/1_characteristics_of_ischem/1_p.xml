<p>Serum cTnI levels in the model group were significantly increased compared with the control group (

 <xref rid="f1-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) all confirmed the successful establishment of the rat MIRI model. In the control group, the myocardium had a physiological myocardial architecture, and the myocardial fibres and myocardial cells were complete and arranged in an orderly manner. In the model group, structural disorder of the cardiac tissue was observed, with different degrees of vacuolar degeneration and necrosis, as well as loose stroma. Moreover, the number of cardiomyocyte fibres were markedly increased after MIRI.

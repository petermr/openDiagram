  <p>Maximum temperatures reached at each depth as calculated by FEM simulation. The dashed line shows the original calculation reaching a surface temperature of 1071 °C, whereas the solid line has been scaled to minimize the squared differences to the determined transition points in the microstructure. Here the surface temperature reaches 985 °C.</p>

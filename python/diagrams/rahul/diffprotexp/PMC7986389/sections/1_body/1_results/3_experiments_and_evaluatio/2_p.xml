<p id="Par23">First, we analysed the directed human protein interaction network with traditional MFVSs and obtained a set of 463 vertices. Then, we used our WMFVS method on the same network (the weights were derived from the FC values). We also used the inverses of the weights as the penalty values and applied them to our WFVS method.</p>

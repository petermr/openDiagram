<p>The experiments were performed by a 400 W average laser power pulsed Nd:YAG laser (model IQL-10, Paya Parto, Tehran, Iran). The available range for the pulse frequency, the pulse duration, and the pulse energy were 0.2–20 ms, 1–1000 Hz, and 0–40 J, respectively. The average power of the laser did not exceed 700 W. Three lenses (75 mm focal length) were used in the focusing optical system, and the minimum spot size was 250 mm. Average power in each experiment and pulse energy were measured by LA300W-LP joule meter (Edu-lab, Karoo Close, Bexwell Business Park, Norfolk, England) and 5000W-LP Ophir (Ophir Photonics Group-Ophir-Spiricon, North Logan, UT, USA). The plan of the experiment for LSTH is shown in

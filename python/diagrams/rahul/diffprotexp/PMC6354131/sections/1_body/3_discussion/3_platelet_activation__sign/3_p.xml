<p id="p0090">A2M (alpha-2-macroglobulin) is a protease inhibitor and cytokine transporter. It inhibits many proteases, including trypsin, thrombin and collagenase. Kelly BJ reported that A2M concentrations were significantly lower in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients; meanwhile, PCT levels were significantly higher in subjects with bacterial sepsis. Interestingly, combination of A2M and PCT can discriminate bacterial sepsis from other SIRS among SICU patients with suspected sepsis.

 </xref> A2M is also a protein with modulatory properties in inflammation. A previous study indicated that A2M has been microencapsulated could be an effective strategy to harness the complex biology of A2M, enhancing outcomes of fundamental processes of the innate immune response; this paves the way to potential future strategies in controlling sepsis.

0: Sorted nuclei from D1-GFP + or D2-GFP + striatal tissues were lysed in 4% SDS and then heated for 15 min at 95 C. The lysates containing 25 g protein each were separated on 420% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and proteins were then transferred to PVDF.
1: The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in 0.05%  v/ v phosphate buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h prior to overnight incubation with primary antibodies (GFP, RRID AB_305564, 1:1000 or DARPP-32, RRID AB_2811192, 1:5000) at 4 C with shaking.
2: Blots were washed three times with 0.05%  v/ v PBST and then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibody at 1:10,000 dilution in PBST (0.5% ( v/ v)) for 30 min at room temperature.
3: Blots were imaged using a LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).

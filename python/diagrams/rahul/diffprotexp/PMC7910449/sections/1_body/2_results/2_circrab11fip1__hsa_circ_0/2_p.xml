<p id="Par20">CircRAB11FIP1 and circTCF20 were silenced in SKOV3 cells and overexpressed in A2780 cells to determine their function. Silencing circRAB11FIP1 reduced the expression of circRAB11FIP1 and LC3-II. However, no significant change in LC3-II expression was observed after silencing circTCF20 (data not shown). On the contrary, circRAB11FIP1 overexpression promoted the expression of circRAB11FIP1 and LC3-II (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>). LC3-II was observed owing to an increase in autophagosomes or inhibition of the autophagic flux. The circRAB11FIP1 ectopic expression promoted LC3-II accumulation. This effect was partly inhibited after adding 3-MA but not BafA1 (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2B</xref>).

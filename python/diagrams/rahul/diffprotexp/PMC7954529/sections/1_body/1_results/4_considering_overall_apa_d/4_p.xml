<p>In a previous study that collected mRNA from a larger panel of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque LCLs, Khan et al. identified genes whose regulation likely evolves under directional selection in humans and chimpanzees (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2013</xref>). We were able to consider RNA and protein expression data as well as APA data from 2532 genes. We found that 22 of the genes with significant inter-species differences in APA at both the site level and in isoform diversity are among those whose regulation likely evolves under directional selection in the chimpanzee lineage, a 1.6× enrichment over what is expected by chance (hypergeometric test, p=0.015). While we did not identify any significant gene ontology (GO) categories for these genes, 5 of the 22 genes are associated with protein transport (CAPZA1, TPM3, TMED2, GOSR2, AP3S1) and 2 are ribosomal subunits (RPL13 and RPL7L1). We did not find a similar enrichment when we considered genes whose regulation evolved under selection in humans, but the sample size is rather small.

0: Early attempts to determine the cellular localization of RNA molecules were performed on one transcript at a time, mostly using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) 13,  14.
1: However, in the last few years, the field has benefited from the use of various high-throughput technologies, such as expression microarrays and RNA-seq in combination with cellular fractionation 11,  15  17.
2: The general aim of these studies was to characterize the contribution of each of the nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptomes to the global gene expression profiles.
3: Several studies have demonstrated that although the nucleus and cytoplasm contain overlapping populations of RNA transcripts, there are significant differences between the two fractions, and many coding and non-coding transcripts are unique to one fraction 17.
4: The differentially localized transcripts exhibit particular global characteristics.
5: For example, transcripts localized to the cytoplasm tend to have shorter coding sequences and shorter Untranslated regions (UTRs) compared to the transcripts localized in the nuclear fraction 15,  18.

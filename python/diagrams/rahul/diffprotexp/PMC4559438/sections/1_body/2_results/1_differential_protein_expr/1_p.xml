<p>The 2-DE analysis of the four congenital cholesteatoma samples showed very similar protein expression patterns (
 <xref rid="pone.0137011.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) that were quite different from acquired cholesteatoma and retroauricular skin samples (
 <xref rid="pone.0137011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). A total of 556 spots were identified in congenital cholesteatomas from 2-DE images analysis. Of the 556 spots, 270 were also simultaneously expressed in acquired cholesteatoma and EAC skin. Additionally, 103 and 56 spots were expressed in skin and acquired cholesteatoma, respectively. Finally, 127 spots were only expressed in congenital cholesteatoma (

<p>From this study it could be concluded that the essential oils under investigation possess antimicrobial activities. 
 <italic>C. sempervirens </italic>essential oil has the most potential antimicrobial properties followed by 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> essential oil. The results of the study are inaccordance with the previous investigations of essential oil of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic>, which proved the presence of α-pinene, camphor, linalool acetate, caryophyllene, alloaromadendrene, bornyl acetate and limonene as the major constituents in several studies of essential oil of different organs of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> in different countries (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Previous investigations on essential oil of 
 <italic>C. decurren</italic>s from USA and Taiwan proved the presence of α-pinene, δ-3-carene, terpinene, terpinolene, linalool, α-fenchyl acetate, β-caryophyllene and cedrol (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)] which were detected in this study. While, a previous study on essential oil of leaves of 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> cultivated in Egypt proved that cedrol constituted the major constituent of the oil followed by δ-3-carene and α-pinene (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) whilst the essential oil of the leaves of the plant cultivated in Tunisia showed the presence of α-pinene as a major component followed by δ-3-carene and limonene (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As the composition of the essential oils revealed intraspecific chemical variability among the same species growing in different localities and different environmental conditions, this study could contribute to the chemotaxonomic characterization of family Cupressaceae.

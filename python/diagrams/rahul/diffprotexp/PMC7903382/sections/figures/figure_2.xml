  <p>MIRI results in expression profile changes of mRNA and lncRNA in the T1-T4 spinal cord. (A) Volcano plot comparing global mRNA gene expression profiles in the spinal cord between the two groups. (B) Hierarchical cluster analysis of the mRNAs. (C) Volcano plot comparing global lncRNA gene expression profiles in the spinal cord between the two groups. (D) Hierarchical cluster analysis of the lncRNAs. The cluster analysis demonstrated that the three MIRI or three sham samples were clustered together. Upregulated, downregulated and not statistically different genes were colored in red, green and black, respectively. MIRI, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA.</p>

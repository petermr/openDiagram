<p id="p0165">In TGA curves (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), the weight loss of SCU was about 15.8% in the range of 200–260 °C, while the weight loss of SCU@CD-MOF was about 5.3% and the range of weight loss was shifted to high temperature, indicating CD-MOF had a certain protective effect on the thermal stability of the SCU molecules. In addition, the weight loss of SCU@CD-MOF in the range of 200–400 °C was 48.2% and was similar with the weight loss trend of CD-MOF.

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> and enhanced mineralization rates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. As a result, these soils may contain a higher inorganic nitrogen content, which is available to plants and promotes growth
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>, thereby reducing run-off
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, burrow mound soils are usually less compacted than surrounding undisturbed soils
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. By decreasing soil compaction there may be an increase in water availability, aeration and root space in soil, thereby enhancing water and nutrient uptake by plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. Burrows typically also provide a more favourable microclimate than ambient conditions by buffering thermal extremes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the activities of burrowing mammals may considerably alter soil properties and create new microhabitats which may preferentially be utilized by other organisms within the landscape.

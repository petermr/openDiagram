<p>We downloaded differential protein-level genes, effect sizes, and directional selection classifications from 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> of 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2013</xref>. Khan et al. modeled differential protein expression of 3390 genes using high-resolution mass spectrometry of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) collected from five human, five chimpanzee, and five rhesus macaque LCLs.

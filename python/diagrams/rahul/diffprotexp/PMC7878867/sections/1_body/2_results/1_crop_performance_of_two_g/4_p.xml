<p id="Par17">Three grain traits (GPC, TSC and colour b*) were measured at harvest (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In DBA Artemis, water-deficit stress significantly increased the GPC of progeny from the same parents (AtCW vs AtCC, AtWW vs AtWC). The GPC of the DBA Artemis progeny from stressed parents seemed to have a higher GPC compared with the progeny from the control parents under the same treatment condition (AtWC vs AtCC, AtWW vs AtCW), but the difference was not significant. For DBA Aurora, water-deficit stress also significantly increased the GPC of progeny from the same parents (AuCW vs AuCC, AuWW vs AuWC). No significant difference was detected for TSC across treatment groups for both genotypes. In DBA Artemis, flour colour (yellowness b*) was significantly decreased under water-deficit for progeny from the control parents. For progeny from the stressed parents, the flour colour was not affected by stress. The same trend was also observed in DBA Aurora, where water-deficit stress only affected the colour b* of the progeny from the control parents.

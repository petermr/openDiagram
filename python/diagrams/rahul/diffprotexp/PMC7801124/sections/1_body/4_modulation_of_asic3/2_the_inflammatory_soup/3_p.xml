<p>ATP is also generated during ischemia and released from cells that lyse during inflammation, and, as mentioned previously, is able to sensitize rASIC3-like currents predominantly via activation of P2X5 [
 <xref rid="cit0100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. As well as inflammatory cells producing pro-inflammatory mediators, cell death leads to substances entering the extracellular space, including protons, ATP and the extracellular concentration of thiols (such as glutathione and sulfhydryl groups, which can be mimicked using dithiothreitol [DTT]) increase. Like AA and NO, DTT (1 mM at pH 6) also potentiates mASIC3 transient currents by 357%, a phenomenon that persisted upon wash out [
 <xref rid="cit0169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. The group also observed that the metal chelator N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) behaved in the similar manner, increasing transient mASIC3 currents by 164% (1 mM at pH 6); it was proposed that DTT and TPEN act on a redox-sensitive site on ASIC3. As reported in studies examining the effect of lactate upon ASIC3, which increases ASIC3 currents by chelating Ca

 <sup>2+</sup>/Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations directly increase ASIC3-mediated currents [
 <xref rid="cit0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Lactate, which is also released in ischemia, (at pH 7.0, 15 mM in vitro) increased the transient amplitudes of rASIC3 by 70%, this amplitude effect was replicated in the absence of lactate with dual reductions of extracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> (Δ 0.29 mM) and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> (Δ 0.12 mM) concentrations [
 <xref rid="cit0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Given the lactate amplitude effects were negated by increasing Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> (Δ 0.35 mM) and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> (Δ 0.12 mM) concentrations, it is likely that lactate’s mechanism of action is through chelating divalent cations.

<p id="Par34">Another example for RUNX1/RUNX1T1-exerted control of an alternative TSS is provided by the 
 <italic>RPS6KA1</italic> locus. RUNX1/RUNX1T1 binds to a site in intron 1 located 12 kb downstream of TSS1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Loss of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 binding results in a threefold increase in transcript and protein levels in t(8;21) AML cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Cufflinks panel; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b, c</xref>). This increase is mainly due to the twentyfold activation of TSS2 located in direct proximity downstream of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 binding site.

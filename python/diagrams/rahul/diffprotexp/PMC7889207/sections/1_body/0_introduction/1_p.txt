0: The chronic consumption of high caloric foods leads to obesity and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [ 1].
1: White adipose tissue (WAT) is a key endocrine organ that plays an active role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in response to nutritional and environmental cues by altering lipid storage, tissue expansion through hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia and secretion of adipokines [ 2].
2: During excessive weight gain, the expansion and remodelling of WAT renders the tissue dysfunctional, leading to insulin resistance and metabolic derangement [ 2].
3: Studies in humans and rodents have shown that fat stored in visceral WAT depots is strongly linked to metabolic derangements and is associated with increased risk for obesity-associated comorbidities, possibly owing to its lipolytic nature and contribution to chronic low-grade inflammation [ 3, 4].
4: Conversely, accumulation of subcutaneous WAT appears to be protective against metabolic diseases as it is associated with a reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease when adiposity is comparable [ 5, 6].
5: However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the depot differences in disease risk remain elusive.

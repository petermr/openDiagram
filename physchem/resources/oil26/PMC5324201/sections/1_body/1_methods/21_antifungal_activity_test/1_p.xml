But PDA growth medium was used instead of NA medium. Positive control (Flucanozole 100&#160;&#956;g/mL) and essential oil containing petri dishs were incubated at 25&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#160;&#176;C for 72&#160;h. The MICs and MBCs of the selected fungi were also done by the micro dilution method as described in the antibacterial activity test.</p>

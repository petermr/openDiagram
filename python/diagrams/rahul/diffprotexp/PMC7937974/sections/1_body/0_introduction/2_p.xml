<p>Compared with the ICAM-1, E-selectin is a more effective molecule in slowing down leukocyte rolling 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which serves as the only selectin expressed by human endothelial cells during inflammatory stimulation 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and plays a more significant role in recruiting inflammatory cells in humans (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The expression levels of E-selectin can be stimulated by a series of inflammatory molecules including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1 (IL-1), or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Previous studies showed that E-selectin levels rose to peak after being stimulated by inflammatory cytokines for 4 h then gradually decreased 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Moreover, E-selectin has been shown to be involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and atherosclerosis (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A previous study found an increment of the soluble form of E-selectin (sE-selectin) in KD patients' sera in the acute phase (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and the expression of E-selectin was also observed in the coronary arteries of KD patients with CAL (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), while a few studies focused on the relationship between E-selectin and inflammatory cell adhesion in CAL formation of KD and the underlying mechanism. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to examine E-selectin levels in endothelial cells treated with KD patients' sera with or without CAL and explore the underlying mechanism involved in inflammatory cell adhesion of CAL.

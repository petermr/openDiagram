0: Graphical abstractGlycoside scutellarin enhanced inhalable   -cyclodextrin metal-organic framework particles anchoring in larynx.
1: As a proof-of-concept, dexamethasone co-delivered with scutellarin (SCU) had enhanced laryngeal deposition.
2: Laryngeal deposition of dried powders was evaluated using the Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor.
3: Molecular simulation revealed the scutellarin incorporation in CD-MOF and its effect to the surface properties.

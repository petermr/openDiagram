0: cDNA was synthesised from 500 ng of RNA using a Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
1: qPCR was performed on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers instructions.
2: Primers (see Supplementary Table  1) were designed with Primer3Plus software ( https://primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi).
3: RT-qPCR was normalised to Gapdh mRNA.
4: Three independent experiments each with replicate samples were performed for each RT-qPCR.
5: The delta-delta CT 63 method was used to analyse gene expression levels.
6: Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 6) software.
7: MannWhitney non-parametric two-tail testing was applied to determine  p values.

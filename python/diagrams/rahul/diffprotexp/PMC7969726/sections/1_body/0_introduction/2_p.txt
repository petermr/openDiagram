0: Post-transcriptional regulation is a common and vital regulatory mechanism that contributes to the diversity of gene expression.
1: Owing to the rapid development of next-generation RNA sequencing, various post-transcriptional alterations in RNA processing have been discovered.
2: In eukaryotic cells, the maturation of primary messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) involves 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) modification, removal of introns by splicing, and 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA).
3: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a general and evolutionarily conserved mechanism of transcriptional modification that involves endonucleolytic cleavage and addition of a polyadenosine tail of 200250 nucleotides that generates different lengths of the 3UTR from a single gene ( Wang et al., 2008;  Di Giammartino et al., 2011).
4: APA at the RNA 3UTR end of RNA results in various transcript isoforms that contribute to transcriptome diversity.
5: Instead of affecting the protein-coding region, the 3 UTR region contains many recognition elements for microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that affect the subcellular localization, intracellular trafficking, degradation, and translation rate of the transcripts in different cellular contexts ( Mayr, 2016).
6: Recent studies have revealed that APA is linked to changes in cellular states, including cancer and other diseases ( Gruber and Zavolan, 2019).
7: In HCC, a large number of APA events had been identified ( Xiang et al., 2018).
8: However, only a few studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of APA and tumor progression.
9: Thus, it is essential to identify the factors that control APA in HCC.

<p>This study used 3 well-characterized isogenic MtzS and MtzR lines to investigate correlates of resistance at the proteomic and post-translational levels in a genetically controlled design. Substantial genotypic variation was found in DEPs and post-translational marks. Together, these data regarding post-translational modifications as well as quantitative proteomics of protein abundance represent the most comprehensive post-transcriptional analysis of any pathogen in the context of nitroheterocyclic resistance to date and suggest Mtz resistance, at least in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>, is significantly more complex than previously thought. Our data confirm that Mtz induces significant changes within proteins in antioxidant, electron transport, and pyruvate catabolism networks in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>, of which NR-1 downregulation coincides with multiple observations at the transcript level as a universal feature among a multiplicity of isolate-specific expression profiles (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Our data also provide the first evidence to credit hypotheses that link acetylation to Mtz resistance, with increased acetylation in MtzR lines (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), as well as substantial cross-resistance to deacetylase inhibitor TSA (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Further, given the relationships between KAc, PFOR expression, and production of acetyl-CoA, we hypothesize that links exist between Mtz resistance, metabolism, and protein modifications.

<p>To characterize transgenic tobacco methylomes, we generated single-base resolution maps of DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for 6-week-old plants of both transgenic tobacco lines. Each transgenic line was sequenced with three biological replicates, and every sequencing library was produced and sequenced. It was obtained an average of 461205823 clean reads by each sample, with quality score of Q20 average of 97.73% (

This represented an average methylation level of 48.64% for CG, 42.33% on CHG, and 9.03% on CHH of the total DNA methylation levels in the transgenic line L8 (

<p>The high ionic conductive polymer PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite membranes were synthesized using the phase-inversion method, and the P2-Na
 <sub>0.66</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.5</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cathode material was synthesized via conventional solid state methods. The ionic conductivity of the membrane was experimentally verified with various temperature ranges and compared with other type separator membranes. The microstructure, pore size, and thickness of membrane were successfully estimated using software. The electrochemical performance of PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membrane was verified with P2-Na
 <sub>0.66</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.5</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cathode and sodium anode and is higher than the commercial membranes (initial discharge capacity of 178 mAh g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>). From the analyses performed in various aspects, one can elucidate that the as-prepared PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite membrane could be served as a safe and suitable separator for the upcoming sodium ion battery technologies.

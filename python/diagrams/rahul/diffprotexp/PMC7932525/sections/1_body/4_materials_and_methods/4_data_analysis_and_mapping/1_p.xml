<p>After filtering reads with an adaptor at the 3â€² end and quality values less than Q20 using Cutadapt [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], clean reads were assembled. Functional annotation was performed using five databases including Non-Redundant Protein Sequence Database (NR), GO, KEGG, and evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (eggnog) databases [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Three pairs of DEG profiles for different sample libraries (NV vs. NDH, NV vs. NDV, and NDV vs. NDH; in each paired comparison, the former was used as a control and the latter as the experimental group) were compared to identify DEGs in vegetative cells and heterocysts of 
 <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120.

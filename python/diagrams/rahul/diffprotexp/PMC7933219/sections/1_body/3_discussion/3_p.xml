<p>As we know, cancer is a complex multistep process. Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death. When tumor cells enter circulation, their metastatic potential largely depends on having a rapid and efficient way to escape from the blood stream by passing the endothelial barrier (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Francesca et al., 2020</xref>). Our transcriptome data and analysis showed us that PC-3M tumor cells influenced HUVECs during intravasation and extravasation. Endothelium morphology, DNA replication, mitochondrial components, ATPase activity, and growth-related signaling pathways were changed in endothelial cells adhered by tumor cells.

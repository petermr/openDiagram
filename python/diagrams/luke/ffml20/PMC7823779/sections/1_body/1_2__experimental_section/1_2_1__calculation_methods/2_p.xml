<p>MD was used to simulate the hydrophilic of GO and NGO. 500 water molecules were put into a cell (33.44 × 33.44 × 33.44 Å
 <sup>3</sup>) and the GO and NGO models were established in the results of the element analysis as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The simulation was carried out by the Forcite module in the COMPASS forcefield. A fixed time step of 1 fs was used in all cases and the whole runs of 1 ns duration were performed in the NPT system. Radial distribution function (RDF) and interaction energies (

<p>Mast cells are widely distributed around the capillaries under the skin and visceral mucosa, secreting a variety of cytokines, which participate in immune regulation (TB cell and APC cell activation), and express MHC and B7 molecules [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study, we found that mast cell-related genes, including 
 <italic>FCRL6</italic> and 
 <italic>IRAK-1</italic>, were highly expressed in the CE-R group. 
 <italic>IRAK-1</italic> is related to Toll-like receptors (TLRs). When oncospheres of the parasite infect the small intestinal tissue, various antigens secreted by the parasite can be recognized by mast cells through TLRs, which activate effective immune response and produce immediate inflammation. This can be evidenced by the upregulation of genes related to inflammation and chemokines.

0: Recently, Zhou et al.
1: performed phylogenetic analyses of multiple human coronavirus genomes to identify evolutionarily conserved targets for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
2: Their quantification of interactions between the human coronavirus-host interactome and subsequent gene set enrichment analyses comparing coronavirus-infected host cells and drug-treated human cells identified the SSRI paroxetine as a novel COVID-19 therapeutic candidate  [26].
3: An observational study correlated antidepressant therapy with decreased risk of intubation or death for hospitalized patients with COVID-19  [27].
4: Preliminary reports also suggest that fluoxetine demonstrates direct inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral protein expression  [28], although the present study is focused on fluoxetines anti-inflammatory activity in human pathophysiology.

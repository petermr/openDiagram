<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Locomotor activity of aardvarks over 24-h periods was biphasic, with activity typically high in the scotophase and low in the photophase, but with brief inactive bouts during the active phase, and brief active bouts during the inactive phases (as shown for a representative aardvark <italic>A08</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Patterns of activity of aardvarks varied intra- and inter-annually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Aardvarks were generally active for &#8764;8 h, but shortened their active phases to &#8764;6 h during winters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Late in our study period, aardvarks were exclusively nocturnal, typically emerging at sunset and returning to their burrows at sunrise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, early in our study period, there was substantial diurnal activity, accompanied by early returns to the burrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Occasionally aardvarks emerged as early as 8 hours before sunset and occasionally they returned to their burrows before sunset, so they had entirely diurnal activity periods. In spite of the variation in times of emergence and return, the duration of the activity period was remarkably constant, except during the winter months, when early returns to the burrows led to curtailed activity periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Shifts of the times of the start and end of activity were not synchronised, resulting in a shortening of the active phase coinciding with a shift to diurnal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

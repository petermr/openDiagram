<p>Cells were harvested from 50 ml of each culture by centrifugation (4,600 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min) and washed in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline. Total protein was extracted by resuspending the cell pellet in 75 μl of extraction buffer [62.5 mM TRIS, 10% glycerol w/v, 12 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) v/v and one Pierce Protease Inhibitor Tablet per 50 ml], heating in a water bath (95°C, 12 min) fully lysing the cells, and then centrifuging (10,500 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 5 min) to remove cell debris. Protein extracts were visualized by SDS-PAGE and trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS with a Thermo Fisher hybrid high resolution LTQ Orbitrap instrument was performed as previously described (

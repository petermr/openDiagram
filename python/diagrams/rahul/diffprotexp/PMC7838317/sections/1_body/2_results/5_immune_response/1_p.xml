<p id="Par14">Transcripts that were down-regulated included those involved in cell signaling and the immune response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The latter included the hydrolytic enzyme lysozyme and the antimicrobial peptide big defensin 1 (Table

 </sup>. Both of these transcripts were assigned the GO terms “extracellular region”, “defense response to Gram-negative bacterium”, and “defense response to Gram-positive bacterium”, and these were significantly over-represented among down-regulated transcripts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). However, not all immune related transcripts were down-regulated. Some, such as interferon-induced protein 44, had transcript variants that were both up- and down-regulated. Others, such as toll-like receptors and peptidoglycan-recognition protein, had numerous transcripts present in the transcriptome but showed no differential expression between captive and wild mussels. Although captivity seems to have affected the immune response of mussels, the varied differential expression patterns made the exact nature of the effect unclear.

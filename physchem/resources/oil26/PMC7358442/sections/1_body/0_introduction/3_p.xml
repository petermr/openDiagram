Periods of energy deficit resulting from reduced food availability or increased energy expenditure are associated with low minimum 24-h body core temperatures (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hetem et al., 2016</xref>) for many large mammal species (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Maloney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Signer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brinkmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hetem et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lubbe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Whiteman et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, large mammals exposed to water deficit in hot and dry environments exhibit high maximum 24-h body temperatures (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hetem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>), thereby reducing water loss through evaporative cooling. Such increases in the maximum 24-h and decreases in the minimum 24-h body temperatures result in increases in the amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm. Because an increased amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm, termed heterothermy, is associated with an energy deficit or water deficit or both, it reflects a disruption of the physiological well-being of large mammals in their natural environment (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, homeothermy appears to occur only in healthy, undisturbed large mammals with sufficient access to food and water (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hetem et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

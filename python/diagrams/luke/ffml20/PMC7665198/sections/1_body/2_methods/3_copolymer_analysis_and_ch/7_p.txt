0: Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) analysis was conducted using Agilent Carry 680 ATR-FTIR single-beam spectrometer set at 4 cm 1 resolution with 64 scans/spectrum (19).
1: To analyze the water content of a damaged copolymer as a function of exposure time, 50/50 p(MMA/nBA) 0.5  0.5  0.03-cm films were damaged (20 vertical and horizontal cuts ~3050 m in depth) and were allowed to heal in water.

0: The phosphorylation of histone H3 by PirB was determined using Western blot analysis by treating primary shrimp hemocytes with rPirB.
1: Briefly, hemocytes were collected and cultured, followed by treatment with different concentrations of His-rPirB or His-rPirA (0.2 M or 0.8 M) at 28C for 2 h. Next, cells were lysed for 10 min at room temperature with lysis buffer (containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA-Na 2  2H 2O, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS and 1 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche, Switzerland) before being centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 15C to collect the supernatant.
2: The collected supernatant was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot, as described in subsection 2.2, with mouse anti-histone H3 antibody (1:1000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China), and rabbit anti-phospho histone H3 (Ser10) antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA).

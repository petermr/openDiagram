<p>Other proteins defined as “stress-related responses”, including heat shock proteins (HSPs), were significantly differentially expressed. Three different HSPs (HSP-70, HSP-83 and HSP-90) were detected in the hemocytes of infected snails, and their expression was down-regulated at 24 and 48 hpi, whereas only HSP-70 was found in plasma, and its expression was up-regulated at 24 and 48 hpi. It has been previously reported that the expression levels of HSP70 were down-regulated in

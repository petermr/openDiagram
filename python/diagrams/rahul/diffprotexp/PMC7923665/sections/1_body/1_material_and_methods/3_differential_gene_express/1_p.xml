Genes were classified as up- and downregulated genes based on their log fold change (FC) value calculated by FC = Log2 (treated/control) formula. A heat map was constructed to show the level of gene abundance. The heat map was constructed using the log-transformed and normalized value of genes based on Euclidean distance as well as based on the average linkage method.

<p>A typical inclusion particle in steel was analyzed by EPMA as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Several AF plates emanated from the surface of the inclusion. The oxide core was rich in Ti and O, as well as a lesser amount of Ca; MnS precipitated on the local surface. The Ti–Ca–O–Mn–S-type complex inclusion was predominant in the Ti–Ca deoxidized steel and was effective for AF nucleation. The development of Mn-depleted zones through both Mn absorption into Ti–oxide and MnS precipitation was the main factor promoting AF nucleation. A decrease in the Mn content around the particles will result in a reduction in austenite stability and increase the driving force for ferrite transformation. Thus, ferrite nucleation will first occur on intragranular particles leading to the formation of an interlocking AF microstructure.

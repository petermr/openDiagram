<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The compounds were identified using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass detector GC/MS (GCMS-QP 5050&#8201;A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The injector and detector temperatures were 220&#8201;&#176;C and 300&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The initial column temperature was 40&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8201;min, with a programmed temperature increase of 3&#8201;&#176;C/min to 300&#8201;&#176;C where it was maintained for 25&#8201;min. The split mode ratio was 1:10. One microliter of the garlic essential oil containing 1% (w/v in dichloromethane) was injected, helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate constant of 1.8&#8201;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> on the Rtx<sup>&#174;</sup>-5MS capillary column (30&#8201;m, 0.25&#8201;mm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;0.25&#8201;&#956;m; Bellefonte, USA) using the Crossbond<sup>&#174;</sup> stationary phase (35% diphenyl-65% dimethyl polysiloxane). Mass spectrometer was programmed to detect masses in the range of 29&#8211;450&#8201;Da with 70&#8201;eV ionization energy. Compounds were identified by comparisons of the mass spectra with those available in the NIST08, NIST11 library and Wiley Spectroteca Data Base (7<sup>th</sup> edition), and by the Retention indices.</p>

<p id="Par69">A hallmark of the NSC to MNP transition was the accumulation of receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erB-4 (
 <italic>ERBB4</italic>) transcripts. ERBB4 is activated by epidermal growth factor proteins, neuregulins2/3, to shape the development of neuronal cells through activation of MAPK3/ERK [

 </sup> channels, glutamate ionotropic receptor (

<p>TRIzol reagent (Takara bio, Otsu, Japan) was used to extract total RNA from cells or human tissue following the standard process. All-in-One First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA) was used to synthesized cDNA. qRT-PCR was performed on ABI 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems, USA). LncRNA and mRNA levels were detected by using the Sybr Green PCR Master Mix and miRNA levels were detected by using Miscript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany). LINC00466, PPP1R14B and miR-137 were normalized to GAPDH and U6, respectively.

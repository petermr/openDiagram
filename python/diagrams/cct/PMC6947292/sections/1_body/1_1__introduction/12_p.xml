<p>The experimental methods derived can generally be applied to nearly any metallic precipitation-hardening alloy system. Since most of the metrological aspects have been published in great detail in two book chapters [

 <xref rid="B84-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], the experimental aspects are condensed to their key features in this review. The materials science aspects are summarised in this work, involving a substantial number of alloys and thousands of individual experiments. The kinetics and nature of quench-induced precipitation are analysed for a total of 27 alloys, comprising 24 wrought alloys (two AlSi binary alloys, 10 AlMgSi alloys, 10 variants of AlZnMg(Cu) alloys and two AlCu(Mg) alloys) and three AlSiMg cast alloys. The enthalpy changes from quench-induced precipitation are quantified, and the drop in hardness is evaluated in terms quench-induced precipitation. Other properties are not focused on, because the small size of DSC samples does not permit materials tests that require large volumes. In some cases, larger samples with similar temperature/time paths as DSC samples are prepared and mechanically tested.

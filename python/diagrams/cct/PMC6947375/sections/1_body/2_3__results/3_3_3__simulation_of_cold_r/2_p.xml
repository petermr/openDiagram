 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f010">Figure 10</xref> shows the distributions of equivalent stress (a1–a4) and strain (b1–b4) during cold rolling of the 0.10C-1.50Cr steel. It could be seen from the cross-sectional view that the equivalent stress and strain significantly increased with increasing passes. Interestingly, the equivalent strain was the largest at the corner of the plate after the fourth pass (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f011">Figure 11</xref>. First, the stress and strain increased with increasing passes. Second, at the beginning of each pass, the stress and strain increased with increasing depth from the surface to a depth of ~3 mm, and subsequently, the values decreased with increased depth. The largest stress and strain were 830 MPa and 0.6 at a depth of 3 mm after the fourth pass of the 0.10C-1.50Cr steel. The accumulated stress and strain in the top layer were potentially caused by severe plastic deformation, as well as attrition rendered by the rollers, leading to the occurrence of dense LAGBs on the top layer.

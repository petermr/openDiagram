<p>In parallel with the above analysis in males, we studied the expression patterns of GluN2 subunits in the L4/L5 spinal cord of juvenile female rats. From a qualitative perspective, the relative intensity and localization of GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D immunoreactivity across dorsal horn laminae were similar between males and females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). In females, GluN2A immunoreactivity was diffusively distributed at neuropil, with robust and approximately equal staining intensity across the SDH and DDH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(b</xref>), left and Suppl. Figure 2). GluN2B immunolabelling was also found throughout all laminae of the dorsal horn, but both cell bodies and neuropil exhibited GluN2B immunoreactivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(b</xref>), middle and Suppl. Figure 4). In terms of the overall intensity of GluN2B staining, there appeared to be a slightly stronger GluN2B signal in the CGRP+ SDH compared to the DDH. Unlike GluN2B, GluN2D immunoreactivity was similar in overall intensity across the SDH and DDH of female rats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(b</xref>), right and Suppl. Fig. 6). This is a divergence from male staining, where GluN2D was preferentially localized to the SDH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a</xref>), right). However, the subcellular pattern of immunopositivity for GluN2D in female spinal cord was similar to that of GluN2B, with labeling of both neuropil and cell bodies (

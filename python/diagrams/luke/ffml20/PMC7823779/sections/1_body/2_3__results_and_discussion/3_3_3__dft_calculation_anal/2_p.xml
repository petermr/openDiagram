<p>For the convenience of describing each atom, these function groups have been labeled, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. O
 <sub>3</sub> is the oxygen atom of epoxy in the center of NGO and O
 <sub>4</sub> is the oxygen atom of epoxy in the edge. O
 <sub>5</sub> and O
 <sub>6</sub> are oxygen atoms of hydroxyl in the edge and center of NGO respectively. The results in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show that the epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the edge are more vulnerable to electrophilic attacks than the groups on the surface.

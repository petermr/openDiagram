<p>4’,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) were used to visualize NifH expression in the filaments of 
 <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120. DAPI is a fluorescent dye that can tightly combine with DNA. Our second antibody of NifH was labeled with FITC. DAPI and FITC emitted blue and green fluorescence after excitation respectively. Under nitrogen-replete condition, filaments consisting of only vegetative cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g007">Fig 7A1–7A4</xref>), and weak green fluorescence of vegetative cells were detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g007">Fig 7A3</xref>). Under nitrogen deprivation conditions, in filaments consisting of vegetative cells and heterocysts, there was one heterocyst in every approximately 10 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g007">Fig 7B1–7B4</xref>). Compared with vegetative cells cultured under nitrogen-replete conditions, the green fluorescence intensity of vegetative cells cultured under nitrogen deprivation conditions was clearly stronger (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g007">Fig 7A3 and 7B3</xref>), indicating that nitrogen deprivation induced the expression of NifH. Under nitrogen deprivation conditions, the green fluorescence of vegetative cells was not lower than that of heterocysts. Thus, there was almost no difference in the NifH expression level between vegetative cells and heterocysts under nitrogen deprivation conditions.

 <caption> Scatter chart of differential expression genes between groups. Figure 2A shows differential expression genes between the CE-R and CE-NR groups. Figure 2B shows differential expression genes between the CE-R and CK groups. Figure 2C shows differential expression genes between the CE-NR and CK groups. X-axis and Y-axis presents two samples log2 value of gene expression, and the expression was calculated using the RPKM method (reads per kilobase transcriptome per million mapped reads) as shown in section “Materials and methods”, red (up) and green (down) dots mean the gene has significant differences (FDR ≤ 0.001, two fold difference), and the blue dot means no significant differences. </caption>

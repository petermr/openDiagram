 <caption> Alternative splicing profiles regulated by CPSF1 in HepG2.2.15 cells. (A) GSEA plot showing the correlation between high CPSF1 expression and spliceosome functions. Black vertical lines indicate the gene that correlated with CPSF1 in the gene set. (B) Pie chart illustrating the distribution of various types of AS events affected by CPSF1 knockdown as revealed by analysis of RNA-seq data. (C) Scatterplot showing the differential AS events identified between the CPSF1-silenced and control groups. (D) Barplot listing the top 10 significantly enriched GO biological processes. (E) Proteinâ€“protein interaction network showing the interaction between CPSF1 and related proteins. The top significant interactions with confidence &gt; 0.95 in the STRING database are included. The size of the nodes and line width indicate the interaction degree and confidence, respectively. </caption>

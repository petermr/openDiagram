<p>In summary, the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich composites were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. PEO with non-shared ether-oxygen electron pairs firstly bridged the separated 2D ultrathin rGO nano-sheets into a remarkable 3D layered spatial structure, and then the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nano-flowers were homogeneously grown on the surfaces of rGO hosts by 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> conversion. This unique 3D flower-like sandwich structure has more active sites and large volume change accommodation. The 3D flower-like composites highlighted high energy density and remarkable cycling stability, and excellent conductivity. Their discharge capacity was retained at 1036 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> even after 500 cycles at current densities of 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. This novel structure design of anode material provides new ideas for improving the electrochemical performances of other metal sulfides.

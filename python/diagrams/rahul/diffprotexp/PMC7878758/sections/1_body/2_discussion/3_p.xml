<p id="Par20">The upregulated gene expression analysis were found associated with muscle tissue development and wound healing processes. Previous research works related to tail regeneration in lizards have listed c-myc upregulation plays a vital role in regeneration mechanism

 </sup>. In thisstudy we have listed BIN1 gene responsible for differentiation

 </sup> also related to c-myc interaction and expression. This suggests that genes are mostly involved in wound healing phase in the timepoints and presence of BIN1

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> gene expression might interact with c-myc in later stages. BIN1 is myc-interacting gene which inhibits the expression of c-myc

 </sup>. This could help in optimal expression of c- myc proliferation in further blastemal and regenerating phases.Â This might indicate controlled expression of c-myc is initiated from preliminary stages and would associate with AEP formation or blastemal stage in latter phase. Also, HOX-D13

 </sup> gene known for its limb morphogenesis found to be downregulated in all timepoints which interact with shh(another developmental associated gene)

 </sup> and initiates limb development process. Some other genes like MYOD1, TNNI1, ACTC1 are involved in myogenesis were found to be upregulated in 5-dpa, 2-dpa and downregulated in later timepoints respectively

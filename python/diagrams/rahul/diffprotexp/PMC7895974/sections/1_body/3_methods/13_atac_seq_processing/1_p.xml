 </sup> and no issues were highlighted from the QC process. Subsequent read alignment and post-alignment filtering was performed in concordance with the ENCODE project’s “ATAC-seq Data Standards and Prototype Processing Pipeline” for replicated data (

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup>. The resultant Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) files were compressed to the Binary Alignment Map (BAM) version on which SAMtools (v.1.9)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup> was used to filter reads that were unmapped, mate unmapped, not primary alignment or failing platform quality checks. Reads mapped as proper pairs were retained. Multi-mapping reads were removed using the Python script assign_multimappers provided by ENCODE’s processing pipeline and duplicate reads within the BAM files were tagged using Picard MarkDuplicates (v.2.18.12) [

For each step, parameters detailed in the ENCODE pipeline were used. From the processed BAM files, coverage tracks in bigWig format were generated using deepTools bamCoverage (v 3.1.2)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup> (parameters -f BAMPE -g mm -B -nomodel -shift -100 -extsize 200). Coverage tracks and peaks (narrow peak format) were uploaded to the UCSC Genome Browser

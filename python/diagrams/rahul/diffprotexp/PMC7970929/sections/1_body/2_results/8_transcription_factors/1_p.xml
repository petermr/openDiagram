<p id="Par22">The total DEGs encoding transcription factors (TFs) increased with higher level of salinity i.e. 841, 1613 and 1623 at ECe 30 dS/m, 40 dS/m and 50 dS/m, respectively. These TFs mainly belong to various families such as BTB/POZ, WRKY, MYB, NAC, DREB, 
 <italic>AP2-EREBP</italic>, 
 <italic>bHLH</italic>, 
 <italic>bZIP</italic>, 
 <italic>MADS</italic>, and 
 <italic>SBP</italic>. The DEGs encoding Myb-related protein Myb4 (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN37753_c2_g1_i9) and Myb family protein-like (DN35501_c2_g1_i2) were found to be up-regulated under ECe 30 dS/m, 40 dS/m and 50 dS/m salinity (Supplementary file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The TFs are also considered as important regulators under salt stress. The expression of transcription factor 
 <italic>WRKY40</italic> (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN39291_c1_g1_i1) decreased with an increase in salinity level while the expression of ABA-responsive proteins (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN33328_c2_g1_i1) were found to be up-regulated with stress as reported in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>

 </sup>. It indicated that 
 <italic>WRKY40</italic> may act as a negative regulator for ABA-responsive genes. In 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic> too, the expression of 
 <italic>WRKY</italic> was found up-regulated under salinity.

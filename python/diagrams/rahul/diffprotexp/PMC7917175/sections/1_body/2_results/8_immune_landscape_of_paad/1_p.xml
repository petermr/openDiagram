 <bold>)</bold>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b, the horizonal axis was correlated to various immune cells, of which effector memory CD8 T cells, type 1 T helper cells and T follicular helper cells showed the most negative correlation, whilst the vertical coordinate was mostly negatively associated with immature DCs. The integral distribution of IS1 was opposite to that of IS4 and IS5. In addition, the same subtype also displayed opposing distribution, indicating significant intra-cluster heterogeneity within subtypes, especially within IS2 and IS3. Based on the location of immune cell populations, IS1, IS4 and IS5 were each further divided into two subsets

 <bold>)</bold>, and the enrichment scores of several immune cells were significantly different between subsets

 <bold>)</bold>. For example, IS1B showed lower counts of activated B cells, activated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, activated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, effector memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while IS4B scored lower in terms of activated B cells, activated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, effector memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, regulatory T cells and MDSCs. Thus, the mRNA vaccine may be relatively viable in IS1B and more effective in IS4B. Furthermore, samples with extreme distributional positions in the immune landscape were subjected to prognostic comparison and patients in group 6 showed the best survival probability, which is consistent with aforementioned results

 <bold>)</bold>. Taken together, the immune landscape based on immune subtypes can precisely identify immune components of each PAAD patients as well as predict their prognoses, which is favorable for selecting personalized therapeutics for mRNA vaccine.

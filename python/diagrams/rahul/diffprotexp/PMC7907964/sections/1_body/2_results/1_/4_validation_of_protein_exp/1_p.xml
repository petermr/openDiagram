<p>To validate proteins identified by label-free quantitative proteomic analysis, the levels of certain selected proteins were determined by western blotting. Specifically, four proteins, including ANXA2, RPL18, TUBB and COL1A1, whose expression levels were highly altered based on the bioinformatics analysis, were selected and analysed in pooled fibroblast samples from healthy controls and in fibroblasts from individual patients with PD carrying 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants. The levels of ANXA2 and RPL18 were upregulated, whereas COL1A1 levels were not different in fibroblasts of patients with PD carrying 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants compared with the levels exhibited by the healthy control fibroblasts (

 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants in comparison with the levels exhibited by the healthy control fibroblasts (
 <xref rid="f3-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). ACTB was used as a protein loading control (

 <xref rid="f3-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The expression levels of selected proteins based on densitometry analysis were consistent with those obtained by the label-free quantitative proteomic analysis (
 <xref rid="f3-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f3-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).

<p id="Par23">For H-NS, the N-terminus has stronger interactions with ERY than its C-terminus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), as found in the earlier simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, because H-NS has more time to adapt to the presence of ERY in this SMD setup, the rupture force becomes weaker. At

 <sub>max</sub> the COM distance between ERY and residue 5 is minimal (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), but in contrast to ErmCL, the weak interaction between the C-terminus of H-NS and ERY (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, note the ~5-fold smaller interaction force in this figure compared to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>) allows H-NS to bypass ERY easier. The importance of the C-terminus in H-NS’s ability to evade inhibition by ERY was also confirmed experimentally by Kannan

<p>A thin slice (30mg) of each frozen lung tissue sample was taken using a razor blade and immediately placed into 0.6 ml of buffer RLT (Qiagen, Germany) on the surface of a sterile Petri dish to start lysis. Once in the lysis buffer, the piece of tissue was chopped with the razor blade to multiple smaller pieces and placed into a 1.5 ml tube (Eppendorf) and vortexed thoroughly to help homogenization. In order to reach the finest homogenization, samples were centrifuged through the QIAshredder spin column (Qiagen). Centrifugate was diluted 1/1 with 70% alcohol and RNA extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To eliminate residual genomic DNA contamination, on-column DNAse digestion was performed using RNAse-Free DNAse Set (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After elution, RNA was checked for RNA concentration and contamination using NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and tested for RNA integrity, using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA USA) according to manufacturers’ instructions. Extracted and quality checked RNA was stored at -80°C until used in further procedures.</p>

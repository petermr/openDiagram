<p>Based on available studies in male rodents, three of the four GluN2 isoforms are expressed in the dorsal horn – GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both transcript [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and protein [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] levels for GluN2C have been found to be either negligible or undetected in the dorsal horn, including recent findings using single-cell sequencing approaches [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite molecular and functional evidence for GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D expression in the dorsal horn [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17–24</xref>], there are considerable discrepancies on the relative localization of these subunits across dorsal horn laminae as well as their contributions to responses at dorsal horn synapses. Reconciling results between these individual studies is often challenging given different types of functional measures (e.g. spontaneous and evoked synaptic responses versus agonist-evoked responses), a lack of investigation into contributions from all possible GluN2 subunit types, and variations between the subpopulations of dorsal horn neurons under study. An unbiased approach is therefore urgently needed to compare the relative expression and localization of GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D across the dorsal horn in both sexes. Given the emerging roles for specific NMDARs, such as GluN2B, in pathological spinal pain processing [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], this information will provide a foundational understanding on baseline expression of NMDAR subunits for future studies into how their dysregulation may drive chronic pain.

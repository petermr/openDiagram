0: Using freshly isolated CD11b + cells, which consist of both CNS infiltrating macrophages and brain resident microglia from the brains of mice that had been systemically treated with LPS in the presence and absence of the K V1.3 blocking peptide ShK-223, Rangaraju  et al.
1: confirmed that K V1.3 inhibition reduces expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 but showed that K V1.3 inhibition also reduced expression of TAP1 and prevented upregulation of EHD1 in CD11b +CD45 low microglia as measured by flow cytometry [ 26].
2: Both TAP1 and EDH1 are proteins that are involved in MHC class-I assembly and trafficking to the cell surface.
3: The authors therefore next investigated the effect of ShK-223 treatment on MHC class-1 expression on acutely isolated microglia, and, based on reduced MHC expression, hypothesized that LPS-induced increases in the antigen presenting capacity of microglia are K V1.3-dependent processes, suggesting that K V1.3 inhibition could reduce antigen presentation to CD8 + cytotoxic T cells.
4: In a subsequent weighted co-expression network analysis applied to microglial transcriptomic datasets from neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease mouse models the same group identified K V1.3 as part of a pro-inflammatory gene signature that also included Tlr2, Ptgs2, Il12b, Il1b, CD44, NFB, Stat1, and RelA [ 27].
5: K V1.3 blockade with ShK-223 could shift this pro-inflammatory signature to one with increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes in disease associated microglia.
6: What is interesting in this context, is that Kv1.3 inhibitors have been reported in other studies to further increase the migration of cultured microglia stimulated with the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 [ 28] and to not affect microglial phagocytosis of microbeads [ 26] or to even increase phagocytosis of amyloid- [ 7].

<p>After euthanization by cervical dislocation, mouse brains were dissected on ice and collected cortices were lysed and homogenized in 350 μL lysis buffer (RLT Buffer, Qiagen) using the VWR Pellet mixer (VWR, Dietikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was isolated on spin columns with silica-based membranes (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland), following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted with 30 μL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Two hundred ng of purified RNA was reverse transcribed in a volume of 50 μL using the RT High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on cDNA obtained with the Applied Biosystems ViiA
 <sup>TM</sup>7 (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) Real-Time PCR System using Power SYBR Green Taq polymerase master mix (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Primer sequences used for mRNA quantification were directed against

 <italic>β-Actin</italic> mRNA used as an endogenous control (See 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-01566-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for sequences). For data analysis, the raw threshold cycle (CT) value was first normalized to the endogenous control for each sample to obtain the 
 <sup>Δ</sup>CT value. The normalized 
 <sup>Δ</sup>CT value was then calibrated to the control cell samples to obtain the 2
 <sup>−</sup>
 <sup>ΔΔCT</sup>.

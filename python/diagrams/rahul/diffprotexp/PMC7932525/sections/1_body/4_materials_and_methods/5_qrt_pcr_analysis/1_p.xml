<p>DEGs obtained by Illumina sequencing were verified by qRT-PCR. The RNA samples used for qRT-PCR were identical to those used for the DEG experiments. cDNA was synthesized using the TUREscript One Step RT-PCR Kit (Aidlab) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers were designed using Premier 6.0 software (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and synthesized commercially (Sangon Biotech Shanghai Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) (

The 20-μL reaction mixture contained 1 μL cDNA template, 1 μL each primer (10 μM), and 10 μL 2× SYBR Green qPCR (Aidlab); qRT-PCR was performed using the 2× SYBR Green qPCR kit (Aidlab) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and relative expression levels of the genes were calculated by the 2

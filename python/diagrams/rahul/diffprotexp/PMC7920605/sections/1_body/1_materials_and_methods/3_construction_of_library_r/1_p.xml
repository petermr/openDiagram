<p>MH7A cells were digested with trypsin and centrifuged to collect cell precipitates, and the total RNA was extracted by the Total RNA Rapid Extraction Kit (TR205-200, Tianmo, China). The RNA after processing was determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, United States), and the RNA concentration was detected by a NanoDrop one (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). VAHTS mRNA Capture Beads was used for capturing poly (A) RNA, which was fragmented by VAHTS 2X Frag/Prime Buffer. Some of the fragments were used for constructing the RNA-seq library with the VAHTS mRNA-seq V2 Library Prep Kit for Illumina, and others were used for the MeRIP-seq library following the instructions of the EpiMark N6-Methyladenosine Enrichment Kit. The obtained libraries were quantified by Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and then sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina), and the sequencing process was entrusted to Origin-Biotech Inc (Ao-Ji Biotech, Shanghai, China).</p>

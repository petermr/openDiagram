<p>As can be seen from the specific precipitation enthalpies in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f066">Figure 66</xref>C, the total precipitation process is increasingly suppressed with rising cooling rate. The specific precipitation enthalpies of both alloys are relatively similar. For the two AlCu(Mg) alloy variants considered here, the UCCR could not be determined by in situ cooling DSC. At the fast rates measured with DSC (3 and 5 K/s, respectively), relatively high specific precipitation enthalpies of about 7 J/g are still detected. Supplemental hardness testing after various cooling rates and subsequent ageing shows hardness saturation levels at cooling rates of above 10 K/s for 2219 and 20 K/s for 2024. These rates can therefore be considered the UCCRs for these alloys for the purposes of technological applications. It is noteworthy that although the UCCRs for the two alloys are similar, the loss in hardening potential (due to quench-induced precipitates) is more severe for 2219. Hence, the achievement of high hardness values over the whole thickness of a thick plate is restricted to a reduced maximum thickness compared to 2024.

<p>Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has had devastating effects on shrimp culture in the last couple of years [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the extensive research work that has sought to understand the causative agent (s) and factors that promote AHPND, the diseaseâ€™s pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms involved are still not well understood [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that the AHPND strain of 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> does affect not only the gastrointestinal system of shrimp (i.e. hepatopancreas, stomach, etc.) but also hemocytes to dysregulate the expression of apoptosis-related genes [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the current study sought to explore the effect of AHPND on shrimp hemocytes, especially the effects and potential mechanism of action of the Pir toxin proteins on hemocyte apoptosis.

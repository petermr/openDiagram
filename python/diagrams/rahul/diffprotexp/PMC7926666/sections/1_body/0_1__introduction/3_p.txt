0: The differential interactome methodology is based on the idea that significant alterations occur in the proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) among phenotypes.
1: The success of this approach has been effectively demonstrated in various cancers and their subtypes [ 8, 9, 10].
2: The differential interactome approach made it possible to estimate the probability distributions for any possible co-expression profile of gene pairs (encoding proteins that interact with each other) across phenotypes and to determine the uncertainty of whether a PPI is meeting the corresponding phenotype.

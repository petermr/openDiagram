<p id="p0095">Recent work from our group demonstrates antidepressant-mediated inhibition of IL6 and NF-KappaB signaling pathways limit organ damage, decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine production, decrease intracellular migration of early-stage inflammatory response, and improve animal survival after an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The present study further supports the potential of antidepressants like fluoxetine to prevent cytokine storm severity and reduce the risk of severe organ dysfunction and death for COVID-19 patients. Indeed, preliminary reports from a multi-site fluoxetine clinical trial in France 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, as well as our groupâ€™s ongoing fluoxetine clinical trial in America (NCT04377308) provide encouraging results suggesting fluoxetine treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

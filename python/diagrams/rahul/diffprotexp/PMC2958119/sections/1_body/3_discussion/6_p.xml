<p>Proteins with binding function like the heat-shock protein family are known to play vital roles in apoptosis reduction 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Omholt1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, as our larvae samples were grown in a normal colony, the presently identified ERp60 and heat shock protein 8 are most likely to act as molecular chaperones in a living cell to make sure that the cellular proteins could function correctly 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Randolt2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Interestingly, both larvae did not upregulate nutritional storage proteins at 72 hours, however were over-expressed at 120 hours in both. This is in line with the case for 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> which exhibited increased expression of larval serum protein 2 during the 3rd larval instar through midway to the pupal stage for the subsequent proteolytically degraded amino acid supply, which are necessary activities for the completion of pupae and adult development

<p>miRNAs showed common and coordinated expression patterns in this differential pigmentation and reduced proliferation induced in melanoma B16F1 cells. We identified potential targets of miRNAs by prediction with TargetScanMouse (

 <italic>Tyrp1</italic>, or 
 <italic>Dct</italic>) were involved in melanin synthesis. miRNAs presented changes in their expression and targeted genes associated with controlling the cell cycle and senescence as expected (

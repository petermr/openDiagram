<p>To facilitate the reading/analysis of chip-array grids in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, appropriate clusters were defined. Two representative cy3-labeled fluorescence subarrays are reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, c, showing a significant increase of IF in POAG subarrays (B) with respect to post-mortem ones (C). The non-parametric Mann–Whitney two-sided 
 <italic>U</italic> test was employed to select factors of significant value. The full data are available in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, including single fold cut-offs and 
 <italic>p</italic> values (&gt;two fold changes and 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.00083) provided in clusters as follows: cytokines; neurotrophins, fibrogenic and angiogenic factors; chemokines/adhesion molecules; ECM metabolism, metalloproteinases and tissue-inhibitory factors and other molecules, including soluble receptors and some referring proteins. A total of 32 out of 60 potential candidates were significantly associated with POAG. Most of them were represented by cytokines (IL10, IL6, IL5, IL7, IL12p40/70), chemokines (VCAM1, MIP1α/δ) and growth factors (TGFβ1, VEGF), showing high expression levels (&gt;five fold) in POAG TMs, as compared to non-glaucomatous ones (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00083; Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test). Moreover, IL16, IL18 and ICAM3 showed negative values, as compared to controls (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00083; Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test). Regarding the ECM enzymes, a significant expression was detected for MMP2 while a low expression was quantified for MMP7 and TIMP1 (&gt;two fold changes; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00083; Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test). No difference in protein profile expression was observed between the two IOP-lowering subgroups (Group 1 and Group 2; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.00083, Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test), nor between the two different surgical approaches (trabeculectomy and phacotrabeculectomy; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.00083, Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test).

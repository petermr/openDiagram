<p>In the present study, isolated MSCs from bone marrow and 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH MSCs were differentiated into dopaminergic neurons using an induction medium containing SHH, bFGF, and FGF8. The 
 <italic>me</italic>_SWH MSCs were obtained from human bone marrow MSCs by modification of genes in the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway by targeting DNA hypermethylation. We subsequently examined changes in the proteomes of MSCs throughout neuronal differentiation. The signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of dopaminergic differentiation of MSCs were also investigated. Differentially expressed proteins and signal proteins in MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways were quantified by western blotting. We believe that understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal differentiation is crucial for the application of MSCs for cell therapy for the treatment of neurological disorders.

<p>A graphical representation of the network structure of the proteins in the two groups of patients for RAS signaling pathway in HNSC is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In this figure, two proteins are connected if the connectivity score between them is significantly large. Different colors and shades in the figure represent positive or negative correlations and the thickness of the lines represents the strength of the associations. A visual inspection reveals some obvious differences in the network connectivity between the two groups of patients. It can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> that the protein MET has very high connectivity with the proteins GAB2 and MAPK1 in the “progression” group, whereas no such connectivity can be seen between them in the “complete remission” group. On the other hand, MET can be seen to be connected with NFKB1 and BAD in the “complete remission” group but no such connectivity can be seen in the “progression” group. Also, it is interesting to note that MET has 100% connectivity with RAF1 in the “complete remission” group. The protein GAB2 appears to be highly connected with MAPK9 in the “progression” group but no connectivity can be seen between them in the “complete remission” group. GAB2 is also connected with PRKCA only in the “progression” group. Further, GAB2 has 100% connectivity with MAPK1 in the “progression” group. In the “progression” group, MAPK1 and BAD are connected among themselves and also with EGFR, which is further connected with KIT. But no such interesting connections can be seen in the “complete remission” group. Summarizing, GAB2, MAPK1, MET, and BAD show noticeably different connectivities in the two networks. The corresponding genes are known oncogenes. GAB2 is known to be overexpressed in multiple human tumors especially in melanoma. It is altered by MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. MET is associated with MET signaling process. In many cancers involving solid tumors, inhibiting this signaling has major therapeutic effect [

0: Stage tips were packed with two punches of C18 mesh (Empore) by using the blunt end of a 16-gauge needle as described [ 25], and were then conditioned with 50 L methanol (MeOH), followed by 50 L 50% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA, and finally, the tips were equilibrated three times with 75 L 0.1% TFA.
1: The nuclei digest was loaded onto the C18 resin by spinning at 3500  g. Thereafter, 100 L freshly prepared HEPES, pH 8, with 2 L of TMT reagent (from stock) was passed over the C18 resin at 350  g until the entire solution had passed through.
2: After TMT labeling, the C18 resin was washed twice with 75 L 0.1% TFA and peptides were eluted with 50 L 50% ACN/0.1% TFA followed by a second elution with 50% ACN/20 mM ammonium formate (NH 4HCO 2), pH 10.
3: After using 5% of the elution volume to determine labeling efficiency, the samples were mixed prior to fractionation and analysis.

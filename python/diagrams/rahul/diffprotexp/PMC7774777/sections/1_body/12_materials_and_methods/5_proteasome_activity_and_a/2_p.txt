0: Native gels were performed similarly to as has previously described ( 44).
1: Tissues were snap frozen and ground into powder with a pestle and mortar.
2: Tissue powders (~50 L) were then triturated using a 25G syringe on ice in native tissue lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (ph8.0), 5 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM ATP) with 3 1-second vortex pulses.
3: Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 4C for 25 minutes at 20 000 g. Clarified supernatants were transferred to a new tube and quantified as described above.
4: Twenty micrograms of protein was loaded per well along with 6 native protein loading buffer (Biorad cat # 1610738) into a 4% to 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (Biorad cat # 5671094) in native running buffer (90 mM Tris base, 90 mM boric acid, 5 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP-MgCl 2), and resolved for 3.5 hours at 100 V on ice.
5: The gel was then soaked in transfer buffer (25 mM tris base, 192 mM glycine) containing 1% SDS for 5 minutes, then soaked for 10 minutes in transfer buffer without SDS.
6: Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer at 250 mA for 90 minutes on ice.
7: The membrane was then probed for the 5 proteasome subunit (Enzo life sciences cat.
8: no.
9: BML-PW8895-0025) as described above for Western blot.

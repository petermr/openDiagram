 </sup>. In this current study, the dataset is generated by varying the composition of CaO, SiO
 <sub>2,</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in a uniform fashion. This is to ensure that the data points from all possible regions in the ternary diagram are equally represented. To obtain a representative dataset, the data are split into training (80%) and test set (20%). The hyperparameters are tuned by implementing fivefold cross-validation. At every fold in cross-validation, the training data is further divided into 80% of the training set and 20% for validation. The errors (training error and validation error) calculated from each fold are averaged to represent the average model error. The performance of the model is then evaluated on the unseen test dataset. In this study, a good correlation between the test values and the predicted values is obtained as can be observed from the results presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Thus, the dataset can be considered representative. Besides, completeness of the dataset is ensured here by choosing all the possible ranges of the Ca/Si ratio for C–S–H observed experimentally. Moreover, the consistency of the dataset is carefully maintained by following the same C–S–H model construction, molecular loading conditions, and elastic constant evaluation procedure within the high throughput MD simulations for all the C–S–H compositions. Thus, the overall adequacy of the dataset is ensured by careful implementation of all the four above-mentioned criteria during the dataset generation and model training/testing procedure.

<p id="Par13">Quantitative real-time PCR was employed in this study to validate the mRNA level of selected genes. Primers used for the amplification of these target genes were listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. According to our previously established method
 <sup>

 </sup>, real-time PCR was conducted on CFX96 real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a total volume of 20 μL with 13.2 μL Milli-Q water, 2 μL RT product, 1 μL single PCR buffer, 0.5 μL DMSO, 0.4 μL 2 mM each dNTP, 0.3 μL 20 μM primer, 0.3 μL Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 1 μL EvaGreen (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). The specificity of PCR amplification was first checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and then subjected to sequencing for checking the identity of all PCR products. The amplification condition of real-time PCR was as follows: pre-denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, then with 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s. The mRNA level of these target genes was first normalized as the ratio to the housekeeping genes

<p>To systematically characterize the expression of the three relevant GluN2-NMDAR subunits within the SDH versus DDH regions of the dorsal horn, we performed qualitative and quantitative immunohistochemistry on fixed spinal sections of male and female juvenile rats. Through a combination of pepsin antigen-retrieval and signal amplification techniques, we were able to detect GluN2 subunits at synaptic, extrasynaptic, and somatic loci within the dorsal horn. Finally, we examined the relative distribution of these GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D NMDAR subunits across the mediolateral axis of the SDH.</p>

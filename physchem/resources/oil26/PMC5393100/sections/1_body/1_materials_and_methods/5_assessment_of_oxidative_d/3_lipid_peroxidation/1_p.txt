0: Evaluation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was performed using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances.
1: Trichloroacetic acid (20%) was mixed with defrosted plasma, and the residual was reacted with 0.05 M sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4).
2: 2-thiobarbituric acid was then mixed with the solution, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min in boiling water bath.
3: Extraction of the final solution was performed with n-butanol, and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm (ELISA reader, Biotek, Germany).
4: [ 22]

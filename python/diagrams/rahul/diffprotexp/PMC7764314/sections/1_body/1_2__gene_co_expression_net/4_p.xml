<p>Biological networks are intrinsically modular [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with genes belonging to the same module usually sharing common functions [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Identifying modules across multiple networks can help in discovering patterns, and shed light on the underlying mechanisms of biological systems. In particular, much interest has been directed to the identification of shared modules in different conditions, and also in cancer biology [

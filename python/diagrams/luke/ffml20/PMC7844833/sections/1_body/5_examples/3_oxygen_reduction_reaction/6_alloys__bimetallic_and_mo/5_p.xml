<p>A concern in the applications of Pd-containing catalysts in fuel cells is the possible uptake of hydrogen (used as fuel) that can crossover through the membrane to the cathode and form Pd hydride (as discussed in 
 <xref rid="sec6.1.3" ref-type="other">Section 
  <xref rid="sec6.1.3" ref-type="other">6.1.3</xref>
 </xref>), thus affecting the durability of the catalyst. However, as demonstrated by Wise et al.,
 <sup>

 </sup> a Pt monolayer on top of a Pd NP core provides efficient protection toward hydride formation. In fact, Pd hydride formation was prevented even if the Pt shell is incomplete (e.g., only a half monolayer of Pt is deposited). In their work, while in pure Pd NPs the Pd–Pd distance, extracted from

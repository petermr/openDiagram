0: A methanolic solution of DPPH was prepared (stock solution) at a concentration of 40 g.mL -1, which was kept under the light.
1: The essential oils were diluted in methanol at concentrations of 5, 2.5, 1, 0.75, 0.50 and 0.25 mg.mL -1.
2: For the evaluation, there were added into a test tube 2.7 mL of the stock solution of DPPH, followed by addition of 0.3 mL of the essential oil solution.
3: The white of the solution was prepared, this being a mixture of 2.7 mL methanol and 0.3 mL of a methanolic solution of each EO concentration evaluated.
4: After 30 min.
5: on a spectrophotometer (Biospectro SP-22), readings were performed at a wavelength of 517 nm [ 13].
6: The assay was performed in triplicate and the calculation of percentage of antioxidant activity (% AA) was calculated with the following equation:  (%AA)=100{[(AbssampleAbswhite).100]Abscontrol}

<p>It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2.

 </sup> However, we did not consider the role of TMPRSS2 for host prediction, due to the following reasons. First, TMPRSS2â€™s role for priming Spike may be replaced by some other proteases like cathepsin B and L.

 </sup> Second, different from ACE2 which is used as a binding receptor only, TMPRSS2 cleaves Spike through chemical catalysis. Thus, to quantify the impact of TMPRSS2, its catalytic activity for cleavage needs to be predicted; this is, however, an impossible task to achieve at present, as almost all protease cleavage predictors were trained to predict cleavage sites for one known protease of one species.

 </sup> Third, TMPRSS2 proteases from different species may be similarly efficient. This is supported in part by the fact that wild-type mice are insusceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while transgenic mice that express hACE2 can be infected,

 </sup> suggesting that mouse TMPRSS2 may be sufficiently efficient at cleaving Spike. Besides, a recent study showed that computational modeling failed to distinguish the binding capability of TMPRSS2 from different animals.

 </sup> As a result, we believe that it may be reasonable to ignore TMPRSS2 for host prediction.

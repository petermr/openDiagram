<sup>2</sup>, the difference in sample area between the burrow entrance and the other two microsites meant that differences in species richness between microsites in the arid scrubland had to be interpreted cautiously (since species richness is an area-dependent metric, and is therefore underestimated in the burrow entrances relative to the other two microsites in the arid scrubland). However, the soil and other vegetation characteristics are not dependent on sample area and still provide for robust comparisons between microsites in that study site.

<p>Plasmid pEF-Bos-FLAG RIG-I MIII was a gift from Curt Horvath (Addgene plasmid # 52877;

 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], was transiently expressed in HEK293-T. The cells were transfected with the plasmid and a negative control (empty vector) in 6-well plates using polyethyleneimine (PEI) [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Cells were infected with SLEV at a MOI of 0.01 48 h after transfection and supernatants were collected at time points 24 h and 48 h post-infection to quantify the viral load. Expression of transfected FLAG-RIG-I was confirmed by anti-FLAG Western blot using a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma). Anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Abcam.

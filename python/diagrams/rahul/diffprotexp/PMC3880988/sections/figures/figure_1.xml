  <p>Immunophenotyping of MSCs and ACs. MSCs expressed cell surface markers CD29 (1A) and CD44 (1B). CD45 was absent in MSCs (C). AC showed the expression of ECM: type-II collagen (1D) and proteoglycan (1E) secretions. Type-I collagen was absence in the AC monolayer culture (1F). (Magnification: 100X in 1A, B, C, D and F; 200X in 1E).</p>

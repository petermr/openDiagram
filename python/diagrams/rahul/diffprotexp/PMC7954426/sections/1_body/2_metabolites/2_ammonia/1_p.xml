<p>Urease is the first metabolic enzyme found in ureaplasmas. Some ureaplasmas, such as 
 <italic>U. urealyticum, U. parvum</italic>, and 
 <italic>U. diversum</italic> express urease, which can hydrolyze urea to produce ATP and simultaneously produce CO
 <sub>2</sub> and NH
 <sub>3</sub> [

 <xref rid="cit0102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0138" ref-type="bibr">138â€“140</xref>]. Ureaplasmas lack the ability to assimilate NH
 <sub>3</sub> to glutamine and glutamate, leading to increased pH in the surrounding environment, thereby exerting toxic effects and tissue injury [

 <xref rid="cit0140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Other potential pathogenic effects of NH
 <sub>3</sub> production including fatal hyperammonemia syndrome and the formation and precipitation of struvite in the urinary tract [

 <xref rid="cit0201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. A study also showed that the urease activity of 
 <italic>U. urealyticum</italic> was higher than that of 
 <italic>U. parvum</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting that 
 <italic>U. urealyticum</italic> may trigger more severe localized pathological damage.

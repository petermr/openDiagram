<p id="Par3">Captive holding of animals in zoos or other specialized facilities is a common and important conservation strategy

 </sup>. Freshwater mussels are also often translocated to different habitats or brought into captive holding facilities for temporary refuge and propagation to mitigate damage from in-stream construction activities, toxic river spills, and zebra mussel infestations

 </sup>. These ex situ management efforts are powerful tools used to maintain or increase biodiversity, but may also cause stress for the animals, making them more vulnerable to factors that directly contribute to translocation failure, such as starvation, disease, and reduced reproductive capacity

   <bold>KPNA3/4 assisted viral replication of FAdV-4 in LMH cells</bold>. (a-b) Overexpression of KPNA3 and KPNA4 increased viral replication in LMH cells. (a) LMH cells were first transfected with pcDNA3.1-KPNA3, pcDNA3.1-KPNA4 and pcDNA3.1, respectively. 24Â hours after transfection, the LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4, and the supernatants collected from infected LMH cells at indicated time points were then titrated with TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. The overexpression of KPNA3 and KPNA4 in LMH cells were examined with western blot by polyclonal antibodies against KPNA3 (b-a) and KPNA4 (b-b). (c-d) Knockout of KPNA3 or KPNA4 inhibited viral replication in LMH cells. (c) KPNA3-KO LMH cells, KPNA4-KO LMH cells and LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4, and the supernatants collected from infected LMH cells at indicated time points were then titrated with TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. The expression of KPNA3 and KPNA4 in KPNA3-KO and KPNA4-KO LMH cells were examined with western blot by polyclonal antibodies against KPNA3 (d-a) and KPNA4 (d-b), respectively. All experiments were done in triplicates and repeated twice

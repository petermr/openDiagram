<p>In addition, we evaluated whether the hub RBPs-based risk model has similar prognostic value in another tongue cancer patient cohort. We included 97 tongue cancer patients from GSE41613, designated as GEO test group, into the risk score analyses. Similarly, we found that patients with a high-risk score also showed a poor OS than those with a low-risk score in the GEO test group (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). In addition, the AUC score of 0.692 also showed a moderate diagnostic performance (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E). The expression heatmap of hub RBPs, survival status and risk score of patients were displayed in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>F. These results again suggested that the prognostic model derived from the hub RBPs-based risk score has well sensitivity and predictability.

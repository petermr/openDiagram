<p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting experiments to further elucidate proliferative phenotypes. As described below, we performed new IHC experiments for SOX2 and Ki67/PH3 labeling from the same animals and re-analyzed our initial results as recommended. The revised version of the manuscript better characterizes progenitor cells and provides stronger evidence of reduced mitosis at E17.5 following MIA (See response 1c below).</p>

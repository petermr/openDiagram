<p>The addition of ι-carrageenan to PVA determines a decrease in the pore size and density of the PC5 and PC12 hydrogels, as also determined from the

 <xref rid="polymers-12-01544-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, calculated from the cyclohexane uptake values. A more compact surface can be observed with increasing carrageenan content, probably due to a substantial decrease in the free water content in the gelling systems and to the stabilization effect of CAR, which interferes with the phase separation process during freezing. The decrease in pore size with the increasing amount of polysaccharide has also been observed for PVA/chitosan blend hydrogels above 40 wt % chitosan [

 <xref rid="B62-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] or PVA/gelatin [
 <xref rid="B63-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] hydrogels prepared through cryogelation. Even if the water diffusion coefficients increase proportionally with the ι-carrageenan content, the equilibrium swelling values do not increase following the same trendline, because the reduced porosity provides less diffusional pathways for water penetration into the hydrogel network, and retards the release of antibiotics from the hydrogel in the relaxation step.

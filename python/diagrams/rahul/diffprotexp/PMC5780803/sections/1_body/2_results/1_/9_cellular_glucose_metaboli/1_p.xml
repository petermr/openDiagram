 <xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> demonstrates that two proteins, LDHA and transketolase (TKT), were involved in cell glucose metabolism. These two proteins were downregulated at 0 h (ratio &lt;0.5) and upregulated at 0.5 and 3 h (ratio &gt;1.5; 
 <xref rid="f7-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). TKT, a thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme, catalyzes several key reactions of the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. TKT catalyzes the conversion of D-pentose (xylulose and ribose) 5-phosphate into D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (

LDHA is a glycolytic enzyme that is catalyzed into a pyruvate lactic acid enzyme, existing in almost all tissues; it serves a key role in the regulation of the conversion of glucose fermentation and aerobic oxidation. In a previous study, the tumor cells exhibited the characteristics of anaerobic fermentation and inhibition of mitochondrial aerobic oxidation (

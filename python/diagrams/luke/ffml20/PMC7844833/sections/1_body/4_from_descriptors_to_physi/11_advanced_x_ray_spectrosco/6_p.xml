<p>One of the main limitations of XAS-based methods is the ensemble averaging, that is, the collected signal is averaged over all absorbing species, which may exist in nonequivalent environments. This issue can be addressed by exploiting the anomalous X-ray diffraction phenomenon. In the latter, if the X-ray diffraction pattern is collected with X-rays whose energy is close to the absorption edge energy, the intensities of the XRD peaks are strongly energy-dependent. This observation is useful for element-specific analysis to discriminate between the contributions of different species to the total X-ray diffractogram and can be used for studies of multielement catalysts.

 </sup> The sensitivity to the local structure can be further enhanced by scanning the energy of the incident X-rays. In this case, the intensity of the X-ray diffraction peaks is modulated analogously to the X-ray absorption coefficient. By following the variations in the intensity of an XRD peak that corresponds to a specific crystallographic site, site-specific diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS) signals can be collected, which can be then analyzed in the same way as a conventional XAFS spectrum. For instance, this approach allows one to analyze separately the structure of ordered and disordered states of the material,

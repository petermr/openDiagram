<p id="Par32">The LTO (Li
 <sub>4</sub>Ti
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>) is an active material that is being considered for application in Li-ion batteries
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. This material does not form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer because its working voltage occurs at a sufficiently high potential (1.55â€‰V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>). Moreover, the LTO qualifies as a zero-strain material because it remains stable during the insertion/deinsertion of lithium
 <sup>

 </sup>. Similar to the LFP, the LTO is a relatively inexpensive material and therefore a perfect candidate for the production of low-cost batteries.

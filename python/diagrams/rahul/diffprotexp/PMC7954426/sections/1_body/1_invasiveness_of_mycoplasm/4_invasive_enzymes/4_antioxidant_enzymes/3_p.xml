<p>Theoretically, some glycerol-utilizing mycoplasmas, such as 
 <italic>M. iowae</italic>, can produce H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> during glycerol metabolism, but no detectable H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was produced under various experimental conditions; this may be interpreted as being due to the existence of a catalase. Indeed, Pritchard et al. successfully cloned the active catalase, katE, which can catalyze the degradation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> efficiently [
 <xref rid="cit0154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. The results illustrate that catalases can protect the mycoplasmas from environmental H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and are beneficial for its survival in the host. Similar catalases also exist in 
 <italic>M. arginini</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Furthermore, there are studies speculating that SOD activity exists in some mycoplasmas but currently, no SOD coding genes are available in the fully sequenced mycoplasmas, although the SOD gene appears to be unique to 
 <italic>M. haemofelis</italic> among the mycoplasmas [
 <xref rid="cit0157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. These antioxidant stress molecules can antagonize oxidative stress damage to varying degrees, making it beneficial to circumvent the immune system.

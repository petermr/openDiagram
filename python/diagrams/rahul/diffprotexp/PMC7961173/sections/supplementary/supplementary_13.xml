   <p>Supplementary file2 Effects of DCVC on cellular proliferation. For cellular proliferation experiments, HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0 (control), 10 μM or 20 μM DCVC for 6 or 12 h. Cellular proliferation was measured by labeling nucleic acids with Cyquant fluorescent dye. Fluorescence signal, measured by a micro plate reader, was proportional to the number of cells in each well. Bars represent means ± SEM. Proliferation was analyzed by two-way ANOVA (no significant interaction) with posthoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons. N=3 independent experiments for each time point, with 5 replicates per treatment in each experiment (TIF 176 KB)</p>

 <italic>NF1</italic> loss of heterozygosity is thought to be the initiating event in CNF and PNF formation, making 
 <italic>NF1</italic> the most commonly mutated gene in these tumors. Other genetic alterations have also been described but are inconsistent between and across tumor types. Previous genomic studies observed that approximately one third of CNFs exhibit focal chromosomal imbalance; however, there were no consistent chromosomal microstructure alterations among the samples analyzed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Expression profiling studies have yielded mixed results as to whether CNFs and PNFs can be distinguished based on gene expression alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is important to note that these studies were not powered specifically to address differences between CNFs and PNFs, but rather focused on distinguishing PNFs and MPNSTs. Even though CNFs and PNFs arise in distinct anatomic sites, mouse models have demonstrated that CNFs and PNFs share a common cell of origin in Schwann cell progenitors (i.e., skin-derived precursor (SKP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or GAP43 + PLP + precursors) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Currently, it is not well understood how tumor microenvironment impacts neurofibroma progression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], however inflammation from 
 <italic>NF1</italic> haploinsufficient mast cells is requisite for PNF development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Prior work examining epigenetic modifications in CNFs and PNFs has also been confounded by the lack of tissue- and patient-matched controls, which are not always available in the context of 
 <italic>NF1 </italic>deficiency. Thus, there are insufficient data to adequately explain why CNFs and PNFs exhibit such distinct clinical behavior.

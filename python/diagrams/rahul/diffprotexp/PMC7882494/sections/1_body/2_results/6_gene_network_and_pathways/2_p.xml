<p>The KEGG pathways established from the DAVID analysis indicate the intervention of COL11A1 and associated genes in the ECM-receptor interaction (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), Protein digestion and absorption (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>), Focal-adhesion (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>), and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The PathwayMapper tab in cBioPortal servers shows the alteration frequency of COL11A1, THBS2, COL10A1, COL5A2, and COL1A2 over the various pathways on the colorectal cancer dataset using a white to red color scale where the more frequently altering gene shows greater intensity of the red color (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A–D</xref>). COL11A1 associated alteration mainly induces changes of PTEN (8.1%), PIK3CA (24.8%), KRAS (37.4%), and BRAF (10.8%) for regulation of RTK-RAS-PI3K signaling pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>); APC (66.7%) in regulation of Wnt signaling pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>); SMAD4 (15.5%) for TGF-β signaling pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>); and ATM (12.5%) and TP53 (53.0%) in alteration of TP53 pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) to proliferate the cancer development.

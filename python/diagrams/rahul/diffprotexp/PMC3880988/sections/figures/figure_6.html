 <caption> Typical 2-DE protein profile of (A) MSC, (B) AC, and (C) cMSC. 100 Î¼g of protein cell lysate were conducted on 24 cm IPG strip (pH 3-10) and 12.5% SDS-PAGE. 2-DE gels were visualized via silver staining. The differentially expressed proteins studied are depicted on the gels. Gels were stained with silver nitrate and image analysis was performed using Nonlinear Progenesis SameSpot software. </caption>

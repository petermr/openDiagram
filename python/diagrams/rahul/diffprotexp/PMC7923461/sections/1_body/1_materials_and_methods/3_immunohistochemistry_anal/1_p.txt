0: An immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was conducted as previously described [ 15].
1: Briefly, the LUAD samples were deparaffinized and rehydrated.
2: The primary antibody was that against TUBA1C (1:100 dilution; ab222849; abcam).
3: The positive expression of TUBA1C was localized in cytoplasm.
4: The scoring criteria for IHC staining were based on the intensity of the stain and the percentage of immunoreactive cells, as previously described [ 15].

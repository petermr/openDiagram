<p id="Par26">To reveal the phenotype-associated protein dysregulations, herein the prefrontal cortical proteomes of the stressed rats were comparatively profiled using an iTRAQ-based quantitative approach. Compared with the unstressed controls, 212 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the prefrontal cortex of depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible rats. The overlapping protein expression changes between the two susceptible groups potentially represented the shared molecular patterns of depression and anxiety disorders. Those similar dysregulations between the insusceptible and anxiety/depression-susceptible groups were considered as general CMS-responsive protein alterations. Interestingly, the distinctly dysregulated proteins in the three stressed groups might represent the differences between the CMS-induced behavioral phenotypes. The clustering analysis also demonstrated that the three CMS-exposed cohorts exhibited distinctive protein dysfunctional profiles. These proteomics data would facilitate studies to uncover protein systems, and pathways related to susceptibility and resilience to stress-induced anxiety or depression.</p>

For example, Baji, the male aardvark, used the warthog scented towels almost twice as much as the three females. Baji&#8217;s response could have been due to sex differences that a small sample size made difficult to explore, or his response could be due to individual preferences. Regardless of the reason, it would be advisable to use caution when applying these results to other aardvarks. Ultimately, welfare and preferences are both individual concepts, and what is successful for one individual or group may not hold for another [<xref rid="B35-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

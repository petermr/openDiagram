<p>The ultimate aim of this study was to explore global gene expression controlled in vitro experiments. The study included analysis of transcriptome data based on statistical significance and ranking methods (RRA). Analysis of collected data offers valuable insight, biologically and clinically, to adipogenesis in a systematic fashion. Non-treated and treated MEFs showed distinct cell morphology, based on lipid accumulation, and expression of 
 <italic>aP2, Lpl</italic>, and 
 <italic>Adipoq</italic>. This finding is reflected in transcriptome data, where correlation analysis, according to distance heatmap and PCA plots, showed tight clustering between samples and corresponding replicates. The largest differences were found among treatment conditions and, to a lesser extent, with time. Thus, global changes do occur in the presence of inducers, as previously described.

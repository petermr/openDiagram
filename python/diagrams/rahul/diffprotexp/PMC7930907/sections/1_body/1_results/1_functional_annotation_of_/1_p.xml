<p>To explore the functional differences of SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs, 720 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EASCs and SASCs (FC &gt;2.0, adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic>-value (FDR) &lt;0.05, 497 downregulated, and 223 upregulated), and 688 DEGs between PASCs and SASCs (FC &gt;2.0, FDR 0.05, 468 downregulated, and 220 upregulated) were found by RNA-Seq. Using Metacore system, the top 10 different enrichments in pathway maps, GO processes, and process networks of DEGs in EASCs and PASCs are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figures 1A,B</xref>. In addition, the top scored network analyses of DEGs in EASCs were involved in regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation (25.6%), regulation of cell population proliferation (48.8%), digestive system development (20.9%), positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation (18.6%), and positive regulation of developmental process (44.2%). Whereas, DEGs in PASCs were most involved in negative regulation of GTPase activity (12.0%), negative regulation of hydrolase activity (24.0%), oncostatin-M-mediated signaling pathway (8.0%), leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathway (8.0%), and regulation of hydrolase activity (34.0%) (

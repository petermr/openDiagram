 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> Mtz-resistant (MtzR) and Mtz-susceptible (MtzS) lines were previously generated at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research via long-term sublethal exposure to Mtz in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. All lines are the Assemblage A genotype, include the genome reference genotype WB (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] 50803), and have been extensively characterized in the literature in the context of Mtz resistance (reviewed by Ansell et al. [

 <italic>In vitro</italic> culture for the 3 genotypes and drug selection for their resistant, isotype lines (TableÂ 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>) were continued in this study; protein was extracted from adherent, viable trophozoites. Protein was prepared for quantitative proteomics via tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling to establish fold change between each MtzR line compared to their drug-susceptible parent line. A total of 3 TMT experiments were performed, 1 for each genotype and its respective isotype and biological triplicates. Each TMT experiment and its fractions were analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo). Ratios of TMT labels detected in each Mtz-resistant to Mtz-susceptible replicates were calculated using Proteome Discoverer software v1.3 (Thermo). The mass spectrometry raw data files, database search results, and TMT ratios have been deposited and can be accessed for free via the ProteomeXchange Consortium [

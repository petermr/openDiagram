 </sup> propose that under moderate levels of environmental stress, metabolism may increase to meet additional energy needs, while severe levels of stress tend to cause metabolic depression. In the prior scenario, long-term survival of the organism is possible, while in the latter scenario it is not. The up-regulation of energy-producing pathways in

Increased ATP production may be necessary for the synthesis of the aforementioned stress proteins, antioxidants, and other compounds involved in homeostatic maintenance.

<p id="Par11">Microsatellite genotyping via fragment analysis was performed using AmpFLSTR Identifiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit run on an 3730XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Waltham, MA, USA). DNA for 8 tetranucleotide repeat loci and the Amelogenin sex determination marker were identified. The short tandem repeat profile generated for our cells was compared to the short tandem repeat profile for cells identified as HTR-8/SVneo (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-3271™) by ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> (2015) (Manassas, VA, USA). The short tandem repeat profile was an exact match: CSF1PO: 12, D13S317: 9,12, D16S539: 13D5S818: 12, D7S820: 12, TH01: 6,9.3, vWA: 13,18, TPOX: 8, Amelogenin sex determination marker: X (ATCC 2015).

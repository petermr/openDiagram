<p>To verify the electrochemical stability of the SSYs as current collectors, electrochemical performance of these yarns will be discussed in the section. As shown in

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of SSYs in the voltage range of 2.0–3.7 V imply no obvious redox peak at different scan rates of 5, 10, 20, and 50 mV·s
 <sup>–1</sup>. Because the SSYs are not involved in the electrochemical reaction of the electrodes in the voltage range, their suitability as a flexible substrate for a yarn-shaped LIB is confirmed.

0: Human neuronal tissue lacks regenerative capacity, leaving few treatments available following neuronal injury or neurodegeneration.
1: In the past decade, an interest in direct neuronal reprogramming of stem cells into motor neurons (MNs) has emerged as a solution to generate human neuronal tissue for therapeutic applications.
2: MNs form synapses to potentiate electrical signals from the CNS into peripheral tissues.
3: They play a critical role in the formation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), where MN axons terminate on muscle fibers and neurotransmitters are released to trigger muscle contractions.
4: NMJs are cholinergic synapses, where the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the presynaptic MN terminal for uptake by postsynaptic ACh receptors on the target muscle cell [ 1].
5: This critical function is disrupted in neurodegenerative motor neurons diseases like as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

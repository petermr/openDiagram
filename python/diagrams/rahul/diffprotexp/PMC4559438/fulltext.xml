Congenital and acquired cholesteatomas progress quite differently from each other and progress patterns can provide clues about the unique origin and pathogenesis of the abnormality. However, the exact pathogenic mechanisms by which cholesteatomas develop remain unknown. In this study, key proteins that directly affect cholesteatoma pathogenesis are investigated with proteomics and immunohistochemistry. Congenital cholesteatoma matrices and retroauricular skin were harvested during surgery in 4 patients diagnosed with a congenital cholesteatoma. Tissue was also harvested from the retraction pocket in an additional 2 patients during middle ear surgery. We performed 2-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis to detect and analyze spots that are expressed only in congenital cholesteatoma and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) to separate proteins by molecular weight. Protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. The image analysis of 2D electrophoresis showed that 4 congenital cholesteatoma samples had very similar protein expression patterns and that 127 spots were exclusively expressed in congenital cholesteatomas. Of these 127 spots, 10 major spots revealed the presence of titin, forkhead transcription activator homolog (FKH 5&#x02013;3), plectin 1, keratin 10, and leucine zipper protein 5 by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that FKH 5&#x02013;3 and titin were expressed in congenital cholesteatoma matrices, but not in acquired cholesteatomas. Our study shows that protein expression patterns are completely different in congenital cholesteatomas, acquired cholesteatomas, and skin. Moreover, non-epithelial proteins, including FKH 5&#x02013;3 and titin, were unexpectedly expressed in congenital cholesteatoma tissue. Our data indicates that congenital cholesteatoma origins may differ from those of acquired cholesteatomas, which originate from retraction pocket epithelia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Bio &#x00026; Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &#x00026; Future Planning (2013M3A9D5072551) and Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (grant number) R11-2007-040-02001-0.

The presentation and progress of congenital cholesteatoma are quite different from those of acquired cholesteatoma. Congenital cholesteatomas commonly appear as pearl-like epidermoid cysts, mostly located in the antero-superior quadrant behind an intact tympanic membrane [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These cholesteatomas can have invasive growth and cause osteolysis [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of congenital cholesteatomas seems to be different from acquired cholesteatomas, which usually arise from the retraction pocket of the pars flaccida of tympanic membrane and have attic destruction [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several pathogenic mechanisms of congenital cholesteatoma have been suggested, including epithelial rests from faulty embryogenesis, invagination or implantation of squamous epithelium, and metaplasia of middle ear epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These suggested pathogenic mechanisms are based on temporal bone histology studies [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There have been several studies that investigated differences in molecular properties between congenital and acquired cholesteatomas. Upregulation of P21, shorter telomere length, increased surviving expression, and absence of ICAM-1 expression and LFA-1 positive cells have all been suggested to play a role in congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis. Unfortunately, their exact roles have not been fully identified [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These studies investigated several target proteins, but no reports have identified differences in molecular expression between congenital and acquired cholesteatoma by mass screening of proteins in each tissue, largely because of the lack of an ideal animal model and a limited number of specimens, which restricted basic molecular and biochemical research on congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.</p><p>Here, we investigate differences in protein expression between congenital and acquired cholesteatomas using proteomic analysis (for protein mass screening) and immunohistochemistry. Our data suggest that protein expression patterns in congenital cholesteatomas are quite different from those in acquired cholesteatomas and skin. The results of our study may provide clues that allow for a better understanding of congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Tissue harvest</title><p>Patients were enrolled in this study after they or their parents provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Severance Hospital.

A relatively small number of studies have been published on congenital cholesteatoma. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have used proteomics to investigate congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.</p><p>Our study showed that protein spot 2-DE distribution patterns of congenital cholesteatoma are consistent among specimens and completely different from acquired cholesteatoma. Many proteins (127 spots) were exclusively expressed in congenital cholesteatoma, and not found in EAC skin or acquired cholesteatoma. Proteins that we did not expect to be expressed in fully differentiated epithelial cells were titin (gi|407139), forkhead transcription activator homolog (FKH 5&#x02013;3, gi|477361), ryanodine receptor 2 (cardiac), and isoform CRA_c (gi|119590477), all of which are expressed in mesodermal tissues [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Several theories have been proposed regarding congenital cholesteatoma origin, including the &#x02018;epithelial rest theory&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the &#x02018;invagination theory&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137011.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the &#x02018;implantation theory&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although it remains unclear which theory best describes congenital cholesteatoma etiology, all theories insist that congenital and acquired cholesteatoma have different origins. Aquired cholesteatoma generally arise from a pars flaccida retraction pocket.</p><p>Unexpected expression of non-epithelial protein in our experiments contradicts the epithelial rest theory where the congenital cholesteatoma arises from ectodermal derivatives from the first epibranchial placode, as found in various vertebrates. Among the 10 most abundant proteins exclusively expressed in congenital cholesteatoma tissues, FKH 5&#x02013;3 was most interesting. Expression of this protein was also confirmed in congenital cholesteatoma by immunohistochemistry. Forkhead proteins, a family of transcription factors, play pathophysiologic roles in regulating expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity. Forkhead proteins regulate embryonic development mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and are expressed in hematopoietic stem cells that originate from the mesoderm and regulate lymphocyte development [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has also been reported that forkhead transcription factors can be a downstream target of the Akt/PKB pathway, which is activated by microRNA 21 upregulation and subsequent apoptosis inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The presence of FKH 5&#x02013;3 might indicate abnormal cell growth and be the pathogenic origin of congenital cholesteatoma.</p><p>Another distinctive finding of our study was expression of titin in congenital cholesteatoma. Titin is exclusively expressed in muscle [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and originates from the mesoderm, where it plays a key role in vertebrate striated muscle assembly and function. Recent studies also found that titin is expressed in chromosomes and has functions related to oncogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137011.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We found that titin matched the major spots found in proteomic analysis on congenital cholesteatoma samples and was also strongly expressed in cholesteatoma matrices, as shown with immunostaining. The role of these proteins remain unclear in pathophysiology of congenital cholesteatoma, but we suggest it may be involved in congenital cholesteatoma cell proliferation.</p><p>Although several markers indirectly suggest pathogenic mechanisms of congenital cholesteatoma, our study has two main limitations. First, proteomics studies have inherent limitations. The amount of expression was determined only by image analysis, which could have differed if a more delicate experimental method was used. Therefore, there could be more abundant proteins that exclusively exist in congenital cholesteatoma. In addition, we only investigated the 10 most abundant spots identified in 2-DE analysis. However, there could be more important proteins that play a larger role in congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis. We were only able to theorize congenital cholesteatoma pathogenic mechanisms using exclusive protein expression found by proteomic analysis. However, no information was gained on the role or importance of identified proteins in pathogenesis, which require animal models and/or in vitro cell culture systems. Second, limitations arose from working with harvested tissue. Congenital cholesteatoma tissue forms a cystic pearl, which was properly washed. Therefore, there should have been little contamination from surrounding tissue. However, sample contamination by middle ear mucosa cannot be completely excluded in acquired cholesteatoma because acquired cholesteatomas are located in retraction pockets and strongly adhere to middle ear mucosa. There also could have been contamination with blood even though surface blood was removed by extensive tissue washing (5&#x02013;6 times in normal saline until blood no longer visible).</p><p>Even with these limitations, our proteomic study on congenital cholesteatoma tissue provides some clues on cholesteatoma pathogenesis. It is tempting to speculate that the origin of congenital cholesteatomas differs from that of acquired cholesteatomas, which originate from tympanic membrane epithelium. This study provides justification for future research on congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to acknowledge technical support from Yonsei Proteomie Research Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteomix.org/">www.proteomix.org</ext-link>).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0137011.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

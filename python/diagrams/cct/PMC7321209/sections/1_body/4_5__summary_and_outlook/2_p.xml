<p>In WAAM, the adaptation of CTWD is a simple and highly efficient approach, which can be applied as inline processing strategy in order to regulate energy input during the build-up process. Furthermore, the processing strategy can be used for wire arc additive manufacturing of work pieces with tailored properties within the built structures. Herein, dimensional and microstructural modulations can be implemented.</p>

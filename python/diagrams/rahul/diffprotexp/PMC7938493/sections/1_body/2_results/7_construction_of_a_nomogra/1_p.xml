<p id="Par57">To establish a quantitative prediction method for evaluating BLCA prognosis, we constructed a nomogram based on the eight independent prognosis-associated RBPs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The point scale in the nomogram was used to assign points to each variable. We drew a vertical line to determine the points for each variable and summed the points of all variables to calculate the total points for each patient, which was then normalized to a distribution of 0 to 100. Hence, we could estimate the survival rates of BLCA patients at 1, 2, and 3 years by calculating the total points for each patient by drawing a vertical line between the total point axis and each prognosis axis. This approach may help clinicians to make clinical decisions for BLCA patients.

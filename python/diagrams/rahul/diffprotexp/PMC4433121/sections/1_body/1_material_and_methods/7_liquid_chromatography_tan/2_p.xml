<p>The MS/MS data was searched using Sequest under the software platform Proteome Discoverer 1.3.0.339 (Thermo Scientific) against the Swissprot_human_20121008.fasta protein sequence database using one 99% peptide confidence as cut-off. A precursor mass tolerance of 15 ppm, and product mass tolerances of 0.02 Da for HCD-FTMS and 0.8 Da for CID-ITMS were used. Further used settings were: trypsin with 1 missed cleavage; IAA on cysteine as fixed modification and iTRAQ 8plex on lysine and N-terminal and oxidation of methionine as variable modification and phosphorylation of serine, threonine or tyrosine as variable modifications. Probabilities for phosphosite localization (within each phosphopeptide) were calculated using the phosphoRS node of Proteome Discoverer. Quantitation of iTRAQ 8plex reporter ions was performed by Proteome Discoverer on HCD-FTMS tandem mass spectra using an integration window tolerance of 20 ppm and false discovery rate was estimated using percolator (part of PD 1.3) for false discovery rate cut-off. The LC-MS/MS data was deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium [

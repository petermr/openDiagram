0: In the absence of shrimp cell lines, nucleosomes used to analyze nucleosome proteins interaction with PirB were purified from  Drosophila Schneider 2 cells (a kind gift from Jianguo He of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China).
1: First, nuclear fractions were extracted as described previously with slight modifications [ 26].
2: Cultured S2 cells were collected, centrifuged, and washed twice with cold 0.01 M PBS.
3: Cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, 2 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM PMSF, pH 7.5), incubated on ice for 5 min followed by the addition of 5.0 L of 20% Triton-X-100 and the shearing of cells by passing through a 21 G needle with a 1 ml syringe at least 10 times.
4: Next, samples were incubated on ice for 5 min before being centrifuged at 3,000 g for 4 min at 4C to collect the pellet as nuclear fraction.
5: After purifying the nuclear proteins, samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4C and then incubated at 37C with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase, NEB, Beijing, China) for 90 min.
6: The supernatant was collected for gel filtration chromatography (SupersoseTM 6 increase 10/300 GL, GE healthcare, CT, USA) on an AKTA pure 25 system (GE healthcare, CT, USA).
7: Finally, all separated components were collected and analyzed using SDS-PAGE or Native-PAGE and Western blot, as described in subsection 2.2, with mouse anti-histone H3 antibody (1:1000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China).
8: The obtained nucleosome proteins were used for subsequent experiments.

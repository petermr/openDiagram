<p id="Par59">The plant material was a wild type (WT) of a dwarf banana ‘Aifen No. 1’ (
 <italic>Musa</italic> spp. Pisang Awak sub-group ABB) and its semi-dwarf mutant (MT). The MT was obtained from tissue-culture induced somaclonal variations in Aifen No. 1 WT at Institute of Fruit Tree Research, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, China by the corresponding author of this article (Professor Ou Sheng). The specimens used in this study have neither been reported nor submitted in any herbarium. The MT and WT were grown in nutrient-soil for four weeks of rooting and two days of hardening. After this, the seedlings were grown to reach five to six leaf stage (6 weeks old). The relative humidity, temperature, and photoperiod were 28 °C, 60 ~ 80%, and 12 h (1500 ± 200 lx), respectively. After six weeks, the banana plantlets had five to six true leaves. Triplicate pseudostems for WT as well as for MT were then cut and used for transcriptome and metabolome analyses (Fig.

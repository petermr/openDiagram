<p>Several cancers show a tendency for decreased sialidase-1/NEU1 expression. Interestingly, sialidase-1/NEU1 expression and metastatic ability present a good inverse relationship. Cells transformed by oncogenic v-fos transfection show a severe decrease in sialidase activity and acquired higher lung metastatic potential 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. In addition, the introduction of sialidase-1/NEU1 into Bl6 melanoma cells resulted in suppression of experimental pulmonary metastasis and tumor progression, with a decreased anchorage-independent growth and increased sensitivity to apoptosis 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. Our findings showed that TNFÎ± significantly reduced the level of sialidase-1/NEU1, suggesting that the decreased sialidase-1/NEU1 may induce enhanced anchorage-independent growth and anti-apoptotic signals.

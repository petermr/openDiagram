    "Within the oocytes of chicken preovulatory follicles, the engulfed yolk constitutes 99% of the oocyte content, while the small germinal disc (GD) (which contains the nucleus and 99% ooplasm) occupies only less than 1%. Relative to the position of the GD, the single granulosa cell layer surrounding the oocyte can be sub-divided into two sub-populations: granulosa cells proximal (named Gp cells) and distal (Gd cells) to the GD. It was reported that Gp cells and Gd cells differ in their morphology, proliferative rate and steroidogenic capacity, however, the underlying mechanism controlling granulosa cell heterogeneity remains unclear. Here we analyzed the transcriptomes of Gd and Gp cells of preovulatory (F5 and F1) follicles in chicken ovaries. We found that: (1) genes associated with cell cycle and DNA replication (CDK1, CCNB3 etc.) have comparatively higher expression levels in Gp cells than in Gd cells, while genes associated with steroidogenesis (CYP51A1, DHCR24) are highly expressed in Gd cells, indicating that Gp cells are likely more mitotic and less steroidogenic than Gd cells; (2) genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion and sperm binding (ZP3, ZP2) are differentially expressed in Gp and Gd cells; (3) Furthermore, signaling molecules (WNT4/IHH) and receptors for NGF (NGFR), epidermal growth factor (EGFR), gonadotropins (FSHR/LHR) and prostaglandin (PTGER3) are abundantly but differentially expressed in Gp and Gd cells. Taken together, our data strongly supports the notion that Gp and Gd cells of preovulatory follicles differ in their proliferation rate, steroidogenic activity, ECM organization and sperm binding capacity, which are likely controlled by gonadotropins and local ovarian factors, such as GD-derived factors."

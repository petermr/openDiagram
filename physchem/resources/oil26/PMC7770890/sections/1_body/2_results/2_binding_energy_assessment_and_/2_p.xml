&#8722;56.21 to &#8722;33.30 EvoEF2 energy units (EEU) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>), where a lower energy
represents a stronger binding affinity, which may correspond to a
higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. However, it was unknown how trustable
the energy values were, and it was not easy to understand whether
or not an ACE2 was suggested to be an effective receptor. To address
such issues, we compared the calculated binding energy with the experimental
ACE2 usage data. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> summarizes the reported infection cases in nature, and the infection
studies in vivo and in vitro. Infections in nature represent those
infection cases that take place naturally and have been confirmed
by experiments such as quantitative real-time PCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> In vivo infection means that the caged experimental animals
can be infected by SARS-CoV-2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> while in vitro infection
signifies that ACE2-expressing cells (e.g., HeLa cells transiently
expressing ACE2) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Discrepancies may exist between in vivo, in vitro,
and natural infections due to different experimental settings. For
instance, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs
and pigs in vivo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> but it was shown that
ACE2 of dogs and pigs could be effectively used for viral entry in
vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Moreover, pet dogs were reported to be infected
naturally by their owners with COVID-19.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> In this situation, an animal&#8217;s ACE2 protein was regarded
as an effective receptor to SARS-CoV-2 if any kind of experimental
evidence held.</p>

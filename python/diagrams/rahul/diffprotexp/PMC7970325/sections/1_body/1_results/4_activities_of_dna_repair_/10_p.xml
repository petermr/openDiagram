<p id="p0105">Thus, no pathway activation changes distinctive for all tumor types versus normal samples have been found. There were also no differentially regulated patterns between all benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. We conclude, therefore, that we could not identify marker DNA repair pathway alterations for thyroid tumorigenesis in general, but several DNA repair pathways were characteristic for follicular and papillary neoplasms.</p>

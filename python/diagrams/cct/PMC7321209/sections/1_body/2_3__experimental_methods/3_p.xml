<p>Measurement data was recorded by a Dewetron DEWE-PCI 16 measuring system (version DEWE-800, Dewetron GmbH, Grambach, Austria) with data acquisition of current, voltage and welding power. The generated wall structures were separated from the substrate by wire-electro discharge machining (EDM). Afterwards the samples were prepared for metallographic analysis including grinding, polishing and etching with alcoholic Nital solution based on 3% nitric acid. The hardness measurements were carried out using a DuraScan 70 machine (Struers GmbH, Willich, Germany) using the Vickers testing method according to [

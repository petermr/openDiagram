<p>Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the DECIPHER package in R [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Pairwise distances were computed using the Kimura (K80) model implemented in the function dist.dna, deleting the sites with missing data in a pairwise way. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using R software using ape package and the neighbour joining evolutionary method (hCoV19/Wuhan/IPBCAMSWH01/2019 as the root). CoV-GLUE resource [

 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]] was used to generate phylogenetic placement of the mutants, annotate the sequences, and check the prevalence of the deletions among worldwide sequences. Codon numbering is based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence.

<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the comprehensive cancer genomics datasets available. The availability of TCGA allows researchers to uncover the molecular profiling of tumors through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. In our present study, we investigated the TCGA transcriptome data from 892 individuals and used the differential interactome methodology [
 <xref rid="B8-jpm-11-00158" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that integrates transcriptome data with the human protein interactome network to analyze and compare the differential protein–protein interactions among healthy and tumor groups. Three common subtypes (ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC) of RCC were investigated and compared in terms of the differential interactome profiles. These analyses allowed us to identify differentially interacting proteins (DIPs) that represent significant changes in their interaction patterns during the transition from “normal” to “tumor” phenotypes and are therefore differently related to the corresponding tumor [

We also determined candidate protein panels with high diagnostic and/or prognostic performance, which might allow us to develop novel drug candidates and to diagnose patients in the early stage. Furthermore, we offer drug candidates that showed an inhibitory effect on mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) receptor tyrosine kinase which is one of the DIPs that have activated interactions in the case of pRCC.

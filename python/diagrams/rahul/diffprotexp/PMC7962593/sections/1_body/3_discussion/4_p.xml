<p>Patients with sepsis have impaired innate and adaptive antibacterial immunity, which renders them unable to control primary and secondary infections.
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Our analysis of immune cell infiltration in sepsis patients showed that the levels of infiltration of some innate immune cells, such as macrophages and mast cells, were significantly higher. The host defends against pathogens by mounting a systemic inflammatory response in innate immune cells, such as macrophages, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and which initiate coagulation cascade within minutes.
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> In our clustering of immune cell types based on differential infiltration, we identified four clusters. Each is characterized by unique immune responses that may influence the disease state of the patient.

<p>After induction with 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> during 2 and 6 hours, the culture medium was removed and wells were washed twice using PBS. RNA was isolated from TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) suspended samples using RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen. The purified RNA was subsequently used for cDNA preparation using the ImProm-IITM Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega). Primers used for qPCR are described in Supplementary table 2. The analysis of gene expression was performed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) SensiMix™ SYBR® Hi-ROX Kit (Roche Diagnostic) and performed in a CFX96 system (Bio-Rad). The actin gene was used as housekeeping and fold change in gene expression was calculated over non-infected cells using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> threshold cycle (CT) method [

<p>Strains were grown overnight in TSB or TSB supplemented with antibiotic as necessary at 37°C with aeration, and the A
 <sub>600</sub> of the full growth was adjusted to 9.0. Five ml of OD adjusted overnight culture was centrifuged to collect the cells. The pellets were washed with PBS and suspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer and centrifuged. The supernatant was then boiled for 5 minutes, and 20 µl was loaded to a 4–20% gradient Mini-PROTEAN®TGX™ precast gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue for visualization.

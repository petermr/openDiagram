<p>We used Pierceâ„¢ Top 12 Abundant Protein Depletion Spin Columns to remove high-abundance proteins from each serum group, as indicated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After the removal of high-abundance proteins, the distribution of protein bands was significantly better than that of samples without the removal of high-abundance proteins. The eight samples separated well after removal of high-abundance proteins; the bands were similar, and the color depth was consistent among the samples.

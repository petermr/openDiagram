<p id="Par27">For insights into the molecular mechanisms downstream of circ_0003865, we subsequently investigated the potential involvement of microRNAs and functional gene expression in BMSC osteogenic regulation by circ_0003865. Using a bioinformatic analysis, circ_0003865 was predicted to target multiple microRNAs and genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Among them, GAS1 and secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) may be involved in the BMSC osteogenic differentiation signaling pathway. These genes were also downregulated in mRNA sequencing after MEL treatment, so we evaluated the two genes and corresponding miRNAs. The results showed that the expression of miR-3653-3p, miR-4775, and miR-6509-3p was significantly elevated by MEL treatment in BMSCs, whereas the expression of GAS1 and SFRP2 was significantly reduced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Furthermore, we found that circ_0003865 knockdown resulted in the elevation of miR-3653-3p expression and reduced GAS1 expression in human BMSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). Furthermore, MEL treatment promoted miR-3653-3p expression and suppressed GAS1 expression, and this effect was mitigated by circ_0003865 overexpression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). These results indicate that circ_0003865 inhibits miR-3653-3p expression and promotes GAS1 expression in human BMSCs.

<p>While we only have genomes from extant or recently extinct species, which indeed represents a single macroevolutionary observation of increased body size/lifespan and reduced cancer risk, we identify hundreds of gene duplication events, which represents hundreds of microevolutionary observations. If there are no biases in gene duplication rates between different types of genes (and there may be) or in the probability that different types of gene duplications will reach fixation under a neutral evolutionary process (and there may be), then we should not expect to observe enrichment of a priori defined gene and pathway ontology terms among the fixed duplicate genes. That we observe the “right” pathway enrichments in the “right” lineages indicate that the hundreds of microevolutionary observations we identify support our single macroevolutionary inference.</p>

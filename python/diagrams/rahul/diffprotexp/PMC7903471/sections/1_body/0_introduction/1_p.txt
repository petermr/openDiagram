0: Knee osteoarthritis is the most common chronic degenerative bone and joint disease in middle-aged and elderly individuals worldwide ( 1).
1: Knee osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disease with an incidence of ~3% ( 2, 3), and results from a multifactorial imbalance in the synthesis and degradation of knee chondrocytes subchondral bone and extracellular matrix ( 4).
2: Abnormal joint metabolism leads to degeneration of knee articular cartilage and subchondral bone, joint fiber hyperplasia, synovial non-specific inflammation and other lesions ( 5).
3: Due to the continuous damage caused by chronic inflammation and the progressive structural changes of the knee joint tissue, the disease progresses continuously ( 6).
4: An irreversible loss of knee function and pain are among the common causes of decreased quality of life and disability associated with knee osteoarthritis ( 7).

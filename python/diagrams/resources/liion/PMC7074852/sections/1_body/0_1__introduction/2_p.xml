<p>Due to the inherent defects of the material, many researchers attempt to enhance the electrochemical performance of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> by controlling their microstructures and optimizing their components [
 <xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the one hand, great efforts have been devoted to the morphological control of Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and therefore, many of the different shaped Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanostructures, such as peapod-like [
 <xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], yolk-shell [
 <xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], hollow nanofibers [
 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], nanowires [
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], other complex structures [
 <xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,

 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have been developed and applied as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries. Compared with other nanostructures, nanowires have large open space, which allows electrolytes to diffuse into the electrode inner region and shorten the solid-phase diffusion path of lithium ions. Moreover, the mechanical flexibility and Young’s modulus of nanowires are significant for micro-flexible electronic components [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, Guan [
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] synthesized 1D Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> mesoporous nanowires, grown on Ni foam, whose specific capacity was approximately 1600 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at current density of 0.5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Zeng [
 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-10-00191" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] designed quasi-single-crystalline mesoporous Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and CoO nanowires from precursor Co(Co
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>0.5</sub>(OH) and the CoO nanowires remain nearly 100% capacity retention after 70 cycles.

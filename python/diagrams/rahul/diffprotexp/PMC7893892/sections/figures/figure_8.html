 <caption> Construction of the DE lncRNAs-target mRNAs co-expression network. a Co-expression of DE lncRNA-mRNA after lncRNA targets coincided with DE mRNAs in MM_F_P vs MM_L_P. b Co-expression of DE lncRNA-mRNA after lncRNA targets coincided with DE mRNAs in MM_F_P vs ww_F_P. c Co-expression of DE lncRNA-mRNA after lncRNA targets coincided with DE mRNAs in MM_L_P vs ww_L_P. Tangerine and green represent upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Octagons and triangles represent lncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively </caption>

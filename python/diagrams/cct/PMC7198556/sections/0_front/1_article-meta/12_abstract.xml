 <p id="Par1">Process control in surface hardening depends greatly on the repeatability of the results. Induction heating facilities stand out in this aspect but challenges arise when it comes to the verification of the expected temperatures. 
  <italic>In-situ</italic> temperature measurement of a workpiece may be made impossible due to it moving through an enclosed, automated induction facility that lacks built-in sensors. This paper uses transition patterns in the microstructure of the hardened region to reconstruct isothermal contour lines of the temperature field during austenitisation. It does so based on a continuous cooling transformation phase diagram and a time-temperature-austenitisation diagram of the considered steel. The presented method serves as a practical approach to validate simulations of the inductive austenitising process and supports simulations of the heat treatment of the work piece. Once these simulations have been iterated upon and validated thoroughly, they may then yield a reconstruction of the entire temperature field during the heat treatment process.

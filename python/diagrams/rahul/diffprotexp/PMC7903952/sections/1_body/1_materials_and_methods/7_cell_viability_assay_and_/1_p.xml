<p>Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was used to analyze cell proliferation. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 1d, 2d and 3d, respectively. 100 μL T98G or A172 cell lines were planted into 96-well plates at a density of 5×10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/100 μL. Each treatment was conducted in triplicate. The absorbance value at 450 nm was measured by an enzyme-labeled instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). For TMZ experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 1d, followed by treatment with 200uM TMZ for another 2d. For colony formation assay, 1×10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well T98G or A172 cells were added into plates with 6 repeated wells for each treatment. After 14 days, the culture medium was replaced. The colonies were fixed in 30% Formaldehyde (thermo fisher, USA) for 15 min, and then stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet (thermo fisher, USA).

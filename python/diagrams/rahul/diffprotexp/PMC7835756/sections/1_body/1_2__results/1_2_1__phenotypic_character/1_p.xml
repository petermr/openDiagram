<p>L8 (overproducing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and L1 (azygotic line) have typical growth under the experimental conditions used, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f001">Figure 1</xref>. L8 displayed a slight growth delay compared with L1, likely associated with the energy demands of its phenotype. However, there were no significant differences in height, fresh weight, foliar area, stem diameter, and chlorophyll content, as described in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00178-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Therefore, as mentioned in previous works, the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> overproduction levels in L8 do not significantly affect the growth and morphology of plants during their life cycle.

<p>The electrochemical performance of the Li–B–Mg composite in the ether‐based electrolyte was also explored since the ether‐based electrolyte is widely employed in Li–S and Li–O
 <sub>2</sub> batteries. Figure S6 (Supporting Information) clearly shows the enhanced cycling stability of the 3D Li–B–Mg composite cycled at 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (over 500 h) and 2 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (250 h) compared with that of the pure Li assembled symmetrical batteries. This study further verifies the stability of the Li–B–Mg composite as a metal electrode.

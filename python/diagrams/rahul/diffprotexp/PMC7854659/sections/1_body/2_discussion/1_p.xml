 </sup>. Previously, we reported a significant impact on genome-wide expression profiles underpinning tissue metabolism, accretion, and function in fetal muscle, liver, and cerebrum from dietary intake-restricted heifers

 </sup>. Herein, based on the co-expression network, we uncovered the regulatory interplay between genes and shed light on the putative mechanisms underlying the effects of early maternal nutrient restriction on bovine developmental programming on day 50 of gestation. We found that these tissues were affected by dietary intake restriction leading to differences in transcriptional regulation between CON and RES groups. Furthermore, we pointed out TFs potentially modulating the expression of DEGs and TS genes.

<p>The volume fraction of reversed austenite was determined using XRD (XPert PRO MPD, PANalytical B. V., Almelo, Holland) with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning speed of 1°·min
 <sup>−1</sup> and step size of 0.02°. The specimens of simulated HAZ were first mechanically polished and then electropolished using an electrolyte consisting of 12% perchloric acid and 88% absolute ethyl alcohol at room temperature. The integrated intensities of (200)γ, (220)γ, (311)γ, (110)α, (200)α, (211)α, (220)α diffraction peaks were used to determine the austenite volume fraction.

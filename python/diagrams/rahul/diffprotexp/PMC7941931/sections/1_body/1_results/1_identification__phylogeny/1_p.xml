 <italic>HYL</italic>, 2 
 <italic>SE</italic>, 1 
 <italic>HEN</italic>, 2 
 <italic>HST</italic>, and 8 
 <italic>AGO</italic> genes were identified in the Tartary buckwheat genome (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that plant RDR proteins can be divided into four clades, as previously defined by Qian et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Among the 8 FtRDR proteins, 3, 1, 3, and 1 belong to clades 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In addition, the FtRDR proteins were closely homologous to 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> RDR proteins. The DCL proteins can also be classed into four groups, and 4 FtDCL proteins showed a one-to-one counterpart with 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> DCL proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Similarly, the AGO proteins can be separated into four clades, but clade 4 only contained the grass AGO proteins as defined by Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For Tartary buckwheat AGO proteins, clade 1 was the biggest clade, which contained 6 FtAGO proteins. In contrast, both clades 1 and 2 only contained 1 FtAGO protein (Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

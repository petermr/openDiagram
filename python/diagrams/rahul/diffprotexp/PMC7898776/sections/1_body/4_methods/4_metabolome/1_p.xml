<p id="Par49">Serum samples (40 μl, including QC samples) were added to new Eppendorf tubes with ice-cold methanol (120 μl), vortex mixed for 1 min, placed in holding for 30 min at − 20 °C, and centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. 25 μl of supernatant and 225 μl 50% methanol were mixed. Then 20 μl of mixture from each sample were mixed as quality control samples, 60 μl of mixture was conducted as samples. All samples were stored at − 80 °C (ten biological replicates for each group).</p>

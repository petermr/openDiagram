<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par6">Although ToxB was first characterised more than 17&#160;years ago (Martinez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>), relatively little systematic investigation of wheat variety sensitivities has been undertaken to date, and the relationship between ToxB sensitivity and disease susceptibility has not been well defined. In this study, we present information on ToxB sensitivity in a collection of over 470 European wheat varieties and undertake genetic mapping of ToxB sensitivity using a combination of an association mapping panel, and an eight parent multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population. Based on genotypic data generated using a 90&#160;k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, fine mapping of the ToxB sensitivity locus <italic>Tsc2</italic> allowed development of a closely linked SNP-based marker for wheat disease resistance research and breeding.</p>

 </sup>, we conducted a sucrose preference test (SPT) to measure the rat depression-like behavior (anhedonia). The behavioral-based formula was used to assess sucrose preference: sucrose preference = (sucrose intake/total fluid intake) × 100%. Afterward, a forced swimming test (FST) was conducted to gauge despair-like behavior, as formerly illustrated

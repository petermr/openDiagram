0: Bacteria were grown overnight in TSB medium at 37C with shaking.
1: Two microliters of the overnight cultures were spotted on TSB agar plates alone or supplemented with 3.3% skim milk to determine pigment production and proteolysis, respectively, and incubated at 37C overnight.
2: Pigment production was assessed visually by the color of the colony formed on TSB agar plates after overnight incubation.
3: The proteolytic activity was determined by the appearance of a clear zone surrounding the bacterial colonies.

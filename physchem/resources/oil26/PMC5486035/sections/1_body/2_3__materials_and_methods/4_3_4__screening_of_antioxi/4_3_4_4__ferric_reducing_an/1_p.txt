0: The free-radical scavenging capacity against TPTZ radical was performed according to Smeriglio et al.
1: [ 37].
2: Twenty-five microliters (25 L) of sample solution (range 15025 g/mL) was added to 1.5 mL of daily fresh FRAP reagent pre-warmed at 37 C, and the absorbance was recorded at 593 nm by an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601) after an incubation time of 4 min at 20 C, with the FRAP reagent used as blank.
3: The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).

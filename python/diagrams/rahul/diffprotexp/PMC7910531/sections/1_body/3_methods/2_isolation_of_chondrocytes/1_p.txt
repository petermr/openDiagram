0: For cohorts 1, 2 and 4, we followed a previously established protocol to isolate chondrocytes 12 with the details as follows.
1: Osteochondral samples were transported in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM)/F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies), 2.5 g/ml amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 g/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) (serum free media).
2: Half of each sample was then taken forward for chondrocyte extraction.
3: Cartilage was removed from the bone, dissected and washed twice in 1xPBS.
4: Tissue was digested in 3 mg/ml collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum free media overnight at 37 C on a flatbed shaker.
5: The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 70 m cell strainer (Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min.
6: Subsequently, the cell pellet was washed twice in serum free media and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min.
7: The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in serum free media.
8: Cells were counted using a haemocytometer and the viability checked using trypan blue exclusion (Invitrogen).
9: The optimal cell number for spin column extraction from cells was between 4  10 6 and 1  10 7.
10: Cells were then pelleted and homogenised.

<p>The effects of TNFα on cell viability of human HCC cell line HepG2 and non-malignant liver cell line THLE-2 were first explored. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, the cell viability of HepG2 was reduced to 95.3 ± 1.2% of control (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) in response to TNFα treatment at 10 μg/mL for 24 h. Comparing to the cell viability of HepG2, the cell viability of THLE-2 was reduced to 60.7 ± 3.1% of control (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.005) with the same TNFα treatment. Similar observations were also obtained in sub-G1 phase ratio of the two cell lines. The Sub-G1 phase ratio of HepG2 and THLE-2 cells in response to the TNFα treatment was increased to 6.2 ± 1.1% (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) and 26.1 ± 3.2% (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Taken together, these findings showed that HepG2 cell was resistant to TNFα-induced apoptosis as comparing to the non-malignant THLE-2 cell.

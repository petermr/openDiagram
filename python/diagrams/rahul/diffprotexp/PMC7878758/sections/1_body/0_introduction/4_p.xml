<p id="Par5">In this research, we sought to study the molecular mechanisms of lost tail regeneration process during wound healing and initiation of repair mechanism stage (0-dpa, 1-dpa, 2-dpa, and 5-dpa). The 1–5-dpa stage would shed light on involvement of genes or proteins during wound healing and initiation of proliferation/activation of multiple cells initiating blastema formation which eventually leads to the regeneration of tail. The initial stages (i.e. wound healing) are responsible for wound epithelium and initiating apical epidermal cap (AEC) in amphibians which regulates blastema formation

 </sup> forms. Though, during the initial stages, the activity of the molecules regulating the regeneration process is not known which is crucial to instigate the replacement of the lost tissue. The study of prelude stages of regeneration has been carried out in zebrafish caudal fin

 </sup> and shown changes in the regulation of genes or proteins. However, this stage-specific study has not been carried out in this species- and it is necessary for deciphering the crucial molecules which kick starts the regenerative mechanism in these amniotes. Here, we list out the involvement of crucial genes or proteins and their differential expression associated with the molecular processes in tail regeneration through transcriptome and proteome approaches.

<p>The phase purity of the synthesized products was examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X' Pert, Holland) by using Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphology of the products was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Model: JEOL JSM−7000F, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Model: FEI Titan X 60–300, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer model PHI 5600 XPS system with a monochromated aluminum anode as the X-ray source.</p>

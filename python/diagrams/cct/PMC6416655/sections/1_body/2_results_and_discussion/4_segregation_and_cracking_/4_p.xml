 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show the EPMA line scan and quantitative analysis of cracking. The minimum values are equivalently same as the base material, which listed here for a comparison. There were obvious high concentration of carbon (0.28–1.80 mass%), sulphur (0.01–1.73 mass%), chromium (1.26–8.14 mass%), and molybdenum (0.12–0.61 mass%). This segregation phenomenon was attributed to the selecting crystallization and dendrite solidification of steel. The center segregation could not be avoided due to the solute accumulation in the final solidification. These concentrations are all higher than the base matrix to form the hard phase structure in steel thermodynamically easily.

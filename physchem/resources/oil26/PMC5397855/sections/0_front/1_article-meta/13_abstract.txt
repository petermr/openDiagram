0: This study evaluated the insecticidal activity of garlic,   Allium sativum Linnaeus (Amaryllidaceae) essential oil and their principal constituents on   Tenebrio molitor.
1: Garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl sulfide oil were used to compare the lethal and repellent effects on larvae, pupae and adults of   T. molitor.
2: Six concentrations of garlic essential oil and their principal constituents were topically applied onto larvae, pupae and adults of this insect.
3: Repellent effect and respiration rate of each constituent was evaluated.
4: The chemical composition of garlic essential oil was also determined and primary compounds were dimethyl trisulfide (19.86%), diallyl disulfide (18.62%), diallyl sulfide (12.67%), diallyl tetrasulfide (11.34%), and 3-vinyl-[4H]-1,2-dithiin (10.11%).
5: Garlic essential oil was toxic to   T. molitor larva, followed by pupa and adult.
6: In toxic compounds, diallyl disulfide was the most toxic than diallyl sulfide for pupa > larva > adult respectively and showing lethal effects at different time points.
7: Garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide and diallyl sulfide induced symptoms of intoxication and necrosis in larva, pupa, and adult of   T. molitor between 2040 h after exposure.
8: Garlic essential oil and their compounds caused lethal and sublethal effects on   T. molitor and, therefore, have the potential for pest control.

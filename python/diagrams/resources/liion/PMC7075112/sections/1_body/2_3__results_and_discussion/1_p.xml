 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f002">Figure 2</xref>a shows the XRD patterns of the HPC. Two broad peaks at about 26° and 44° can be clearly found. The broad peak at 26° is ascribed to the (002) crystal plane of graphite (JCPDS No. 65-6212), while the peak around 44° relates to the (100) crystal plane of sp

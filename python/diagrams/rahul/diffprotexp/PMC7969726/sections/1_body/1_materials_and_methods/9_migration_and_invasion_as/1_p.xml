<p>Following transfection, 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells were harvested and replated in the upper compartment of Transwell chambers (8-μm pore size, Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States) in serum-free medium. For invasion assay, the upper chambers were coated with 50 μL of 0.5 mg/mL Matrigel
 <sup>®</sup>. Fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower chamber. The fetal bovine serum-containing medium in the lower chamber serves as a chemoattractant for cell migration. After incubation for 36 h, the cells in the lower membrane were fixed with methanol for 30 min and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Three 20× magnification fields were randomly chosen to count the cell number under a microscope.

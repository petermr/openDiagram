<p>Many authors indicated that the pretreatment of spent LIBs is a key step prior to the recovery of cathode components, particularly for hydrometallurgical and direct recycling processes [

 <xref rid="B64-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The objectives of the pretreatment are to maximize recovery of valuable materials, reduce the flow rate of material undergoing the downstream process, ensure the safe disposal of hazardous components, and ensure the safe handling of spent LIBs. This latter aspect is particularly important because it could help reducing the safety risks (high fire risks) and consequently decrease transportation costs of spent batteries, which could represent 40%â€“50% of the overall recycling cost [
 <xref rid="B68-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Two strategies could be used to reduce transportation costs significantly. First, companies might consider designing several smaller local process plants, which would shorten travelling distances. In addition, they could use several remote (or mobile) small crushing facilities to feed the central processing plant for black mass treatment. Thus, only black mass needs to be transported, which neutralizes all safety concerns.

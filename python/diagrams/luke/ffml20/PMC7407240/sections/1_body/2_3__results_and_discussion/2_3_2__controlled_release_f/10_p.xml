<p>At pH = 3, the carboxyl groups of amoxicillin (pKa
 <sub>1</sub> = 2.7) are completely ionized [
 <xref rid="B51-polymers-12-01544" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which accounts for higher release rates and diffusion coefficients at low pH values (electrostatic repulsion between the –COO– from amoxicillin and the –OSO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> groups of carrageenan). The higher the carrageenan content in the hydrogels, the higher the release rate for amoxicillin at pH = 3. At higher pH values (6.5 and 7.3), increasing of the carrageenan amount has an opposite effect. The amino groups become ionized in higher numbers, leading to a decrease with up to 40% in the release rates for this drug at pH = 7.3, compared with pH = 3. For the same pH value, a variation of 15% in the amoxicillin diffusion rates can be registered between the PC12 blend hydrogel and PVA.

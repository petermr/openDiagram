<p>In this study, the effects of Nd:YAG laser parameters (i.e., LSS, laser power, and stand-off distance) on AISI 4130 steel in the surface hardening process was studied. To investigate the surface properties, geometrical dimensions of the hardened zone, microhardness distribution in width and depth of LSTH, percentage of the ferrite phase, and microstructure of the hardened surface were investigated.</p>

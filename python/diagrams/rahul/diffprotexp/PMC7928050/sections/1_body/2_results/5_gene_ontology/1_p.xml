<p>Using the GOrilla tool [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we analysed the biological processes linked to the DEGs. We confirmed that most downregulated processes were involved in metabolic processes, while the upregulated processes corresponded to inflammatory and remodelling processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>). Pathway analysis done with GSEA using KEGG database verified the repartition of the biological up- and downregulated pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, downregulation of metabolic involved pathways seems to start rather 7 to 15 days after transplantation and is not an early genetic response to transplantation. Indeed, when comparing the genetic pathway profiles before and 7 days after transplantation, changes in inflammatory and remodelling processes dominate changes in metabolic involved pathways.

<p>5-Methylcytosine modifications of RNA are ubiquitous in nature and play important roles in many biological processes, such as protein translational regulation, RNA processing, and stress response (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); RNA transport (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, the modification mechanism of m
 <sup>5</sup>C in cancer is being explored. Nonetheless, the exact catalytic mechanism of m
 <sup>5</sup>C methylation remained unclear (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Li Q. et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Trixl and Lusser, 2019</xref>). Herein, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of known m
 <sup>5</sup>C writers (
 <italic>NSUN1-7</italic> and 
 <italic>TRDMT1</italic>) and reader (
 <italic>ALYREF</italic>) in GI cancer. Overall, the expression level of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators was distinctly different across all samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, the expression of 
 <italic>NSUN1</italic>, 
 <italic>NSUN3</italic>, 
 <italic>NSUN4</italic>, 
 <italic>NSUN5</italic>, and 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> was all significantly elevated in GI cancer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Meanwhile, the genomic and protein structure alterations of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators were also determined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, the mutation rate of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators in GI cancer was not high, and it was relatively higher in esophagus and stomach cancers than in other cancers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). The mutation rate for 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> was the highest. In accordance with our finding, copy number gain of 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> has been reported in breast, oral, and colorectal cancers (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Frye et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>), which leads to the increased expression of it in cancers. Alteration in protein structure was seen in all m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). There were more protein alteration sites in 
 <italic>NSUN1</italic> and 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> than in other regulators, whereas there was only one alteration site in 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic>. Although study on the role of m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulatory proteins in cancer was very limited, 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> was relatively well-studied among m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators. There were a few reports on the elevated expression of 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> in a range of cancer, including oral (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>), head and neck (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2018</xref>), colorectal (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>), breast (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Frye et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2017</xref>), ovarian (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Yang J. C. et al., 2017</xref>), and GI cancers (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>), which was consistent with our bioinformatics analysis. 
 <italic>TDMT1</italic>/
 <italic>DNMT2</italic>, a member of DNA methyltransferases, was shown to be down-regulated in liver (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2001</xref>), stomach, and colorectal cancers (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kanai et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, it was significantly over-expressed in stomach and liver cancers from our study and decreased in PC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).

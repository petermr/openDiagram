<p>Results are expressed as mean plus standard error of mean, unless otherwise stated. Raw data was first analyzed for the presence of outliers (GraphPad quickCalcs) and checked for a Gaussian distribution. Data sets were compared using ANOVA, followed by posttests of Tukey or Sidak. Differences between survival curves were analyzed using the Log Rank test. Results with P &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. All data are representative of at least two experiments (n = 4 to n = 12 replicates or n = 7 to n = 17 mice). All data analysis and graph construction were performed using software GraphPad Prism 8.</p>

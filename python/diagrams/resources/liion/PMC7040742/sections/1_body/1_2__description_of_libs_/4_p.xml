<p>Both cathodes and anodes consist of pastes of intercalation compounds bound together with organic binders such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and are coated on electronic conductors. Typically, Al and Cu foils are the preferred cathode and anode current collectors, respectively. Electric insulation between electrodes is maintained using an ion-permeable membrane and an electrolyte, which is a good ionic conductor. The most common electrolyte used for LIBs consists of a solution of lithium hexafluophosphate in alkyl carbonate solvents, such as ethyl carbonate or dimethyl carbonate. Lastly, alternating cathode, anode, and membrane layers are rolled or folded together, and then are wrapped into solid- or soft-shell casings. </p>

<p id="Par2">In recent years, the quest for new and emerging high-performance materials has been increasing rapidly in the fields of infrastructure, aviation, energy, and communications. To address this challenge, machine learning (ML)-based approaches have emerged as promising avenues to accelerate the development of innovative materials design strategies

 </sup>. Fundamental evaluation of composition-property relationships in highly heterogeneous systems is a key feature of such materials design strategies. ML, when judiciously used, can learn various complex composition-property relationships that would otherwise remain undetected using traditional approaches

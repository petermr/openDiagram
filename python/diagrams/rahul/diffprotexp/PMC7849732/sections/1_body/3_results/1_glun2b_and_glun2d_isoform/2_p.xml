<p>Starting with the staining results from male rats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a</xref>)), we found that the pattern of immunoreactivity across the dorsal horn varied for each individual GluN2 subunit. Qualitatively, the immunoreactivity for GluN2A was intense, localized mainly to diffuse neuropil, and evenly dispersed across the laminae of both the CGRP+ SDH and the DDH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a</xref>) left, and Suppl. Figure 1). The GluN2B NMDAR subunit was also found throughout the SDH and DDH; however, the signal was more concentrated in the SDH compared to the DDH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a</xref>) middle, and Suppl. Figure 3). In contrast to the homogenous distribution of GluN2A, the expression of GluN2B was strongly localized to the soma of cells as well as to the punctate labeling of neuropil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a</xref>) middle, top). GluN2B-positive cell bodies were also identified in the dorsal column white matter region, suggesting that cells outside the dorsal horn gray matter express this NMDAR isoform. The expression pattern for GluN2D was similar to that of GluN2B, but with less pronounced differential expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a</xref>) right, Suppl. Figure 5). GluN2D immunoreactivity was found at both cell bodies and diffuse neuropil, with a slight increase in the intensity of overall expression in the SDH compared to the DDH.

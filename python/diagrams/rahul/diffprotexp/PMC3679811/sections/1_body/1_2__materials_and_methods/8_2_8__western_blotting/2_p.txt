0: The membranes were then incubated overnight with rabbit anti-APOA1 (2840-1, Epitomics), rabbit anti-APOA4 (3109-1, Epitomics), anti-EIF4G1 (E8949-54, Labome), and rabbit anti-AZGP1 (ab117275, Abcam) diluted to 1  g/mL.
1: After washing, the membrane was incubated with alkaline peroxidase-conjugated affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG (111-035-003, Immuno Research) diluted 1/10000 for 1 hr.
2: The proteins were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system.
3: The quantitative analysis of Western blotting was carried out using the ImageQuant-TL-7.0 software, version 2010 (Amersham Biosciences) [ 17].

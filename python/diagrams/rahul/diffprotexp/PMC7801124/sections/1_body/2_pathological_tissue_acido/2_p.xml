<p>In normal physiological conditions, blood plasma pH is pH 7.35–7.45 and is well buffered, but during pathophysiological conditions such as metabolic acidosis there can be marked systemic acidosis due to buffering systems being overcome; a further factor affecting blood plasma pH is temperature, such that in hyperthermia (≥40°C) there can be a decrease by ~0.05 pH [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>). For example, inflammation occurs in response to pathogens, trauma, or autoimmune diseases. As immune cells infiltrate the site of injury there is often a concomitant drop in pH, in arthritic conditions, for example, although reported pH values differ, human synovial fluid readings place this acidification for rheumatoid (RA) at ∆ (the difference in pH compared to healthy individuals of) 0.7 pH units [

 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Gout is a further form of inflammatory arthritis and is linked to uric acid levels. As the joint pH becomes more acidic, urate crystals become insoluble leading to deposition into the joints and researchers examining the urine pH levels of those with gout compared to healthy individuals identified a significant difference (∆ 2.6 units) [

 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, it should be noted that not all studies of gout, OA and RA record acidosis, i.e. it has also been reported that synovial fluid from patients with gout, OA and RA can be approximately pH 7.4 [

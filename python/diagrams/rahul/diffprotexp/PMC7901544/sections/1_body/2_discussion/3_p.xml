<p>Except for the finding of the interaction between Fiber-2 and KPNA3/4, the N-terminal 1–40aa of Fiber-2 was identified as the binding domain in Fiber-2 with KPNA3/4. Interestingly, several unique deletions or mutations were found in the sequence of N-terminal 1–40aa of Fiber-2 in some nonpathogenic FAdV-4 isolates. For example, nonpathogenic FAdV-4 isolate ON1 has a deletion of “10ENGKP16” and A29P mutation, and isolate KR5 carries K13Q and T16S mutations as described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>. Notably, nonpathogenic serotype 10 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-10) which belongs to the same species C with FAdV-4, also carries K13Q and T16S mutations. The roles of the deletion or these mutations in the pathogenesis of FAdV-4 need to be further elucidated.

<p id="Par22">Changes in the translational machinery are known to occur during stress response or PCD in several species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. In 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, the toxinâ€“antitoxin system (mazEF) induces the activation of the toxin MazF under stress response. MazF cleaves single-stranded mRNAs, near the AUG start codon, generating leaderless mRNAs and 16S rRNA at the decoding center. These events lead to the formation of a subpopulation of ribosomes able to translate leaderless mRNAs

 </sup>. In mycobacteria, ribosomes containing the alternative small ribosomal subunit protein RpsR2 generate distinct translational landscapes compared to canonical ribosomes. Moreover, this alternative small ribosomal subunit protein is necessary for growth in iron-depleted medium, highlighting that alternative bacterial ribosomes may play a crucial role during nutrient depletion stress

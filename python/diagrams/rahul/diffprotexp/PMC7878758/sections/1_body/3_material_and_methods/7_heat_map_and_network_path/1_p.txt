0: All the differentially expressed genes and proteins were analysed for the heat map analysis involving heat mapper portal ( www.heatmapper.ca) towards elucidating the hierarchical cluster analysis of the genes/proteins and the time points.
1: This analysis helps in visually distinguish the upregulated and downregulated expression of genes involved in all selected time points of regeneration mechanism.The association of these genes / proteins were also analysed for the association in network pathways based on Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).
2: This will give an insight on genes association or cross talk within a specific biological processes and its functional roles.

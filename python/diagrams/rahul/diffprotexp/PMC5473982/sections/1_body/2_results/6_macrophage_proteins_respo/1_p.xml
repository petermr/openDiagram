<p>Four KEGG pathways were specifically enriched when testing proteins of increased abundance in macrophages following 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis infection. These included fatty acid elongation pathway (MECR and HADHB proteins, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.49E−4), lysosomal proteins CTSB and CTSC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 6.98E−3), phagosomal proteins RAB7A and STX7 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 9.23E−3) and LDHA and HADHB from the microbial metabolism in diverse environments pathway (
 <italic>p</italic> = 9.4E−3). Other proteins with increased abundance in macrophages following 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis infection were MRP126, CATHL1, CATHL2, GAL1, CTSB, CTSC, RSFR, SOD1, LECT2, LY86 and FTH, all with antibacterial functions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Proteins which decreased in abundance in macrophages following 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis infection included RBMX, NDUFA4, FNBP1, FAM107, STMN1, GLOD4 and OLA1 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>; Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> for all quantified macrophage proteins).

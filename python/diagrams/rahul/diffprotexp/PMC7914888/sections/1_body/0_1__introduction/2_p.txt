0: Previous works on the mouse melanoma B16F1 cell line showed that 72-h exposure to 5 mM L-Tyr resulted in increased cell size and pigmentation, while exposure to 5-Brd-2-dU 2.5 g/mL showed cells with a senescence-associated phenotype and hypopigmentation; however, a decrease in cell growth was reported [ 14, 15].
1: These changes coincide with the differential expression of hundreds of genes evaluated in this experimental model, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDKs inhibitors [ 16, 17].
2: In 2008, it was possible to identify two miRNAs (miR-138-5p and miR-470-3p) that presented differential expression, which had  cyclin D1 as a molecular target [ 18].
3: However, the differential expression profile of miRNAs for this experimental model is unknown, as well as their possible coordinated and altered expression, evidence that could to expand our knowledge about melanoma plasticity is seen from the microRNAs post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms, and at least in part, to explain the changes in gene expression previously reported for this model of proliferation reduction and differential pigmentation.

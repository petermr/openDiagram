<p id="Par11">The EO were analyzed by gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer Auto XL GC; Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a flame ionisation detector, and the GC conditions were EQUITY-5 column (60 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm); H
 <sub>2</sub> as the carrier gas; column head pressure 10 psi; oven temperature program isotherm 2 min at 70 °C, 3 °C/min gradient 250 °C, isotherm 10 min; injection temperature, 250 °C; detector temperature 280 °C. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis was performed using a Perkin Elmer Turbomass GC–MS. The GC column was EQUITY-5 (60 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm); fused silica capillary column. The GC conditions were injection temperature, 250 °C; column temperature, isothermal at 70 °C for 2 min, then programmed to 250 °C at 37 °C/min and held at this temperature for 10 min; ion source temperature, 250 °C. Helium was the carrier gas. The effluent of the GC column was introduced directly into the source of MS and spectra obtained in the EI mode with 70 eV ionisation energy. The sector mass analyzer was set to scan from 40 to 500 amu for 22 s. The identification of individual compounds is based on their retention times, retention indices relative to C

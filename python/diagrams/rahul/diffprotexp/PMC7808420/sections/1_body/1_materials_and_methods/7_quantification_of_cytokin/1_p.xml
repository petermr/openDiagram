<p>Concentrations of IFNγ, CCL5, CXCL-1 and IL-1β were quantified in cell culture supernatant or processed tissue samples by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, USA), following the manufacturer instructions. The detection limit of quantitative ELISA was in the range of 4–8 pg/mL or pg per 100 mg of tissue. Results were expressed as pg per 100 mg of tissue, pg/mL of supernatant or by absorbance at 490 nm. IFNα4 and ISG expression levels (RIG-I (DDX58), Mx1, Mx2, ISG15, ISG20) were determined in processed samples by RT-qPCR using specific primers (IDT, USA), using primers pairs as described elsewhere [

 <sup>−ΔCt (sample)-ΔCt (housekeeping)</sup>. Results are expressed as fold increase over the mock-infected WT group.

<p id="Par13">We next investigated if lncRNAs also exhibit differential distribution in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions across all samples. Overall, we found a higher representation of lncRNAs in the nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Out of all expressed lncRNAs, we identified 1,114 lncRNAs in the nucleus compared to 118 lncRNA in the cytosol (

 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">6</xref> (A-C). The adult frontal cortex samples harbored the highest number of lncRNAs that showed significant enrichment in either nucleus or cytosol, followed by the fetal cortex and fetal cerebellum, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and Supplementary Table 6). Although there was an overlap within the cytosolic and within nuclear lncRNAs between the tissues, each tissue type harbored a group of unique lncRNAs.

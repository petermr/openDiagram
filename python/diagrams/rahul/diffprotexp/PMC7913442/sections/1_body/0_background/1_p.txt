0: Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are a rare form of stromal cell malignant cancer accounting for one in twenty cases of ovarian cancer.
1: GCTs can occur as either adult or juvenile subtypes [ 1].
2: Commonly the adult form of GCTs is diagnosed at an early stage and can be treated surgically.
3: However, these tumors often recur, and are predominantly fatal in case of recurrence [ 2 4].
4: Current research is focused on discovering new molecular markers to predict the progression of aGCTs.
5: Established cancer markers have no prognostic significance for this type of tumor.
6: Indeed, while many types of tumors show prognostic induction of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, aGCTs reveal a modestly impacted genome.
7: The immunohistochemical evaluation of different oncogenes and tumor suppressors ( e.g., MYC, CDKN1A, ERBB2 and TP53) failed to detect a correlation with patient outcome [ 5,  6].

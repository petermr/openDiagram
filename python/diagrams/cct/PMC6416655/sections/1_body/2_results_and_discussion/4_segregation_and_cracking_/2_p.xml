<p id="p0100">In general, severe segregation in steel would turn into hard phase structure, which would generate cracking during the forging process. The hardness of segregation and regular structure in high-alloy mould steel was shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. Position 1–3 are lines containing three points from one quarter to the center on the slab. From our measurement, the segregation structure was hard phase structure (370–380 HV), and the regular ones were soft phase structure (170–180 HV). These two structures had a significant difference in the hardness which was the reason for cracking during the forging process.

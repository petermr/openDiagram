We used empirical body size and lifespan for extant species, and estimates of lifespan based on body size for extinct species, and both of these estimates to statistically-predict cancer risks. We also note that, at least for elephants, captive individuals have shorter lifespans than wild individuals (Lahdenper&#228;, L. et al. Differences in age-specific mortality between wild-caught and captive-born Asian elephants. Nature Communications (2018) DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05515-8; Clubb R. et al. Compromised survivorship in zoo elephants. Science (2008). DOI: 10.1126/science.1164298). Thus, it is not necessarily the case that data from zoo specimens represent maximum longevity.</p>

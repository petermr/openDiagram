  <p>Chromatin architecture analysis reveals distinct structural and site-specific methylation events. 
   <bold>a</bold> Genome-wide chromatin compartment calling (X-chromosome excluded) comparing CNFs to PNFs. b DMR analysis of overlapping promoter and enhancer space between CNFs and PNFs. Top 100 significant DMR sites shown. 
   <bold>c</bold> Chromatin compartment concordance is depicted as the fraction of CNF and PNF compartment overlap at 100Â kb resolution. 
   <bold>d</bold> Chromosome 17 was the most differentially methylated chromosome. Chromosome-specific analysis of promoter and enhancer space shown. Red bar indicates position of the 
   <italic>NF1</italic> gene. 
   <bold>e</bold> Chromatin structural analysis demonstrating the distribution of DMR calls in topographic CpG categories (i.e., shelves, shores, islands, promoters and enhancers)

Based on the width of the inhibition zone diameter, essential oils exhibits the strongest antibacterial activity against most Gram-positive organisms (except for <italic>E. faecalis)</italic> and a few Gram-negative organisms, including <italic>S. typhi, S. paratyphi</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (p &lt; 0.01). The weakest antibacterial activity was observed against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, with a 10.40 &#177; 0.05 mm zone of inhibition (p&lt;0.01).</p>

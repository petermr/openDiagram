0: According to the manufacturers instructions and our established protocol, total RNA was extracted and then dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H 2O (DEPC-H 2O) for quality and quantity evaluation.
1: Briefly, the isolated granulosa cell subpopulations were dispersed in RNAzol reagent (500 L) (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA) for lysis through a pipette several times and then shaken vigorously 15 s and stored for 510 min at room temperature (425 C).
2: The extract was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at room temperature.
3: The supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 4-bromoanisole added (0.5% of the supernatant volume) (MRC, BN191).
4: The resulting mixture was shaken and then subjected for centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at room temperature.
5: After centrifugation, the RNA-containing supernatant was then transferred to a new tube for precipitation with equal volume of isopropanol added (v/v).
6: The mixtures were stored at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min.
7: The RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and air dried before solubilization in 10 L DEPC-H 2O and stored in  80 C freezer before further analyses.

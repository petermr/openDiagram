<p>In conclusion, we found a number of genes related to the resistance of Kazakh sheep to echinococcosis in the present study, mainly related to lectin secretion, immune cell activation, antigen binding, chemokine expression, and metabolic pathways like retinol. Further studies, like using RNAi or Crispr/cas9 to verify the function of these genes are still needed in the future. In addition to transcriptomics analysis, Multi-omics research including proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics is still needed to reveal the molecular mechanism of CE resistance in Kazakh sheep with the resistant haplotype. We are currently carrying out a proteomics study to select different proteins in the intestinal tissue of these Kazakh sheep. Combined with the results of this study, we hope future results will enable us to provide a comprehensive explanation of resistance to CE in Kazakh sheep.</p>

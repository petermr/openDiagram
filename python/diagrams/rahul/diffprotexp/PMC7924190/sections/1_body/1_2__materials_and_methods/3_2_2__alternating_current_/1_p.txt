0: To study the influence of AC electric fields on hTCEpi cells, an in vitro setup developed by Prof. Baders group at the Medical University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany, was used [ 26].
1: In this system, the electrode setup was modified to perform the EF stimulations in a chamber of a 6-well plate.
2: The pure titanium cylindrical electrodes measuring 14 mm in length and 5 mm in diameter were segregated by a 5 mm-long insulator made up of polyether ether ketone (PEEK).
3: The electrode holders were also made of PEEK and provided a distance of 3 mm between electrodes and the well bottom, thus facilitating growth of the cultured cells below the electrodes.
4: The lid of 6-well plate had pre-drilled holes for the contact titanium rods measuring 35 mm in length.
5: The electrical stimulation was started 14 h after cell seeding.
6: Prior to EF stimulation, the medium was replaced by 4 mL fresh cell culture medium (4.2 mm medium height) without the addition of growth factors.
7: AC EFs were applied continuously for 24 h as a sinusoidal signal of 200 mV and with a frequency of 20 Hz, resulting in a maximum electrical field of 1.4 V/m, as previously described, using a Metrix GX 310 function generator (Metrix Electronics, Hampshire, UK).
8: During stimulation, cells were cultured at 37 C under 5% CO 2.
9: For unstimulated control, cells were similarly cultured in a 6-well plate in the presence of the electrode system, however without connecting to the function generator.

<p id="Par16">In a later section, the accuracy of the GP models is compared against NN and other traditional models such as polynomial regression, decision trees, and support vector machine. The advantage of GP regression is its ability to provide the uncertainty underlying in the model. The error bars shown for each value represent the standard deviation around the mean values. Thus, GP regression provides confidence in the predictions, which are lacking in other models. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the training sets represents the level of noise present in the data subjected to the training set. On the contrary, the standard deviation in the test sets corresponds to the uncertainty in the model prediction given the distribution of the training data.</p>

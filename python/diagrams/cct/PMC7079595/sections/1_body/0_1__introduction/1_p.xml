<p>Medium manganese steels are some of the most promising grades of steel in the automotive industry. The reason for this is a good compromise between material cost and mechanical properties. The metastable retained austenite, one of the main phases, is responsible for high combinations of strength and ductility [

 <xref rid="B2-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This phase during deformation transforms locally into martensite increasing both strength and ductility of the steel. This prevents the strain localization increasing the deformation potential of steel elements. That is why high manganese austenitic steels have very promising mechanical properties [

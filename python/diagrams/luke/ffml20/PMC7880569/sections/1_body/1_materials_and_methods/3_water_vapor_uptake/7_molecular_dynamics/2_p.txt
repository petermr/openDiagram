0: To gain direct molecular-scale insight into the hydration of birnessite, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of K +-saturated birnessite at different water loadings were also undertaken.
1: The lattice of one UC 14 was expanded into a system containing 6  12  4 UCs, with a composition of K 144[Mn 576O 1152]  (H 2O) 3840.
2: This initial composition corresponded to an average of 0.25 K + ions and 13.333 water molecules per UC.
3: After energy minimization and 2 ns of volume and pressure optimization, 61  3 ns successive production runs in the isobaricisothermal ensemble ( NPT) were performed at decreasing water loadings.
4: This was realized by successively evaporating a constant number of randomly selected water molecules (0.22 water molecules per UC per step) from each interlayer region, while preserving the same  d001 of each interlayer at each step.
5: Each evaporation step was followed by a 100 ps of pre-equilibration run not included in the analysis.

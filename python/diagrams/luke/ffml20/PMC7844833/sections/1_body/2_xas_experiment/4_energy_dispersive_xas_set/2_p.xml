<p>An alternative approach to conventional XAS data collection with a scanning monochromator relies on an energy-dispersive (or optically dispersive) setup, as illustrated in

 </xref>b. Instead of a monochromator, the X-ray beam is reflected in this scheme from a polychromator, which disperses the beam in space in a way so that photons with different energies travel along different paths. After passing through the sample, the entire spectrum is collected in a single shot using a 2D detector. This allows one to collect the XAS signal with unprecedented time resolution (down to the μs scale). Moreover, this setup provides much better beam stability since no moving components are involved. This makes it attractive for studies of very small samples, such as samples under extreme conditions (high temperatures, high pressures, strong magnetic fields), allowing one to extract unique information about

 </sup> The applications of this method for the studies of catalysts under working conditions, are, however, limited by the fact that the data collection in fluorescence mode is normally not possible. Moreover, the quality and homogeneity of the sample are even more critical than in transmission measurements at a conventional XAS beamline because X-ray photons with different wavelengths travel through different parts of the sample. Normally, only relatively short spectra can be collected at energy dispersive beamlines, and defects in optics result in noticeable distortions of the spectral features.

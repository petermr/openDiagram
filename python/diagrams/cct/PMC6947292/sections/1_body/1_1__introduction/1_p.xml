<p>Aluminium alloys are the second most important metallic materials. In 2014, the global production of steel (about 1670 Mt) amounted to about 90% of global metal production [

 <xref rid="B3-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and other metals below 1% in total. Thus, considering non-ferrous metal castings, aluminium amounted to about 85% of the global production. The importance of aluminium and its products can also be seen from the fact that the global demand for aluminium has doubled during the last ten years, reaching more than 60 Mt in 2017 [

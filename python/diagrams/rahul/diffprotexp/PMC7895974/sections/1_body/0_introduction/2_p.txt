0: In addition, somite derivatives exhibit regional differences depending on their anteriorposterior axial position.
1: Regional identity is already established at gastrula stages and is controlled by the stepwise transcriptional activation of  HOX gene expression 9  11.
2: For example, members of the  HOXB cluster are first activated in a temporal colinear fashion in prospective paraxial mesoderm, prior to ingression through the primitive streak 12.
3: The colinear activation of  HOX genes culminates in nested expression domains within the paraxial mesoderm, thereby conferring regional identity along the axis 13,  14.
4: To determine the structural features associated with colinear expression, the 3D organisation of  HOX clusters has been investigated 10.
5: It has also been shown that posterior Wnt signalling and CDX transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of the trunk  HOX genes in the centre of  HOX clusters 15.
6: In particular, CDX2 is essential for axial elongation with mutations leading to posterior truncations associated with changes in  HOX expression domains 16.
7: CDX activity is associated with histone acetylation and mediates chromatin accessibility of regulatory elements 17.

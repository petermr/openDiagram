0: In this study, proteomic technique was used to explore the mechanism of ricin aerosol exposure-induced lung injury in mice.
1: So far, there are only limited studies reported on the toxicology of inhaled ricin.
2: Since there is no effective drug or clinically approved vaccine for ricin poisoning, a better understanding of the mechanism of the ricin toxicity can offer new directions to develop new treatments for the respiratory poisoning caused by ricin aerosol.

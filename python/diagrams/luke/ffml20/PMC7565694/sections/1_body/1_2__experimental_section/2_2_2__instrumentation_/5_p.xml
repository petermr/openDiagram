<p>Positron lifetime measurements were performed as follows: two identical samples with dimension of 1.5 × 10 × 10 mm
 <sup>3</sup> were sandwiched with a 10 μCi 
 <sup>22</sup>Na positron source. The 
 <sup>22</sup>Na nucleus emits a 1.28 MeV γ-ray simultaneously (within a few ps) with the positron. The positron lifetime is determined from the time delay between the emission of the birth gamma (1.28 MeV) and one of the 0.511 MeV annihilation photons. Lifetime measurements were carried out using a fast-fast coincidence system with a time resolution of about 210 ps and a channel width of 12.6 ps. We have analyzed the lifetime spectra with the help of the data processing programs PATFIT. Before analyzing each spectrum, the positron source components (377 ps/11.75%, 1.04 ns/0.17%) were subtracted. The variance of the fits was around 1.1.

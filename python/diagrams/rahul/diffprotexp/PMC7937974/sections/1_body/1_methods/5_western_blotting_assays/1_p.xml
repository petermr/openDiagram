<p>Total fresh protein extracts were isolated from HCAECs using enhanced radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo) was used for protein quantification. Equal protein samples (30–100 μg) were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-E-selectin (1:500 dilutions, CST, Danvers, USA), mouse anti-GAPDH (1:1,000 dilutions, OriGene, Beijing, China). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilutions, Proteintech, Wuhan, China) were used to detect primary antibody binding.</p>

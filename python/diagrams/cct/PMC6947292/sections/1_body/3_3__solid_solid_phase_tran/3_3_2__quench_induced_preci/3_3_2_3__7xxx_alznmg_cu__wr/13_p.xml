<p>As demonstrated above, the DFSC-DRM is very helpful in assessing the kinetics of quench-induced precipitation as a function of cooling rate. However, no precipitation start and finish temperatures, which are crucial for the completion of a CCP diagram, are evaluable from the measurements shown above. In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B129-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], the DRM was developed further to allow a temperature-dependent recording of the precipitation enthalpy values (

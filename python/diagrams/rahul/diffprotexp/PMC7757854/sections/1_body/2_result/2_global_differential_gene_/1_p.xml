<p>Correlations were assessed with principle component analysis (PCA) and distance heatmap [
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43–45</xref>] for all timepoints to gain insight into changes at the transcriptome level. Times assessed included day 0 (MEFD0_1, MEFD0_3, and MEFD0_4), day 3 untreated (MEFD3min_1, MEFD3min_3, and MEFD3min_4), day 3 treated (MEFD3plu_1, MEFD3plu_3, and MEFD3plu_4), day 5 untreated (MEFD5min_1, MEFD5min_3, and MEFD5min_4), and day 5 treated (MEFD5plu_1, MEFD5plu_3, and MEFD5plu_4) (

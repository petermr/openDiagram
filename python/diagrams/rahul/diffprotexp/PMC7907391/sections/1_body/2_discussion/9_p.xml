<p id="Par28">In our study, we explored the potential biological rationale behind increased COVID-19 among cancer patients using published literature and an analysis of large-scale genome-wide transcriptional data of normal and malignant tissues from human adults and children. Evidence supports a mechanistic relationship underlying the increased infectivity and severity of COVID-19 in oncology patients based on increased viral entry and reduced host resistance. To mitigate risks, shortening treatment schedules or modifying the sequencing or timing of cancer treatments may be helpful if oncologically safe to do so. Close monitoring of infectious symptoms during treatment may also be warranted. We do note some recent reassuring reports, including one from the UK, that have not observed any immediate deleterious effects of chemotherapy on COVID-19 patients

 </sup>. As the global experience with COVID-19 continues to accumulate, the community will collectively achieve a greater understanding of the interactions between cancer therapy with this novel disease. Continued investigation of the biology of this disease as well as larger, comprehensive epidemiological studies will be important to further elucidate the complex relationship between COVID-19 and patients with cancer.

<p>Much like aspirin and diclofenac acid which have their primary action as COX inhibitors, but also directly modulate ASIC3, further potential such re-purposing of medically licensed drugs has been investigated. For example, diminazene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10A</xref>), an anti-protozoan diarylamidine, is a nonselective inhibitor of ASICs with greatest potency against ASIC1b, in silico docking models suggesting that binding occurs at the base of the palm region [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10B</xref>), is a protease inhibitor licensed for acute pancreatitis also inhibits hASIC3 transient currents (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ∼2.5 µM) and sustained currents (IC
 <sub>50</sub> not determined due to current instabilities), but is not selective, also inhibiting ASIC1a and 2a, albeit at 4 and 20 fold higher concentrations, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Figure 10C</xref>), which can be used to treat multiple sclerosis via blockade of voltage-gated K
 <sup>+</sup> channels, also nonselectively inhibits the transient phase of ASIC-mediated currents, with the least effect on rASIC3, reducing amplitude by ~25% (10 mM at pH 5) [

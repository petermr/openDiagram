<p>Finally, selective leaching of lithium from LFP can be performed by contacting the cathodic material in a pressurized vessel with an oxidizing agent such as H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, O
 <sub>3</sub>, or O
 <sub>2</sub> and CO
 <sub>2</sub> to form a solution of LiHCO
 <sub>3</sub> and a residue of FePO
 <sub>4</sub>. At a CO
 <sub>2</sub> pressure of 2 atmosphere and room temperature, the Li extraction reached 100% in 30 min [

 <sub>4</sub> kept its orthorhombic structure, which could allow for reuse in new battery manufacturing. This process, illustrated in

 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> in water to selectively extract Li ions as Li
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. In this case, the lithium persulfate acted as oxidizing agent and chelating agent.

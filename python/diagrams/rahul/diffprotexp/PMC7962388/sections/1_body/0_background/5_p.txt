0: Paspalum notatum Flugge is a warm-season perennial grass widely distributed in the Western Hemisphere [ 46], where it occurs as a primary constituent of natural grasslands, particularly in southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and north-east Argentina [ 47].
1: The species form a multiploid complex in which the diploid cytotype (2n = 2x = 20) is self-sterile and sexual, while the tetraploid one (the common race) (2n = 4x = 40) is pseudogamous, aposporous apomictic and self-fertile [ 48].
2: Other infrequent polyploid cytotypes (3x and 5x) are also apomicts [ 49].
3: Moreover, numerous sexual tetraploid individuals were artificially synthetized from diploids by colchicine treatment, or obtained from experimental crosses involving facultative apomicts [ 50].
4: Interestingly, although sexual seeds form the endosperm under a strict 2 maternal: 1 paternal genomic contribution, apomictic ones are more permissive and can develop under different maternal:paternal genomic ratios (e.g., 4:1; 8:1) [ 49].
5: P. notatum has become a model system for apomixis research and breeding, mainly due to the existence of freely-crossable races of the same ploidy and different reproductive mode, a thoroughly-characterized living germplasm collection and advanced breeding programs exploiting apomixis for cultivar generation [ 48,  50 53].

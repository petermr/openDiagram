0: Based on the screening results, the phase diagram of the [P 44414]Cl + CH 3COOH + H 2O system was experimentally determined using a combination of the cloud point titration method and turbidimetric method performed in a temperature-controlled thermostatic bath.
1: The cloud point, representing the solution turbidity caused by phase demixing, was visually detected when a mass of acid or aqueous salt solution was added dropwise over an aqueous IL solution of known mass, and a known mass of water was added until the solution became clear again, this process being repeated several times.
2: The [P 44414]Cl and CH 3COOH concentration ranges probed in this study are 2.0 to 75.0 wt.% IL and 0.0 to 30.0 wt.% CH 3COOH respectively.
3: Additionally, to delimit the type 0 phase diagram of [P 44414]Cl + CH 3COOH + H 2O, mixing points of known composition concentrated in organic acid and IL were prepared and a known mass of water was added dropwise in each tube until the appearance of cloudiness.
4: All mixing points were made in triplicate.

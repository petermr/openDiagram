<p>Furthermore, in vagal and glossopharyngeal sensory ganglia, rASIC3 was found to be coexpressed with CGRP and TRPV1 in jugular ganglia (78% and 62%, respectively), less frequent coexpression was observed in petrosal ganglia (28% and 22%, respectively), and coexpression was rare in nodose ganglia (ND, 6% and 1%, respectively) [

 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice having a decreased sensitivity of vagal gastro-esophageal tension receptors, colonic mesenteric and colonic serosal mechanoreceptors compared to their WT counterparts [
 <xref rid="cit0112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. In mouse thoracolumbar DRG neurones, ASIC3 was the least abundant ASIC isoform expressed, but when looking specifically at colonic sensory neurones it was the highest (by 5-fold) [
 <xref rid="cit0113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Guinea pigs in comparison to mice display greater levels of ASIC3 (similar to in rats) in vagal esophageal neurones that are putative cell bodies of tension mechanosensors; this interspecies differences also extends to nodose neurones, which follow the same pattern [
 <xref rid="cit0114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Thus, ASIC3 is expressed in those sensory neurones compatible with it playing key roles in visceral afferent function and contributing to visceral pain.

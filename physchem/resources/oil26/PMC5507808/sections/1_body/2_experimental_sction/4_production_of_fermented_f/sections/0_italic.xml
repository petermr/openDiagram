<italic>Gal&#233;oides decadactylus</italic>) are scaled and eviscerated. After washing, it was left for 24&#160;h for maturation. During this step, the fish is subjected to a tissue degradation process, under the action of enzymes and microorganisms. After the maturation step, fishes are salted by introducing the salt into the evisceration slot made under the operculum, and also into the gills and over the entire body of the fish. Fishes are now ready to the anaerobic fermentation process which duration is 3&#160;days. After the anaerobic fermentation step, fish&#8217;s samples are then rinsed by immersion in brine (0.5%). The fish thus treated are then separated into four (4) parts labelled respectively A, B, C and D. The first three parts of fish (A, B, C) are treated with the essential oil of

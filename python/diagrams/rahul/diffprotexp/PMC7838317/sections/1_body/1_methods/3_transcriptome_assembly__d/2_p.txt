0: Differentially expressed transcripts were used as BLASTx queries against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant (nr) database (downloaded 9 July 2018) with a word size of 6, an e-value cutoff of 1e 5, and a hit threshold number of 20.
1: Functional annotation of transcripts using Gene Ontology (GO) terms and InterProScan was performed using Blast2GO (version 5.2.4) 44,  45 using default parameters.
2: Fishers Exact Test was conducted to identify GO terms that are significantly over-represented in the up-regulated and down-regulated sets of genes 46.
3: To ensure that our discussion of differentially expressed transcripts was not affected by potential prokaryotic contamination, we filtered transcripts using Kraken2 (version 2.1.1) 47 with a combination of its Archaea and Bacteria databases.
4: We used a kmer length of 35 and a classification confidence threshold cutoff of 0.05.

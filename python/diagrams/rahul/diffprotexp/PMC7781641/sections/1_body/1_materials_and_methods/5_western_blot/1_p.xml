<p>Twelve male and female mice (8–10 weeks old, six mice per sex) were subject to the FRICT-ION model of trigeminal neuropathic pain. In week 3 post-nerve injury, three mice of each sex were administered TAT-C3P peptide and the remaining mice were administered TAT-C3D following the methods described above. Four hours post-injection, mice were euthanized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and both ipsilateral and contralateral TG were removed. TG were washed immediately in PBS and stored at −80°C.</p>

0: Alcanivorax spp.
1: has a cosmopolitan distribution with isolations or detection of its 16S rRNA gene sequences from many different oilimpacted marine environments (Yakimov  et al.,2007).
2: Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 T (DSM 11573) was the first OHCB to have its genome sequenced revealing a plethora of genes accounting for its wide hydrocarbon substrate range and efficient oildegradation capabilities (Reva et al.,  2008; Schneiker  et al.,2006).
3: Analysis revealed proteins required to oxidize  nalkanes up to the corresponding acylCoA derivative are coded by the  alkSB 1GJH operon which has >80% amino acid similarity to the corresponding wellcharacterized alkane degradation components in  Pseudomonas putida Gpo1 (Kok  et al.,1989; van Beilen  et al.,2001; van Beilen  et al.,2003; van Beilen  et al.,2004).
4: However, genomes only give insight into the genetic potential of an organism.
5: Several transcriptomic studies hint even more at this potential.
6: A microarraybased study led to the identification of upregulated genes predicted to be involved in the terminal oxidation of  nhexadecane (Sabirova  et al.,  2011).
7: These included genes coding for two alkanes monooxygenases ( alkB1 and  alkB2), three flavinbinding monooxygenases (ABO_0282, ABO_1097, ABO_2107), an alcohol dehydrogenase (ABO_2483) and an aldehyde reductase ( AKR1A1/ABO_2414).
8: A subsequent microarray analysis identified genes that distinctly respond to solvent stress by the addition of 1octanol, a known toxic intermediate of  nalkane degradation (Naether  et al.,2013).
9: In accordance with Sabirova  et al., 2011, the expression level of  alkB1 (ABO_2707) was increased during growth on the  nhexadecane.
10: In contrast, RNAsequencing surprisingly showed that only 1% of genes were upregulated while  A.borkumensis was growing on  ndodecane and none of these were involved in alkane metabolism (Barbato  et al.,  2016).
11: The mRNA abundances presented in such studies may not directly correlate to the amount of protein within a cell, due to many factors.
12: Large changes in gene expression may not necessarily result in similar changes in translated proteins as there can be a requirement for gene coregulation, controls on posttranslational modification or protein degradation, or protein translation may be highly dependent on translation initiation features and recruitment of ribosomes (Vogel and Marcotte,  2012).
13: The proteins are the functional molecules in cells and it is the proteome, rather than the genome or transcriptome, that is, therefore most related to the phenotype of an organism, yet there is little knowledge or quantification of protein biosynthesis in  Alcanivorax during alkane degradation.
14: A previous study of  A.borkumensis using twodimensional gel electrophoresis identified upregulation of two alkane hydroxylases AlkB1 and AlkB2 (Sabirova  et al.,2006), which have been shown to oxidize mediumchain alkanes in the range of  nC 5 nC 12 and  nC 8 nC 16 (van Beilen  et al.,2004), respectively, three P450 cytochromes, and a flavinbinding monooxygenase with a strong similarity to the AlmA enzyme, which hydroxylates longchain alkanes ( nC 22 nC 36) in  A. dieselolei and  A. hongdengensis (Liu  et al.,2011; Wang and Shao,  2012b, Wang and Shao,  2014).
15: A downside of this proteomic technique is that it is only semiquantitative and often a relatively small number of proteins are detected (e.g.
16: only 97 proteins were excised, sequenced and identified in Sabirova  et al.,2006.

0: Urosepsis is defined as sepsis caused by a urogenital tract infection.
1: Urogenital tract infections are considered to be responsible for about 30% sepsis cases, with a mortality of 20%40%.
2: As the population ages, the incidence of urosepsis is likely to rise.
3: 1,  2 Although blood culture has been considered the gold standard for sepsis diagnosis, it is too slow and limited by false negatives.
4: 3 This has prompted studies to identify methods for sepsis diagnosis in the early-stages, where treatment outcomes are more favorable.
5: Indeed, the prognosis of urosepsis must be assessed as early as possible.
6: Recently, proteomic technologies have been used to detect new biomarkers.
7: A large number of differentially expressed proteins have been reported as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of several diseases.
8: In this study, two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) was applied to assess protein profiles in uroseptic patients with different prognoses, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers.

<p id="Par7">After quality control, on average, 92.8%,Â 89.9%, and 93.0% of unique reads from the cerebrum, liver, and muscle tissues, respectively, were mapped to the reference genome. A summary of sequencing throughput and mapping rates per sample and tissue is reported in Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>. Mapped reads saturation plot showed that, on average, 92% of the genes were identified, supporting an adequate read-depth per tissue in the current study (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The multi-tissue normalization approach (

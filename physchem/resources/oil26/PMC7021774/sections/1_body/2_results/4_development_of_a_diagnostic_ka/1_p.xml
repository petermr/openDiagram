The KASP primers designed (Allele-specific-A: 5&#8242;-tgattgcggagtatgtgca-3&#8242;, Allele-specific-B 5&#8242;- tgattgcggagtatgtgcg-3&#8242;, Common primer: 5&#8242;-gcaatgcgtgtccgtgtaaata-3&#8242;) were tested on DNAs extracted from all eight MAGIC founders, as well as a 50:50 mix of DNAs from &#8216;Brompton and &#8216;Xi19&#8217;, and found tight clustering of both homozygous allele classes, while robust calling of the artificially admixed DNA confirmed the KASP marker to be co-dominant (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The marker was subsequently used to genotype a collection of 47 elite UK winter wheat varieties that post-dated the AM panel, released on the UK AHDB Recommended List (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/varieties/ahdb-recommended-lists.aspx">https://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/varieties/ahdb-recommended-lists.aspx</ext-link>) between 2009 and 2017 (Supplementary Table 7). Of these, 39 were found to be A:A homozygous alleles, while 8 were G:G (predictive of ToxB insensitivity and sensitivity, respectively). Phenotyping these 47 recent varieties for ToxB sensitivity found the KASP allele call to correctly predict phenotype in all cases (Supplementary Table 7).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Allele calls for the <italic>Tsc2-</italic>linked KASP marker developed for SNP BS00072620_51.

<p>Although Se is an essential element, its margin between the lowest acceptable level of intake and toxicity is very narrow. According to a previous study, sodium selenite stimulated Caco-2 cell proliferation at low concentrations (10 to 100 nM) but inhibited growth at higher doses (&gt;1 Î¼M) in serum-free medium [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In nature and organisms, Se presents as organic (such as selenomethionine (Se-Met) and selenocysteine (Sec)) and inorganic forms (selenide (Se

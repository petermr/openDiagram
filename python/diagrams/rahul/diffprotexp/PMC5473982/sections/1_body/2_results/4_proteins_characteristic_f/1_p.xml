<p>Out of 334 proteins specific for macrophages (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), 20 with the highest PSM difference between macrophages and heterophils are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Five of these represented receptor proteins MRC1L, LRP1, LGALS1, LRPAP1 and DMBT1L, the last one containing the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain. CTSB, CKB, MECR, PHB2, H9KZK0 and p41/Li are involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation. An additional 4 proteins UQCR, UQCRC1, ACO2 and HADHB are localized to the mitochondria. Only 3 proteins, MRC1L, HSP70 and p41/Li, were already recorded in chicken macrophages [

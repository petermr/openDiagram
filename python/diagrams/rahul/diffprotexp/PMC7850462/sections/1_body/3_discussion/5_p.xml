<p>In summary, miR-34b-5p promotes LPS-induced renal cell injury by inhibiting AQP2. As high expression of miR-34b-5p is detected in septic AKI patients, the serum level of miR-34b-5p may have diagnostic value for sepsis-induced AKI. The findings may also inspire the development of molecule-targeted therapy for septic AKI. Nonetheless, this study lacks animal experiments to confirm the regulation of septic AKI by miR-34b-5p 
 <italic>inÂ vivo</italic>. More studies are expected to further probe into the potential of miR-34b-5p for septic AKI diagnosis and treatment.

 </sup>, the FASP-based method with 10-kD ultrafiltration centrifuge tubes was employed for protein digestion. Briefly, the lysates were diluted using urea buffer (150 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 8 M urea). The denatured proteins were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. After centrifugation, the proteins were washed two times using the urea buffer. Subsequently, the proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin. The resulting digests were collected by repeated centrifugation and washing. The peptide solution was then dried in a Speed Vac.

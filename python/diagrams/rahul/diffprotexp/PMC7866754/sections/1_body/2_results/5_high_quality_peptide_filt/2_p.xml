<p id="Par47">The ORFs of the filtered novel peptides as described previously, and see which of them was differentially expressed. With a much smaller pool of high-quality peptides, only five unique novel ORFs showed differential expression between the two stages (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), where AltORF is still the most common category, and one ORF from 3′ UTR and intergenic regions. Interestingly, four out of five DE nORFs showed opposite trend in transcript and protein expression, meaning that those that have positive fold-change at mRNA-level showed negative fold-change at protein level and vice versa. The poor correlation between mRNA and protein abundances are not uncommon, which is often caused by the regulatory mechanism governing transcripts or proteins, but sometimes by noise and experimental error as well [

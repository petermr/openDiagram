0: Adipose tissue is mainly composed of adipocytes (90%), nonadipocytes (preadipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, inflammatory cells, etc.
1: ), connective tissue matrix, blood vessels, and nervous tissues ( Ibrahim, 2010).
2: Girousse et al.
3: (2019) stated that adipocytes mainly originate from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), and  Silva and Baptista (2019) demonstrated the different pathophysiologic properties of ASCs in different adipose deposits.
4: A widely different function among Subcutaneous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SASCs), epididymal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (EASCs), and perirenal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PASCs) were illustrated including a higher potential of lipogenesis in EASCs and PASCs ( Jeffery et al., 2015,  2016).
5: However, the contributions of different original ASCs in different adipose deposits are still not clear.
6: We designed this study to investigate the functional differences among different original ASCs by multi-omics analysis.

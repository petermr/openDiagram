0: Insoluble fractions of spinal cord lysates were suspended in TEN buffer (10 mM Tris-HcCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl plus protease inhibitors) and quantified using the Bio-Rad protein Assay Dye system (cat.
1: no.
2: 500-0006).
3: A 25-g bolus from each sample was brought to an equal volume in TEN buffer.
4: Five percent Trition-X100 in tris-buffered saline was then added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated on ice for 10 minutes.
5: Samples were then added to the filter trap assembly (Bio-Rad) and passed through a nitrocellulose membrane with a pore size of 0.2 m (Optitran).
6: After transfer, the membrane was removed, washed in TBST, and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma P7170-1L).
7: Densitometry was performed in ImageJ.

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. There is a consensus on the high-temperature brittle zones of steels from the melting point to 873 K 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The III brittle zone of steel is in the temperature zone of 873â€“1173 K. Membranous ferrite and carbonitride precipitated along the austenite grain boundary made the boundary coarsened and caused the brittleness of base matrix. There is a negative relationship between the ductility and the tensile strain rate in the III brittle zone of steel. Many researchers found that the ductility is related to the chemical composition and tensile strain rate. The ductility in these three zones was not always present at the same time, or overlap

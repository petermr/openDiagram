0: The ability of the Pir toxin proteins to enter primary shrimp hemocytes was explored using immunocytochemical analysis.
1: First, recombinant His-tagged PirA and PirB proteins (designated as His-rPirA or His-rPirB) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously [ 19].
2: Briefly, the nucleotide sequence encoding PirA (GenBank #: KU145400.1) and PirB (GenBank #: KU145400.1) were amplified using the AHPND strain of  V. parahaemolyticus (PD-2) (a kind gift from Dr. Chu Fang Lo of National Cheng Kung University) as template, with gene-specific primers ( Table 1) designed with Primer Premier 5.
3: The PCR product was cloned into pET-28a and transformed into  Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China).
4: The expressed recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-NTA beads (GE Healthcare, CT, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
5: The recombinant proteins were identified via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis as described previously [ 20].
6: The purified proteins (His-rPirA and His-rPirB) were separated on SDS-PAGE, before being transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF, Millipore, MA, USA).
7: The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk dissolved in TBST (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature.
8: The membranes were incubated overnight at 4C with mouse anti-His primary antibody (1:3000, Transgen BioTech, Beijing, China) followed by washing 3 times (15 min) with TBST.
9: The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-linked goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:3000, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and then washed 3 times (15 min).
10: Protein bands on blots were detected with the Amersham Imager 600 system (GE Healthcare, CT).

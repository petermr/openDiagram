(30&#160;m&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2.5&#160;mm; 0.25&#160;&#956;m film thickness). The column temperature was 40&#160;&#176;C (hold 2&#160;min) to 220&#160;&#176;C (hold 5&#160;min) at the rate of 10&#160;&#176;C/min, maintained with carrier gas helium at a constant pressure of 90 kPa (Acquisition parameters full scan; scan range 40&#8211;550&#160;amu). The split ratio was 10. Mass spectra were taken at 70&#160;eV.</p>

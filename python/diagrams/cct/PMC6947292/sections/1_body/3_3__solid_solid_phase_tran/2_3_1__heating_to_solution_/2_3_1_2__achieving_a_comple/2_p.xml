<p>DSC analysis can help to identify proper solution treatment parameters. In the first instance, the solvus temperature can be estimated from DSC heating experiments, as discussed above. In this case, the solution temperature is ideally chosen to be a few tens of K above the solvus temperature. If the overheating above the solvus must be kept small, or if very coarse precipitates are to be dissolved, and if the homogeneity of the elemental distribution is also a consideration, a particular soaking duration is required at the solution temperature. In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B161-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>], we showed that the heat-flow development during isothermal soaking in a differential scanning calorimeter at the solution treatment temperature can be used to estimate the duration of the dissolution processes. Based on this, suitable solution treatment parameters can be derived.

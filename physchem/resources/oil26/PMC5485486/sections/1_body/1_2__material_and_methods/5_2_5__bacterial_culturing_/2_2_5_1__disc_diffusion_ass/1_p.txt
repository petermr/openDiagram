0: The determination of inhibition diameters of essential oils on  E. coli ATCC 25922,  S. aureus ATCC 25923, and  P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 cultures was carried out (in triplicate) by the agar disc diffusion method according to the NCCLS (the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards), recently called CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute) [ 10].
1: The Mueller-Hinton agar media in Petri dishes was swabbed with 100  l of the bacterial suspension 10 8 CFU/ml (0.5 NTU McFarland) and kept for 30 min at 4C.
2: Sterile filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) [ 11] were soaked with 6  l essential oil and placed aseptically on the surface of the inoculated Muller-Hinton agar plates.
3: Plates were then incubated at 37C for 24 h and the diameters of bacterial growth inhibition zones (in millimeters) were recorded.
4: Standard antibiotic discs (6 mm) were used as positive controls: ceftriaxone (30  g), ofloxacin (5  g), and blank discs were used as negative control.

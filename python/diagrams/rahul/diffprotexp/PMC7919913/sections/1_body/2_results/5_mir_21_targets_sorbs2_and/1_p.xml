<p>SORBS2 and ENH have been demonstrated to be the targets of miR-21 [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The effects of miR-21 on the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH were determined in cultured cardiomyocytes. RT-qPCR revealed that transfection of miR-21 mimic inhibited the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH, whereas pre-transfection of miR-21 inhibitor induced the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH (

Consistent with the results of RT-qPCR, Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH at the protein level were also inhibited by transfection of miR-21 mimic, while they were up-regulated by transfection of miR-21 inhibitor (

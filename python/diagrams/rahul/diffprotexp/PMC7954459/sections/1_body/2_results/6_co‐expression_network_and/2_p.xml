<p>To gain more insights into miRNA‐mediated regulation of seed development and seed size/weight determination, we identified sets of miRNAs co‐expressed at a specific stage and/or with similar expression patterns at one or more stages of seed development via WGCNA using the whole miRNA dataset. In total, 24 co‐expressed modules were identified based on the dynamic tree cut algorithm, and were assigned with different colors (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The number of miRNAs ranged from 5 (red) to 38 (turquoise) in different modules (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The expression pattern of miRNAs in modules revealed stage‐specific or cultivar‐specific expression of several miRNAs. For example, brown and black modules were cultivar‐specific; miRNAs in these modules were specifically expressed at the S4 stage in Himchana 1 and JGK 3, respectively. However, the miRNAs clustered in the dark green module were expressed in both the cultivars at the S4 stage. Some modules showed broader expression pattern at multiple stages of seed development, such as miRNAs in cyan and gery60 modules were found to be expressed at early and mid‐embryogenesis (S1–S3) stages in both the cultivars (Figure

0: We performed sequencing of two technical replicates of samples TC63 and TC116, Spearman's correlation coefficient between gene expression profiles was 0.95 for both cases.
1: We also found that the replicates tightly clustered on the dendrogram ( Figure 20) which confirmed data consistency of the RNA sequencing protocol used.

<p>We identified 302 and 357 human- and chimpanzee-specific PAS, respectively (see 'Materials and methods'). Suggesting biological significance, compared to the genes in which we identified a PAS in both species, the genes with species-specific PAS are enriched for a number of general cellular processes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, see 'Materials and methods'). It has been previously shown that most PAS are directly preceded by 1 of 12 annotated sequence motifs that recruit cleavage and polyadenylation machinery to mRNA molecules as they are transcribed (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beaudoing et al., 2000</xref>). We asked if creation or disruption of a signal site motif could be responsible for species-specific PAS by mapping signal site motifs in both human and chimpanzee for each PAS region. Although human and chimpanzee PAS regions are equally likely to contain each of the 12 annotated signal sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), only the top two most commonly used motifs, AATAAA and ATTAAA, are associated with increased PAS usage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>). Not only have other studies revealed a similar preference for these two motifs, cryo-electric microscopy analysis of the recognition machinery suggests that the mutation from the canonical signal site to the second most used site requires a smaller RNA rearrangement than other variations of the motif (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beaudoing et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we considered only the presence or absence of these two motifs in subsequent analyses. We classified sites as having a species-specific signal site if we only identified the AATAAA or ATTAAA motif in one species. Of the 302 human-specific PAS, 14 have human-specific signal sites and 6 have chimpanzee-specific signal sites. Of the 357 chimpanzee-specific PAS, 24 have a chimpanzee-specific signal site and 6 have a human-specific signal site. These numbers are small; still, species-specific signal sites are more abundant than expected by chance among species-specific PAS in human (5.7×, hypergeometric test, p=2.30×10
 <sup>−7</sup>) and in chimpanzee (8.3×, hypergeometric test, p=3.2×10
 <sup>−15</sup>), suggesting that signal site changes can explain a subset of differences in PAS usage. For example, we identified a chimpanzee-specific PAS about 1 kb upstream of a PAS used in both species in the 3' UTR of 
 <italic>MAN2B2</italic>. The ancestral signal site conserved in chimpanzee is AATAAA; however, there has been a T to C transition in the human lineage (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Blanchette et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>). This transition is likely responsible for the loss of PAS in humans. The MAN2B2 gene involved with lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins, and in 2019 a physician diagnosed a patient with immune deficiency as a result of a loss of function mutation in the gene (

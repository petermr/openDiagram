 <caption> The crosstalk between lncRNAs and immune-related biological processes in PRAD. (A) Network shows the connections between differential lncRNAs and top significant immune-related biological processes in PRAD. Circle sizes indicate the numbers of significantly enriched lncRNAs for individual immune-related biological processes. (B) Comparison of immune response activities between high and low expression levels of CTD-2521M24.9. (C) Comparison of immune system development activities between high and low expression levels of CTD-2521M24.9. (D) Points show the correlations between lncRNAs and representative genes in individual immune-related biological processes. </caption>

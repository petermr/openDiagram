<p>We have identified a heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) that increases its quantity in 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> after exposure to chilling temperature. Hsp70 has been shown to prevent cytochrome 
 <italic>c</italic>/dATP-mediated caspase activation and recruitment of caspases to the apoptosome complex. Hsp70, therefore, suppresses apoptosis [

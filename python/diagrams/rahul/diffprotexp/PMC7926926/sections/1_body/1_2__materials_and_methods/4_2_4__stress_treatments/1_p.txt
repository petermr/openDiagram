0: The test set included 4 treatments, namely 2 inoculated LB-0 (Al 3+, 0 mmol L 1), LB-04 (Al 3+, 0.4 mmol L 1) and two non-inoculated treatments CK-0 (Al 3+, 0 mmol L 1), CK-04 (Al 3+, 0.4 mmol L 1.
1: AlCl 3 (Tianjin Komiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added to Hoagland solution (complete nutrient solution), and pH of the Hoagland solution was adjusted to 4.1  0.1 by adding 0.1 M diluted HCl or NaOH.
2: The nutrient composition of Hoagland solution was as 5 mmol L 1 KNO 3, 4.5 mmol L 1 Ca(NO 3)4H 2O, 2 mmol L 1 MgSO 47H 2O, 1 mmol L 1 KH 2PO 4, and 25 mol L 1 Fe-Na EDTA [ 50].
3: To maintain the quality, the treatment solution was changed after a week interval.
4: Al activity was maintained by adding CaCl 2 solution purchased from Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd., into the nutrient solution, a standard treatment acting as a buffer to avoid possible interface between Al ions and solution ions [ 51].
5: Due to the unstable Al ions, the high concentration of phosphorus in the nutrient solution can cause a reaction with Al ions and reduce the actual Al concentration of the treatment.
6: Hence, after adding a low concentration of CaCl 2, Ca 2+ can preempt the binding site of Al 3+, which ensures the target Al 3+ concentration [ 52, 53].
7: The proteome was determined from the needle samples collected 60 days after Al treatment.

<p>While XRD studies are usually applied for studies of ordered materials, high-energy X-ray diffraction and the analysis of the intensity between the Bragg peaks enable the analysis of disorder and local structure. The so-called pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X-ray (or neutron) scattering patterns allows one to extract information about the interatomic distance distributions, analogous to that from EXAFS measurements. While the sensitivity of EXAFS is limited to short-range interactions, PDF analysis of scattering data allows one to probe atomic ordering at much longer length scales.

 </sup> Normally, the X-ray scattering-based PDF analysis lacks the element-sensitivity of EXAFS. This issue, however, can be addressed by scanning the energy of the incident X-rays and employing the anomalous X-ray scattering, as discussed above.

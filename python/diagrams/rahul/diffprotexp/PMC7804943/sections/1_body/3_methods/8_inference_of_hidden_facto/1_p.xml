 </sup> was used to infer the shared sources of variation between multiple data types. To prepare for model training, four sets of regulatory layers were used: GE, APA, AS, and IR. The AS layer included all exon-based events, including cassette exons and alternative 5′ and 3′ splice sites, while IR was treated as a separate layer. Each layer was filtered to include features with sufficient variation across samples, as summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and described above. Training of the model was carried out using the following options: for hippocampal analysis, DropFactorThreshold = 0, tolerance = 0.01, maxiter = 6000; for whole-brain analysis, DropFactorThreshold = 0.02, tolerance = 0.01, maxiter = 5000.

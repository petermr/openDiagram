<p>Divergence between differentially expressed proteins in MtzR isotypes led us to consider the potential for genotypic variation, transcriptional plasticity, and reversible protein modifications in Mtz resistance. Immunoblotting was performed for acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation for the 3 genotypes and isotype lines, as well as for isotype lines monitored after cessation of drug selection every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks. Isotype lines maintained without Mtz were also monitored for reversion to Mtz sensitivity, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after cessation of drug selection to observe resistance phenotype stability. Chemical inhibitors of protein acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation were also used to further probe post-translational responses, with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> calculated for post-translational modification (PTM) inhibitors in the 6 lines, which was further complemented by immunoblotting of protein extracted from trophozoites exposed to chemical inhibitors.

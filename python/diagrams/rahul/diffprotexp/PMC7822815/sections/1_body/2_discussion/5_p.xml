<p id="Par50">In conclusion, we have shown here that RUNX1/RUNX1T1 regulates alternative RNA splicing for a sub-set of genes in t(8;21)-positive AML, by controlling the choice of transcriptional start sites and by modulating expression of splicing components. These findings add another layer of dysregulation of gene function by nuclear oncoproteins promoting leukaemogenesis.</p>

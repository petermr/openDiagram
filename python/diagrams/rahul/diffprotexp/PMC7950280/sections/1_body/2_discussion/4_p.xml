<p>Recently, the protective effects of candesartan (an inhibitor of Ang II) on BDNF loss and neuronal apoptosis has also been demonstrated in cognitively impaired rats, pointing to the reduction in BDNF on Ras signaling as a mechanism of neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, BDNF participation in Ras / MAPK signaling pathways was extended by binding to and activating the tyrosine receptor kinase B, giving rise to the differentiation and survival of knock-in striatal cells in HD [

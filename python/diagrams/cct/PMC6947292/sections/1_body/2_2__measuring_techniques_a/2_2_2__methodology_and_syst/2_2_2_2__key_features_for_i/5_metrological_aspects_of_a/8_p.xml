<p>The required wide range of cooling rates is accompanied by another metrological challenge, in that the dimensions of the quench-induced precipitates vary substantially within the cooling rate range. This aspect is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f012">Figure 12</xref>. It can be seen that the dimensions of quench-induced precipitates vary between several tens of µm down to thicknesses of a few atomic layers (≈nm), i.e., the dimensions vary by a factor of &gt;10,000. Comprehensive imaging of quench-induced precipitates over the entire relevant dynamic range (of cooling rates and duration) requires the application of three different types of microscopy: optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Of course, the application of additional analytical methods can provide further detailed information on quench-induced precipitation, and these will be briefly introduced in

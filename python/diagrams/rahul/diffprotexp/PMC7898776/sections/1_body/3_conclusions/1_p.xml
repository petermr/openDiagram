<p id="Par44">Our research indicated the individual differences of acceptance on artificial diets in mandarin fish and the potential molecular mechanism. The mandarin fish which feed on artificial diets, could down-regulate the 
 <italic>ezh1</italic> expression, repressing the tri-methylation level of histone H3 at lysine 27, and then resulting in the increased DNA methylation and mRNA expression of 
 <italic>TFIIF</italic> gene. TFIIF as an important transcription factor, might regulate the expression of genes involved in retinol metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and glycerophosphoric metabolism, and modify the acceptance on artificial diets of mandarin fish. These results suggested the potential effect of histone methylation on food habits domestication in mandarin fish.

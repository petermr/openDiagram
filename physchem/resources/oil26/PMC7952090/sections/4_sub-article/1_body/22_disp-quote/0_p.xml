<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">6) Similarly, the authors observe what appears to be a number of independent duplications of tumor suppressors in African and Asian elephants: duplications that are lacking in many of the ancient genomes considered. The authors used rigorous statistical methods to correct for the fragmented nature of these ancient genomes, but it is very hard not to wonder if some of the data in Figure 4 is really not an artifact of using ancient genomes, where detecting recent gene duplications may be very difficult (several of the Asian and African elephant duplications in Figure 4 appear to be of the same genes). If these events are truly independent and not genome assembly/annotation artifacts, there is then an alternative hypothesis to propose. Thus, are the authors suggesting that there is a rapid turnover in the duplication of tumor suppressors, such that all elephants have such duplicates, but the particular duplications have short life spans and differ from species to species?</p>

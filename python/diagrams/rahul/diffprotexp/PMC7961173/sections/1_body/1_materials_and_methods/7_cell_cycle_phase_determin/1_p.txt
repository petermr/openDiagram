0: HTR-8/SVneo cells were seeded at a density of 400,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere for 24 h prior to treatment.
1: Cells were treated for 12 h with medium alone (control) or DCVC (10 or 20 M).
2: The percentage of cells in each well in G 1/G 0, S, and G 2/M phases were measured using the Cell Cycle Phase Determination Kit (Cayman Chemical; Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and flow cytometry, performed according to the manufacturers protocol.
3: This assay uses propidium iodide (PI) to label DNA.
4: Briefly, after exposure, cells were treated with 0.25% trypsinEDTA and incubated for 2 min to detach adherent cells from the substrate.
5: After incubation, trypsin was deactivated with FBS-containing medium, and the suspended cells were transferred to 5-ml round-bottom fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes.
6: Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of assay buffer, resuspended in 500 l of cell fixative assay buffer solution, and chilled for 2 h at  20 C. After fixation, cells were washed and resuspended in 500 l PI staining solution, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and transported to the University of Michigan Flow Cytometry Core for analysis.
7: Cell phases were quantified using a LSRFortessa Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA).
8: Quantification and dye-based visualization were performed using BD FACSDiva Software (BD Sciences).
9: Cell aggregates and cellular debris were excluded using the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) modes and the analysis was performed using 10,000 events per sample.
10: PI was detected using the 488 nm laser.

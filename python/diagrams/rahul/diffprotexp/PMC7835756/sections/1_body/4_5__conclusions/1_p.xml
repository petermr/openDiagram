 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> overproduction in the transgenic tobacco plants has a high impact on the cytosine DNA methylation status of associated genes, especially with CHG context changes on the gene body regions. The impact was observed in energy metabolism genes, molecule transport, sensing, and signaling related to calcium and DNA repair. This work corroborates that the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is a key compound in the biological process, with a molecular significance at an epigenetic level.

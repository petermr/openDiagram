0: Twelve Sprague-Dawley juvenile (p21) rats of both sexes (n = 6 male, n = 6 female) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 3 g/kg urethane (Sigma-Aldrich).
1: Lumbar spinal cord segments were dissected through ventral laminectomy according to a procedure previously described [ 20].
2: The collected spinal cords were immediately placed in an ice-cold, oxygenated, sucrose protective solution containing 50 mM sucrose, 92 mM NaCl, 17 mM D-glucose, 26 mM NaHCO 3, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH 2PO 4, 0.5 mM CaCl 2, and 7 mM MgSO 4.
3: All the meninges and blood vessels were quickly removed from the meninges and blood vessels spinal cord segments.
4: The tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h at 4C, then placed in a first step of 10% sucrose for 24 h, a second step of 10% sucrose for at least 6 h, and in 30% sucrose solutions (in PB) for 72 h at 4C.
5: Spinal cord tissues were embedded in OCT using cryo-molders and then flash frozen through submersion in isopentane that was supercooled by liquid nitrogen.
6: The embedded spinal cords were then stored at 80C up until sectioning with a microtome cryostat (ThermoScientific).
7: The spinal lumbar segments were sliced into 25 m thick transverse sections.
8: Each section was serially mounted onto pre-treated slides (FisherBrand TM SuperFrost TM Plus) to obtain approximately the same set of L1 to L6 spinal cord sections on each slide.

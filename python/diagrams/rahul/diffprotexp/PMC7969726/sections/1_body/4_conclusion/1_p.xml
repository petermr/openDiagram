<p>Our results provide novel insights into the crucial role of the CPA core factor, CPSF1, and its related aberrant APA as well as AS events in HCC. Although further detailed examination is required to understand the exact mechanism underlying CPSF1-mediated cell growth and APA regulation in HCC, our results suggest that CPSF1 serves as an oncogene, and novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for patients with HCC.</p>

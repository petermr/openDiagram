<p>The database was initially built by searching the specific terms “COVID” and “SARS-CoV-2”, with a manual double-check for differential expression of genes or proteins after SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of the host. To increase the search and the user interface, all data were categorized according to experimental approach, as described above, including the reference article. The SARSCOVIDB is a database to exclusively gather DEGs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus is an important resource to be explored by the scientific community and COVID-19 medical workers in this topic of urgent need. So far, the SARSCOVIDB contains 12,535 differential DEG entries and 9,283 unique genes. These data comprise different experimental approaches with distinct objectives, the majority being obtained from clinical samples (

 </xref>A). Thus, users can easily consult the most frequently reported host models and compare specific gene sets and other information from all published studies with differential expression after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This can facilitate the planning of new experiments, accelerating understanding of the data available and contributing to accelerate understanding of the molecular impact of COVID-19. These expressive numbers in such a short time span of only a few months also highlight the great efforts made by the scientific community to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. The ZIKAVID covered the same kind of data but on ZIKV; however, this generated a smaller number of clinical samples of ZIKV-infected patients,

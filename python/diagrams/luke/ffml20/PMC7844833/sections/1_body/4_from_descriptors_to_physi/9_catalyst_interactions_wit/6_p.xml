<p>Unfortunately, in practice the effects of different particle interactions with the environment, either adsorbate or the NP support can be hard to distinguish. For example, a similar long Pt–O bond (ca. 2.5 Å), which was previously attributed to the interaction between Pt and adsorbed 2-propanol species, was subsequently assigned to the interaction between Pt NPs and the alumina support.

 </sup> Moreover, the short Pt–O bond with a length of ∼2.0 Å can be attributed either to the presence of chemisorbed oxygen, or the formation of PtO

 </sub> oxides. Both of these processes can have also a similar effect on the shape of the XANES features. A similar controversy about the origin of the long metal–oxygen bond was also addressed by Paredis et al. in the study of zirconia-supported Pd catalysts for NO reduction with hydrogen.

 </sup> To better distinguish between these processes, XAS measurements in HERFD mode can be beneficial, as demonstrated by Merte et al.

 <caption> Microstructural details of 6005A: ( A– C) SEM secondary electron images of Mg 2Si particles after very slow cooling (0.00083 K/s), which all seem to be nucleated on coarse primary Fe-rich particles [ 128, 138]. ( A, B) Intragrannular precipitated Mg 2Si plates in two perpendicular alignments; ( C) Mg 2Si precipitate on the grain boundary; ( D) TEM-BF image of rod-shaped precipitate from LTR during cooling with 0.16 K/s to 225 °C (β’/B’, [ 118, 128]). Nucleation seems to take place on an Mn-rich dispersoid particle [ 128]. </caption>

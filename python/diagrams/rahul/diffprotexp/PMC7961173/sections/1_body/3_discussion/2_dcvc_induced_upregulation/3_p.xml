<p id="Par49">Molecular signaling through the ISR has a degree of complexity that allows for tight regulation and tailored response. Although the ISR largely promotes an adaptive, pro-survival program through attenuation of global protein synthesis (Pakos-Zebrucka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>; Wortel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2017</xref>), if restoration to equilibrium fails due to prolonged or severe stress, then protein synthesis may resume via amino acid biosynthesis and transport, ultimately triggering apoptosis (Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>). Contrary to the role of amino acid biosynthesis in triggering cell death as reported by Han et al (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>), we previously demonstrated that HTR-8/SVneo cells are highly dependent on amino acids as a fuel source for successful compensatory mechanisms in response to DCVC treatment, demonstrating ISR complexity (Elkin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020a</xref>). Furthermore, ATF4-regulated gene expression plays a role in both compensation and cell death (Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>). ATF4 regulates the gene expression of other transcription factors, while simultaneously interacting with them to co-regulate additional gene targets. For example, ATF4 regulates the expression of

0: pUC r-yfp and pUC r-cfp were constructed as described previously, except that primers MBPD 82/83 were used for the amplification of the kanamycin resistance cassette from pACYC177 [ 18].
1: pUC r-yfp and pUC r-cfp were used as templates to generate linear PCR products to generate chromosomal P dps-cfp and P dps-yfp transcriptional fusions in  E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 as described previously [ 25].
2: The P dps-cfp and P dps-yfp fusion constructs were amplified from chromosomal DNA with primers MBP 140 and MBPD 156, digested with  KpnI and cloned into pWKS30 [ 27], digested with  FspI and  KpnI to create pPS1 (dpsP- cfp) and pPS2 (dpsP- yfp), respectively, for the differential fluorescent labeling of stationary phase  E. coli cells.

<p>Gleeble 3800 was used to detect the expansion variation during the simulated welding thermal cycle. The sample was 6 mm in diameter and 70 mm in length. The peak temperature was 1320 and 850 °C to simulate the coarse-grained heat affected zone (CGHAZ) and fine-grained heat affected zone (FGHAZ) respectively. The different cooling rates of 1~60 °C·s
 <sup>−1</sup> were set to draw the simulated heat-affected zone continuous cooling transformation diagram (SHCCT). The transformation temperature and transformation kinetic were detected based on the thermal expansion curves.

0: To selectively label the GluN2A NMDAR subunit we used a polyclonal antibody (Alomone Labs, #ACG-002) raised in rabbit.
1: This antibody recognizes the extracellular, N-terminus, sequence GHSHDVTERELRN(C) corresponding to the amino-acid residues 4153 of the rat GluN2A.
2: The peptide is homologous to the mice and humans peptide and, therefore, can be used to detect GluN2A in all of these species.
3: This specific antibody has been used to successfully label GluN2A in previous published immunohistochemistry [ 32], cytochemistry [ 3335], and western blot experiments.

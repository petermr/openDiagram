  <p>Mutations of m
   <sup>5</sup>C writer and reader in GI cancer. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Alteration frequency of m
   <sup>5</sup>C regulatory factors in GI cancer, including mutations, amplification, and deletion, and multiple changes were analyzed from the TCGA database and studied in cBioPortal. About 28% (52/186) of esophageal cancer, 8% (14/186) of pancreatic cancer, 19% (91/478) of stomach cancer, 5% (33/640) of colorectal cancer, 13% (56/442) of liver cancer, and 12% (234/1,928) of GI cancer had genomic changes of m
   <sup>5</sup>C regulators. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The alteration frequency of m
   <sup>5</sup>C regulatory factors in gastrointestinal cancer from the TCGA database was analyzed in cBioPortal. The gene alteration frequencies of m
   <sup>5</sup>C regulators in GI cancer was 2.4% in 
   <italic>NSUN1</italic>, 4% in 
   <italic>NSUN2</italic>, 1.8% in 
   <italic>NSUN5</italic>, and 2.2% in 
   <italic>ALYREF</italic>, etc. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Protein structure alteration (missense, truncating, and inframe mutation) was analyzed in GI cancers.

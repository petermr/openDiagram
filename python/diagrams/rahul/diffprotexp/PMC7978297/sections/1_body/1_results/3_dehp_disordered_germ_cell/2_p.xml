<p>To investigate the inherent mechanism, gene expression patterns at two branches was performed (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). Four gene sets regarding two cell fates were generated: set 1 consisted of 282 genes, mostly and highly expressed in cell fate 1, partly expressed at cell fate 2, and slightly expressed at pre-branch (State 1); furthermore, the GO terms of the top 100 genes in the set were mostly enriched in biological processes such as “Translation”, “Ribosomal small subunit biogenesis”, “Regulation of translation”, “Negative regulation of ubiquitin protein ligase activity” and “rRNA processing”. Set 2 contained 643 genes that were mainly expressed in pre-branch and fate 1 cells, and hugely decreased in fate 2, which acted on “Translation”, “Ribosome assembly”, “Oxidative phosphorylation”, “Ribosome biogenesis”, and “Positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway by p53 class mediator”. For the 396 genes in set 3, they were mainly expressed at pre-branch, showing a slight decline at fate 2 and were dramatically down-regulated at fate 1, but largely enriched in “Synapsis”, “Protein-DNA complex subunit organization”, “Mitochondrial genome maintenance”, “Protein refolding”, and “Negative regulation of mRNA metabolic process”. The 1,371 genes in set 4 seemed to be elevated by DEHP at fate 2 and were related to the processes of “ATP synthesis coupled electron transport”, “Histone H3-K4 monomethylation”, “Cellular response to steroid hormone stimulus” and “Supramolecular fiber organization” (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E). Therefore, following DEHP exposure during PF formation, these results suggest that some biological consequences (such as “organization cell cycle” and “sexual reproduction”) persisted from pre-branch (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>F, set 3), the “process metabolic biosynthetic” decreased (set 2), and “process regulation metabolic” increased (set 4). Moreover, the representative genes in each gene set are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S5</xref>B; for set 4, with enrichment analysis of protein-protein interaction, the genes seemed to be involved in “chromatin organization”, “covalent chromatin modification”, and “histone modification” (

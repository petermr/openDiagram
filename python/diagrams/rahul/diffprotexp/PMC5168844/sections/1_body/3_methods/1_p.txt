0: We have analyzed the preprocessed challenge datasets for CAMDA 2015 provided by the International Cancer Genomic Consortium (ICGC).
1: For our study, we have considered the protein expression and the clinical profiles of the patients for the three cancers: Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC), Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC).
2: A set of 132 proteins is present in the protein expression profiles of each of the three cancers; the patient sample sizes of HNSC, LUAD and KIRC are 212, 237 and 454 patients, respectively.
3: The number of patients in the clinical profile of HNSC, LUAD and KIRC are respectively 422, 473 and 515.
4: The clinical profile of each of the cancer type represents the disease status (progression or complete remission) of each patient.
5: However, 44, 111 and 28 patients have missing disease status in the clinical data of HNSC, LUAD and KIRC respectively.
6: After removing the patients who have missing disease status, we are left with 185 patients (71 in progression group and 114 in complete remission group) in HNSC, 172 patients (51 in progression group and 121 in complete remission group) in LUAD and 430 patients (132 in progression group and 298 in complete remission group) in KIRC, each with expression values of 132 proteins.
7: In summary, we have two groups of patients for each cancer type and a set of recorded protein expression values of 132 proteins for each of them.

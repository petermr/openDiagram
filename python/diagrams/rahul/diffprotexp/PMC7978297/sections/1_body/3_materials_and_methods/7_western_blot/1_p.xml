 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>; proteins from six ovaries were extracted with RIPA lysis solution (Beyotime, P0013C). After denaturation treatment, the protein of each sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Millipore, ISEQ00010, USA) membrane. Subsequently, protein bands were blocked at a temperature of approximately 20 ℃ for 2 h, and the primary antibody was incubated at 4 ℃ overnight. The following day, after three washes, the secondary antibodies were incubated. Finally, a BeyoECL Plus kit (Beyotime, P0018) was used for chemiluminescence. The primary antibodies used for Western blot consisted of MVH (Abcam, ab13840), GDF9 (Abcam, ab93892), LHX8 (Abcam, ab137036), BMPR1A (Affinity, DF6634, Shanghai, China), SMAD3 (Abcam, ab40854), and GAPDH (Affinity, AF7021).

<p>The magnitude of the CNT-induced changes in protein expression was low. Of all the increased proteins, the highest fold change was 1.3. However, decreased expression reached as high as 2.1 fold. The relatively low level of change is not surprising in light of the physiological functional changes demonstrated in previous studies [

Within the concentration range used in the current studies, CNTs decreased the barrier function of both renal and airway high resistance epithelial cell lines but did so without altering cellular viability. In the Calu-3 cells, exposure decreased, but did not fully inhibit, epinephrine stimulated Cl
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> secretion. Therefore some cellular functions are altered but the CNTs are not overtly toxic so one would anticipate compensatory changed in cell metabolism manifested as modest changes in protein content.

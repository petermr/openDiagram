<p>When comparing the acid-sensitivity of rat gastric sensory neurones arising from ND ganglia vs. those from DRG, it was observed that the former displayed biphasic ASIC3-like currents, but had a lower (more acidic) half-maximal pH of activation [

In support of this hypothesis, the hyperresponsiveness observed in mice following induction of increased intragastric acidity was greatly diminished in ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice, the sensory importance of ASIC3 being demonstrated by reduced brainstem activity (measured with c-Fos, a marker of neuronal excitation), and thus ASIC3 can be considered a detector of noxious gastric acid secretion [

As expected with ASIC3 activity, mouse ND gastric and gastroesophageal ganglia neurones displayed greater currents with increased acidity, pH 4.0 vs pH 7.0 (control); however, whereas ASIC3 appears to play a role in acid sensation, perhaps important during dyspepsia, TRPV1 appeared to play a greater role in broader chemo- and mechanosensation [

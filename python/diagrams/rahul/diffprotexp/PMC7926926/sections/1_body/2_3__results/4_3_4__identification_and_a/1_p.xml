<p>The main goal of this study was to understand how 
 <italic>S. luteus</italic> helps masson pine seedlings to tolerate Al stress. So, the specific DEPs identified in LB-04 vs. LB-0 are crucial components of this mechanism. In total, we identified 198 DEPs specific to LB-04 vs. LB-0 group (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-11-00177">Table S4</xref>). Among these 198 proteins, 79 proteins were up-regulated, and 119 proteins showed a down-regulated expression pattern in LB-04 group. A total of 136 proteins were unknown function, providing interesting novel protein resources to further investigate Al-stress response in plants. The major GO terms associated with these proteins were: biological process (gene regulation, metabolic process, oxidation and reduction process, binding process, and response to oxidative stress), molecular functions (hydrolyze activity, peptide activity, catalytic activity, and binding), and cellular components (cytosol, membrane, plastids, mitochondrion, and chloroplast).

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">2) In Results section 3, the cancer pathway frequency data of many nodes seem to not be consistent with data shown in Table 2. For example, "55.8% (29/52) of the pathways that were enriched in the Tethytherian stem-lineage&#8230;, 27.8% (20/72) of the pathways that were enriched in the Proboscidean stem-lineage&#8230;were related to tumor suppression", the cancer pathway percentages shown in Table 2 for these 2 nodes are 63.4% and 38.81%, respectively. While the frequency data in Table 2 are consistent with Supplementary file 3. It is possible that the frequency data shown in the main text are specific to pathways of tumor suppression, rather than cancer related pathways. If this is the case, more detailed data should be shown somewhere else.</p>

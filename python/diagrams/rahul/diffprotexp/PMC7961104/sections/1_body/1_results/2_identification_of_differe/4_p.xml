<p id="p0080">Using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS), we measured the amounts of polar metabolites, including carbohydrates, amino acids, polar lipids, and nucleic acids, in the liver and skeletal muscle from fasted WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, and defined polar metabolites that significantly changed in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice as the differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D; 
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). We detected 167 polar metabolites in liver and identified 63 increased and 39 decreased DEMs in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). In the skeletal muscle, we detected 102 polar metabolites with only 1 that increased, pantothenate, and 10 that decreased in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). The increased DEMs in the liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice included the cofactors ATP and glutathione (GSH), intermediate metabolites of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6P)), and the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (Val, Leu, and Ile), and the decreased DEMs included AMP. The decreased DEMs in skeletal muscle from 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice included several that are particularly abundant in muscle: succinate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), some amino acids such as beta-alanine and betaine, and the antioxidants anserine and carnosine, which are abundant in muscle compared with other organs (

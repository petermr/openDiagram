A possible association between cysticercosis the appearance of brain tumors has also been described; DNA damage may occur in the cells surrounding cysticerci due to the host chronic inflammatory response. A similar association has been proposed between cysticercosis and the development of hematological malignancies, due to chromosomal aberrations [

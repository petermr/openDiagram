<p>DNA methylation is involved in the replication and mismatch repair, the control in gene expression, tissue-specific gene expression, transcript synthesis, signaling to host-pathogen interaction, virus resistance, gene imprinting, and epigenetic memory [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DNA methylation is a highly stable epigenetic mark, due to it can be maintained during the mitotic and meiotic cell division processes, such that these changes provide a mark plausible for the inheritance of metastable epigenetic traits [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, the priming with some compounds alters the DNA methylation behavior of the plant. Î²-Aminobutyric acid (BABA) [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] induce DNA hypermethylation, and it is suggested that it may be associated with the development of memory to enhance stress tolerance. Due to this nature of the epigenetic changes, they are a potential strategy for plant breeding to obtain more adaptable crops to stress. Further, it is necessary to elucidate what kind and doses of stress factors can induce an epigenomic response in the plant genome.

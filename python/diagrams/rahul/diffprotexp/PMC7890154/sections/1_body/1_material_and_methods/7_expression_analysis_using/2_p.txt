0: Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as explained in above section.
1: We have used diluted cDNA (100 ng L 1) for qRT-PCR reactions.
2: Oligos for the qRT-PCR was designed using Genefisher2 software.
3: We selected heat-responsive transcription factors -  HSFA6e (acc.
4: no.
5: KU291394.1),  WRKY (acc.
6: no.
7: KU562861.1), HSPs -  HSP17 (acc.
8: no.
9: JN572711.1),  HSP26 (acc.
10: no.
11: AF097659.1)], antioxidant enzymes   SOD (acc.
12: no.
13: AF092524.1),  POX (acc.
14: no.
15: AF005087.1) and starch biosynthesis pathway linked genes  ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (large subunit; acc.
16: no.
17: KC347594.1), soluble starch synthase gene (acc.
18: no.
19: KJ854903.1) for the expression analysis (Table S3).
20: The samples were used in triplicates for the expression analysis.
21: The expression was performed following the protocol as mentioned in Kumar et al.
22: [ 20].
23: We have used -actin gene (acc.
24: no.
25: AB181991.1) for normalizing the C t value.
26: Further, Pfaffl method [ 24] was used for calculating the relative fold expression of the genes.

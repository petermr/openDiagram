<p>Six large well-defined spots were sequenced by LC/ESI-MS/MS as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0009104.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The spots were excised from Coomassie blue-stained gels and digested with modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in a 3200 QTRAP System (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source and a nanoflow LC system (Agilent 1100 Nano Pump, Waldbronn, Germany), coupled to an Acquity Ultra Performance LC system (Waters Corporations, Milford, MA). For data interpretation and protein identification, MS/MS spectrum datasets were searched using the MASCOT search algorithm v.1.6b9, Matrix Science, London, UK, available at

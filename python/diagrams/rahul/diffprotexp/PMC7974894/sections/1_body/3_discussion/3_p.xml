<p>Here, by performing the pathway enrichment analysis, we revealed that four of six hub RBPs (LEPR, PFKM, PGK1, and CYP19A1) are greatly enriched in metabolic processes. Cellular metabolism lies at the foundation of all biological activities. Unlike normal cells that are instructed to proliferate by extracellular signals, most cancer cells have acquired the ability to take up glucose cell-autonomously through the activation of oncogenes, including AMPK, HIF1Î±, and hence, acquire much more glucose for their oxidative metabolism 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. Here, we identified LEPR is the upstream signal of AMPK. The upregulation of AMPK and HIF1 can directly induce the expression of PFKM and PGK1. These two factors accelerate the use of glucose and thus helps the cancer cells to generate more substrate and energy it needs (Warburg effect). Deregulated glucose uptake has emerged as a hallmark of cancer metabolism

In our study, we did find the abnormally upregulation of LEPR, PFKM and PGK1 in tongue tumor patients and their upregulation are related to patients' poor overall survivals. Another metabolic pathway we identified was hormone biosynthesis, which the prognostic hub RBP CYP19A1 involved. CYP19A1 catalyzes the aromatization of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol, respectively

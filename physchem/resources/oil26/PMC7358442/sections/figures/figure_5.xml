  <p>Patterns of 24-h activity and body temperature of study aardvarks, double-plotted for better visualisation, during a month of a drought summer (February 2013, panel 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, the following drought winter (August 2013, panel 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, during a non-drought summer (February 2014, panel 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, and the following non-drought winter (August 2014, panel 
   <bold>(D)</bold> at Tswalu. Grey areas indicate night time. Error bars indicate SD between individuals. Note that on panel 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, activity patterns of two aardvarks for which data were available were plotted individually to display the difference between an aardvark that survived the drought summer (
   <italic>A06</italic>, filled bars), and one that died in the following month (
   <italic>A02</italic>, empty bars). Mean minimum 24-h air temperatures during the winter months were similar (4.5°C in August 2013; 7.6°C in August 2014). Mean maximum 24-h air temperatures differed between the summer months, with the drought summer up to 10°C hotter than the non-drought summer month (36.5°C in February 2013; 26.0°C in February 2014.

<p>The BBB which is primarily constituted by the brain capillary endothelial cells interacts with neighboring cells, such as pericytes, astrocytes, and neurons to maintain the barrier integrity [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) are a special type of cell that constitute the BBB [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Like poliovirus, EV71 transmitted by the fecal-oral route has an affinity for cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and manifests as poliomyelitis-like paralysis [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Proteomics analysis is currently considered to be a powerful tool for global evaluation of protein expression. In this study, proteomics analyses of HBMEC after EV71 infection were performed. First, we found EV71 could infect and replicate in HBMEC through detecting EV71 RNA [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Secondly, the changes progress of HBMEC proteome induced by EV71 was explored. We found EV71-infected HBMEC can induce 28 differently expressed protein spots compared with control. These proteins might affect BBB dysfunction and lead to the development of EV71 CNS disease.

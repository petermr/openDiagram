0: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of premature mortality worldwide ( 1, 2).
1: IHD affects ~126 million individuals globally (1,655 per 100,000), which is estimated to be 1.72% of the world's population ( 1).
2: Restoration of coronary artery perfusion is currently one of the main treatment options but it can lead to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI), which refers to a more serious myocardial injury caused by blood recanalization after a period of myocardial ischemia compared with that induced by vascular occlusion ( 3, 4).
3: MIRI is reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, which imposes health, social and human burdens on societies worldwide, and thus is a public health issue ( 5-8).
4: Therefore, treatment of MIRI is important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, the end stage of cardiac dysfunction and mortality.

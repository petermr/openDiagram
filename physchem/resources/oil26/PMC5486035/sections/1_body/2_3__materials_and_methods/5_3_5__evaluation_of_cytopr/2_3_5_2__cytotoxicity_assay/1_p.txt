0: For the cytotoxicity assay, cells (1  10 5/mL) were incubated in complete medium without or with 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, or 1 g/mL of sample solution for 24 h in the presence of 100 M tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( t-BOOH).
1: The stock solution of HEO in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were conveniently diluted with phosphate saline buffer to maintain the concentration of the DMSO below 0.1% in the reaction mixture.
2: Parallel controls were performed without  t-BOOH and in the presence of the final concentrations of HEO.
3: After incubation, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining.
4: Briefly, an aliquot of the cell suspension was diluted 1:1 ( v/ v) with 0.4% trypan blue and the cells were counted using a haemocytometer.
5: Results were expressed as the percentage of viable or dead cells (ratio of unstained or stained cells to the total number of cells, respectively).
6: Cytotoxicity was also measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from damaged cells into culture medium and expressed as a percentage of total cellular activity.
7: LDH activity in the medium was determined using a commercially available kit from BioSystems S.A (Barcelona, Spain) and expressed as a function of the total amount of the enzyme present in the  t-BOOH-no treated cells obtained after total cell lysis by sonication.
8: At the concentration tested, HEO does not show any interference with the LDH assay.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The oils of <italic>O. caniculata</italic> showed predominance of sesquiterpenes of selinane and caryophyllane skeletons. In the leaves (<bold>Can-L</bold>), the main compounds were &#946;-selinene (20.3%), &#946;-caryophyllene (18.9%), 7-<italic>epi</italic>-&#945;-selinene (14.3%), and bicyclogermacrene (10.4%); in the branches (<bold>Can-B</bold>), selin-11-en-4-&#945;-ol (20.6%), &#946;-selinene (12.1%), 7-<italic>epi</italic>-&#945;-selinene (9.0%), &#946;-caryophyllene (7.1%), and the phenylpropanoid (<italic>E</italic>)-asarone (8.8%) were identified. Interestingly, the leaf essential oil of <italic>O. foetens</italic>, an endemic species of the Macronesian region (Canary Islands, Spain, and Madeira Islands, Portugal), had very little concentration of monoterpenoids or sesquiterpenoids, but was rich in ethyl <italic>p</italic>-coumarate [<xref rid="B28-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

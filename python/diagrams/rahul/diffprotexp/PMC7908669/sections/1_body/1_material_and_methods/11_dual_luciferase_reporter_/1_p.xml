<p id="Par19">The interactions between miR-3653-3p and circ_0003865 or the 3′ UTR region of the GAS1 gene were verified using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the circ_0003865 sequences and its mutant version, as well as the GAS1 3′ UTR sequences and its mutant version, were amplified by RT-PCR and were ligated into PmirGLO plasmids. The plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using the Lipofectamine TM 2000 transfection kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, along with miR-3653-3p mimics or a negative control. Subsequently, the cells were lysed using the Passive Lysis Buffer and analyzed using the GloMax-20/20 luminometer (#E5311; Promega). At least three biological replicates were conducted for comparison of luciferase activities between groups.</p>

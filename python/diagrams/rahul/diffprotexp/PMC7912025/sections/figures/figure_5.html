 <caption> Pathway analysis of differentially expressed DIU transcripts. ( A) Shown are genome ontologies of enriched DIU transcripts ranked by the number of genes (gene ratio) and by enrichment relative to the genome (pValue). ( B) Biological pathways of DIUs. For each pathway are shown the fraction of the pathway contained within the DIU transcript list and the adjusted p Value. </caption>

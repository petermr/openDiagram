<p>These changed protein expression levels that have been proved in our study between the two growth phases might, for most of our identified proteins, underlie functional adaptations of the cells, such as raising in cell synthesis and metabolism during the exponential phase, while elevating in the virulence and increasing adaptation, as well as survival in the stationary phase. However, there were some controversial results. Thus, we performed transcriptomic analysis to unravel the discrepancy.</p>

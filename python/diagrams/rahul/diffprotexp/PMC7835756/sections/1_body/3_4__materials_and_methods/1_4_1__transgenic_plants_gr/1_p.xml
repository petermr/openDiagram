<p>Seeds from the transgenic lines L8 (overproducing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and L1 (acigotic line) obtained in previous works were used [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The seeds were surface sterilized by immersion in 10% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and washed three times with sterile distilled water. The seeds were left in sterile water for three days; then 20 seeds of each line were sowed in flasks with Murashige-Skoog medium with 100 Âµg/mL of kanamycin as a selection agent for the transgene. They were kept at room temperature under a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod. After three weeks the seedlings were transferred into individual pots with Mixture 3 Peat Moss Sunshine as substrate and kept inside a glass chamber at room temperature with humidity of 70% for three days. They were kept in a greenhouse until seed obtaining. The plants were watered daily.

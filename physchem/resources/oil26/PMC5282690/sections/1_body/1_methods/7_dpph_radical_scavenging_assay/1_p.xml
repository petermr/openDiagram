<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of the EOs was evaluated as described by Senthilkumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], with slight modifications. A volume of 1&#160;ml of 0.1&#160;mM of methanolic solution of the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) was added to 1&#160;ml of increased doses of AcEO ranging from 0.1&#160;mg/ml to 2&#160;mg/ml previously dissolved in methanol. A control sample using methanol instead of AcEO was prepared. Ascorbic acid dissolved in methanol (0.1&#8211;2&#160;mg/ml) was used as standard. The preparations were incubated for 30&#160;min in obscurity at room temperature, then after, absorbance was measured at 517&#160;nm. Pure methanol was used as blank. Measurements were carried out in triplicate for each experiment.</p>

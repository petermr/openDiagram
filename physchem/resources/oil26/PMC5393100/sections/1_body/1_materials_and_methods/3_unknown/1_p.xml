The animals were individually kept under standard vivarium condition (temperature of 25 &#177; 1&#176;C and relative humidity of 45%&#8211;55%, 12 h light, and 12 h dark cycle) with free access to food and water for 1 week to become adapted to the animal laboratory condition. The experiment was approved by the animal ethics guidelines of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. NAFLD was induced with a CDD composed of lard (TD 98262) containing 6.5% kcal from protein, 46.7% kcal from carbohydrate, and 46.8% kcal from fat.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Rats were randomly divided into ten groups with six animals in each group.</p>

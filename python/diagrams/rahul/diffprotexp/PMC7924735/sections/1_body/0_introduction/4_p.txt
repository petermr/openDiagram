1: (2012) first reported and characterized  Taenia solium secretion proteins.
2: These authors used a database of secretion proteins from closely related helminths and the expressed sequence tags combined with BLAST and a mapping of super contigs in the genome of  Echinococcus granulosus, taking advantage of its biological closeness with  T.  solium.
3: While this strategy allowed to outline the possible secretome of  T.  solium, it proved to have great limitations, and only 76 proteins, mostly involved in parasite survival, were identified as ESP.
4: Among these proteins, only 27 had been previously described in  T.  solium; 32 proteins were identified as probably of  T.  solium origin by their homology to sequences found in other helminths, and 17 proteins were determined as produced by the host ( Sus scrofa) [ 6].

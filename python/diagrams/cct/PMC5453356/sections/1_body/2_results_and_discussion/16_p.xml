<p>One drawback of the present study is that all measurements were performed on only one single sample, because we were focusing on the development of a new DSC measurement method. More than 60 heat treatment cycles were applied. By a control measurement, it was found that the precipitation reaction in the heat flow curve is less intensive after 64 heat treatment cycles compared to a fresh sample (

However, the peak time is not influenced, and besides, we are not discussing the absolute precipitation heat, but rather, precipitation heat fractions. Therefore, it is believed that the results correctly present the precipitation kinetics. Furthermore, this multiple use of only one sample also inhibits the evaluation of the precipitation volume fraction. The evaluation of the precipitation volume fraction would be preferable and is basically achievable directly from the DSC results and in detail from the precipitation heat or enthalpy under certain conditions [

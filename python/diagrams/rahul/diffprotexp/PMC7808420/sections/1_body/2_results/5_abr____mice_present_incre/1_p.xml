<p>We next investigated how brain resident cells would respond to SLEV infection in the context of a functional or disrupted type I IFN response. Cleaved (activated) caspase-3 is a marker of cell death [
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and is involved in microglial activation [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We evaluated the presence of cleaved caspase-3 in the brains of SLEV-infected mice to find that SLEV induces the activation of caspase-3 throughout infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4</xref>). Brain samples were recovered from WT and ABR-/- mice infected or not with SLEV on day 3 and 7 p.i. were prepared in histological sections and assessed for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Mock-infected mice brain sections were negative for cleaved caspase-3 staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5a,b</xref>). SLEV-infected WT mouse brain cortexes had detectable levels of cleaved caspase-3 on day 3 p.i., which were increased on day 7 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5c-f</xref>). ABR-/- mice brain sections were also positive for cleaved caspase 3 on day 3 p.i. but at greater levels, similar to WT brains on day 7 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5g-h</xref>).

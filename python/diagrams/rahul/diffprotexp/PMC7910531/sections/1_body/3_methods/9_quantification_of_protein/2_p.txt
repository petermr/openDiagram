0: We excluded samples from four patients due to non-European ancestry (Supplementary Data  7).
1: The final dataset included low-grade and high-grade cartilage samples each from 99 patients, with 4801 proteins was observed in 30% of samples, and 1677 proteins in all samples, in line with the resolution depth of the isobaric labelling method employed.
2: To account for protein loading, abundance values were normalised by the sum of all protein abundances in a given sample, then log2-transformed and quantile normalised.

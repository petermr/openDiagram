 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation is a two-step process that requires the adhesion of bacteria to a surface followed by cell-cell adhesion or intercellular aggregation. In staphylococci, the main molecule responsible for intercellular adhesion is the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), also called poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), which together with other polymers such as teichoic acids forms the major part of the extracellular biofilm matrix [
 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. PIA biosynthesis is mediated by the intercellular adhesin (ica) locus, 
 <italic>icaADB</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>, with the icaB and icaC genes encoding for extracellular membrane proteins, and icaC proposed to be a putative PIA exporter [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Transcriptome analysis of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> recovered from mice with mixed catheter infection demonstrated both icaB and icaC to be upregulated. Regulation of icaADBC is complex and numerous regulatory factors have been implicated, many of which are well-known global transcriptional regulatory factors like SarA and sigmaB [
 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. SarA also appears to enhance biofilm formation more directly, by increasing ica expression [
 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Interestingly, SarU, a member of the SarA family proteins was found to be up-regulated during mixed catheter infection. Combined, the down-regulation of the lrg operon and nuc, concomitant with the upregulation of the icaADBC-encoded PIA indicate transcriptional activation of the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation regulatory network, induced by the presence of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> during mixed biofilm growth.

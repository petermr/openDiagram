 <caption> Effect of DU exposure on the expression of the ETHE1 protein, and role of a specific siRNA of ETHE1 on cell survival rates after DU exposure. MT+/+ mice were administrated with DU at a dose of 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. After 4 days, the ETHE1 levels in kidney tissues ( a) were detected by ELISA and the content of uranium ( b) was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). HEK293 cells were treated with DU (500 μM) for different time (0~4 h) ( c) or different concentrations of DU (0~500 μM) for 4 h ( d), respectively, and then analysed ETHE1 by Western blotting. ( e) HEK293 cells were treated with different concentrations of DU (0~500 μM) for 24 h. Then the cells were fixed and probed with ETHE1 antibody to detect subcellular localization of ETHE1 (red), nuclei were visualized by staining with Hoechst (blue), and mitochondria were visualized by staining with Mito-Tracker Green (green). Intracellular localization of ETHE1 was visualized by confocal microscopy. ( f) Representative western blots showed the levels of ETHE1 in HEK293 cells treated with control siRNA (100 nM) or ETHE1 siRNA (100 nM). siRNA-C, siRNA-control; siRNA-E, siRNA-ETHE1. ( g) After being transfected with ETHE1-specific siRNA or control siRNA, cells were pretreated with or without MT (100 nM) for 24 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by a CCK-8 assay. Results represent means ± SD of five separate experiments. # p &lt; 0.05, compared with control group; * p &lt; 0.05, with a one-way ANOVA and LSD test for multiple comparisons. </caption>

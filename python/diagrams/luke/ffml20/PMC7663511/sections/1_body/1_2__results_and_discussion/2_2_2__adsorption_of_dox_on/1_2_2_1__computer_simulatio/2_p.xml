<p>The simulation time was set to 20 ns, which is sufficient enough to track the process of aggregation of DOX molecules. First, we focus on the analysis of the simulation results obtained for an SWCNTs system. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-08230-f006">Figure 6</xref>a shows the number of aggregates (gray squares) and the average aggregate size (red squares) as a function of time. The number of aggregates decreases very fast from the values of the order of 1000 corresponding to small DOX aggregates, to the values below 10, characteristic for large aggregates. At the same time, the average aggregate size increases from a value of about 2.5 to a value close to 350 after about 7.4 ns and remains stable after that time. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-08230-f006">Figure 6</xref>b presents the percentage of all DOX molecules adsorbed onto the SWCNTs (gray squares) and the percentage of DOX molecules adsorbed inside SWCNTs (red squares). The fluctuations of the latter result from the algorithm of their counting. This algorithm divides the nanotube into single carbon rings arranged in parallel. For each of these rings, the algorithm calculates the number of DOX molecules whose center of mass lies inside the sphere of a radius smaller than that of the nanotube and coincides with the center of mass of the analyzed carbon ring. Then, from the sum of all rings, we eliminate duplicate DOX molecules. Each of the carbon rings of the nanotubes is deformed to some extent from the ideal circle in time, which causes fluctuations in the calculated number of DOX molecules that have been adsorbed into the nanotubes. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-08230-f006">Figure 6</xref>b, about 33% of DOX molecules are attached to SWCNTs covering them from the outside, while only about 1.5% are adsorbed on the inside. The small amount of DOX molecules that is adsorbed inside the nanotube is a result of two types of aggregation processes taking place simultaneously. One of them is the formation of aggregates exclusively by DOX molecules. The other involves the adsorption of both single DOX molecules as well as aggregated DOX clusters on the nanotube. Individual DOX molecules, due to their small size with respect to the diameter of the nanotube, can relatively easily enter the nanotube. The amount of free DOX molecules and small DOX aggregates drastically decreases over time and thus the probability of entering DOX into the nanotube drastically decreases. This explains the small number of DOX molecules inside the nanotube relative to their total adsorption on its surface.

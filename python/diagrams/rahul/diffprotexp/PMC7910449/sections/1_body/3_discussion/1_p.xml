<p id="Par31">The present study showed that the circRAB11FIP1 level was upregulated in SKOV3 cells, and it was mediated via Torn1. Meanwhile, the circRAB11FIP1 level increased in epithelial cancer tissues compared with non-carcinoma tissues. In addition, circRAB11FIP1 silencing was found to suppress the autophagic flux, which was accelerated by circRAB11FIP1 ectopic expression. The circRAB11FIP1-induced autophagy promoted ovarian cancer migration and growth. Furthermore, circRAB11FIP1 was found to sponge miR-129 to modulate ATG14 and ATG7. CircRAB11FIP1 allowed the direct binding with DSC1 to promote its level.</p>

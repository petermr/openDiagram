<p>The most fine-grained analysis of differential co-expression aims at identifying pairs of genes that change their co-expression across conditions, losing, gaining or switching the sign of their correlation. Often, single genes with overall large changes in connectivity across the whole network are identified. This approach has the advantage of providing easily testable hypotheses, involving one or two specific genes, at the cost of lower interpretability. Therefore, most studies combine the “gene-specific” approach with the identification of modules as ensembles of DC genes or built from a single gene changing its connectivity, which is used as a seed for a module’s construction.</p>

<p>5-Methylcytosine modification is regulated by methyltransferases (writers, including 
 <italic>NSUN1-7</italic> and 
 <italic>TRDMT1</italic> [
 <italic>tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1</italic>]) and binding protein (reader, i.e., 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> [
 <italic>Aly/REF export factor</italic>]). 
 <italic>NSUN1-7</italic> and 
 <italic>TRDMT1</italic> are known writers for chemical RNA modifications (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <italic>NSUN1</italic> (NOP2 nucleolar protein/rRNA MTase) plays an important role in maintaining cell proliferation capacity and is possibly involved in the regeneration of nervous tissue (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <italic>NSUN2</italic> (
 <italic>NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2/</italic>mRNA and tRNA MTase) is a main RNA modification methyltransferase. Its mechanism of action includes controlling cell division, growth arrest, and promoting premature senescence (

 <italic>NSUN2</italic> mutations lead to intellectual disability in human diseases (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbasi-Moheb et al., 2012</xref>). 
 <italic>NSUN3</italic> (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 3/mt-tRNA MTase) and 
 <italic>NSUN4</italic> (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 4/mt-rRNA MTase) have important impacts on the mitochondria (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <italic>NSUN5</italic> (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 5/rRNA MTase) is a conserved rRNA methyltransferase (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Schosserer et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>NSUN6</italic> (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 6/tRNA MTase) modifies tRNAs in their biogenesis (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Haag et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>NSUN7</italic> (
 <italic>NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 7</italic>) gene product plays a role in sperm motility (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Khosronezhad et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>TRDMT1</italic> (also known as 
 <italic>DNMT2</italic>) was previously considered as a DNA MTase, but it is now primarily regarded as a tRNA MTase (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer and Lyko, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Squires et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jeltsch et al., 2017</xref>). Up to now, the m
 <sup>5</sup>C eraser is still unknown, and the only known binding protein (reader) of m
 <sup>5</sup>C is 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic>. 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> as an m
 <sup>5</sup>C reader can promote mRNA export (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Yang X. et al., 2017</xref>). In general, m
 <sup>5</sup>C methyltransferases are strongly associated with diseases.

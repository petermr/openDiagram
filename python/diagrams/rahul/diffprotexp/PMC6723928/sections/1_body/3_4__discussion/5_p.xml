<p>Actins are highly conserved proteins [
 <xref rid="B26-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] involved in cell motility, structure, and integrity. Beta-actin (human gene and protein symbol ACTB/ACTB), one of the two non-muscle cytoskeletal actin isoforms, is one of six different actin isoforms which have been identified in humans. In this study, mutant beta-actin expression was increased ten-fold in the experimental groups, compared to the healthy pulp (

 <xref rid="B11-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported an upregulation of the actin cytoskeleton component, tropomyosin alpha-1 chain protein, in caries-resistant teeth, but further research is necessary to verify the contributions of beta-actin.

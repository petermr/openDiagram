 <caption> Synaptic markers in AD. Pre-synaptic, pos-synaptic and mitochondrial proteins were determined in post-mortem human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of sporadic AD patients and controls. The levels of synaptophysin, PSD95 and HSP60 were determined in: ( A) SNpc; ( B) Hippocampus and ( C) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. ( D) Densitometric analysis of the levels of GRP78 and ATF4. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information. </caption>

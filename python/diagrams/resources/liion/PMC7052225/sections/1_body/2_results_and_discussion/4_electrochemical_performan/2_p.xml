<p id="Par33">Self-standing LTO films with different loadings are prepared following the same method of fabrication described in Scheme 
 <xref rid="Sch2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The cyclic voltammetry and rate capability experiments are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. When the load is increased (because of the LTO mass), the intensity of redox peaks in the voltammogram (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>) increases, and the polarization slightly decreases. This behavior demonstrates that this technique of fabrication can be adapted for high loads of active material. Furthermore, the corresponding rate capabilities shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref> are considerably similar up to a rate of 2 C. At 2 C, approximately 135 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> is obtained, representing ~85% of the initial discharge capacity (160 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>). A few slight variations among the anode capacities are observed at 5 C; nevertheless, approximately 90–100 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> is delivered. Similar to the LFP cathodes, a better electrochemical performance is obtained when a small amount of CNT–COOH is added to the composition of the LTO electrode. For instance, at a 5 C rate, a specific capacity of 120 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> is obtained (Fig.

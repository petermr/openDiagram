  <p>Example view of human reaching experiment; grey circles indicate the task arena boundary which participants were instructed to move the joystick through. (
   <bold>A</bold>) During baseline and aftereffect blocks, the green cursor follows the trajectory of the joystick (arrow). (
   <bold>B</bold>) To induce visuomotor adaptation during the Adaptation block, a 30
   <sup>o</sup> clockwise rotation to the position of the green cursor was implemented, providing the illusion of an incorrect joystick trajectory (dashed arrow). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Example event markers and muscle activity recorded during the cat forelimb reaching movement in one trial. Tonic bursting activity of triceps (extensor) muscles ceases immediately before the forelimb breaks contact with the contact plate. At this time, Cleidobrachialis (flexor) muscle begins a ramped increase in activity that lasts for the duration of the reach, with activity continuing beyond as the animal collects the food reward. R.T., reaction time in response to cue to start reach; Dur, duration of reaching movement to target.

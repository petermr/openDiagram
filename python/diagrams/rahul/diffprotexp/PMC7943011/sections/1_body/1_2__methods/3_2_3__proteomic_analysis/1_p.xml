<p>Proteins were extracted with scioExtract buffer (Sciomics, Heidelberg, Germany) and total protein concentrations were measured with the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The samples were labelled at an adjusted protein concentration with scioDye 1 and scioDye 2 (Sciomics) for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by an exchange of the buffer to PBS and proteins were analyzed in a dual-color approach using a reference-based design on nine scioDiscover antibody microarrays (Sciomics) targeting 1,300 different proteins with 1,830 antibodies in quadruplicates. Arrays were blocked with scioBlock (Sciomics) on a Hybstation 4800 (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland) and afterwards incubated competitively using a dual-color approach. After incubation for 3 h, slides were washed with PBSTT, rinsed with 0.1% (v/v) PBS as well as water and subsequently dried with N

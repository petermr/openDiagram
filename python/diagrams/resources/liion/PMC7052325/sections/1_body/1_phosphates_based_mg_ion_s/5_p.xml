<p>Later in 2016, Imanaka and Tamura claimed that most of the attempts to obtain the NASICON-type structure of Mg ion conductor were unsuccessful, because of the small ionic radius of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> resulting in the formation of β-Fe
 <sub>2</sub>(SO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>-type structure at high temperature (Tamura et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). They selected HfNb(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> as the mother solid and partially substituted Hf
 <sup>4+</sup> with Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> to realize Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> conduction. Although the ion conductivity of (Mg
 <sub>0.1</sub>Hf
 <sub>0.9</sub>)
 <sub>4/3.8</sub>Nb(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> at high temperature was lower than that of Mg
 <sub>0.7</sub>(Zr
 <sub>0.85</sub>Nb
 <sub>0.15</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>6</sub>, the Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ion conductivity of the former at a moderate temperature of 300°C (2.1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) was 20 times higher than that of latter (1.1 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The authors proposed that the good ionic conductivity was resulted from the three-dimensionally well-ordered NASICON structure and also the presence of cations with a higher valence than that of the conducting cation Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, enabling the smooth ion migration of the latter.

<p>In order to make MgSc
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub> as an applicable solid-state conductor, Wang and Fichtner tried two strategies to reduce the electronic conductivity of MgSc
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub>, including synthesizing Se-rich phase and doping with Ce
 <sup>4+</sup> or ti
 <sup>4+</sup> to partially substitute Sc
 <sup>3+</sup> (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, neither methods could successfully reduce the electronic conductivity. The authors suggested to employ MgSc
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub> as a surface coating to protect Mg anode or cathode materials.

<p>The results emerging from co-expression network analysis demonstrated that the blue and turquoise modules had the greatest correlation with HD and BDNF expression, in which the DEGs were involved in GABAergic synapse, phagosome, Rap1, cAMP, MAPK, Ras and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathways. Additional experiments from animal HD models linked the MAPK signaling pathway to the neurotoxicity of mHtt [

 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More specifically, the role for MAPK signaling in HD was supported by mHtt-induced inhibition of fast axonal transport through the activation of MAPKs, which provided a molecular basis for HD neuropathology [

 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several indirect evidences confirmed the linkage between BDNF and MAPK signaling, namely, the targeted deletion of MAPK kinases inhibited the neuroprotective action of BDNF, leading to neuronal apoptosis and brain developmental defects [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, pretreatment with BDNF prevented MAPK phosphorylation activated by amyloid-beta peptide in the entorhinal cortex of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a negative correlation of BDNF with MAPK signaling [
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, our results supported the likelihood that low expression of BDNF was involved in the hyperactivation of MAPK signaling and that enhancing BDNF expression could be neuroprotective in HD.

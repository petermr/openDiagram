 </sup> applying the default parameters and using the quality filtered RNA-seq data and the assembled transcriptome generated with Trinity as reference. Three samples of normal mesentery, 3 of day 1 regenerating intestine and 3 of day 3 regenerating intestine were used for the differential expression analysis. Equivalence classes generated by Salmon were used to hierarchically cluster contigs by sequence similarity and expression using Corsetv1.06
 <sup>

 </sup> with default settings and the parameterâ€”D 9 for all samples (9). Lastly, DESeq2 tool package
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>
 </sup> was used to extract differentially expressed clusters of contigs from the read count files generated with Salmon. Files with less than 30 read counts were filtered from every biological replicate of each sample. Workflow used in the differential expression analysis can be found at

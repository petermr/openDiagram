<p>Adhesive tape sampling is a non-invasive method that allows recovery of cells comprising and associated with the epidermal stratum corneum and granulosum.
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–34</xref> Studies in atopic dermatitis (AD), contact dermatitis, psoriasis and melanoma have used non-invasive tape sampling to investigate disease-specific gene profiles and identify genomic tumour phenotypes and disease-associated transcriptomic endotypes.

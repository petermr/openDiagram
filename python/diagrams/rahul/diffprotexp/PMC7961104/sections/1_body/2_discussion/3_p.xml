<p id="p0205">We provided the potential mechanisms of dysregulations of the inter-organ metabolic cycle of ketone body; both the production of a ketone body, 3-OH butyrate, in liver and its release from the liver into the blood increased in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, suggesting that excess lipids are converted into this ketone body in the liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. In addition, the expression of the gene encoding the 3-OH butyrate transporter in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice decreased. However, the amount of 3-OH butyrate in the blood was similar between WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, suggesting that organs other than skeletal muscle take up this ketone body, preventing its accumulation in the blood despite increased production and release by the liver. In skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, the expression of ketone body transporter and metabolic enzyme and the amount of 3-OH butyrate decreased, despite activation of enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation in skeletal muscle. These results suggest that fatty acids instead of ketone bodies were metabolized to produce acetyl-CoA in skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle from 
 <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, 5 of the 8 increased DEMEs involved in fatty acid degradation were not upregulated at the transcript level (see 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B), suggesting that the increased abundance of these enzymes may be controlled by the modulation of protein turnover.

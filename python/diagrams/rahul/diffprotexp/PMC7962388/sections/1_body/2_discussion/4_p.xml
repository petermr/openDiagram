<p id="Par72">The set of sequences presented here considerably increases the number of transcripts available from the Roche 454/FLX + reference library [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and offers information on the expression dynamics for each sequence in the course of development. The GDEA analysis showed 13,205 (68%) and 6147 (32%) transcripts up- and down-regulated during apomixis, providing full-length sequences for most of them and pointing to a greater complexity for the molecular control of agamospermy with respect to sexuality. Meanwhile, the SSDEA study revealed a higher number of DETs than GDEA, a clear indication of expression heterochronicity for a considerable number of transcripts (that is because those genes showing upregulation at different developmental stages in apomictic and sexual plants are classified as ‘non-differential’ in the GDEA). Particularly, a large number of DETs and DEATs was detected at anthesis, which reveals an abundance of exclusive pathways at this stage. Regarding this, chronological differences in the onset of the sexual and apomictic embryonic periods should be taken into account: in apomictic plants, parthenogenesis of the 2n (non-reduced) egg cell starts at the end of megagametogenesis, while in sexual plants, the legitimate n (reduced) egg cell remains quiescent until fertilization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Then, at least a part of the differentially expressed transcripts detected at anthesis might be related alternatively to the induction of parthenogenesis or to embryo development, since, at anthesis, embryos are forming in apomictic plants only. Besides, other genes like those related to pollen-stigma interactions or pollen discharge into the egg cell could also be integrating this particular group of DETs.

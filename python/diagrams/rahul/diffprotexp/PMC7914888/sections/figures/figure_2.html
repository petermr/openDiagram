 <caption> B16F1 cells exposed for 72 h to 5-Brd-2′-dU reveal changes in markers associated with senescence. ( a) Representative photographs of B16F1 cells after the chromogenic assay for senescence-associated β-Galactosidase activity (S.A. β-Gal). ( b) Quantification by spectrophotometry of the S.A. β-Gal activity at pH 6.0. ( c) Representative photographs of immunofluorescence (IF) in B16F1 cells labeled against histone H3K9me3 (green) and nucleus staining with DAPI (blue). ( d) Measurement of the apparent cell area in µm2 from bright-field photographs of 100 B16F1 cells ( n = 3). ( e) Diagram of cell complexity (SSC-A) and size (FSC-A) acquired by flow cytometry and its distribution by quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4). The significance level (*) using two-tailed multiple t-tests, and the differences were considered statistically significant for a p-value &lt; 0.05 using the Holm–Sidak method. Significant (*) with p &lt; 0.05, significant (***) with p &lt; 0.001. </caption>

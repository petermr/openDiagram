<p id="Par32">All patients were biologic naïve, had received previous treatment with DMARDs, and were selected if they were treated with adalimumab and could be categorised as good or non-responders to treatment at 3 months. Stringent inclusion criteria were applied to select responder groups. Good-responders were defined by a 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) of &lt; 2.6 at follow-up (i.e. clinical remission) and an improvement of &gt; 1.2. Non-responders were included if their improvement in DAS28 was &lt; 0.6 with an endpoint DAS28 of &gt; 5.1 (i.e. high disease activity). Non-responder patients were excluded if anti-drug antibodies, measured by radioimmunoassay at 3-month follow-up, were detected in serum samples and/or if they self-reported non-adherence [

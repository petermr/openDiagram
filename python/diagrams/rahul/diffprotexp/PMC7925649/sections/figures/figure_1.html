 <caption> ( A) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the patient transcriptome profiles in different comparisons. ( B) Heatmap of differentially regulated genes ( q-value &lt; 0.05, fold change exceeding 1.5×). ( C) Volcano plots of the different comparisons performed on the HLHS cohort samples where red dots indicate genes with a q-value &lt; 0.05 and a linear fold change of at least 1.5×, and grey dots are genes that do not meet these criteria.

<p>Reviewer #1:Â All most all the issues raised by the reviewers are well addressed. Though authors put several references in their defense but as per my consideration, several other experiment should be set up to confer the PSII of heterocyst and it mechanism to prevent nitrogenase oxidation inside. The positive ARA activity is an indication that the Vegetative cells may perform nitrogen fixation under limited nitrogen condition. Hope this paper will provide a new direction of research to the authors as well as the researchers who will read it in near future.</p>

0: Cell type- and tissue-differential GE patterns have been largely conserved during vertebrate evolution, whereas differential AS patterns, overall (with the exception of conserved sub-networks of AS events) have evolved rapidly and display increased complexity during evolution, particularly in the nervous system 19,  20.
1: Moreover, increasing examples have been reported of functionally important neuronal subtype-specific AS patterns 21  23.
2: APA also shows extensive variation between tissues and species 24,  25, with pronounced changes in neural cells that predominantly result in longer 3 UTRs to facilitate extensive post-transcriptional regulation 24,  25.
3: For example, changes in the expression of 3 UTR sequences through APA can regulate the localization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to dendrites and axons, in part to facilitate localized translation 26.
4: APA has been implicated in the regulation of long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons 27.
5: Hence, in conjunction with differential GE, AS and APA are important and complementary regulatory layers that contribute to the specification of neuronal subtypes.
6: Yet, the relative degrees to which these regulatory layers contribute to cell-type specification in the nervous system has not been systematically investigated.

<p id="par0260">The significant high activity of MAPK under HS was correlated with the traits linked with thermotolerance of wheat. With increase in the MAPK activity, we observed very high activity of antioxidant enzymes in HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk in response to HS. Wheat showed significant increase in the ROS and osmolyte under terminal HS. The accumulation was more significant in thermotolerant

 <caption> Kawasaki disease (KD) sera increased E-selectin level in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). (A–C) HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from healthy controls (HCs; n = 6), KD without coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL–; n = 6), and KD with coronary artery lesion (KD-CAL+; n = 6) for 4 h. The E-selectin mRNA levels were measured by qPCR ( A, HC = 6, KD-CAL– = 6, KD-CAL+ = 6), and protein levels were measured by Western blot ( B, HC = 6, KD-CAL– = 6, KD-CAL+ = 6). (C) Statistical analysis of immunoblots. (D,E) HCAECs were treated with medium containing 15% sera from HCs ( n = 6), KD-CAL– ( n = 6), and KD-CAL+ ( n = 6) for 4 h; localization and expression of E-selectin (green) in HCAECs were measured by immunofluorescence. (D,E) Statistical analysis of immunofluorescence. The bar graphs are mean ± SEM. ** P &lt; 0.01 compared with the indicated group. </caption>

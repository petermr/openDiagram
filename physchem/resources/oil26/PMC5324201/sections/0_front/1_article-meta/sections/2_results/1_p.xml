<p>A total of 24 constituents was identified and quantified in the essential oil and its water extract portion by GC and GC-MS. Apiol (81.99 and 74.779%) was found the highest phenylpropanoid constituent followed by m-diaminobenzene (10.446 and 8.778%) in the essential oil and aqueous extract portion. On the other hand, &#946;-butyrolactone (5.13%) and isobutyl acetone (3.73%) were found in the major constituents in the water extract part. The IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of the essential oil was found to be 3.07&#160;mg/mL by DPPH radical assay methods. The LC
   <sub>50</sub> value of the brine shrimp cytotoxicity assay of the essential oil was observed at 0.81&#160;&#956;g/mL. The essential oil showed better activity on Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The proximate composition showed that root contained 5.29% ash, 2.01% protein, 54.09% crude fibre, 0.15% essential oil and 1.14% fatty oil for hot extract and 0.23% for cold extract on the dried basis. The palmitic (33.81 &amp; 31.58%) and linoleic acid (30.03 &amp; 23.79%) were the major saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the cold and hot extracted root powder respectively. Ca (23,600&#160;mg/kg), Mg (7620.33&#160;mg/kg) and K (1286.15&#160;mg/kg) were the most predominant elements followed by Ni (1187.30&#160;mg/kg), Se (913.79&#160;mg/kg), Li (317.84&#160;mg/kg), Na (288.72&#160;mg/kg) and Fe (206.88&#160;mg/kg). The toxic elements were found to be within the permissible limit. Glutamic acid (19.37%), glycine (14.53%) and lysine (17.08%) were found as the major amino acids. The decomposition rates were obtained by TG, DTG and DTA curve of the powder sample at various temperature ranges.

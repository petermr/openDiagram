<p id="Par65">A recently identified protein in the inner ear, actopaxin (parvin α) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] is associated with organ morphology. This protein is found exclusively on P3 relative to P14 and interacts with Ilk in the P3 cochlea, as confirmed by our coIPs. Interestingly, a recent study suggests that the integrin/pinch1/parvin (IPP) protein complex regulates apico-basal polarity of mammary cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Hence, parvin’s early expression may contribute to regulating actin organization at the apical and basal poles of cochlear sensory cells.

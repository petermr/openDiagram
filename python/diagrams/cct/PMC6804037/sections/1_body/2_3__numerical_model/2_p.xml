<p>In this paper, the finite element model was built using the Simufact Welding 8.0 software (MSC Software, Hamburg, Germany). Thermoâ€“physical and mechanical properties have important influences on the results of FEM simulation. Thermal conductivity was taken as 42.7 W/mK, while liquidus temperature and solidus temperature were taken 1733 K and 1693 K, respectively. These properties are displayed in

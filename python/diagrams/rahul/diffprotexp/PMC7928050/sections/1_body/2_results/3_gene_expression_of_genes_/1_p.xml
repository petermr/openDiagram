<p>Sirpb1a, Spp1, and Mmp12 were most significantly upregulated in both groups. Sirpb1a encodes for Signal-regulatory protein beta 1, which is a transmembrane receptor, that acts as a phagocytic receptor on macrophages[
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is involved in inflammatory response[
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) gene encodes for the protein Osteopontin, which is a phosphorylated protein of the ECM, that has a dominant role in B and T cell control[
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], in cancer development and is a gene relevant for ECM[
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is highly expressed in adipose tissue macrophages[

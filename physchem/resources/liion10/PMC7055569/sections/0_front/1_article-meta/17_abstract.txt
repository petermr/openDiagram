0: AbstractIn recent years, there has been an upsurge in the study of novel and alternative energy storage devices beyond lithiumbased systems due to the exponential increase in price of lithium.
1: Sodium (Na) metalbased batteries can be a possible alternative to lithiumbased batteries due to the similar electrochemical voltage of Na and Li together with the thousand times higher natural abundance of Na compared to Li.
2: Though two different kinds of NaO  2 batteries have been studied specifically based on electrolytes until now, very recently, a hybrid Naair cell has shown distinctive advantage over nonaqueous cell systems.
3: Hybrid Naair batteries provide a fundamental advantage due to the formation of highly soluble discharge product (sodium hydroxide) which leads to low overpotentials for charge and discharge processes, high electrical energy efficiency, and good cyclic stability.
4: Herein, the current status and challenges associated with hybrid Naair batteries are reported.
5: Also, a brief description of nonaqueous NaO  2 batteries and its close competition with hybrid Naair batteries are provided.

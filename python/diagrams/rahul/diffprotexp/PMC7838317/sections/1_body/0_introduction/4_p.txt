0: In a previous study, we found that translocation of the freshwater mussel  Amblema plicata (Threeridge), whether to another river system or into captivity, induces a similar general stress response, characterized by decreased levels of metabolites involved in amino acid, polyamine, methionine, and nucleotide metabolism 29.
1: Because mussels exhibited changes in primary metabolic pathways up to a year post-translocation, it is reasonable to infer that these metabolic changes were accompanied by changes in gene expression.
2: However, there are few genomic resources available for freshwater mussels 30, and while some studies have looked at the effects of environmental stressors on gene expression of freshwater mussels 31  33, none have described the effects of translocation to other habitats.
3: We sequenced and characterized the transcriptome of the freshwater mussel  Amblema plicata to establish the necessary molecular resources to assess transcriptomic changes in response to various experimentally-induced environmental stressors in this tolerant species 34.
4: Here, we leverage the power of RNA-Seq in a comparative transcriptomic framework to determine how translocation into captivity changes the gene expression profile of  A. plicata so that we can better understand the physiology of  A. plicata and the effects of this common conservation technique.
5: Specifically, the study objectives were to determine whether  A. plicata experience stress after 11 months in captivity, and whether changes in gene expression reveal how biological pathways are governed.

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The ability of samples to protect supercoiled pBR322 plasmid against AAPH was measured according to the method described by Zhang and Omaye with some modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Intact pBR322 plasmid (0.5&#8201;&#956;g) was mixed with various concentrations of samples and 2&#8201;&#956;L of 25&#8201;mM AAPH in PBS (pH 7.4), and the mixture was incubated for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Then the samples were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel containing 0.5&#8201;&#956;g/mL ethidium bromide, photos of DNA bands were taken under gel image analysis system.</p>

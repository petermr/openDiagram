<p>The second-generation antihistamine, loratadine is known to be used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The drug has good absorption from the gastrointestinal tract when given orally reaching peak plasma concentration after 1 to 1.5
 <bold> </bold>hour (Moffat et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, it has poor oral bioavailability (40%) as it experiences rapid first-pass hepatic metabolism (Borgaonkar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Therefore, in order to avoid the drug metabolism in the liver, an alternate route of delivery would be favored.

<p>The data showed that ATP synthase and urease were markedly up-regulated in the ammonium group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g015">Fig 15</xref>), and the bacteria grew normally in both groups. The GO analyses showed that the electron transfer activity was significantly higher in the ammonium group than it was in the urea group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g016">Fig 16</xref>). Jahns 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> might have an ATP production mechanism associated with urea catabolism [
 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Once the bacteria of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> were under hypoxic environments, the synthesis of urease in the bacteria would stop [
 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It was known that 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> was unable to utilize glucose. Therefore, the metabolism of oxygen in the bacteria was probably to be oxidative phosphorylation which was closely related to the synthesis of ATP. From this perspective, the synthesis of urease might require the support of ATP, 
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., the synthesis of urease required an increase in oxidative phosphorylation activity indirectly. As an energy currency, ATP was quickly exhausted during hypoxia, leading to the termination of urease synthesis. Moreover, the ammonium was involved in the regulation of the internal pH of the bacteria and leaded to an increase in the bacterial proton electric potential, which stimulated the synthesis of ATP [
 <xref rid="pone.0246818.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It was consistent with the results of Jahns’s that the addition of ammonium could stimulate ATP synthesis more directly and efficiently compared to the addition of urea at the same nitrogen content. Such a result might be due to the fact that ammonium was a direct factor in stimulating ATP synthesis in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>. However, when urea was present in the environment, the bacteria’s efficient urease could catalyze urea hydrolysis to the ammonium required for its metabolism, thus completing the ATP synthesis and other metabolic activities.

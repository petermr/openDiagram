0: In vitro evaluation of biofilm formation of the   S. aureus lrgA and lrgB mutant strains .
1: Biofilm formation of  S. aureus knock-out mutants defective in cell autolysis regulation (lrgA and lrgB) was comparatively evaluated to the WT strain.
2: 24 hrs biofilms were evaluated based on metabolic activity measurement using the MTS-assay as per manufacture directions (Promega; Madison, WI).
3: Total biofilm biomass was evaluated by the crystal violet staining assay where 24 hr-grown biofilms were fixed in methanol for 20 mins, air dried and stained with crystal violet solution (0.2%) for 20 mins.
4: The excess crystal violet was removed, plates were washed twice with PBS and cell-bound crystal violet was dissolved in 33% acetic acid.
5: 100 l of the extraction solution was transferred to 96-well plates and absorbance was measured at 595 nm.

 </sup> Pathway Analysis software (IPA), we provided insights into AAS-induced protein expression changes in the GT1-7 cell line. These networks are ranked by scores, and are based on the number of focus proteins and the size of the network. Scores of 10 or higher (negative log of the P value) have high confidence, avoiding random effects [

The pathway analysis identified only one network with a high score of 35, and it was associated to drug metabolism, glutathione depletion, protein synthesis, immunological disease, and endocrine system development and function. The network incorporated 13 focus proteins out of the 17 identified proteins modulated by 17α-meT (

The cannonical signaling pathway showed the highest significance and number of focus proteins for glycolysis (3 proteins), gluconeogenesis (3 proteins), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR signaling; 3 proteins), glutathione mediated detoxification (2 proteins) and NRF2-meditaited oxidative stress response (3 proteins). Other signaling pathways associated with AAS-induced protein modulation are shown in

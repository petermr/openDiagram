<p>Total protein quantification was performed using Coomassie Plus assay as per the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, 10 µl of the samples or albumin (BSA) standards were pipetted into a 96 well plate in duplicate. 300 µl of Coomassie Plus reagent was added to each well and placed on a plate shaker protected from sunlight for 5–10 minutes. The absorbance of each sample was read at 595 nm on a spectrophotometric plate reader and blanked against water. Standard dilutions were used to derive a four-parameter best-fit standard curve to calculate sample protein concentration (µg/ml). HA-ELISA values were then normalized against total protein content of the sample for the purposes of this study. No Coomassie assay was performed for serum samples.</p>

<p>Transformed yeast colonies were pre-cultured in 5 mL of S6A media or 24 h at 28°C. For small-scale expression tests, the pre-culture was diluted to OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.2 in 20 mL of YPGE2X rich media (2% (w/v) Bacto
 <sup>TM</sup> Peptone, 2% (w/v), yeast extract, 1% (w/v) glucose and 2.7% (w/v) ethanol) and cultured for 30 h at 28°C. Then, the cell culture was cooled down to 18°C, and 20 g/L of galactose was added to induce protein expression for 18 h at 18°C.

0: The dosage form of DPIs is usually a capsule, which must be punctured with sharpened pins to release the powders 49.
1: Laryngeal administration of powders are inhaled through the oral cavity, and the suction of powders from the mouth is the first step.
2: Therefore, emptying rate is an important indicator for evaluating DPIs 50.
3: Firstly, shells of 10 empty capsules were precisely weighed ( W1), filled each capsule with SCU@CD-MOF or free CD-MOF 10 mg, and accurately weighed respectively ( W2).
4: Then, the capsules were placed one by one into the inhalation device for NGI (NGI-094, Copley Scientific Ltd., Nottingham, UK), the flow rate was set to 65 L/min, the capsule weight was measured after emptying ( W3), and the emptying rate was calculated as shown in Eq.
5: (6).
6: (6)Emptyingrate(%)=(W2W3)(W2W1)100

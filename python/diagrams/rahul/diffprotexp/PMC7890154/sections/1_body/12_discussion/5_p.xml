 <italic>cv</italic>. HD3086 showed higher expression level of 
 <italic>MAPK-1</italic> with lower activity under differential HS. The MAPK mRNA translation has tight regulation and regulates the expression of MAPK gene in response to intracellular and extracellular environmental cues [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Different signaling pathways interrupt the mRNA translation by inducing different inhibitors for downregulating translational machinery. Many literatures have reported that MAPK itself regulates the proteome homeostasis in order to trigger adaptive responses under stresses [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This may be the reason behind the higher expression level of 
 <italic>MAPK-1</italic> with lower protein activity and it varies with the genotypes and other environmental cues.

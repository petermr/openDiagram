 </sup> to replicate the observed molecular differences between high-grade and low-grade cartilage (within the power constraints of the smaller replication set). Of the differentially expressed genes and proteins, 65.9 and 68.3% showed a concordant direction of effect in the replication data, respectively (both Fisher’s

This concordance increased to 77.9% for genes with cross-omics concordant differential expression in this study, indicating additional robustness afforded by cross-omics data integration. We found significantly higher concordance where replication power was highest (88.5% for genes with cross-omics higher expression in high-grade cartilage, compared to 66.7% for genes with cross-omics lower expression in high-grade cartilage, Fisher’s

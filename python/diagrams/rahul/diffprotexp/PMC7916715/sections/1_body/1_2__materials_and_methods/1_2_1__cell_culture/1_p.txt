0: LNCaP cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI1640 with supplementation of 10% FBS (Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Burlington, ON, Canada).
1: The cell line was authenticated (Cell Line Authentication Service, ATCC), and routinely checked for Mycoplasma contamination (a PCR kit from Abm, Cat#: G238).
2: LNCaP empty vector (EV) and CNTN1 stable lines were constructed using retrovirus following our established conditions [ 34, 36, 37, 38].
3: Briefly, a gag-pol, an envelope (VSV-G; Stratagene), and a designed retroviral vector (EV or CNTN1) were transiently co-transfected into HEK293T cells at the ratio 1:1:1.
4: At 48 h post transfection, the virus-containing medium was filtered (0.45 m filter) and centrifuged (50,000  g) for 90 min to concentrate the viral vectors.
5: The retrovirus pellets were resuspended into RPMI1640 medium and LNCaP cells were subsequently infected and selected for stable integration with puromycin (1 g/mL; Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada).

<p id="Par32">For comparative purposes, gene expression values for a large cohort, consisting of COVID-19 and control patients (GSE157103) were visualised using ggplot2. Patients were stratified into non-COVID-19 (n = 26), non-ICU care COVID-19 patients (n = 50) and ICU-level care COVID-19 patients (n = 50). Subsequent Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed, and expression was compared between different groups. COVID-19 patients (n = 100) were also stratified into groups based on whether patients had been put on a mechanical ventilator (patients who had not been on mechanical ventilation (n = 58) and patients who had been on mechanical ventilation (n = 42)). Next, a differential expression analysis was performed on the peripheral mononuclear blood cell data from GSE103412. The data was a subset for specific genes of interest detailed in Xiong et al.

 </sup> where there were 13,745 out of 39,189 genes that overlapped in the gene expression matrix. The makeContrasts limma function was used to determine contrasts between treatment groups. A linear model was then fit to the data, and the contrasts.fit function was applied to identify genes with significant differential expression between samples prior to radiation treatment,

The number of differentially expressed genes was extracted via the topTable function and an adjusted p value threshold &lt; 0.05 was set, from which there were 243 significantly differentially expressed genes. Fold change cut-offs of 1.5 and -1.5 were implemented to determine up- and downregulated genes. In total, there were 65 significantly downregulated genes and 3 significantly upregulated genes that fit the criteria.

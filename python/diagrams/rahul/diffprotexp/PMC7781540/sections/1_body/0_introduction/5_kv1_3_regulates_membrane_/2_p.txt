0: While K V1.3 thus certainly contributes to regulating resting membrane potential in microglia ( Figure 2), we believe, its more important role, and the reason for why Kv1.3 expression increases in activated microglia, is the channels ability to offset extreme and prolonged membrane depolarization that potentially can negatively impact microglial health and physiology as revealed by current injection experiments.
1: While current injections of 25 pA are not able to depolarize K V1.3 expressing microglia beyond 30 mV in the absence of blockers, microglia pretreated with K V1.3 blockers depolarize to potentials of +50 mV in response to the same 25 pA current injections [ 40], suggesting that K V1.3 is able to clamp membrane potential close to the channels activation threshold potential to prevent excessive membrane depolarizations ( Figure 2).
2: The situation in microglial physiology where this capacity is important is when microglia are exposed to extracellular ATP, a danger signal that can reach concentrations in the high micromolar range due to release of cytosolic ATP from damaged neurons or ATP-containing synaptic vesicles [ 41], which activate P2X receptor channels leading to intense depolarizations [ 42].
3: In our own hands, current clamp experiments performed on undifferentiated and LPS stimulated microglia showed that acute exposure to 100 M ATP, which out of the P2X receptors expressed in microglia primarily activates P2X4, lead to more pronounced depolarizations in undifferentiated microglia, despite their more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential than in K V1.3 high LPS-stimulated microglia, which did not depolarize above 40 mV.
4: K V1.3 blockers impaired this ability to resist ATP-induced depolarizations and microglia depolarized in their presence [ 40].

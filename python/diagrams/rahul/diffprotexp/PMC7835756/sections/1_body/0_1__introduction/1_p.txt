0: Plants are regularly exposed to stress factors, and due to their sessile nature, they have developed sophisticated defense responses at a physiological, biochemical, and genetic level.
1: It is well known that the environment and the genotype give the phenotype of an organism.
2: This is partly due to the epigenetic phenomena, where modifications in DNA, RNA, and histones can alter the genetic expression patterns of genes.
3: The environment determines these modifications; they are labile but can be stable and heritable [ 1, 2].
4: Therefore, the epigenetic modifications are part of the genetic plasticity of organisms [ 3] and in plants are also essential in acclimatization (stable during the same generation) and adaptation processes (conservable to subsequent generations) [ 4].

<p id="p0055">Whole tissue total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.1 mL of whole tissue homogenate was mixed with 0.9 mL of physiological saline (0.9% NaCl), and then 0.1 mL of 15mM pyrogallic acid was added. The activity was measured at 420 nm for 3 min using a multidetection microplate reader (Infinite 200; Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) and expressed as U/mg protein. One unit was determined as the amount of enzyme that inhibited the oxidation of pyrogallic acid by 50%. Experiments for MDA content and SOD activity were performed in triplicate in this study.</p>

<p>RNA isolation was performed as above; the same RNA was used to generate SMRTbell libraries and prepare mRNAs for short-read sequencing. For SMRT sequencing, Iso-Seq™ SMRTbell libraries containing circular templates were generated using an NEBNext Single Cell RT Enzyme Mix and recommendations by the manufacturers for long-read transcripts using the Iso-Seq™ Express Template (PN: 101-901-700) and indicated quality control (QC) steps. Sequencing was performed using the Pac Bio Sequel II system with SMRT Cell 8M.</p>

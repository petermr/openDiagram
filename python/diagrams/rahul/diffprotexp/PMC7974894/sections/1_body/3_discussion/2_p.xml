<p>The aforementioned hub RBPs were selected by univariate cox regression analysis, survival analyses, and multiple cox regression analysis. A total of six hub RBPs were identified as prhRBPs, including LEPR, PFKM, PGK1, CYP19A1, SLC20A1, and ZC3H12D. Previous studies have reported that the expression of LEPR 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, PFKM

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, PGK1

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, SLC20A1 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, and ZC3H12D 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> were associated with tumorigenesis and progression in various tumor types, which support the further identification and exploring in tongue cancer. Next, we produced a risk model based on these hub RBPs, trained using TCGA cohort and validated by GEO retrieved tongue cancer patients. The ROC analysis revealed that these hub RBP genes signature with the better diagnostic capability to select out the tongue cancer patients with poor prognosis. Subsequently, a nomogram was built to predict 1, 3, and 5 years OS more intuitively. We also used the Kaplan Meier-plotter to detect the prognostic value of the hub RBPs genes, the results were basically consistent with the prognostic analysis results of TCGA cohort. These results suggested that the prognostic model of these hub RBPs genes have a certain value in adjusting treatment plans of tongue cancer patients.

<p id="Par33">To determine whether DEGs were direct targets of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>, we next annotated gene promoters using available FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> ChIP-seq from the recent studies by Weis-Banke et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] (ChIP1) in TGFβ-treated HGrC1, and by Carles et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which included inducible expression of FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> in human SVOG3e cell line (ChIP2). A large fraction (44–40%) of DEGs between FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> had a FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> binding site near their promoters (313 out of 717 using the HGrC1 ChIP-seq and 291 using the SVOG3e ChIP-Seq), which was a significantly higher proportion than in non-DEGs (Fisher’s exact test, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a overall p = 9.8 × 10
 <sup>–51</sup>; upregulated p = 3.7 × 10
 <sup>–37</sup>; and downregulated p = 5.2 × 10
 <sup>–15</sup>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b overall p = 9.9 × 10
 <sup>–39</sup>; upregulated p = 6.4 × 10
 <sup>–26</sup>; and downregulated p = 3.8 × 10
 <sup>–14</sup>). The presence of these binding sites suggests that the changes in gene expression in our system are due in large extent to differences in FOXL2 binding.

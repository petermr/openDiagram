<p>In summary, using a quantitative discovery-based proteomic approach, this study identified commonalities as well as significant differences in BALF protein expression profiles following LPS-induced direct and indirect lung injury. Most notably, LPS-induced systemic inflammation results in suppression of select components of lung innate immunity. It remains to be determined whether the same pathways were suppressed in human sepsis patients, to what extent such changes predispose sepsis patients to subsequent infections, and whether boosting lung innate immunity would be beneficial in the management and care of sepsis patients.</p>

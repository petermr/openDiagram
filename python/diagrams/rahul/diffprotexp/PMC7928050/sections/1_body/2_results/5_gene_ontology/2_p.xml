<p>Remarkably, when comparing DEGs and gene ontology changes between 7 and 15Â days after transplantation, analysis showed most changes in genes and gene pathways linked to cell differentiation and developmental processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref> A and B). As these pathways only showed up when comparing day 7 to day 15, we assume, that it is a phenomenon that is initiated only after several days of transplantation, unlike the upregulation of immune response associated pathways which started right after transplantation. These different patterns of pathway regulation reflect the dynamic answer of the transplanted tissue according to the time after transplantation.

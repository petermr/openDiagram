<p>Doseâ€“response curves for kinase inhibitor staurosporine and phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>) were similar and overlapping in MtzR and MtzS lines, with only minor shifts in IC
 <sub>50</sub> between lines. Staurosporine and calyculin A have significant efficacy against 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> for both compounds &gt;50 nm (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>), and have also been shown previously to block entry into and prevent exit from mitosis, respectively. Although their enzyme specificity and targets are not known [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], there is nonetheless a need for more targeted inhibitors to functionally probe specific phosphorylation pathways or enzymes between Mtz-resistant and -susceptible lines [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, more work is required to annotate core kinases in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> into subfamily classifications, define their homology, and, more broadly, screen chemical inhibitors of phosphorylation.

  <p>B16F1 cells induced to differential pigmentation and decreased proliferation, show changes in miRNA expression and, together with their molecular targets, make up potential gene interaction networks. (
   <bold>a</bold>) A heat map with the relative expression levels of 55 differentially expressed miRNAs, obtained by Small RNA-seq from B16F1 cells exposed to 5 mM L-Tyr or 2.5 μg.mL
   <sup>−1</sup> 5-Brd-2′-dU concerning non-exposed B16F1 control cells; red, expression up, blue, expression down, and white indicator of no variation. Differential expression by using the DESeq2 program. (
   <bold>b</bold>–
   <bold>d</bold>) Analysis of functional enrichment by KEGG signaling pathways of the potential interactions between differentially expressed miRNAs and their molecular targets in a network model, for exposure of melanoma cells to L-Tyr (
   <bold>b</bold>), 5-Brd-2′-dU (
   <bold>c</bold>), and 5-Brd-2′-dU with relative to L-Tyr (
   <bold>d</bold>). The related KEGG signaling pathways were considered statistically significant for a 
   <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 after applying a hypergeometric test.

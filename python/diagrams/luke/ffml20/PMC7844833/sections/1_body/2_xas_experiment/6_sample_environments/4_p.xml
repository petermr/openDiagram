<p>Many different experimental cell designs have been proposed that are optimized for different applications and address the inevitable trade-off from different perspectives. Designs of several 
 <italic>in situ</italic> cells for electrochemical measurements have been reviewed by Russell and Rose.

 </sup> Two proposed cell designs exemplifying alternative approaches are shown in

 </xref>. Both cells are single compartment cells with a typical three electrode setup: reference electrode, counter electrode, and the sample as a working electrode.

 </xref>a shows a large volume cell for XAS measurements in fluorescence mode, where the sample is mounted on the front panel of the cell facing the electrolyte, so that the working electrode simultaneously acts as an X-ray window. Incident X-rays and X-ray fluorescence thus pass through the back of the sample.

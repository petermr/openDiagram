  <p>a) sTREM1 concentrations in lung homogenates from WT mice during 
   <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection at different times (D2, 2 days; D3, 3 days; D5, 5 days). Values are represented as bar plots with mean ± SEM. p-values were calculated using the Mann–Whitney U test. ****, p &lt; 0.0001; **, p &lt; 0.01. b) Comparison of survival rate of WT mice (
   <italic>Trem</italic>1
   <sup>+/+</sup>; black lines with triangles) and TREM1-deficient mice (
   <italic>Trem</italic>1
   <sup>−/−</sup>; black lines with squares) to IPA. Intact mice (black lines with circle). Data represent the cumulative data of two separate experiments. The p-value of Kaplan–Meier curves comparison of immunosuppressed mice was determined with the use of the log-rank test. ***, p &lt; 0.001

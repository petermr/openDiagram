0: AbstractWe present an atomistic simulation scheme for the determination of the hydration number (  h) of aqueous electrolyte solutions based on the calculation of the water dipole reorientation dynamics.
1: In this methodology, the time evolution of an aqueous electrolyte solution generated from   ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is used to compute the reorientation time of different water subpopulations.
2: The value of   h is determined by considering whether the reorientation time of the water subpopulations is retarded with respect to bulklike behavior.
3: The application of this computational protocol to magnesium chloride (MgCl  2) solutions at different concentrations (0.62.8 mol kg  1) gives   h values in excellent agreement with experimental hydration numbers obtained using GHztoTHz dielectric relaxation spectroscopy.
4: This methodology is attractive because it is based on a welldefined criterion for the definition of hydration number and provides a link with the molecularlevel processes responsible for affecting bulk solution behavior.
5: Analysis of the   ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories using radial distribution functions, hydrogen bonding statistics, vibrational density of states, waterwater hydrogen bonding lifetimes, and water dipole reorientation reveals that MgCl  2 has a considerable influence on the hydrogen bond network compared with bulk water.
6: These effects have been assigned to the specific strong Mgwater interaction rather than the Clwater interaction.

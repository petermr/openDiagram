<p>We identified a set of orthologous UTRs using the orthologous exon file described in the differential expression analysis section of the 'Materials and methods'. We merged all regions annotated as 3' UTR by gene. If a gene had multiple non-continuous annotations, we selected the most 3' region as the orthologous UTR. We used deepTools compute matrix and plotHeatmap functions to plot merged human and chimpanzee reads along the orthologous 3' UTR set (

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Lauraceae species used in this study formed a defined group in the phylogenetic analysis, and the results of the phylogenetic tree were robust and supported by bootstrap value (=100). Species of Calycanthaceae were used as outgroup; this corroborates with the taxonomic classification and supports the topology of the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01081-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

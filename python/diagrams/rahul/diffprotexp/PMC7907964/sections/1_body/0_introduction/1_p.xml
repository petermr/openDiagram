<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of movement in the aged populations worldwide. PD is characterized pathologically by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which results in a reduction of dopamine, a vital neurotransmitter affecting movement and balance. Whilst the exact cause of PD is generally unknown, the development and progression of the disease is considered to be associated with environmental and genetic factors (

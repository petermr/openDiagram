<p>In the roots, on all three sites, the chemical profile is primarily aristolone. We also find a certain selectivity of the plant in the production of two major compounds. In February and December, for all three sites, the content of aristolone is at the maximum, whereas that of limonene is low. In general, it seems that the production of aristolone comes at the expense of limonene. (FigureÂ

<p id="Par30">To better understand the relationship between lncRNA and mRNA, we constructed network of co-expression of DE lncRNAs and DE target mRNAs, after screening the overlaps between target mRNAs and DE mRNAs in each comparison group, which indicated regulation of lncRNA and mRNA in reproduction (|Pearson correlation| &gt;0.95). Between MM_FP and MM_LP, a total of 5 DE lncRNAs and 9 DE mRNAs were involved in the network, and it consists of 9 edges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, Supplementary material 
 <xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">9</xref>A). Between MM_FP and ww_FP, a total of 10 DE lncRNAs and 14 DE mRNAs were involved in the network, and it consists of 18 edges (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c, Supplementary material

0: Cloned full-length sequence of LINC00466, LINC00466 overexpression plasmid and pcDNA3.1 vector were accessed from Genechem Co., LTD. After achieving 70% confluence in a well, treated cells were used for subsequent analysis.
1: After the lentiviral transduction, cell lines were treated with 1 mg/mL purinomycin to obtain stably transfected cell lines.
2: miR-137 mimic (miR-137), sh-miR-137, si-PPP1R14B and their corresponding controls (NC) were purchased form Ribo Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, china).
3: Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000015, Invitrogen, USA) was used to transfected cells following the standard process.

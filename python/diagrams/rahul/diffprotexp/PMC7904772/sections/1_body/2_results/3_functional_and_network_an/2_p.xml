<p id="Par19">To deeply understand the significant biological functions and pathways associated with behavioral phenotypes, these differential proteins from the three groups were investigated using the OmicsBean tool. The 57 differentially expressed proteins in the depression-susceptible group were analyzed based on the GO and KEGG pathway databases. In total 439, 66, 88, and 49 terms in the BP, CC, MF, and KEGG pathway categories were significantly enriched (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The ten leading enriched GO terms are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>. BP category analysis demonstrated that many proteins were related to the nervous system and brain development, and erythrocyte and myeloid/glial cell proliferation. Most proteins in the CC category were observed to belong to mitochondrial and organelle parts. MF category analysis indicated that a majority of proteins were involved in protein, DNA and RNA binding, and enzyme activity. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed the dysregulated proteins mainly participated in various signaling, secretion, and synapse pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).

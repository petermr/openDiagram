0: Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECX400 (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer.
1: Proton chemical shift values are reported in parts per million (ppm,   scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane, which was used as a reference (  0).
2: X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra were recorded on a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer at 40 kV and 15 mA using a Cu target tube.
3: Samples were measured without grinding and data were collected at 2  = 330 using Cu-K  radiation.
4: Indexing of the XRPD patterns was performed using the Rigaku PDXL XRD analysis software.
5: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JCM-600Plus NeoScope microscope.
6: Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (IRAffinity-1S, Shimadzu).
7: Elemental analysis was performed at A-Rabbit-Science Japan Co., Ltd. (an ultra-trace element analysis research center).
8: Water and N 2 sorption isotherms for  PCT-1 were acquired using a MicrotracBEL BELSORP-max volumetric gas adsorption instrument at 298 and 77 K, respectively.
9: The guest-free phases of  PCT-1 were obtained by treatment under reduced pressure at 120 C for 12 h. Ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600) at   = 3001200 nm with BaSO 4 as a standard.
10: Further details regarding the computational methods and electrochemical measurements are given in the ESI.

<p>This study highlights roles of 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic> and 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic> in regulating adipogenesis through interactions of large numbers of genes. Their expression was regulated in this study in a time-dependent manner. Nonetheless, characterizing relationship among interaction of identified genes with CEBP factors (or other pioneering factors) will be essential in future work. This study has demonstrated the strength in ranking method into stressing the most influential factors driving adipogenesis in MEFs via transcriptome data. Systematic global gene expression changes during adipogenesis allow us to better understand this process for future therapeutic targeting. In addition to studying known model for adipogenesis, such as 3T3-L1 and mesenchymal stem cells, this study illustrates the use of MEFs to better understand adipogenesis from transcriptome data by identifying new key proteins that can potentially regulate adipogenesis. As such, this study has systematically noted the main factor that drive differentiation was due to reduction in proliferation activity given the downregulation of cell cycle regulated genes and its associates. Indeed, further analysis from this study data will be needed to decipher MEFs adipogenic potential.

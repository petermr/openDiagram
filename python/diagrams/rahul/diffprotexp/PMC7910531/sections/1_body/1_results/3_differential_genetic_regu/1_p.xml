<p id="Par8">We identified differential regulation of gene expression between high-grade and low-grade cartilage, with 172 variants showing strong evidence for an eQTL effect in one tissue grade (posterior probability &gt;0.9), but not in the other (posterior probability &lt;0.1), termed ‘differential eQTLs' (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>, and Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We detected 32 genes with differential eQTLs (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These genes function in the regulation of gene expression (high-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>HOXB2, IFITM3, EIF2B3TRAF2, HLCS, APBA1, HLX</italic>; low-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>EARS2, TCEB1, USP16</italic>), nervous system development (high-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>HOXB2, CRLF1, EIF2B3, APBA1, HLX, NEGR1, ARGHAP11B</italic>; low-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>SZT2, NRN1</italic>), response to stress (high-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>IFITM3, EIF2B3, TRAF2, ICAM3</italic>; low-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>PNKP, SZT2, REV1, USP16</italic>), immune response (high-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>IFITM3, IL4I1, CRLF1, TRAF2, ICAM3, HLX</italic>), cell adhesion (high-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>TRAF2, ICAM3, APBA1, HLX, NEGR1</italic>) and catabolic processes (high-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>IL4I1, TRAF2, WDR91, HAAO</italic>; low-grade eQTL: 
 <italic>USP16</italic>). For most of these processes, some genes with differential eQTLs show gain of genetic regulatory associations in high-grade cartilage, while others show loss of such associations compared to low-grade cartilage, suggesting a broader rewiring of regulatory processes (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Sixteen genes have differential eQTLs located in a regulatory region.

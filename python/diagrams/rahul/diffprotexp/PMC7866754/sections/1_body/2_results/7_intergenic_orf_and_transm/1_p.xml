<p id="Par52">Surprisingly, an intergenic nORF was also differentially expressed after the quality filtering. It is a short ORF with only 30 amino acids and unique to salivary gland sporozoites, identified by 10 raw PSMs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). InterProScan could not detect any functional domain possibly due to its short length and, therefore, its structure was modelled using an ab initio structure prediction tool QUARK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], which can yield high-resolution structures for small proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The predicted structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) is highly ordered with two short helices connected by a loop, suggesting that the intergenic ORF could form protein-like products too.

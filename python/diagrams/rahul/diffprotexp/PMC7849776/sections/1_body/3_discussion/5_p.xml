<p>In our study, we have shown for the first time that YjbH is required for full virulence of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and regulates virulence genes and surface proteins, and is necessary for oxidative stress tolerance inside the host. Moreover, the disruption of the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> and the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> genes led to reduced protease activity and reduced surface protein. Interestingly, most of the proteases are excreted into supernatant from the cell in general [
 <xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52–54</xref>], and surface proteins of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> predominantly consist of proteins related to adhesion and evasion such as clumping factor, fibronectin, and collagen-binding proteins, staphylococcal protein A [
 <xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55–58</xref>]. In this regard, further proteomic analysis of the whole proteome, surfacome, and secretome of the mutants is required to provide an in-depth understanding of the role of YjbH in Staphylococcal virulence. Nonetheless, the findings of this study indicate that unlike other virulence factors such as 
 <italic>sarA, agr</italic>, and other two-component systems such as 
 <italic>srrAB, saeRS</italic>, and 
 <italic>ArlRS</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], YjbH affects the expression of a broad range of genes. Further studies regarding the detailed mechanism at the protein level will give an insight into the complex regulatory mechanism of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence pathway and its utilization as a target for anti-virulence drug development.

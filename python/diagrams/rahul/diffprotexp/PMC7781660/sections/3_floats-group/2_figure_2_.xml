  <p>RNA-Seq analysis of mRNA in BVDV-infected MDBK cells. (a) Volcano plot map of mRNA expression in BVDV-infected MDBK cells compared to mock-infected cells. The abscissa indicates the log of the difference multiple of the two samples. The ordinate indicates the negative Log
   <sub>10</sub> value of the FDR of the two samples; the red points (up-expression) and green points (down-regulation) indicate the difference in gene expression (judgment criteria: FDR &lt;0.05, and the difference multiple is more than twice); there is no difference in black dots. (b) GO term classification statistics were performed on the differential genes. The abscissa represents the three ontologies of GO: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process; the ordinate represents the number of genes corresponding to each classification entry. (c) KEGG enrichment analysis between groups. “RichFactor” refers to the ratio of the number of transcripts in the pathway entry in the DE transcripts to the total number of transcripts located in the pathway entry. The larger the RichFactor, the higher the degree of enrichment. Q-value indicates the P-value after multiple hypothesis test corrections, ranging from 0 to 1; the closer to 0, the more significant the enrichment. The figure was plotted using the Q-value from small to large for the top 20 paths

<p>Moreover, with a single exception, metazoan queries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>) did not retrieve any proteins from our trypanosoma query cohort (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>) but instead others that may be important as NEA proteins, namely a beta propeller protein Tb927.8.1980, a Noc2p family protein Tb927.10.12430, CBF/Mak21 family protein Tb11.v5.0274/Tb927.10.6320/Tb927.11.2120/Tb927.4.3670. The exception to this lineage-specificity is Tm7sf2 (E9Q4M8), which appears to be an ortholog of 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> Tb927.11.15530 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003 f0006">Figures 3 and 6</xref>). 
 <italic>Frequency of lineage-specific proteins in fungi and plants</italic>. To expand our coverage, we also examined published analysis of NE proteomes in both yeast and plants. An earlier systematic study focused on forty-five budding yeast proteins selected for NE localization from a high throughput dataset [
 <xref rid="cit0091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In this case ~50% of the cohort were suggested as pan-eukaryotic with a further ~20% broadly distributed. The conserved proteins were in the main involved in core nuclear functions, including chromatin organization, with only 20% predicted as unique to Saccharomycetes. A considerable number of homologs could only be identified through a shared domain, indicating possible domain swapping as noted above for the LBR. This pattern may in part be a reflection of the extensive gene losses in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, such that lineage-specific proteins are depleted. A high incidence of domain sharing amongst NEA proteins from different lineages, but within otherwise highly divergent proteins, is also supported by evidence from the vascular plant 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LINC complex for example is canonical, containing both SUN and KASH-domain proteins. However, the nesprins (see below) of metazoan cells, which also contain KASH domains and associate with the core LINC complex, are replaced by analogs that only retain a KASH domain but no other obvious homology [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Given that the KASH domain is quite short (less than 60 amino acids and in plants frequently even shorter) how this system has evolved is intriguing. SINE proteins are present across a large number of vascular plants and are components of the analogous LINC complex and likely support a link between the plant-specific lamina NMCP/CRWN proteins and the cytoskeleton [
 <xref rid="cit0093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. There is considerable promiscuity here as all SINE proteins interact with SUN1 and SUN2; this may be related to the manner in which this family has expanded, with clear ancestral as well as lineage-restricted members that presumably evolved later. This may be, at least in part, due to tissue-specific expression [
 <xref rid="cit0093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].

<p>Compared with Li metal anode, the interfacial issues at cathode side are more complex and there are exceptional challenges. Unlike the batteries using liquid electrolytes that contain mainly liquid/solid interface with quite smaller resisitance, there are numerous solid/solid interfaces with very large resisitance between cathode particles and solid electrolyte. In addition, these interfaces are unstable during long cycling of all‐solid‐state battery. Therefore, constructing high‐efficient and stable ion‐conducting networks inside the cathode is essential for practical application of all‐solid‐state battery.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">105</xref> Special structure design of SCE and all‐solid‐state batteries such as layer‐by‐layer and integrated structure could tighten the interphase connection and reinforce the ion conduction to obtain an effective conductive network. In addition, the oxidation potential of polymer electrolyte is lower, which is prone to be oxidized and decomposed, especially coupled with high‐voltage cathode materials. Hence, it is quite significant to develop the high‐voltage‐resistant polymer matrix or improve the electrochemical window of polymer electrolyte using ICEs to broaden the SCE application in all‐solid‐state battery in future.

<p>Combining dilatometry and microstructural characterization, continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of test steels with different austenitization temperatures are presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), the normal ferrite, bainite (B), and martensite (M) microstructures were formed respectively with the increase in cooling rate. Ferrite grains forming at low cooling rates were polygonal ferrite (PF), and pearlite (P) then formed between the PF grains. When the austenitization temperature increased to 1050 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), acicular ferrite (AF) appeared together with bainite, while the PF transformation region shrunk. With an austenitization temperature above 1150 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d), the formation of AF occurred at all experimental cooling rates: 0.15–50 °C/s. At low cooling rates, grain boundary ferrite (GBF) formed before AF transformation and pearlite formed between AF laths. At high cooling rates, complex microstructures of AF and B/M were obtained. Full acicular ferrite structure was formed at medium cooling rates around 5 °C/s.

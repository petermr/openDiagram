<p id="Par24">Our results highlight the explanatory power of comparative transcriptomics and provide a powerful foundation upon which to study the effects of stress on mussel physiology. For example, our results can be used in future work to explore more granular changes in metabolic pathways we found to be affected by stress of captivity. Additionally, we can use transcriptomic tools to study how changing specific variables in captivity affects the organismâ€™s stress response. In this way, we can not only learn more about mussel physiology but also improve conditions in research and propagation facilities. Captivity is an important aspect of freshwater mussel conservation and improving our understanding of the effects of stressors on mussel health is crucial if we are to save these endangered animals. Beyond captivity induced changes, transcriptomic tools can be used to study responses to a wide variety of environmental stressors to advance our understanding of freshwater mussel physiology.</p>

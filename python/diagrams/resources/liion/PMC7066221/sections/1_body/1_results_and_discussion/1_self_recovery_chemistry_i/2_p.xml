<p id="p0060">The different capacity variation tendencies of these two cathodes point to a fact that is seldom noticed: The capacity of Zn-ion battery cathodes may not be simply determined, as previously reported, by the capability of suppressing Mn-based cathode dissolution. The intrinsic property of the cathode (e.g., the specific surface area, the valent state of Mn cations, and Mn-site defects) may result in the change of parameters that were not given sufficient attention, i.e., the oxidation of the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion in the electrolyte that can lead to the deposition of active Mn compound on the cathode. Considering the abundant defects in the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode material as synthesized under an unstable, highly oxidizing atmosphere generated by the molten sodium nitrate salt (

 <sub>2</sub> was conducted using a facile method where the oxide was stirred in 1 M CoCl
 <sub>2</sub> at room temperature (see

 <sub>2</sub>, the resulting cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> showed an even more pronounced capacity enhancement (

 <sup>−1</sup> to 258 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after five cycles and further to 435 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at the 100
 <sup>th</sup> discharge. This capacity is surprisingly high when compared with the previously reported values (∼300 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the 100
 <sup>th</sup> discharge) (

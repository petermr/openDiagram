<p id="Par39">It is easy to see that the ONGene, TSGene and MSigDB data sets are significantly enriched at the tops of the lists. Although NCG seems enriched at the top, its ES is relatively low; the ES of CGC is even worse than that of NCG. The best enriched data set is MSigDB. Since this data set was constructed directly from microarray gene expression data from cancer gene perturbations, it is closely related to differential expression values. The ES value explains the different performances of WMFVS and WFVS in different data sets.</p>

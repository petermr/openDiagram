0: % scavenging = 100 - (Abs sample - Abs control)/Abs DPPH  100 %, where the Abs sample is the absorbance of the sample without DPPH.
1: The oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC 50) was calculated from the plot of inhibition percentages against the oil concentrations.
2: The assay was repeated three times.

<p id="p0150">First, the preparation of SCU@CD-MOF crystals was optimized to maximize SCU loading. After in depth characterizations, molecular simulation was employed to investigate the configuration of SCU in CD-MOF and its contribution to the surface free energy of SCU@CD-MOF, related to laryngeal deposition. It seemed that glycoside SCU transformed pulmonary inhalable CD-MOF with a particle size of 1–5 μm anchoring in larynx as assessed by

<p>Western blot analyses showed expression of expected protein products for CK-19 (
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), ANXA3, CMBL and S100A13 in cyst fluids (
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). CK-19 showed a higher expression in cPTCs as compared to benign thyroid cases. Furthermore, S100A13 showed weak expression in 4 (57%) of the cPTC cases, while in the remaining cPTCs and all benign samples no S100A13 expression was detected. ANXA3 and CMBL were both expressed in the cyst fluids of cPTCs and benign samples without obvious differences between the two groups.

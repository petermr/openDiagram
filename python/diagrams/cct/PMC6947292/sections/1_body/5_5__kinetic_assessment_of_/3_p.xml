<p>This basic modelling approach was combined with the knowledge gained on nucleation and growth in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B219-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>] and was applied to model the kinetic development of quench-induced precipitation, initially for pure binary AlSi alloys [
 <xref rid="B117-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]; later, it was extended to AlMgSi and AlZnMg(Cu) alloys [
 <xref rid="B118-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>,
 <xref rid="B119-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The aim of the quench sensitivity model is to predict the volume fractions of the most relevant types of quench-induced precipitates formed during the quench as a function of composition and cooling rate. This enables a kinetic assessment of the large amount of DSC data and verification of the model using these DSC data. For the AlMgSi and AlZnMg(Cu) alloys, the resulting calculated supersaturation was used to predict strengthening after ageing at various cooling rates, via a further extension of the model that describes the formation of hardening precipitates during ageing [

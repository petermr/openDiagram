<p>Protein expression was compared to untreated controls and between metformin treatment and insulin supplementation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248103.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A total of 80 differentially expressed proteins were selected for further analysis based on most prominent changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248103.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These proteins were subjected to STRING analysis for the generation of protein networks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248103.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Clusters of proteins were detected and proteins were assigned to four different biological processes including cell population proliferation, cell adhesion, cell migration and immune response (

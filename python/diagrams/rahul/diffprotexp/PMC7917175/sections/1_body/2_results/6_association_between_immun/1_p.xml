<p id="Par48">CA125 and CA199 are established prognostic and diagnostic makers of PAAD, and higher levels of both are indicative of cancer progression, poor prognosis or cancer relapse. In this study, both ICGC and TCGA cohorts displayed significant differences in CA199 and CA125 expression levels across the immune subtypes. In the ICGC cohort for example, IS1 as well as IS3 and IS4 showed higher CA199 and CA125 expression respectively

Furthermore, the differential expression of CA199 and not CA125 was relatively consistent in both cohorts, indicating that CA125 levels are highly susceptible to biological or environmental factors. Taken together, immune subtype is superior to CA199 and CA125 in predicting PAAD patient prognosis.

<p>MSCs were seeded on a 96-well plate with a cell density of 5000 cells/well. After neuronal induction, the number of viable proliferating cells was determined using the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). The assay was performed by adding 20 μl of the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Reagent directly to culture wells, incubating in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C for 1–4 hours, and then recording absorbance at 490 nm in a 96-well plate reader. The CellTiter 96® AQ
 <sub>ueous</sub> One Solution Reagent contains a tetrazolium compound MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt), which in the presence of phenazine methosulfate can be reduced by living cells to yield a colored formazan product. The quantity of formazan product as measured by absorbance at 490 nm is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture.

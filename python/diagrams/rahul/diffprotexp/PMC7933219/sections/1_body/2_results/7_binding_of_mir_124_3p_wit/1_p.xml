<p>A dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the binding between PRKAA2 3’UTR and miR-124-3p in HEK293T cells. The wild-type 3’-UTR segments or mutated 3’-UTR segments of PRKAA2 and miR-124-3p sequence were cloned into a reporter plasmid downstream from luciferase, and reporter assays were then performed. It was found that after miR-124-3p overexpression, the luciferase activity in the pGL3-PRKAA2 3’UTR-WT-transfected group decreased when compared with the luciferase activity of the pGL3-PRKAA2 3’UTR-MUT group and pGL3-PRKAA2 3’UTR-NC group (

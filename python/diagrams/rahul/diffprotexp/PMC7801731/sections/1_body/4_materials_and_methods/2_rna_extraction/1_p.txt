0: RNA extraction was done with a combination of the method established by Chomczynski (1993) using Tri-reagent (N.93289, Sigma, USA) and the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany).
1: Three extractions were made for each stage (normal, day 1 and day 3) and each extraction consisted of pooled tissue samples from three organisms at the same stage.
2: The concentration and quality of the RNA was determined by using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA).
3: Samples with a concentration greater than 200 ng/L and an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) value of  8 were used for sequencing.

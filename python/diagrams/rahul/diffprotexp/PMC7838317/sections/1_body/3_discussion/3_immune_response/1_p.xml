<p id="Par21">Several transcripts likely coding for immune response proteins were found to be differentially expressed in mussels in captivity. Two down-regulated transcripts with important roles in the bivalve immune system were big defensin 1 and lysozyme. Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses

 </sup>. In addition, we found down-regulation of transcripts coding for the hydrolytic enzyme lysozyme. Lysozyme contributes to pathogen neutralization and plays an important role in bivalve antimicrobial defense

 </sup>. However, we found that not all transcripts with potential immune response functions were down-regulated in captive mussels. For example, some transcript variants coding for interferon-induced protein 44, a protein involved in bivalve anti-viral response

 </sup> were identified in our transcriptome but did not exhibit differential expression. Mussels in captivity might experience less infection or immune stress than those in the wild, and so have lower levels of expression for transcripts that respond to infection. This could also reflect differences between the intensity of immune-provoking agents (bacteria, parasites, chemicals) between the Muskingum and Scioto Rivers, or simply reflect the “snapshot in time” nature of transcriptomes, if the reference transcriptome from a mussel in the wild happened to be fighting infection and thus experiencing relatively high expression of immune response proteins. However, it may also be that chronic stress causes captive mussels to have lower expression of immune proteins because stress or nutritional levels demand that energy be allocated elsewhere. Although up-regulation versus down-regulation varied by transcript, captivity clearly had an effect on the mussel immune system.

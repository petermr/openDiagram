  <caption> Additional file 4. Comparative analysis of sense transcript representation in apomictic and sexual libraries. Volcano comparative plots were constructed both globally and separately for each developmental stage. Red dots correspond to DETs at p-adjust &lt; 0.001 and Log 2FC &gt; ǀ3ǀ. Positive Log 2FCs indicate overexpression in apomictic plants. Negative Log 2FCs indicate overexpression in sexual plants. </caption>

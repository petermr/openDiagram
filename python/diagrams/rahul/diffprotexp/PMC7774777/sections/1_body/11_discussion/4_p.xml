<p>In the current study, our analysis focused on the spinal cord and therefore utilized a model of ALS, where the spinal cord is the major tissue affected. Nevertheless, our findings in the CNS do not rule out a potential contribution of a systemic effect of raloxifene in other organs and tissues, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. The unique ability of raloxifene to induce the expression of genes leading to increased proteostasis is beyond expectation and raises great hope for future investigations, since not only defects in proteostasis are critical to the pathogenesis of this disease, but significant delay in disease progression was observed, despite the fact that the dose achieved in the trial was 10-fold lower than typically achieved in humans. Interestingly, in the course of our study, another group identified raloxifene in a screen for compounds able to reduce tau aggregation in an in vitro cell model (

<p>This work reports a novel approach to predict the sequence of proteins by their physical-chemical properties. Notwithstanding its promising results, it should be regarded as a preliminary study. The method should be validated in more comprehensive studies including other organisms, to strengthen its advantages and minimize its limitations. One of the main limitations of this approach is the need of a high-quality genome annotation, to reduce the likelihood of prediction errors. Another limitation is the restricted resolution of proteins in 2D-gels; even though this technique allows for resolving up to 10 000 proteins, the most abundant proteins in a sample were found to be overrepresented [

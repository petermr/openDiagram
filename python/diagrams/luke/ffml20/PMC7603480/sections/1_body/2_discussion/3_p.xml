<p id="Par40">We also presented a proof-of-principle application of a reactive ML model to the exploration of the methane combustion reaction network. Here, a microkinetic simulation based on ML energetics was carried out, revealing relevant pathways and elementary steps in a large reaction network of 21,000 reactions. In our view, there are two ways to proceed from here. On one hand, the relevant subgraph thus extracted from of a much larger reaction network could be studied in depth with first-principles methods. On the other hand, we can envision an ML-driven computational reactor, where this is done in a more integrated fashion. Important steps (as identified by an ML-driven microkinetic simulation) could be studied with DFT and the results used to retrain the ML model. This would lead to an active-learning-type iterative procedure, where the predicted energetics of the reaction network are continuously improved in a targeted fashion, and no subgraph selection is necessary (within the computational constraints of the microkinetic simulation).</p>

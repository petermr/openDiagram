<p>Finally we verified the expression of 37 genes coding for selected proteins listed in TablesÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Expression of 4 genes, LRP1, MPO, PPIB and TUBA3A was too low and these genes were excluded from further consideration (Additional file

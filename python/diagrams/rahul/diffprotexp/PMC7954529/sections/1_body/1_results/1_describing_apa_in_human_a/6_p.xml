<p>To assess sequence conservation in PAS regions, we downloaded PhyloP scores computed over 100 vertebrate genomes from the UCSC Genome Browser and calculated mean PhyloP scores in PAS regions. Higher mean PhyloP scores correspond to regions of higher sequence conservation and thus slower evolution (

 <sup>−16</sup>). This pattern also holds independently for PAS in all genic locations other than introns (

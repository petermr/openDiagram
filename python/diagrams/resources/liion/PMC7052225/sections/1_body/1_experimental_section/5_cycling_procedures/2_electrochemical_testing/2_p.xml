<p id="Par19">For bare and paper electrodes, the experiment starts from an open circuit potential (OCP) to 4.2 V. It is then followed by a reverse scan of 2.0 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. The same procedure is followed for the LFP electrodes except that the upper cutoff voltage is set to 4 V. For the LTO electrodes, the experiment starts from the OCP to 1.2 V. It is thereafter followed by a reverse scan of 2.5 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. For the PTCDA electrodes, the experiment starts from the OCP to 1.5 V followed by a reverse scan of 3.5 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>.

<p id="Par6">In this study, the ovarian cancer cell line was cultivated with Rosewell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, R8758) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin, followed by incubation at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The lentiviral vectors (LV2-1 and LV2-2) and the lentiviral overexpression vector (LV6, all from GenePharma) were transfected with circRAB11FIP1. MIR-129 mimics and inhibitors were also provided by GenePharma. An ATG5 or ATG7 overexpression plasmid was constructed using a pCMV5 vector. The siRNA sequence targeting circRAB11FIP1 was as follows: LV2-1: 5′-CAUGAUGAAGGUGGUAUAATT-3′; LV2-2: 5′-GAUGAAGGUAUAAGUUTT′; ATG7: 5′-CAGAAGGAGUCACAGCUCUUCCUUA-3′; ATG5: 5′-CAAUCCCAUCCAGAGUUGCUUGUGA-3′; and negative control (NC) siRNA: 5′-UUCUUCGAAGGUGUCACGUTT-3′

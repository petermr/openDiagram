<p id="Par40">Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed to identify enrichment of relevant pathways involving differentially expressed transcripts, which are either up- or downregulated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> or Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The most significantly enriched pathway within the differential expression dataset for adalimumab good-responders was in ‘B and T cell signalling in rheumatoid arthritis’ (

<p>Lung tissue samples from the Control group and Experimental group (48 h post-exposure) were crushed using liquid nitrogen and suspended in lysis buffer (9.5 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, and 0.2% carrier ampholyte) which contained a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The suspension was homogenized, sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined using a Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, VA, USA). Protein aliquots equivalent to 100 mg were stored at −80 °C for future use.</p>

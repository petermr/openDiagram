0: Adipose Tissue (AT) function has advanced from its role as a primary storage of triglyceride in the form fat droplets for energy to the secretion of various signalling factors, known as adipokines that regulates various metabolic pathways.
1: Thus, AT has been characterized as a major endocrine organ [ 1].
2: Adipogenesis, the transformation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, plays a critical role in development of specific functions and differentiation of cellular subtypes [ 24].

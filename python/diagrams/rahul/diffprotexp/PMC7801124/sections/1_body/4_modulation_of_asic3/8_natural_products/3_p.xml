<p>Ligustrazine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9b</xref>), is a Chinese traditional medicine used to promote blood flow (menstruation and headaches) and treat inflammatory conditions (boils and carbuncles), which is extracted from the roots of 
 <italic>Ligusticum striatum</italic>. With regard to modulation of ASIC function, ligustrazine decreases ASIC3-like transient currents, at pH 5–6.5 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 239.5 mΜ, but had a greater potency against ASIC1a/1b/2a (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 60–130 µM) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9c</xref>) is more potent and selectively inhibits ASIC3 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 13.2 µM at pH 5; injection of 100 µmol/L also significantly attenuated acid-induced pain responses in mice [
 <xref rid="cit0216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. Another herbal medicine used for headaches is gastrodin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9d</xref>), a constituent of 
 <italic>Gastrodia elata</italic>, which inhibits the amplitude of ASIC-like currents in DRG neurones (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 21 µM, at pH 5.5) and attenuates acetic acid evoked pain [
 <xref rid="cit0217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. Another Chinese medicine is paeoniflorin (PF), extracted from 
 <italic>Paeoniae alba</italic> and used to treat conditions associated with neuronal damage (i.e. stroke and Parkinson’s disease), which has been shown to reduce the expression of rASIC3 in PC12 cells (a DRG-like cell line) [

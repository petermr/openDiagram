0: The biogeography of  T. oleivorans shows it is widely distributed all over the world.
1: The RDP (Ribosomal Database Project) and GenBank databases contain 16S rRNA gene sequences of 54  Thalassolituus-like bacteria from microbial communities inhabiting both marine (Baltic, Barents, Mediterranean, North, Okhotsk and South China seas, and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Polar Oceans) and terrestrial environments (caves and ground waters) ( Yakimov et al., 2007,  2010;  Mou et al., 2008).
2: Previous reports have shown that  Thalassolituus-related species were among the most dominant members of hydrocarbon/petroleum enriched consortia and can outcompete other OHCB such as  Alcanivorax, which is often the most dominant alkane degrader in marine oil spills ( Harayama et al., 2004;  Kostka et al., 2011).
3: For example,  Thalassolituus outcompeted  Alcanivorax in  n-C 14 enriched microcosms even though tetradecane was shown to be the preferred substrate of  Alcanivorax ( Yakimov et al., 2005).
4: T. oleivorans became abundant in crude oil-amended North Sea microcosms at both 4C and 20C and was in fact the most dominant bacterium at 20C, with total extractable hydrocarbons 15% their original value, confirming the important role this species plays in crude oil degradation in seawater ( Coulon et al., 2007).
5: T. oleivorans has also been shown to be the most dominant alkane degrader in both single and mixed alkane seawater microcosms over a range of different length  n-alkanes from  n-C 12 up to  n-C 32 ( McKew et al., 2007b).
6: Also, in contrast to previous studies,  Thalassolituus, rather than  Alcanivorax, was shown to be dominant in crude oil-amended microcosms, suggesting that they are less affected by potentially stressful compounds within crude oil ( Hara et al., 2003;  Brakstad and Ldeng, 2005;  Yakimov et al., 2005).
7: T. oleivorans was also one of the dominant species within bacterial communities in deep water samples taken near the oil plume from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico ( Camilli et al., 2010;  Hazen et al., 2010).
8: Thalassolituus spp.
9: also dominated the microbial communities present in water samples collected from oil production wells in Canada ( Kryachko et al., 2012).

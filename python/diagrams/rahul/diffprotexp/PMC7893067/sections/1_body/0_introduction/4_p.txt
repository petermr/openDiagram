0: Due to the importance of expanding the catalog of RNA subcellular localization, Zhang et al., established a database (RNALocate), from previously published data, that documents the subcellular localization of different RNA types in several species 3.
1: However, most of the current knowledge about RNA localization is based on cell lines and in most cases restricted to targeted experiments rather than analysis of the complete RNA co-expression profiles.
2: Global profiling of the differences between nuclear and cytosolic fractions is crucial for accurately interpreting data from single-cell transcriptome studies.
3: Single-cell analysis from frozen tissue mainly involves sequencing RNA from sorted nuclei 27.
4: Therefore, understanding the main differences between the nuclear and cytosolic transcriptome in human tissues is important for meaningful interpretation of results from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments.

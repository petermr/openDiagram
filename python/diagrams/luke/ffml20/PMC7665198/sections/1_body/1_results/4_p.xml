<p id="Par7">Although ATR-FTIR analysis indicates that the type of water associations in close proximity of polymer chains plays a significant role in self-healing, to further elucidate molecular origins of enhanced self-healing in water, we utilized MD simulations (MD) in the presence and absence of water, which were employed under isothermal (NVT) and isoenergetic equilibration (NVE) conditions. We varied H
 <sub>2</sub>O to MMA/nBA-repeating unit ratios (R
 <sub>w</sub> = H
 <sub>2</sub>O:MMA/nBA) from 1:4, 1:2, 3:4, 1:1, 3:2, to 2:1, which correspond to 105, 210, 315, 420, 630, and 840 water molecules per 420 copolymer MMA/nBA units. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes MD results and shows that the total cohesive energy (CE
 <sub>total</sub>) and cohesive energy due to H-bonding (CE
 <sub>H</sub>) increases as the number of H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules increases; cohesive energy due to vdW (CE
 <sub>vdW</sub>) forces reaches maximum when

 <sub>w</sub> = 1:1. The same behavior is observed for the radius of gyration (

 <sub>g</sub>) and end-to-end distances (

 <sub>eq</sub>). This behavior is not observed for non-self-healable p(MMA/nBA) copolymers with 60/40 and 40/60 MMA/nBA molar ratios (Supplementary Tables

<p id="Par16">The results of quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed STAR, CYP11A1 and FSHR were significantly up-regulated in 3-month-old ovaries (H3), while MSTRG.283534.2 was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). In the 8-month-old ovaries (H8), FST, INHB, INHA and MSTRG.123289.5 were significantly down-regulated, while STAR and MSTRG.77987.3 were significantly up-regulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). These results are in consonance with our RNA-seq results. These genes had high expression either as up- or down-regulated in RNA-seq results; hence, providing a clue for their potential functional validation in our subsequent experiments.

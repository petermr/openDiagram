<p>According to the LC-MS analysis (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S1</xref>, serum; Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S2</xref>, urine), the relative molecular mass distribution of proteins was mainly concentrated below 200 kDa in the serum and urine samples, because the experiment used the classic bottom-up technique (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). Proteins with molecular weights of up to 540 kDa were identified. Peptide sequence lengths ranged from 10 to 13 peaks; polypeptide lengths were concentrated in the 6–25 range, and 90% of peptide lengths were within 24 kDa, as expected (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>). The theoretical distribution was fitted to a sixth degree polynomial, and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> was greater than 0.95. On the polypeptide 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> distribution map, the abscissa is 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic>, and the ordinate is the number of polypeptides. Most of the polypeptides had an 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> of 400–1,200, and as 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> gradually increased, the number of identified polypeptides gradually decreased, as expected (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(f)</xref>). In the final correlation analysis, the normalized protein abundance values were used to analyze the correlation between the samples. Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(g)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(h)</xref> are the correlation map and correlation coefficient matrix analysis of serum and urine samples. Correlation between the samples was very high, and the correlation coefficient was close to 1.

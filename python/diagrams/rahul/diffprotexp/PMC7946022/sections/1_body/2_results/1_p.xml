 </bold>. C Single- and mixed-species biofilms were grown in 96-well plates using 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5314 reference strains for 24 hrs and then treated with vancomycin (800 µg/ml) for 24 hrs at 37°C. Following incubation, wells were sonicated to disrupt biofilms, and cell suspensions were diluted and plated on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>-specific and 
 <italic>Candida</italic>-specific chromogenic medium (CHROMagar; DRG International, Inc.) for CFU (colony forming units) enumeration. Consistent with previous observations, significant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> killing was seen in the vancomycin-treated single-species biofilms (****, p &lt; 0.0001), which was significantly lower in mixed biofilms with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (**; p &lt; 0.05) (

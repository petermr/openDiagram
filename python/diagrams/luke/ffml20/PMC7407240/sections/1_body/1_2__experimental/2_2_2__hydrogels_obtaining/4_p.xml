<p>The antibiotic-loaded hydrogels were prepared through applying the same freeze–thaw procedure as for the neat hydrogels, adding a specified amount of drug (

 <xref rid="polymers-12-01544-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> was kept at 250 mg/g of dry polymer(s). Since the carrageenan gel alone did not show satisfactory stability to water action, an antibiotic-loaded gel was not prepared for this type of material. The antibiotic-loaded hydrogels coding is preserved from the neat samples, with adding “-T”, “-A”, and “-G” as a suffix, for tetracycline hydrochloride, amoxicillin, respectively, gentamicin sulfate.

<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) consisting of 705 scaffolds with a mean scaffold size of 5.6&#160;Kb. The un-gapped assembled super-contig was 3.47&#160;Mb representing 64.3% of the &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; region (5.39&#160;Mb). We then undertook gene annotation of the &#8216;W9784&#8217; super-contig (see Supplementary Text 1), resulting in the identification of 379 gene models (Supplementary Table 6). After excluding gene models annotated as transposable elements, 23 potential candidate genes were identified in the remaining 347 models, including four within the GWAS interval encompassing hits 1&#8211;8, 10 and 12 (from SNPs Kukri_c148_1512 to Kukri_c63748_1453; &#8216;W9784&#8217; gene models jg131, jg166 and jg172) (Supplementary Table 6). Three of these candidates were annotated as LRR receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinases. Gene jg131 is collinear with &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; gene model TraesCS2B01G047800, while jg166 is absent in the collinear region of &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;, and jg172 appears to be present (99% average CDS nucleotide identity), but not annotated as a gene in &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;. In addition, a WRKY transcription factor (jg224), collinear with &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; gene TraesCS2B01G050500 annotated as a TIR-NBS-LRR domain disease resistance protein, was identified. Of these, jg166, jg172 and jg224 were located within the interval defined by the peak of the MAGIC QTL (from SNPs Kukri_c148_1512 to Kukri_c63748_1453). Using a cut-off of 80% CDS sequence similarity, 51 genes in the &#8216;W9784&#8217; assembly were found to be absent from the

<p>In order to investigate the role of phosphorylation in MtzR, blots were performed to assess changes between isogenic lines in total tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) or the 14–3-3 substrate network. Although there were limited common fluctuations in pY modifications between lines, there were changes in the phosphorylated 14–3-3 substrate network. Changes in 14–3-3 sites included an increase and mass shift between MtzS and MtzR in a protein band at approximately 90kDa, as well an increase in a protein band at approximately 25kDA. These were accompanied by increases in 5 protein bands common between 106- and 713-MtzR lines. Of the 314 known 14–3-3 interacting substrates [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], 139 proteins were detected in all 3 isolates, and 52 proteins were detected in 1 or 2 of the isolates, constituting 60.8% of known substrates. However, only 57 of these substrates (18.2%) were detected among DEPs, indicating the majority of potential 14–3-3 substrates did not have significant changes in abundance. Western blots targeting ubiquitin also detected that 2 large protein bands at approximately 75 and approximately 55kDa increased in all 3 MtzR lines, as well increases in free ubiquitin (approximately 10kDa) in resistant lines.

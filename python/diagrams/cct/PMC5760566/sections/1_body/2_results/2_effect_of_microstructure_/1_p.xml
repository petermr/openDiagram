 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the tensile properties of the SA508Gr.4 N steel in the quenched and tempered (QT) state and the after step-cooling heat treatment (QT-S.C) state. Two tests were carried out for each process. For both states, the measured ultimate tensile strength (UTS: ∼760 MPa) and yield strength (YS: ∼630 MPa) of the fast cooling (60 °C/min) sample were slightly higher than those (UTS: ∼740 MPa, YS: ∼600 MPa) of the slow cooling (4.4 °C/min) sample.

<p>Glucocorticoids provide a non-invasive measure of an animal’s HPA activation, which can be associated with stress and negative welfare, but also with exercise and beneficial stressors like social introductions [

The potential for HPA activation to reflect both positive and negative factors could account for why the current study and others have shown no clear impact of enrichment on glucocorticoid concentrations. Another explanation may be that the lack of change in FGM concentrations is indicative of the aardvarks being accustomed to the environment and daily husbandry routine, including enrichment, which was essentially the same before and during the study period. Thus, the aardvarks may have experienced a floor effect in their glucocorticoid concentrations, meaning that it may have been difficult to detect any small decrease in glucocorticoids if baseline levels were already low [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although a floor effect may be one explanation for the results in this study, we have no specific evidence that this is the case. When designing the study, we made a conscious decision not to include a control condition without enrichment because we felt this might negatively affect the aardvarks’ welfare. However, this lack of a control condition may have restricted the range of welfare the aardvarks experienced, as both stated enrichment goals were achieved by the items provided. This restriction may have decreased our ability to detect the impact of the stated enrichment goals on specific indicators or to identify if a floor effect occurred. We acknowledge that this is a limitation of the current study that makes it challenging to assess how the stated goal of enrichment affected the aardvarks’ FGM concentrations.

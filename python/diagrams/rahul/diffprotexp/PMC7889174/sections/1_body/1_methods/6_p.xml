<p>Search results were binned according to inferred timing of evolutionary origin: Either originating in the LECA (Group A), in an amorphean ancestor of Metazoa (Group B), or much later within either Metazoa or Euglenozoa (Group C). Results in Group A included both those with orthologs nearly universally conserved among eukaryotes and those with orthologs not identified in several major taxonomic groups. Data from comparative genomics searches were converted to the Coulson plot format using CPG version 1.6.1 (

<p id="Par44">These eight differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins, especially ECHS1, may be used as new antiviral targets, but the results need to be further verified by a series of methods, such as RNA interference. In IAV proteomic studies by other groups, 60-kDa heat shock protein, 70-kDa heat shock protein and ATP synthase subunits often appear as differentially expressed proteins. Are these differentially expressed proteins commonly regulated by different IAVs? To date, a relatively small amount of proteomic data have been obtained for different IAVs. Thus, a large amount of proteomics data for different IAV infections is needed to analyze the common differentially expressed proteins for different IAV infections and the pathogenic mechanism of IAV.</p>

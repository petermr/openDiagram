<p id="Par45">All experiments were carried out in accordance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines at the University of East Anglia, with full ethical review and approval, compliant to UK Home Office regulations. To obtain 
 <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos, females were primed with 100 units of PMSG and induced with 500 units of human chorionic gonadotrophin. Eggs were collected manually and fertilised in vitro. Embryos were de-jellied in 2% L-cysteine, incubated at 18 °C and microinjected in 3% Ficoll into 1 cell at the 2 cell stage in the animal pole with 5 nl of enhancer reporter plasmid at 400 ng/μl or GFP capped RNA as control. Embryos were left to develop at 23 °C. Embryo stageing is according to Nieuwkoop and Faber normal table of Xenopus development. GFP capped RNA for injections was prepared using the SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit, 5 ng was injected per embryo.

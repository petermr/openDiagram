0: We selected seven miRNAs to confirm their expression by RT-qPCR stem-loop.
1: For this, we used a stable loop-type structure (stem-loop) to provide additional length to the target cDNA, optimize its melting temperature (Tm), and improve the assays specificity ( Table S4.
2: List of primer sets for genes and miRNAs used in RT-qPCR and RT-qPCR-stem loop).
3: The miRNAs RT and qPCR assays were conducted with the mirVanaTM microRNA Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturers recommendations.
4: We started with 65 ng of RNA for RT, and cDNA synthesis run in a thermocycler (BIO-RAD, Hercules, California, USA): 30 min at 16 C, 30 min at 42 C, and 5 min at 85 C. For qPCR, we used 2.5 g of cDNA in the Chromo4TM thermal cycler (BIO-RAD) under the program: 3 min at 95 C and 40 cycles: 15 s at 95 C for denaturation, followed by 1 min at 60 C for ringing and 1 min at 72 C extensions, after 40 cycles a final extension left at 72 C for 10 min.

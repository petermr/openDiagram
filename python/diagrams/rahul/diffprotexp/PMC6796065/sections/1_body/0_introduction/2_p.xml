 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, and no studies have investigated this expression in patients with bipolar disorder. DARPP-32 and CaN are mostly expressed on dopamine receptor-positive neurons in various brain regions, especially in the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens (NAc)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, NAc is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>; it has been especially implicated in generating so-called positive symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, on account of its major role in regulating dopamine release and midbrain dopamine system
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. Nonetheless, the expression of DARPP-32 or CaN in the postmortem NAc of the patients with schizophrenia has not been investigated. Thus, we investigated the expression of DARPP-32 and CaN in NAc and PFC of the patients with schizophrenia.

<p>To examine differences in DNA methylation between the two transgenic line, we compared the cytosines methylated between overproducing (L8) and azygous (L1) plants to define the differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs) as hyper or hypomethylated, according to the methylation proportion of a cytosine between the L1 and L8 samples at the same site. The hypermethylated and hypomethylated cytosines were distributed similarly across the chromosomes of the genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00178-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The major abundance of hypermethylated cytosines was mapped in chromosomes 11 and 16, while the hypomethylated was in chromosomes 9 and 12.

0: A 20 l aliquot of plasma collected for validation was first diluted in 1 mL of PBS.
1: Then, the same volume of diluted plasma from every group was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, 0.22 m) with a transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad).
2: The membranes were first blocked in a 5% BSA/TBS solution for 1 h at room temperature.
3: All antibodies were purchased from Abcam.
4: The primary antibodies were diluted in a 1% BSA/TBS solution to the ratios indicated in the specific instructions from Abcam, and the membranes were then incubated with the antibodies overnight at 4C.
5: The membranes were then incubated with the secondary antibodies, diluted 1:10,000 in a 1% BSA/TBS solution, for 2 h at room temperature.
6: The protein signals were detected and quantified with the AlphaEaseFC system.

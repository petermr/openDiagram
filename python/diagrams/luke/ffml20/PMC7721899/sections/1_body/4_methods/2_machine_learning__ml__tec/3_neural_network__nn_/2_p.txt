1: This optimization problem is usually solved by stochastic gradient descent or backward propagation algorithm.
2: Since the non-convex nature of the neural network, the solution to this optimization problem is not unique.
3: Moreover, the selection of the number of layers and the number of perceptron in each layer affects the result of the regression, and it is subjected to high variance problems when large numbers of neurons and layers are used.
4: As such proper regularization is needed when the neural network is implemented.
5: In this study, while training a neural network model, a rectified linear unit (ReLU) is implemented for performance-enhancement.
6: Here, the data is trained using a feedforward multilayer perceptron where the weights are trained by the back propagation algorithm.
7: Henceforth, the feedforward backpropagation multilayer perceptrons will be referred to as a neural network (NN), which is commonly used in the literature.

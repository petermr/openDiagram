0: Primers were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST, with selection for ideal target specificity, PCR product size (less than 200 bp, and when possible less than 100 bp), primer annealing temperature (60C), and PCR product melting temperature (less than 93C).
1: When possible, primers were designed to either span exon/intron junctions or have an intervening intron greater than 1000 base-pairs.
2: Primers were experimentally validated for mRNA and target specificity and optimized for efficiency (9299%) across 6-logs input template concentration.
3: Primer panel sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 2.
4: Sequencing analysis is described in Supplemental Methods.

0: Based on experimenter observation during the recording session and offline verification by examining a video record of task performance, individual reaches were divided into three categories: (i) Hits when the cat rapidly and smoothly reached to place its forepaw into the target reward tube.
1: (ii) Misses were the same as hits for the reach component of the movement, but the forepaw failed initially to enter the target, hitting the Perspex facade ~ 1 cm to the left or right of the reward tube entrance (ie.
2: opposite to the original prism glasses displacement).
3: A subsequent lateral adjustment was required for the paw to enter the tube to retrieve the reward.
4: (iii) Rejected trials were all reaches that either had a reaction time shorter than 150 ms; a reach duration (time between paw lift-off and target/facade hit) more than 2 standard deviations of the mean computed for each animal; reaches that displayed a corrective adjustment near the end of the movement, prior to contact with the Perspex facade, in order for the forepaw to enter the reward tube; or trials with large electrical noise artefacts in the neural data.
5: Rejected reaches accounted for approximately 20% of all trials and are not considered further.

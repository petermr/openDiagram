0: Epidemiological risk factors for the disease have been well-established and include older age, female sex, obesity, joint morphology and injury, and family history.
1: The heritability of osteoarthritis has been estimated to range between 40 (for knee osteoarthritis) and 60% (for hip osteoarthritis) 7.
2: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~90 robustly-replicating risk loci 8.
3: However, the molecular landscape of osteoarthritis-relevant tissue has not been similarly characterised by large-scale efforts such as the GTEx 9, ENCODE 10 and RoadMap Epigenomics 11 projects.

<p id="Par26">To address the role of circ_0003865 in MEL-induced BMSC osteogenic differentiation, we then overexpressed circ_0003865 in human BMSCs by infection with the LV5-hsa_circ_0003865 lentivirus. Using qRT-PCR, we initially confirmed that the expression of circ_0003865 was significantly elevated by LV5-circ_0003865 compared with that by the LV5-NC group even with MEL treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Then, we demonstrated the elevation of 
 <italic>ALP</italic>, 
 <italic>RUNX2</italic>, and 
 <italic>OPN</italic> gene expression in the LV5-NC + MEL (MEL) group compared with that in the LV5-NC group. All of these genes were significantly repressed by circ_0003865 overexpression during MEL treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). These trends were observed in the protein expression of ALP, RUNX2, and OPN as determined by WB analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Furthermore, CCK-8 assay indicated that circ_0003865 overexpression had no effect on proliferation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). And ALP staining revealed that circ_0003865 overexpression significantly mitigated the increase of in situ ALP gene expression in BMSCs induced by MEL treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). Similarly, we used the Alizarin Red staining method to demonstrate that the MEL-induced promotion of osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs was also substantially repressed by circ_0003865 overexpression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). These assays indicate that the activation of BMSC osteogenic differentiation by MEL is mediated by its inhibition of circ_0003865 expression.

<p id="p0130">We also evaluated the number of metabolic reactions regulated by the increased and decreased DRTFs in the trans-omic networks for liver and skeletal muscle from 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). This analysis showed that increased DRTFs had a greater impact on the networks than decreased DRTFs. It also showed that across carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, liver showed more complex effects of changes in gene expression with many metabolic pathways having both input from increased and decreased DRTFs. In addition, in liver 
 <italic>Esr1</italic> (
 <italic>Estrogen receptor 1</italic>) was significantly associated with fatty acid elongation, 
 <italic>Srebf1</italic> (
 <italic>Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1</italic>) and 
 <italic>Klf4</italic> (
 <italic>Kruppel-like factor 4</italic>) were significantly associated with metabolism of the short fatty acid propanoate, and 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> (
 <italic>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma</italic>) was significantly associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. In skeletal muscle, only 
 <italic>Nfatc2</italic> (
 <italic>Nuclear factor of activated T cells 2</italic>) was significantly associated with any pathway and the association was with propanoate metabolism.

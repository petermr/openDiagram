<p>Because of the large number of possible structures, learning about the 3D atomic arrangement and structural motifs in nonmetallic and non-close-packed materials is an even more challenging problem than the determination of the 3D structure of the metallic NPs with fcc-type structure. Information from EXAFS only usually concerns the radial atomic distribution of atoms (i.e., all information is projected onto one dimension) unless analysis can be extended to account for the contributions of distant coordination shells and bonding-angle sensitive MS effects. Thus, while EXAFS can provide enough information to distinguish different metal phases (e.g., fcc vs bcc structures)

 </sup> and metallic from oxidized materials, a more specific identification of the non-close packed materials structure without additional information is challenging. As one successful example, we can mention the study of nanosized tungstates (CoWO
 <sub>4</sub> and CuWO
 <sub>4</sub>) that are considered promising catalysts for photocatalytic oxidation of water. As shown in

 </xref>a and b, by carrying out RMC-EXAFS optimization of four different candidate structure models, one could conclude that only the models with edge-sharing Coâ€“O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra can fit the available experimental data.

<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013455-g002">Figure 2</xref>, at 72 hours proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production were the most represented category and qualitatively the proportion was almost the same in both larvae castes. However, proteins involved in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, antioxidation, protein folding and transcription/translation showed qualitative differences. Proteins implicated in developmental related processes were present in equal proportions in both queen and worker larvae. Similarly at 120 hours, the proportional representations of different functional classes of the identified proteins showed variations over the two intended larvae castes. The representations of carbohydrate metabolism and energy production proteins in queen larvae remained constant as of the 72 hour developmental stages and drastically dropped in worker larvae (

<p>Most (64.6%) of identified miRNAs were of 21‐nt length, while 20 nt (17.1%) and 22 nt (18.3%) long miRNAs represented a smaller fraction (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b‐d</xref>). About 80% of the miRNAs were found to be originated from intergenic regions and remaining 20% from the genic regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>a). To gain more insights into structural and functional aspects of miRNAs, we determined nucleotide base at their 5’‐end (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We found that majority (55%) of miRNAs harbored uracil at 5’‐end, while ~ 19% miRNAs had adenine at their 5’‐end (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). It has been suggested that miRNAs with 5’‐uracil exhibit higher affinity for AGO1, which is involved in the cleavage of transcripts (Borges &amp; Martienssen, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). However, siRNAs harboring adenine at 5’‐end exhibit greater affinity for AGO4 that result in gene repression via DNA methylation (Borges &amp; Martienssen, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Mi et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The higher fraction (~19%) of miRNAs harboring adenine at the 5’‐end in chickpea as compared to that reported in Arabidopsis (~7–8%; Mi et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) may represent a species‐specific feature, which needs to be investigated further. These results suggest that miRNAs identified in this study might be involved in gene regulation via post‐transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and/or RNA‐directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway(s) during seed development in chickpea.

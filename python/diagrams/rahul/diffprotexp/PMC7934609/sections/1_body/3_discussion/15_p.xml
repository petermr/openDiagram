<p>The iTRAQ method has obvious advantages such as high throughput, strong separation ability, and wide analysis range, which improves the reliability of the data. In our research, using this technology to analyze samples can obtain more target peptides than conventional traditional methods, as 6780 unique peptide segments and 1836 protein sequences were identified from three consecutive developmental stages of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>, and many differentially expressed proteins were screened. Further analysis showed that these differential proteins were enriched into multiple metabolic pathways related to target site recognition, disease occurrence, and immune response. The results may provide a rich resource to underpin the development of urgently needed treatments to control parasite infection.

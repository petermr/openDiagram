<p>To characterize the neuroanatomical specificity of Blue and Turquoise dysregulation transcriptional signatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), we performed a static immunofluorescent labeling comparison of late neurogenesis, cortical lamination and cell specification at E17.5 in an independent MIA cohort. E17.5 represents the end of the peak of neurogenesis during cortical development, before the neuronal-glial transition that occurs around E18.5. At this stage, it is expected that progenitor markers, such as PAX6, SOX9 and more specifically SOX2, will identify a small population of progenitors that are maintained and retain the ability to produce neurons, as well as subpopulations of proliferative cells commencing gliogenesis (

PAX6+, SOX9+ and SOX2+ cell distribution patterns showed that progenitors localized correctly around the cortical ventricular zone in coronal brain sections; all analyzed cell populations were significantly reduced in MIA brains compared to controls (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), with protein levels that either resolved or were too subtle to be distinguishable by birth (p=0.766, two tailed Student’s t-test) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b–c,i</xref>). MIA brains showed a decrease in SOX9+ cells in the ventricular zone (VZ), which is expressed in progenitors (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). We also observed increased SOX9+ cells above the VZ in the neocortex, which can remain expressed in a subset of cells, including oligodendrocyte progenitors and maturing astrocytes (

 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) (SOX9 VZ, p=0.0198; nCtx, p=0.0058, two tailed Student’s t-test). Reduced expression of SOX2, a progenitor marker that is restricted to the VZ, was also observed in MIA brains (SOX2 VZ, p=0.0006 two tailed Student’s t-test) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Overall, these data are consistent with the transcriptomic downregulation signature of proliferating cells in MIA brains.

<p>One caveat is that, despite the general assumption that physical or genetic interactions indicate shared functions or belonging to the same molecular pathway(s), this is not necessarily true, since the information used for edges’ inference is not a direct measure of a functional relationship. Moreover, each network type estimates only part of the overall GRN structure (e.g., transcriptional regulation, protein–protein interactions), losing the information hidden to the specific data type used for its construction, which could be revealed by combining the results obtained with additional data sources.</p>

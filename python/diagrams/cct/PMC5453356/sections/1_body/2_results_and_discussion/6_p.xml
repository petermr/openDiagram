 <xref rid="f10-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> shows the isothermal time-temperature-precipitation diagram (TTP diagram) of the aluminum alloy EN AW-6005A, which is based on 
 <italic>in situ</italic> isothermal DSC measurements. The four different datasets (peak values, 10% ∆
 <italic>H</italic>, 50% ∆
 <italic>H</italic> and 90% ∆
 <italic>H</italic>) are plotted in different colors. The four different curves have very similar shapes. In general, the whole curve shape can be described as the expected “C-curve”. However, in detail, each curve shows three local time-minima at about 440 °C, 370 °C and 300 °C, respectively. Based on the results of this study, a temperature of about 370 °C must be considered to be very critical for precipitation. At 370 °C, 10% of the precipitation reactions have already happened after about 25 s.

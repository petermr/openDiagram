<p>To validate results of detected miRNAs, six known and nine novel miRNAs were randomly selected. Stem-loop primers for cDNA synthesis were designed by miRNA Primer Design Tool [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Stem-loop pulsed reverse transcription of each miRNA was according to Varkonyi-Gasic et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] with few modifications. Briefly, 1–2 μg total RNA was added to 0.5 μl dNTP (10mM), 1 μl stem-loop primer (10μM) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244364.s012">S1 Table</xref>) and desired volume of RNase/DNase-free water to a total of 13.8 μl. The mixture was incubated for 5min at 65°C followed by 3 min ice incubation. Subsequently, 4 μl of 5X first-strand reverse transcriptase (RT) buffer mixed with 2 μl DTT and 0.2 μl SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, USA) (200U/μL) were gently added to yield the final volume of 20 μl. Tubes were loaded to thermal cycler for pulsed reverse transcription with initial incubation at 16°C for 30 min, followed by 60 cycles of 30°C for 30 s, 42°C for 30 s and 50°C for 1 s. Then, the samples were incubated at 85°C for 5 min to inactivate RT enzyme. To prepare PCR reactions, 1 μl of cDNA was added to 0.4 μl of each primer (10 μM), 8.2 μl water, and 10 μl of Platinum™ II Hot-Start Green PCR Master Mix (2X). Loaded samples in thermocycler were initially denatured at 94°C followed by 35–40 cycles of 94°C for 15s, and 60°C for 30sec. PCR products were resolved electrophoretically on ethidium bromide stained-2% agarose gel immersed in 1× TAE and visualized with Biorad Gel Doc XR instrument (Biorad, USA).

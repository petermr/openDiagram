0: Thus, if only the faster rates are considered in the analysis of quench-induced precipitation, the high-temperature reactions may be disregarded [ 121].
1: By inversion of the above argument, it can be seen that all relevant precipitation reactions can be detected only if the full range of physically relevant cooling rates is analysed.

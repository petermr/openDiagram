<p>The starting 10 wt/vol % poly (vinyl alcohol), respectively, 2 wt/vol % ι-carrageenan aqueous solutions were prepared through dispersing the required amount of polymer in distilled water, followed by magnetic stirring of the resultant disperse system at 90 °C for 5 h until homogenization, followed by filtering through a 1 μm stainless steel wire mesh and cooling to room temperature (21 ± 1 °C). The PVA and CAR mixtures were prepared by magnetically stirring the required volume of the two polymer solutions at 90 °C for 30 min. For hydrogels obtaining, 10 mL of PVA, CAR, and PVA:CAR solution mixtures were cast into borosilicate Petri dishes (60 mm diameter) and submitted to five consecutive cycles of freezing and thawing. The freezing temperature was –25 °C, the freezing duration 12 h, while the thawing temperature was 22 °C, with a corresponding thawing duration of 12 h.</p>

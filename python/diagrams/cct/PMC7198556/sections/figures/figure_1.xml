  <p>The phase transformation behaviour of the sample steel. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Displays the time-temperature-austenitisation diagram. Note the shifted transformation temperatures Ac
   <sub>1</sub> and Ac
   <sub>3</sub> at high heating rates, as well as the split of Ac
   <sub>1</sub> into a beginning and an end temperature (Ac
   <sub>1b</sub> and Ac
   <sub>1e</sub>). The heating rate associated with the inductive surface hardening process is marked as K1000 and has a value of 81.67 Ks
   <sup>−1</sup>. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Shows the continuous-cooling-transformation diagram evaluated for an austenitisation temperature of 1000 °C with 10 s hold time. A – Austenite, F – Ferrite, P – Pearlite, B – Bainite, M – Martensite, MS – Martensite start, RA – retained austenite, HV10 – Vickers hardness HV10, 
   <italic>λ</italic> – time in seconds from 800 °C to 500 °C divided by 100, 3; 5; 8; … – percentages of final microstructure.

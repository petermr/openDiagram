<p>During the last years, the use of the wavelet transform for the interpretation of experimental spectra has become increasingly popular, also in the studies of heterogeneous thermal- and electrocatalysts. For example, Grosse et al. used it to separate Cu–Cu, Cu–O and Cu–Cl contributions in Cu K-edge EXAFS for Cu nanocubes, a promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO
 <sub>2</sub> reduction.

 </sup> In studies of nonprecious-metal catalysts for ORR, in turn, it was employed to distinguish between metal–metal and metal–nonmetal contributions in EXAFS spectra and to interpret distant coordination shell contributions,

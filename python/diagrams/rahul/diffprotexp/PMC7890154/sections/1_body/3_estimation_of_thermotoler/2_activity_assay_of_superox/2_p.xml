<p id="par0090">We have used the protocol of Beauchamp and Fridovich [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for the SOD activity assay. The absorbance was taken at 560 nm against the reagent blank (phosphate buffer) and was further used for the calculation. The formula used was - SOD measured = [Control-(Sample-Blank)]/ Control *100; 50% inhibition in O.D. was considered as 1 unit of SOD activity.

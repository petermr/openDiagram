<p id="Par21">To further explore the mechanism of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS in the sterile and restorer lines, we sampled the flower buds of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> &lt; 0.5 mm to determine the proteomes, and we used a label-free method to detect the gene expression differences and protein abundance differences between sterile and restorer lines of near-isogenic lines. For proteomes, 711,479 total spectra, 27,274 matched spectra, 46,998 peptides, 30,391 unique peptides, 7598 proteins, and 4967 quantifiable proteins were detected (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>A,C). PCA analysis results showed that among the sterile and restorer lines, the difference between the groups was significant at 44.6%, and the difference within the group was 14.9%, which can better distinguish the differences between the two materials and indicates that the method has good quantitative repeatability (Fig. S

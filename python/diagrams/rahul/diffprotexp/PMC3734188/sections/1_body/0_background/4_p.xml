<p>The isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) model was first introduced by Claude Bernard in 1855. It is a widely employed physiological model for studying liver functions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Eighty-six differentially expressed perfusate proteins were identified and various important proteins related to liver metastasis were identified, which indicates the value of these perfusates for biomarker discovery. To our knowledge, there has not been a study on differential protein expression in the perfusates from metastasized organs aimed at biomarker discovery.

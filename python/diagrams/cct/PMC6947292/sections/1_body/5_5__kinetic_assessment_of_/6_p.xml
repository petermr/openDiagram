<p>A feature of the model that was introduced to allow time efficient computation is the assumption that the quench-induced precipitation reactions can be considered to occur consecutively, e.g., the HTR is assumed to be completed before the MTR starts. Although this is not always strictly the case, the DSC cooling curves indicate that is generally a reasonable assumption: the main reactions (HTR, MTR, LRT) generally have an overlap that is limited. To allow calculation of the phase fractions, the novel model for diffusion-controlled precipitation reactions (extended volume concept, [

0: RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Sigma Aldrich, Cat No: 93289) as per the manufacturers protocol.
1: Briefly, for up to 1 g of tissue, 500 l of TRI reagent was added and triturated using mortar and pestle.
2: Later, the triturate was centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected in a new tube.
3: The chloroform was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was vigorously shaken for 15 s and was allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 min.
4: Centrifugation was again done at 12000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube.
5: An equal amount of isopropanol was added to the solution and incubated at  20 C for 24 h for RNA precipitation.
6: Later, centrifugation was done at 12000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted.
7: Subsequently, washing of RNA was carried out in 70% ethanol and the RNA pellet was resuspended in 20 l of 1/10 Tris EDTA buffer.
8: The RNA concentration and quality were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer.
9: A260/A280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1 was taken to denote the quality of isolated RNA.
10: Further, electrophoresis was carried out in formaldehyde-denatured gel and the quality of the isolated RNA was confirmed.
11: The RNA sequencing libraries were then prepared from the isolated total RNA using Illumina True Seq mRNA standard library preparation kit; the quality of the libraries was verified using agilent tap station, and cluster generation and sequencing using NextSeq 500 were proceeded.

0: Males and females were analyzed separately.
1: Whisker pad mechanical thresholds were averaged for FRICT-ION-injured mice receiving TAT-C3P or TAT-C3D peptides.
2: The behavioral data were expressed as mean  SEM using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc testing with Tukeys multiple comparisons over time.
3: A p-value of<0.05 was considered significant.
4: Normalized fold change between TAT-C3P-peptide-treated and control TAT-C3D-peptide-treated mice was compared with t-tests for the Western blots.
5: Statistical analysis of the transcript cluster-level data comparisons was done via paired t-tests.

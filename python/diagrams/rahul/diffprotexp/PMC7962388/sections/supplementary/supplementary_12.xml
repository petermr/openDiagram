    <bold>Additional file 4.</bold> Comparative analysis of sense transcript representation in apomictic and sexual libraries. Volcano comparative plots were constructed both globally and separately for each developmental stage. Red dots correspond to DETs at p-adjust &lt; 0.001 and Log
    <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; ǀ3ǀ. Positive Log
    <sub>2</sub>FCs indicate overexpression in apomictic plants. Negative Log
    <sub>2</sub>FCs indicate overexpression in sexual plants.

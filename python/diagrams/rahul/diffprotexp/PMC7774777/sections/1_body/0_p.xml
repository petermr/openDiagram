<p>Defects in the ubiquitinâ€“proteasome pathway are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Why the nervous system is more susceptible to these defects than other tissues remains unclear; however, we recently reported that the central nervous system (CNS) is among the tissues with the lowest level of proteasome activity (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Therefore, a low intrinsic activity of the proteasome in the CNS may contribute to its sensitivity to proteotoxic stress.

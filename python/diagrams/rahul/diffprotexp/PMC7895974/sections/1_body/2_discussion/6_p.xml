<p id="Par29">Taken together we provide a resource of paraxial mesoderm samples across a spatiotemporal series. Our analysis focussed on PPI networks and CREs important for vertebrate anteriorâ€“posterior axis formation. We assess evolutionary conservation and validate in vivo function to establish proof-of-principle, which underpins further interrogation and mining of this comprehensive data set.</p>

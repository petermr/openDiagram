<p id="Par22">In summary, by integrating multiple layers of omics data, we have generated a first molecular QTL map for osteoarthritis-relevant tissues and have helped resolve genetic association signals by identifying likely effector genes. We demonstrate how integrating multi-omics dataÂ in primary human complex disease tissue can serve as a valuable approach that moves from basic discovery to accelerated translational opportunities. Our findings identify drug repurposing opportunities and allow novel investigational avenues for therapy development, responding to the urgent clinical need of patients suffering from osteoarthritis.</p>

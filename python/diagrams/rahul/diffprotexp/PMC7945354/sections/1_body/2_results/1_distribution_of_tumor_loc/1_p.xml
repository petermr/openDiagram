<p id="Par40">Previous research has indicated that lung cancer is the most common concomitant malignant tumor among patients with diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, to further confirm the distribution of tumor location, we collected clinical information of hospitalized T2DM patients diagnosed with cancers from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2020. After analyzing the distribution, we found that lung cancer was the highest proportion of malignant tumors (20.84%) followed by digestive tract cancers (colorectum: 12.81%, stomach: 12.32%, and liver: 6.18%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We next analyzed the histological types of T2DM patients with lung cancer. The proportion of histological types was as follows: adenocarcinoma (60.62%), squamous carcinoma (13.86%), small cell carcinoma (3.69%), mixed carcinoma (1.47%), neuroendocrine carcinoma (0.88%), magnocellular carcinoma (0.29%) and other histological types (0.88%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Overall, LAC accounted for the most common tumor in T2DM patients and should be monitored and diagnosed early.

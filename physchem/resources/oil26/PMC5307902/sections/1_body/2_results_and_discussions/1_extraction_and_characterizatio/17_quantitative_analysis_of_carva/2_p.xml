<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The chemical control of the emulsions was performed by the quantitative analysis of the Carvacrol, which is the major constituent of the PaEO. The contents of the chemical marker were assayed by GC, and the PaEO contents in the emulsions were evaluated, also indicating the emulsions stability. The contents of the chemical marker for each formulation were evaluated after 7 and 180 days of storage at room temperature [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 5</xref>]. The quantification of Carvacrol in the emulsions was carried out only at room temperature because volume loss was observed, unlike with emulsions, which are stored at 5&#176;C. The proportions of PaEO entrapped in emulsified systems were estimated from the total volume of essential oil added to each formulation.</p>

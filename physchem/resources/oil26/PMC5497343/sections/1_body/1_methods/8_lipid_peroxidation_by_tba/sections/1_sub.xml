<sub>4</sub> (Iron (II) sulphate) was added to the solution and incubated at 25&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min. A 375&#160;&#956;L of 10% acetic acid (pH&#160;3.50) adjusted with NaOH. Then, 0.80% of 2-thiobarbituric acid (375&#160;&#956;L) mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate 1.1% and 2% trichloroacetic acid (12.5&#160;&#956;L) was added in the same micro centrifuge tubes, vortexed and heat at 65&#160;&#176;C for 60&#160;min. After cooling, 975&#160;&#956;L of butanol was added, centrifuged at 3000&#160;rpm for 600&#160;s. The upper organic layer was then aspirated and the absorbance read at 532&#160;nm. Percentage inhibition of lipid by the EO was calculated using the formula previously stated above and all the assays were performed in triplicate.

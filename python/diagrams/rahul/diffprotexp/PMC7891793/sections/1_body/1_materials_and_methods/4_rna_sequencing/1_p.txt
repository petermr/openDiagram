0: Library generation and sequencing was performed in the DNA technology & Expression Analysis Core Laboratory at the University of California Davis.
1: Barcoded 3 Tag-Seq libraries were prepared using the QuantSeq FWD kit (Lexogen, Vienna, Austria) for multiplexed sequencing according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.
2: The fragment size distribution of the libraries was verified via micro-capillary gel-electrophoresis on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
3: The libraries were quantified by fluorometry on a Qubit instrument (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA), and pooled in equimolar ratios.
4: Forty eight libraries were sequenced per lane on a HiSeq 4000 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with single-end 100 bp reads.
5: The sequencing generated more than 3 million reads per library.

0: The chromosomal distribution of StbZIPs was identified using the MCScanX ( http:/chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/) program to map the positions of the  StbZIP genes within the  Solanum tuberosum genome (plant ensemble and Spud DB ( http:/solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/pgsc%20download.shtml).
1: Based on the condition of BLAST aligned query sequence (> 80 percent) of the StbZIPs, tandem and collinear gene duplications were recognized ( Fig 1).

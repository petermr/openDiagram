<p>Analysis of the interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs was applied to determine the possible functional role of miRNAs, which are differentially expressed in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors. We used both mRNA target prediction and correlation analysis of the expression levels of particular miRNAs and their predicted mRNA targets in corticotroph tumor samples.

<p>In total, three rats in the MIRI group and three from the sham group were anesthetized, and the T1-T4 spinal cord segments were quickly extracted. Total RNAs were collected from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord using TRIzol
 <sup>®</sup> reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) based on the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration and purity were examined using a spectrophotometer (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) (

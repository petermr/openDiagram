<p>These populations were expressed in terms of the number of H
 <sub>2</sub>O bound per unit cell (UC). We note that a single UC consists of two MnO
 <sub>2</sub> units. Additionally, the conversion of the experimentally obtained “mass of bound H
 <sub>2</sub>O per mass of MnO
 <sub>2</sub>” to “H
 <sub>2</sub>O/UC” is made using the molar masses (

 <sub>2</sub> (0.20 K) for AcidBir and of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.17 K) for δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>.

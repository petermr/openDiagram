 <caption> Kaplan–Meier survival curves of m 5C regulatory factors in GI cancer. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were drawn based on the differential expression level of m 5C regulatory factors in GI cancer. The red and green curves showed survival curves of the high and low expression groups, respectively. ∗ P &lt; 0.05, ∗∗ P &lt; 0.01, and ∗∗∗ P &lt; 0.001 between the two groups. </caption>

 <caption> ( A) Human task grand average trial-by-trial endpoint-error. Negative error indicates a clockwise error direction. Shaded area represents standard error. During the first 200 trials (including Baseline epoch), endpoint errors are near zero. When the 30° clockwise perturbation is applied on trials 201–400, motor adaptation occurs as shown by a progressive reduction in endpoint errors until asymptote is reached at around 5°–7° of clockwise error. When the 30° rotation is removed in the final 200 trials, a negative aftereffect occurs, with an initial error opposing that of initial adaptation, returning to baseline performance levels by the final trials. Bar charts represent grand average reaction time ( B) and reach duration ( C) during adaptation epochs of human task. ( D, E) Mean reaction time and reach duration over adaptation epochs in cats ( A) (cross mark), ( B) (circle), and ( C) (square). Error bars indicate standard error. Individual data points represent participant means. Asterisks indicate Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparison to other groups, *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01). Baseline baseline epoch, EA early adaptation epoch, LA late adaptation epoch, EAft early aftereffect epoch, LAft late aftereffect epoch. </caption>

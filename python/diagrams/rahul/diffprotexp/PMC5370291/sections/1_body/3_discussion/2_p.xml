<p>Although we first provide the differential protein expression profile of HepG2 cell in response to TNFα, proteomic analysis of HepG2 in response to other stimuli such as mushroom polysaccharide 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> or in comparison to human hepatocyte 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> has been reported. Among these proteomic analyses for HepG2, cytoskeletal components, HSPs/chaperones, 14-3-3 family, oxidoreduction-associating proteins, and energy metabolism-associating proteins have been widely identified and investigated. Similarly, we identify 8 cytoskeletal components, 10 HSPs/chaperones, 5 14-3-3 isoforms, 7 oxidoreduction-associating proteins, and 6 energy metabolism-associating proteins (Supplementary data), and their expression levels are significantly changed in response to TNFα.

<p>We have performed a very comprehensive analysis of the histopathology in this experiment. Six lung compartments (pleura, alveolus, septum, interstitium, bronchiole, and bronchus) were evaluated on H &amp; E slides from each calf in the experiment by a board certified veterinary pathologist (FC). The evaluations included the scoring of specific histological lesions in each of these areas (from none, mild, moderate and severe). Statistical analysis was performed on this data. In addition, gross pathology consisting of determination of mean percentages of consolidation were computed and analyzed statistically. This information has been written up and is being submitted as a separate manuscript. It includes multiple microphotographs, figures and tables. It was our feeling that this very interesting and somewhat voluminous data required a separate manuscript. However, we totally understand why some part of the pathology should be included in the transcriptome manuscript. We have therefore included in the revision a brief summary of the pathology including mean percentages of lung consolidation in each group; we have added our pathologist (FC) as an author on this manuscript: see lines 541-553)</p>

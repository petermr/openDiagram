0: Rats were starved for 12 h before isolating ASCs.
1: First, rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane to induce sacrifices, soaked in 75% ethanol for whole-body disinfection, removed from alcohol, and placed on a sterile ultra-clean table.
2: The limbs were fixed, and the SAT was obtained from the groin.
3: Perirenal and EAT was obtained from the kidney and testis, and the tissue was rinsed in precooled PBS.
4: The washed adipose tissue was transferred into the cell platform, muscle and lymph tissue were removed, tissue was cut into 12 mm pieces, and collagenase type I was added.
5: After digestion, all the suspensions collected were filtered through a nylon filter (Dutscher, 100 m), centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded.
6: DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the sample.
7: Then the suspension was evenly spread in culture dishes and cultured into a 37 C incubator for 2 h. The upper-medium was discarded, high glucose medium containing 10% FBS was added, and SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs were obtained.
8: After culturing at 37 C in an incubator for 3 days, RNA and metabolites were extracted from the third passage (P3) cells and sequenced by transcriptomics and metabolomics, respectively ( Figure 9).

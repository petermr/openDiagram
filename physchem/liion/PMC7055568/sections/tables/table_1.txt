0: Table 1 The conclusion summary of different researches focused on the mechanism of Liion migration in SCEs Composition Method Conclusion Refs.
1: 50 wt% LLZOPEO_18/LiClO_4 Selective isotope labeling and highresolution solidstate Li NMR Li ions preferentially move through the Li_7La_3Zr_2O_12 ceramic phase.
2: @62 5 wt% LLZO nanowiresPAN/ LiClO_4 Selective isotope labeling and highresolution solidstate Li NMR Li ions preferentially move through the modified regions at the LLZO/polymer interface.
3: @52 5 wt% LLZOPEO_18/LiTFSI Selective isotope labeling and highresolution solidstate Li NMR Li ions preferentially move through the polymer phase.
4: @64 20 wt% LLZOPEO_18/LiTFSI Li ions preferentially move through the LiTFSI dispersed in PEO and partially from decomposed LLZO.
5: 50 wt% LLZOPEO_18/LiTFSI Li ions preferentially move through the percolated network formed by LLZO particles.
6: 50 wt% LLZOPEO_18/LiTFSI(50 wt%)TEGDME Li ions preferentially move through the PEOTEGDME matrix.
7: 16 vol% GaLLZOPEO The ionic conductivity data and Monte Carlo simulation The space charge region is observed and the enhanced ionic conductivity can be ascribed to the space charge region @65 10 wt% LATPPEO/LiClO_4 The ionic conductivity data and simulation and transmission electron microscope The enhanced ionic conductivity can be ascribed to the interphase region surrounding the particles, which achieves percolation at low nanoparticle loading.
8: @66 70 wt% LLZOP(EO)_15/LiTFSI The ionic conductivity data Li ions are trapped at the interface and/or within the LLZO surface layer, which depletes the ionic conductivity.

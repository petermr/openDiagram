0: Moreover, all methods can be distinguished based on the number of conditions they can simultaneously compare, and on the amount of previous information they rely on and they can account for.
1: For example, gene co-expression networks structure and differential modules can be obtained in three ways: (i) making use of transcriptional data only in a completely unbiased way ( Table 3, Unbiased methods); (ii) analysing transcriptional data of pre-defined gene sets such as Gene Ontology lists ( Table 3, A priori methods) (iii) combining manually curated proteinprotein interaction networks or known pathway structures with expression data ( Table 3, Structured pathway methods), to identify a differential usage of predetermined nodes and edges.
2: This method, while allowing for the reduction the noise, it is unable to uncover new, potentially relevant, interactions.
3: Finally, additional features such as genetic variation may be integrated to improve networks interpretation [ 92, 93] ( Table 5).

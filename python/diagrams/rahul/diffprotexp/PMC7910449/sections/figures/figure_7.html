 <caption> CircRAB11FIP1 directly bound to DSC1 protein. A Silver staining of protein gels acquired through circRAB11FIP1 RNA knockdown. B RNA knockdown was applied to identify circRAB11FIP1-specific binding protein gels. C LV2, LV2-1, or LV2-2 was transfected into SKOV3 and A2780 cells. LV6-NC or LV6 was transfected into SKOV3 and A2780 cells. Later, the DSC1 protein level was detected through western blot analysis. D catRAPID was used to predict possible binding sites between circRAB11FIP1 and DSC1 protein. E DSC1 DNA fragments were cloned to the PCMV5 plasmid. PCMV5 vector, PCMV5-DSC1, PCMV5-Δ26-77, PCMV5-Δ139-190, or PCMV5-Δ176-227, PCMV5-Δ239-290 was transfected into SKOV3 cells. PCR was conducted to detect circRAB11FIP1 expression after 48 h. F Co-IP and western blot assays showing the interaction between DSC1 and ATG101 in SKOV3 and A2780 cells stably transfected with LV6 or LV2-1, respectively. Error bar stands for standard error. * P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.01. </caption>

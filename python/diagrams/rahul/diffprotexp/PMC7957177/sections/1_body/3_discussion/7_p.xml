<p>During the progression of cervical cancer, other down‐regulated genes, such as synaptonemal complex protein 2 (SYCP2)(Gene ID: 10388) has been found that it is expressed uncontrolled in early oral cancer of human HPV infection,

 </xref> Cycle‐dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (Gene ID: 1029) controls G1 phase by regulating CDK4 and P53, is an important tumor suppressor gene. Recently, Viloria ME et al. reported that the decreased frequency of p16 (CDKN2A) expression accompanied by decreased frequency of TGF‐β1 in CIN III and cancer.

 </xref> This report suggested that CDKN2A could be involved in the neoplasia progression, as we predicted before. In our study, we found that all of them regulated in cervical cancer. But their reactivity in our study is no good. There exists internal and external reason. For those analysis are based on gene chips, no protein analysis, the internal reason may threaten the validity of this study, such as post‐transcriptional modification of protein, and system error of the determination of gene chips. The external reason maybe change the validity of this study, such as our experimental conditions, antibody batches, etc. Although we did not confirm their expressions, its do not hinder them to be the candidate biomarker in the future.

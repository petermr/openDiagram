0: The ETS (E26 transformation specific) domain transcription factor superfamily includes 27 members in humans in 11 subfamilies [ 2, 4].
1: Taking its name from the founding member of this superfamily, namely oncogenic v-ets [ 5], ETS domain transcription factors are typically defined by their DNA binding domain, called the ETS domain, which binds the consensus motif 5-GGA(A/T)-3, called the ets motif of the ETS binding site (EBS) [ 6].
2: Their DNA binding property, as well as transactivation function, is regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway [ 7, 8].

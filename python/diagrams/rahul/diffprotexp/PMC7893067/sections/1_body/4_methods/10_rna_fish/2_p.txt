0: RNA FISH was carried using hybridization and wash buffers from LGC Biosearch Technologies.
1: In short, 10^5 human SHSY-5Y cells were seeded on 18 mm #1 round cover glass (VWR) in a 12 well culture plate.
2: Cells were cultured in 1:1 mixture of Ham's F12 and DMEM (Gibco) medium (Gibco) with  l-glutamine and phenol red, supplemented with 2 mM  l-glutamine (Sigma), 10% FBS (Sigma) and 1  PEST (Sigma).
3: Cells were maintained in culture at 37 C and 5% CO 2.
4: Following overnight incubation, cells were fixed and permeabilized according to manufacturer recommendations.
5: Cells were incubated for 16 h with FISH probes in the hybridization buffer (LGC Biosearch Technologies).
6: Cells were then washed using wash buffer A (LGC Biosearch Technologies) for 30 min at 37 C, and DNA stained with DAPI (1 g/ml) for 30 min at 37 C. Finally, cells were washed in wash buffer B, and coverslips were mounted in Vectashield anti-fade (VectorLabs) and imaged immediately.
7: Imaging was carried out on Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 Widefield Fluorescence Microscopy using an Olympus 63x/1.42 PlanApo objective and using and ZEN imaging software.
8: Z-stacks were collected at 0.5 m intervals for 18 fields per sample.
9: Z-stacks were deconvolved using orthogonal projection (ZEN imaging software).

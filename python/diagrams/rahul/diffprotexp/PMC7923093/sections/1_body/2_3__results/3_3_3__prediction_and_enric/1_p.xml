<p>The “SBC analysis wizard” was used to predict the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. Results indicated 44,142 and 55,401 in the control and arginine groups, respectively. The target genes of mir-133a-3p and mir-133b-3p were completely consistent via DAVID (

In addition, the coincidence rate of mir-1-3p and mir-206-3p target genes were higher. Results of GO enrichment analysis were in line with KEGG pathway analysis. There were 240 out of 535 significantly correlative target genes through GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis (

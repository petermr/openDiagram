<p id="Par14">Based on experimenter observation during the recording session and offline verification by examining a video record of task performance, individual reaches were divided into three categories: (i) ‘Hits’ when the cat rapidly and smoothly reached to place its forepaw into the target reward tube. (ii) ‘Misses’ were the same as hits for the reach component of the movement, but the forepaw failed initially to enter the target, hitting the Perspex façade ~ 1 cm to the left or right of the reward tube entrance (ie. opposite to the original prism glasses displacement). A subsequent lateral adjustment was required for the paw to enter the tube to retrieve the reward. (iii) ‘Rejected’ trials were all reaches that either had a reaction time shorter than 150 ms; a reach duration (time between paw lift-off and target/façade hit) more than 2 standard deviations of the mean computed for each animal; reaches that displayed a corrective adjustment near the end of the movement, prior to contact with the Perspex façade, in order for the forepaw to enter the reward tube; or trials with large electrical noise artefacts in the neural data. Rejected reaches accounted for approximately 20% of all trials and are not considered further.</p>

<p>Since we focus on the reaction pathways and voltage profiles during the charge/discharge process for the FeNCN archetype in Li/Na‐ion batteries, the crystal structures of the fully delithiated (desodiated) compound FeNCN and the lithiated (sodiated) compound Li
 <sub>2</sub>NCN (Na
 <sub>2</sub>NCN) should be analyzed first (Figure 
 <xref rid="anie201914760-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). FeNCN crystallizes in the hexagonal system with 
 <italic>P</italic>6
 <sub>3</sub>/
 <italic>mmc</italic> symmetry, that is, octahedral coordination for Fe and trigonal‐prismatic coordination for NCN, resembling the nickel arsenide motif. Li
 <sub>2</sub>NCN (Na
 <sub>2</sub>NCN), however, adopts a tetragonal 
 <italic>I</italic>4/
 <italic>mmm</italic> structure with tetrahedral coordination for Li (Na) and a quadratic‐prismatic coordination for NCN. Like the related oxide compounds, transition‐metal carbodiimides follow a conversion‐reaction mechanism when used as electrode materials. That means that drastic structural transformations occur during the charge/discharge process. It is unclear up to which degree the crystal structures of the intermediate compounds may resemble FeNCN or Li
 <sub>2</sub>NCN in a LIB. It is therefore far from trivial to correctly deduce the atomistic structural details of these ternaries denoted as Li–Fe–NCN, in particular because reliable experimental models (for example, from X‐ray diffraction) are missing. Because of this, we tentatively used four kinds of structural bases for a thorough survey of possible Li–Fe–NCN ternaries: two from divalent carbodiimides,

 <sub>2</sub>NCN, and one from Li‐containing metal oxides such as CuLi
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (where one needs to replace O
 <sup>2−</sup> anions with NCN
 <sup>2−</sup> groups).

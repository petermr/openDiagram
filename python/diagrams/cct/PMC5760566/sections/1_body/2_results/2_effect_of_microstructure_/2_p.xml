<p id="Par15">After the step-cooling heat treatment, the strength of each sample decreases, but the strength of the fast cooling samples is still significantly higher (∼25 MPa) than that of the slow cooling samples. ASME specification for mechanical properties of SA508Gr.4N steel stipulates UTS and YS values of 725 MPa and 585 MPa, respectively. The test (i.e., SA508Gr.4N) steel meets the requirements of the ASME specification. Furthermore, the difference in the microstructures has no effect on the ductility, as evidenced by a total elongation (
 <italic>A</italic>) and a reduction in area (
 <italic>Z</italic>) of 24% and 78%, respectively, for both states. These values are higher than those stipulated in the ASME requirements (
 <italic>A</italic> ≥ 18%, 
 <italic>Z</italic> ≥ 45%).

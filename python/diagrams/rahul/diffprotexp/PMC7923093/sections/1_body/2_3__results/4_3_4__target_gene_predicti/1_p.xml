<p>Seven differentially expressed miRNAs were used to predict their target genes via TargetScan, MiRanda, PicTar, MirTarget2 and PITA supported (

The 34 predicted target genes were detected by RT-PCR (

 <xref rid="animals-11-00535-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. In general, we observed that 17 out of 34 genes showed significant expression levels between the control and arginine groups. Notably, some of the differential expressed genes were known to be cell cycle related, indicating the potential roles of miRNAs in regulating mammary gland development.

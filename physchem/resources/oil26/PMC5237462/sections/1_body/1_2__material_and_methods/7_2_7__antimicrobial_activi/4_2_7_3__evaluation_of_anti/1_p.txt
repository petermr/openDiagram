0: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, we used the disk agar diffusion method.
1: Each bacterial suspension was plated (in triplicate) with the aid of a stereodisposable swab across the surface of Mueller-Hinton agar.
2: A solution was prepared with a solubilized concentration of 250 mg/mL with Tween 80 and then, dilutions were held to obtain concentrations of 100, 50, and 10 mg/mL.
3: After that, it was soaked on filter paper discs (Whatman, type 3) of 6 mm diameter each 10 L concentrations, respectively.
4: After incubation of the plates at 35C for 24 hours, a reading of the results by measuring the halo formed around disks containing the oil was performed.
5: The result of each dilution, the average of the three measurements, and susceptible halo of an equal size or greater than 8 mm diameter were considered [ 21,  22].

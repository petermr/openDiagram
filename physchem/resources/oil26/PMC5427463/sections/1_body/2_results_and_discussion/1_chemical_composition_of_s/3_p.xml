<p>This variation is probably due to the different growth habitat. Indeed, the oil composition is highly influenced by genetic (Mader et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), environmental factors (Bettaieb et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), the developmental stage of the plants and extraction method (Hadri et al., 2010[

 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]), climate conditions, organ, culture site and season (Santos-Gomes and Fernandes-Ferreira, 2001[

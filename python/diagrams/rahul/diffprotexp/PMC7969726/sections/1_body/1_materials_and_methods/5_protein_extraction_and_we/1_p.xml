<p>Total cellular proteins were extracted and resuspended in lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) supplemented with a protease inhibitor. Western blotting was performed using a standard protocol described previously (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, total proteins (30 μg) were loaded in individual lanes and separated on an 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. The following primary antibodies against the indicated proteins were used: CPSF1 (1:1,000, Bethyl, A301-580) and β-actin (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, United States). The secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology, 7074S, 1:3,000) and anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076S, 1:3,000), and both were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The protein band intensities were quantified using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager ChemiDoc

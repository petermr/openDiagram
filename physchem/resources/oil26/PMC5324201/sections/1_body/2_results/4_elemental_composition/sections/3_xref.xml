<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>. A total of 21 elements were analyzed which are designated as essential and non-essential elements. The relative standard deviation (RSD%) values for the studied elements were found to be&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;5%. The concentrations of the elements are calculated on fresh (FB) and dry weight basis (DB) within the significance level (p&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.05). In the current experiment, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe and Al were detected as rich essential elements followed by Ni, Se and Li on the dry weight basis (DWB). Hg was detected the highest level of the analyzed toxic elements followed by As and Cd. On the other hand, Cr and Pb were not found in the current experiment.

0: Compared to sepsis and bacterial pneumonia, studies evaluating the role of TREM1 in aspergillosis are relatively limited.
1: Increased TREM1 expression is observed in monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, while reduced TREM1 expression is observed in individuals suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ 15].
2: In addition, TREM1 has been shown to modulate the immune response directed against  A. fumigatus during experimental fungal asthma [ 16] and in infected rat corneal epithelium [ 17].

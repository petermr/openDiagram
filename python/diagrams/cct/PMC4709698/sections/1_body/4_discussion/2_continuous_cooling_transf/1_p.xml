<p>The precipitation of β-Ti in the present system can be captured by continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curves. We use the quasi-equilibrium phase diagram to construct a CCT curve for the present alloys (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). It is also the basis for discussing the differences in the crystalline volume fractions and compositions of the glass and β-Ti for BT48 samples produced with different cooling rates (see above). The following temperatures are crucial here:

 <sub>
  <italic>l</italic>
 </sub> (the equilibrium liquidus temperature), 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> (the temperature when nucleation commences), 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> (the temperature when the compositions of the supercooled liquid and β-Ti reach the equilibrium values), 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub> (the temperature when diffusion stops and the composition are effectively frozen in), 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub> (the glass transition temperature) and finally the temperatures at which the supercooled liquid crystallizes into Be
 <sub>2</sub>Zr and Cu
 <sub>10</sub>Zr
 <sub>7</sub>. The cooling curves (constant cooling rate given by equation 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq21">(2)</xref>) for the rods having a diameter of 2 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm as well as the cooling rate for the 100 g ingot of BT48 are displayed (

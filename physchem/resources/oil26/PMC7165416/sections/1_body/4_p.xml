<p>To determine the molecular basis of spectral tuning, we performed in vitro expression of ancestral proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), and, using site-directed mutagenesis, generated mutants containing derived substitutions. For the degu, hamster, and jerboa, differences in spectral sensitivity between the expressed derived and respective ancestral proteins could be explained by observed substitutions at known critical sites (Y277F, T285A, and A308S). In contrast, the gerbil and elephant-shrew were each characterized by an amino acid substitution at a single critical site (T285A and A308S, respectively). Introducing these residues into the ancestral proteins did not recover the recorded λ
 <sub>max</sub> value of the wild types. We therefore searched the protein sequences of each taxon for other potentially important substitutions on the basis of changes in the presence of a hydroxyl group (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). For gerbil M/LWS pigment, we found that S107G and S134A gave rise to spectral shifts in λ
 <sub>max</sub> (−3 and −6 nm, respectively), and that the combination of S107G, S134A, and T285A recovered the λ
 <sub>max</sub> shift to 490 nm seen in the wild-type gerbil (

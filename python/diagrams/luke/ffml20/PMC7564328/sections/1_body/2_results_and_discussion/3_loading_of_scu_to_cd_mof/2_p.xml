<p id="p0155">The payload of SCU in SCU@CD-MOF was determined by an HPLC method. The reaction temperature, time and molar ratio of SCU to CD-MOF were the key parameters that determined the loading efficiency. All these factors were carefully monitored to optimize the loading process. The incubation temperature had the weakest effect on SCU loading (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). For instance, at a molar ratio of 1:1 (SCU to CD-MOF), the lowest and highest drug loadings were 16.75 ± 1.11% at 30 °C and 18.80 ± 0.18% at 50 °C, respectively, with a merely difference of 2.05%. The molar ratio of SCU to CD-MOF played a more important role, reaching maximal values between 2:1 and 5:1 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). It is of sense to note that the SCU loading was stagnated after extension the reaction time of 4 h, the loading efficiency was 29.51 ± 0.71% at 4 h and 30.42 ± 0.1% at 6 h, with a merely difference of 0.91%. Thus, the reaction time was selected as 4 h (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). In general, the optimal SCU loading was achieved within 4 h through gentle stirring (400 rpm) for molar ratio of SCU to CD-MOF of 2:1, in ethanolic solution at 50 °C.

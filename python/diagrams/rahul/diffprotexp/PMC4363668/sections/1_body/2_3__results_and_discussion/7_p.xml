<p>EV71 infection cause central nervous system (CNS) complications whether through BBB is unclear. Furthermore, EV71 invasion will modify the patterns of protein expression in HBMEC, which may affect the normal physiological function of HBMEC and determine its pathogenic progress and consequence. Therefore, studies on viral infections proteomics contributes to uncover the mechanism of interaction between EV71 and HBMEC and viral molecular pathogenesis, find early biomarker of EV71 infection, develop earlier diagnostic method, evaluate therapeutic effect and prognosis and so on. In this study, we identified 28 differentially expressed protein in HBMEC after EV71 infection, and western analysis three proteins. Those differential protein expression in EV71-infected HBMEC in vitro may not completely be according to the protein level in vivo. We regretted that most of the confirmed differential protein didnot be futher tested the expression level by western blotting, but our identified three proteins have be confirmed expression level by western blotting, which have important roles in virus infection; for example, HSP27 and vimentin are associated with virus entry and/or infection, and DJ-1 protein may associated with EV71 infection caused encephalitis. Our study on HBMEC proteome of BBB in CNS may contribute to understand the severity of EV71 brain encephalitis in clinic, and some differential proteins may provide a new way to find early biomarker candidate during EV71 infection developed severe case; our work on differential protein expression of HBMEC may provide a possible insight into central nervous system complications caused by EV71 virus infection, and find new drug candidate against EV71. This study builds up a comprehensive profile of the HBMEC proteome and provides a useful basis for further analysis of the pathogenic mechanism that underlies EV71 infections to induce severe neural complications.</p>

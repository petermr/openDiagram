<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As the chemical composition, as well as the pharmacological study of <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. root, have not been reported previously, it was undertaken for the present investigation. In the present results, we have found the <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. root as a rich source of mineral constituents along with amino acids. Inorganic elements remain complexed with organic ligands and make them bioavailable to the body system. The essential amino acids of the protein may prove its potentiality in medicinal preparation. The thermal analysis suggested that it is a simple, effective and rapid method to characterize the <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. species as well as to evaluation of phytotherapy. The current study of the essential oil showed weak antioxidant activity compared to ASA and BHT and also exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. This study contributes to knowledge of the chemical properties and also the biological significance of essential oil of <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. root as an aromatic, spice and medicinal plants. Several compounds of different polarity present in small amounts can also contribute to the biological activity. The results of the present studies will be helpful for herbal formulation and also for the basis of further studies.</p>

0: The protocols used in this study were conducted according to the guidelines of CLSI, formerly known as NCCLS (Wayne 2007) with slight modifications.
1: In summary, each sterile Petri dish with a diameter of 9 cm was prepared with 20 ml of Mueller-Hinton medium.
2: Then, 100 L of a bacterial suspension (10 8 CFU/mL) was spread on the plates.
3: After 5 min, a sterile filter paper disc (6 mm) containing 20 L of  D. kotschyi essential oil was placed on the surface of the plate.
4: In order to accelerate essential oil diffusion into the agar, the plates were incubated at 4 C for 1 h followed by incubation at 37 C, for 24 to 48 h. The diameters of the inhibition zones (mm) were measured, including the diameter of the disks.
5: Gentamycin (30 g/disk) and vancomycin (30 g/disk) served as positive controls for Gram-positive and Gram-negative, respectively.
6: All tests were performed in triplicate.

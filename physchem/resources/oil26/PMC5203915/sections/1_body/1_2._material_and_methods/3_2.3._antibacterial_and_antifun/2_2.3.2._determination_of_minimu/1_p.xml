<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of HR and SGR essential oils was evaluated by means of the twofold serial microdilution assay [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The essential oils dissolved in DMSO were diluted at concentrations ranging from 500 to 0.48&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL, with Mueller-Hinton broth medium for bacteria and 5000 to 4.88&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL with Sabouraud medium for yeasts. The antimicrobial activity of the solvent DMSO was also evaluated. Vancomycin (for Gram-positive bacteria), norfloxacin (for Gram-negative bacteria), and amphotericin B (for yeasts) were used as controls. The MIC values, presented in <italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL, were considered as the lowest concentration of the essential oils that inhibited the growth of the microorganisms, after 24&#8201;h of incubation at 37&#176;C. The microbial growth was measured with an Absorbance Microplate Reader set to 620&#8201;nm (Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC). Assays for each tested microorganism were carried out in triplicate.</p>

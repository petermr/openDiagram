<p id="Par62">Expression variability within biological replicas allowed us to compute the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the (log

 <italic>j</italic> in the same chamber or with the same gene in adjacent chambers. We used the correlation analysis to identify significantly (p-val &lt; 0.05) synergistically, antagonistically and independently expressed genes in the same chamber as well synchronous and asynchronous expression of the same gene in adjacent chambers. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficient was determined with the publically available software

 <italic>t</italic>-test) for degrees of freedom df = 4 (biological replicas)*R (number of spots probing redundantly each of the correlated transcripts) − 2. If each gene was probed by one spot, then df = 4 − 2 = 2, for two spots df = 8 − 2 = 6, for 3 spots df = 12 − 2 = 10. For unequal number of spots, we used for each biological replica the average expression level of all spots probing that gene.

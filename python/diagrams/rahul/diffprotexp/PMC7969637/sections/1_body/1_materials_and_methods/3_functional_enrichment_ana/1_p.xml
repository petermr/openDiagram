<p>For the obtained differentially expressed genes, we used the “clusterProfiler” function package in R language for enrichment analysis of GO (Gene Ontology, including Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, including key related pathways) analysis. When

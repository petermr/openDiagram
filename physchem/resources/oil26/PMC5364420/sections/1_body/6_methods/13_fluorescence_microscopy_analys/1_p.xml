<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Logarithmic phase bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 6000&#8201;&#215;&#8201;g for 5&#8201;min, washed three times, and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4). Tested bacteria were treated with different concentrations of samples and incubated at 37&#8201;&#176;C. After 1&#8201;h and 2&#8201;h, cells containing approximately 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>8</sup>&#8201;CFU/mL were harvested by centrifugation at 6000&#8201;&#215;&#8201;g for 5&#8201;min and stained for 15&#8201;min with the equal volume of 1&#8201;mg/mL PI in the dark at room temperature. Ten microliters of the stained bacterial suspensions were dropped onto glass slides and covered with coverslips, and images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMi8).</p>

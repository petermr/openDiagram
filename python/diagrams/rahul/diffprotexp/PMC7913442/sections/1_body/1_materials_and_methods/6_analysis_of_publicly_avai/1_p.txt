0: To estimate the fraction of genes with FOXL2 binding sites we used two publicly available human FOXL2 ChIP-seq dataset: one from TGF-treated HGrC1 cells ectopically expressing FOXL2 or FOXL2 C134W [ 37] and the other from an immortalized granulosa cell line (SVOG3e) with inducible expression of V5-tagged FOXL2 C134W protein [ 28].
1: For the first one (ChIP1), BAM files from FOXL2 C134W and the negative empty vector control were obtained from the authors and peaks were called using MACS2 [ 48] callpeak with default setting and using q-value cutoff of peak detection of 0.01 ( q 0.01).
2: For the second (ChIP2), we obtained the peak coordinates from GEO (GSE126171) from 4 replicates at 12hrs induction of V5-tagged FOXL2 C134W and merged peaks coordinates of the replicates.
3: Peaks BED files from the above ChIP-Seq were intersected with a  5 kb window from the transcription start site (TSS) of human genes (genecode v35 and genecode v19 respectively for ChIP1 and ChIP2) to identify genes with FOXL2 C134W binding around their promoter region ( n = 9,939 and  n = 11,697, respectively).
4: Enrichment for genes with FOXL2 binding was calculated using Fishers exact test in R, comparing DEGs versus non-DEGs.

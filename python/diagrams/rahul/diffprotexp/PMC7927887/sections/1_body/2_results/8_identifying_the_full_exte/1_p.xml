<p>To determine the extent of alternative splicing in MM, irrespective of mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>, we split the dataset (n=598) into three groups. The groups consisted of the top and bottom 20% (both n=120) and middle 60% (n=358) in number of novel splice loci (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4</italic>). We compared the makeup of the groups based on key MM clinical and genomic characteristics. We first looked at the number of novel splice loci in each group defined by translocations and compared it to the group of samples without translocations. We included a group of four pooled normal donor samples derived from CD138 selected plasma cells in the analysis for comparison (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5</italic>). The t(4;14) group had significantly fewer novel splice loci than the group with no translocations and other translocation groups. The t(11;14) and t(6;14) group had significantly more novel splice loci. We identified significantly less novel splicing in the t(4;14) group and an increase in the t(11;14) group (
 <italic>vs.</italic> the no translocation group; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.002 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0001) (
 <xref rid="table002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There was no difference in the frequency of 
 <italic>MYC</italic> translocations, International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) or International Scoring System (ISS) risk scores but there was a significant difference in p53 inactivation (one or both alleles) in the high splice group (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.019). Survival analysis revealed a significant difference in progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.03 and 0.013) with the high splice group having adverse outcome (

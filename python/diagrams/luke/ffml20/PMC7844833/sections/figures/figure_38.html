 <caption> (a) Effective thicknesses of the oxide layers on Ir (blue) and Ru (red) thin films, estimated from a linear combination fitting of operando Ir L 3-edge and Ru K-edge XANES data. Representative spectra are shown in the insets. The data are reproduced with permission from ref ( 556). Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society. (b) Potential-dependent Ir–O interatomic distances, as obtained from the fitting of operando EXAFS data at the Ir L 3-edge for bulk-like IrO x catalyst (IrO 2-30) NPs and for dispersed catalysts with NP size ∼1.7 nm (IrO 2-150). The number in the sample names refers to an approximate surface area of the catalyst (30 m 2/g and 150 m 2/g). Reproduced with permission from ref ( 564). Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society. (c) Experimentally acquired O K-edge XAS spectra for rutile-type IrO 2 and amorphous IrO x catalysts, as well as ab initio calculated spectra for O II- species in IrO 2, and a spectrum obtained as a linear combination of ab initio spectra for O II- and O I- species (with weights 60% and 40%, correspondingly).

<p>As can be seen from the comparative plot of hardness after ageing and specific precipitation enthalpy during cooling for all considered AlMgSi alloys in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f0A2">Figure A2</xref> in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-04083">Appendix A</xref>, a correlation between precipitation enthalpy and hardness after ageing is shown for all AlMgSi alloys for which DSC was able to achieve sufficiently fast cooling. Thus, in cases where DSC is not fast enough, the hardness data after ageing can provide a good approximation of the UCCR. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f031">Figure 31</xref> shows the values of the UCCR on a logarithmic scale for nine different AlMgSi alloys as a function of the summarised Mg+Si content. This figure shows that the UCCR increases substantially with increasing alloying element concentration. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f031">Figure 31</xref> also includes four different alloys within the chemical specification of 6082 (which is very broad), and it is interesting to note that their UCCRs can vary by a factor of up to 10. A strong batch influence can therefore be expected in terms of the quench sensitivity of Al alloys with a broad specification range for their composition.

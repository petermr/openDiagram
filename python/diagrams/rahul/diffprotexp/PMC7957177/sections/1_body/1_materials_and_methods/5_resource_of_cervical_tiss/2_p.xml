<p>To validate the results of genetic analysis at the transcriptional level, human cervical tissues were collected from the outpatient or surgical divisions of the Department of Gynaecology in Women's Hospital School of Medicine Zhejiang University between June and December 2017. We collected a total of 69 specimens for analysis according to the 4th Edition of WHO Classification of Tumours of the Female Reproductive Organs (IARC WHO Classification of Tumours). The histopathologic diagnosis was made by five pathologists and included normal tissues in 15 patients, LSIL in 19 patients, HSIL in 18 patients and SCC in 17 patients. We excluded patients with any other malignancies or a history of preoperative anticancer treatment. Unstained paraffin sections from all specimens were prepared to do IHC staining, after which the specimens were diagnosed again by the same pathologists.</p>

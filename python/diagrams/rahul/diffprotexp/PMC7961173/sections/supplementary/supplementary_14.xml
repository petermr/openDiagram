   <p>Supplementary file3 Multidimensional scaling plots for HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with DCVC. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0 (control), 10 or 20 ÂµM DCVC for 6 or 12 h. N=4 independent experiments. After mRNA isolation and sequencing, multidimensional scaling analysis was performed using the edgeR package for R. Plots depicting multidimensional scaling were clustered by treatment group, exposure duration and experiment day. Color keys are identified with each plot (TIF 222 KB)</p>

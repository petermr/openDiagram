 <caption> Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) of differential protein spots (a-c). Proteins including ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (E2), glutathione synthetases (GS), triosephosphate isomerase (TSP), T-complex protein 1 subunit zeta (TCPZ), lamin-B1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP F), and superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (Cu, Zn-SOD) were determined using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). </caption>

0: IHC assay was performed as Ho et al recommended.
1: 17 In brief, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and treated with ethanol in gradient concentration.
2: The endogenous peroxidase was inactivated using PBS with 1% H 2O 2 for 10 min, after which the sections were washed with PBS three times and incubated with 5% skim milk/PBS for 30 min to decrease non-specific binding.
3: The sections were subsequently diluted with 5% skim milk/PBS and incubated with anti-PPP1R14B and Ki-67 antibodies for 16 h at 4C.
4: After being washed with PBS twice, the sections were detected by IHC detection system.
5: 3, 3-diaminobenzidine liquid substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used for observation of specific immunostaining, followed by hematoxylin for counterstaining.
6: Non-immune IgG in the same concentration was used as negative control.
7: The information of all antibodies in the experiment was shown in  Supplement Table 4.

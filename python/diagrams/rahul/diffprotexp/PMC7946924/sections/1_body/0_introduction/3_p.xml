These differentially expressed miRNAs possibly participate in control of hormone metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic pathways and cell division of the developing kernels and difference in function and expression levels of the miRNAs determine the quantum of grain filling of the spikelets. To study the expression pattern during grain development, miRNAs from all growth stages were sequenced and novel miRNAs involved in the process have been identified

 </sup> analysed 457 known and 13 novel miRNAs and showed differential expression of 141 known miRNAs between superior verses inferior spikelets with higher level of expression associated in most of the cases in the former than in the latter. The genes targeted by these differentially expressed miRNAs were linked to signalling pathways of plant hormone homeostasis and starch synthesis during the storage phase of grain development; precisely day 10 after anthesis and onwards. However, information is scant on the precise role of the miRNAs in genome dynamics regulating target mRNA expression for hormone homeostasis during early part of caryopsis development, when ethylene-induced endosperm morbidity underscores grain development of failing spikelets of rice panicle in spite of advancement of test of small RNA sequencing repeatability of rice

Early part of grain development period provides license for fixing the cell number of endosperm and ultimate size of grain at maturity

To understand the differential pattern of regulatory network that co-ordinates gene expression programs and finalize developmental plasticity for grain filling between the contrasting spikelet types, dynamic variation of the miRNAs controlling expression of target genes specific to ethylene or auxin pathways have been selected for exploration.

<p id="Par20">High salinity can severely affect the efficiency of photosynthesis due to decrease in photosynthetic pigments, decrease in unsaturation index, damaged photosynthetic system and ultimately reduction in the photosynthesis. Interestingly, in 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>, the expression of genes for the photosynthetic enzymes i.e
 <italic>.</italic> Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN40184_c0_g1_i1), and ferredoxin (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN34936_c0_g1_i4), were found to be up-regulated in response to high salt stress (Supplementary file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). High salinity also causes the degradation of photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll, and phycobilins. The expression of genes essential for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll pigment is down-regulated under the influence of salt stress. Remarkably, we observed that the expression of gene for the enzyme divinyl reductase (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN36240_c1_g1_i2) which converts 8-vinyl groups of different chlorophyll intermediates to ethyl groups was down-regulated with increasing salt stress. One more enzyme, Omega-6 fatty acid desaturase (
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>_DN40411_c2_g1_i3), which is involved in unsaturation of fatty acid of the chloroplastic membrane, was upregulated under salt stress.

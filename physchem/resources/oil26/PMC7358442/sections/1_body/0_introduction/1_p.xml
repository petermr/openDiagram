<p>Large mammals that reproduce slowly and are unable to move to more suitable surroundings require flexibility in behaviour and physiology to survive in rapidly changing environments (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding flexibility in activity patterns of mammals is crucial for predicting their resilience to climate change (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">McCain and King, 2014</xref>). Many mammals buffer the effects of increasing heat and aridity, occurring with climate change, by seeking cooler microclimates and reducing diurnal activity (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">McFarland et al., 2014</xref>). Those adjustments reduce the demand for water for evaporative cooling. If cooler microclimates are not available or if reduced diurnal activity compromises energy intake, diurnal species may increase their nocturnal activity (

progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that binding to ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we propose a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated for the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlated closely with the effectiveness of animal infection as determined by multiple experimental data sets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggest a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggests a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation, but also, more importantly, it proposes a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng",

SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that binding to ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we propose a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated for the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlated closely with the effectiveness of animal infection as determined by multiple experimental data sets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggest a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggests a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation, but also, more importantly, it proposes a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.", "Keywords": ["Binding affinity", "Intermediate host", "Sars-cov-2", "Zoonotic Origin", "Evoef2 Energy Unit"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7770890?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of proteome research", "authorinfo": ["Huang X", "Zhang C", "Pearce R", "Omenn GS", "Zhang Y"], "title": "Identifying the Zoonotic Origin of SARS-CoV-2 by Modeling the Binding Affinity between the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain and Host ACE2."}, "PMC6920383": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31852970", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31852970", "pmcid": "PMC6920383", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6920383"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-55917-x", "title": "Testing for consistency in the impacts of a burrowing ecosystem engineer on soil and vegetation characteristics across biomes.", "authorString": "Louw MA, Haussmann NS, le Roux PC.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Louw MA", "firstName": "M A", "lastName": "Louw", "initials": "MA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Private Bag X20, Hatfield, 0028, South Africa. michelleannelouw87@gmail.com."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cape Town, Private Bag X3, Rondebosch, 7701, South Africa. michelleannelouw87@gmail.com."}, {"affiliation": "Centre for Statistics in Ecology, Environment and Conservation, Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Cape Town, Private Bag X3, Rondebosch, 7701, South Africa. michelleannelouw87@gmail.com."}]}}, {"fullName": "Haussmann NS", "firstName": "N S", "lastName": "Haussmann", "initials": "NS", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Geography, Geoinformatics and Meteorology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Private Bag X20, Hatfield, 0028, South Africa."}}}, {"fullName": "le Roux PC", "firstName": "P C", "lastName": "le Roux", "initials": "PC", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7941-7444"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Private Bag X20, Hatfield, 0028, South Africa."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1746-0682"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7941-7444"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "supporting_data"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "2887502", "dateOfPublication": "2019 Dec", "monthOfPublication": "12", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "19355", "abstractText": "The impacts of ecosystem engineers may be expected to vary along environmental gradients.

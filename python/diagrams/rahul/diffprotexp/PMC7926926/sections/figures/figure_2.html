 <caption> ( a) Venn diagram representing differentially expressed proteins conserved between LB-04 vs. LB-0 and CK-04 vs. CK-0, ( b) Differential expression pattern of proteins conserved between LB-04 vs. LB-0 &amp; CK-04 vs. CK-0. Deep blue color shows lower intensity, and deep red color displays higher intensity. Different samples (LB-04/LB-0 and CK-04/CK-0) are represented as columns. </caption>

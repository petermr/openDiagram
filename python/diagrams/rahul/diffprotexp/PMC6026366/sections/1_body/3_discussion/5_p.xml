<p id="p0140">Oxidation impairs protein function as the proteins are unfolded leading to an increase in protein hydrophobicity. This often leads to the formation of toxic aggregates that interfere with normal cellular functions, which is a sign of the aging process and many age-related diseases. In this study, changes in the expression levels of HSP70 and UCHL1 (both up-regulated in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D.Â melanogaster</italic>) could be a response to general age-derived cellular alterations, such as increasing oxidative burden, accumulation of damaged proteins, and elevated protein synthesis. At the molecular level, to ensure survival, cells have developed antioxidants to counteract this oxidative damage accumulation 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It is wildly believed that HSP70 and UCHL1, which are responsible for the removal of damaged proteins, counteract the oxidative stress damage of proteins 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. HSP70 has also been shown to confer protection against the harmful effects of oxidative stress, as well as modulate the inflammatory status 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, the overexpression of HSP70 in mice muscle eliminated the age-related increase in posttranslational modifications of proteins

<p>Peptide spectra were prepared using in-gel digestion. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) was performed with a laser power of MS 5000 and MSMS 5500. A GPS software (ABI) was used for retrieval in NCBI database with the relative accuracy of MS 0.12 Da and MSMS 0.3 Da. The proteins that were scored &gt; 52 in differential expression were selected and the confidence level was set &gt; 95%[

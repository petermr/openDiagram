<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Doherty and de Magalh&#227;es, 2016</xref>). Here we: (1) trace the evolution of body size and lifespan in Eutherian mammals, with particular reference to Afrotherians; (2) infer changes in cancer susceptibility across Afrotherian lineages; (3) use a genome-wide screen to identify gene duplications in Afrotherian genomes, including multiple living and extinct Proboscideans; and (4) show that while duplication of genes with tumor suppressor functions is pervasive in Afrotherian genomes, Proboscidean gene duplicates are enriched in unique pathways with tumor suppressor functions.

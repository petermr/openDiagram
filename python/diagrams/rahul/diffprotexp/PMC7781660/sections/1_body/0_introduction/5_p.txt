0: Here, Illumina sequencing was employed to explore the different expression profiles of lncRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells for further investigating the roles of lncRNAs in BVDV infection and hostBVDV interaction.
1: The potential functions of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted by lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, which would provide a molecular biology basis for further understanding the roles of lncRNAs in hostBVDV interaction.

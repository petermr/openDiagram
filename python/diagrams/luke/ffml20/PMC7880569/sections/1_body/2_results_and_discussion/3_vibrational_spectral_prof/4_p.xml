<p>The resulting concentration profiles (

 </xref>b). Changes at larger humidity relate, in contrast, to a combination of a smaller change intercalation and binding to the external basal face and of a more dominant contribution from the condensation regime. Finally, we note that the desorption leg reveals a stronger hysteresis for AcidBir than in δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> in the 30–90% RH range. These results confirm that the hysteresis seen in the microgravimetric data (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>) is from condensed interparticle water, as little hysteresis was observed in the

<p>The recognition of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> conidia induces the expression of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines [10;11]. In line with previous results, we observed that the complete deficiency of the receptor was associated with decreased 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. The production of CXCL1, IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6 was decreased in the lungs of 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice at early stages on the infection (2 dpi). Time course pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in 
 <italic>Trem</italic>1
 <sup>+/+</sup> mice (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>). While pro-inflammatory cytokines and sTREM1 levels decreased at 3 dpi, the number of immune cell was still increasing (

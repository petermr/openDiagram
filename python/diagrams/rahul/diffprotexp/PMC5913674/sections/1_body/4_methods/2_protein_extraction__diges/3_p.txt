0: For TMT labeling, 35 mg of peptides per sample were used for each TMT label reaction.
1: Samples were labeled across 3 TMT 10-plex reactions (Thermo, San Jose, CA) using 0.14 mg of each reagent, with each of the 3 TMT 10-plex experiments containing MtzS and MtzR replicates of each of the 3 isolates (WB, 106, and 713).
2: Samples were incubated with labels for 1 hour at room temperature and then quenched with 5% hydroxylamine (Sigma Aldrich).
3: Each of the 10 labeled samples for each of the 3 TMT 10-plex experiments were combined, dried by vacuum centrifuge, reconstituted in 1% formic acid, and desalted on a 200-mg C18 SepPak (Waters, Massachusetts) prior to strong cation-exchange (SCX) fractionation as described previously [ 41].
4: A total of 10 pooled SCX fractions were desalted using SPE as before, dried down using a vacuum centrifuge, and reconstituted in 1% formic acid for nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS).

<p>A total of six DNA samples (three individuals per group) were sent for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to the Beijing Genomic Institute (BGI, Beijing, China). The library preparation was done according to the BGI standard directional WGBS pipeline. Genome fragmentation into 100–300 bp fragments was done by sonication. Bisulfite treatment was done with the EZ DNA methylation Gold Kit (ZYMO, Mexico City, Mexico). The WGBS consisted of a 150 bp paired-end sequencing with a genome coverage of 12× on a NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p>

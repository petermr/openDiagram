<p id="Par48">Whilst 813 differentially expressed transcripts were found in responders between baseline and 3 months, no significant differences in gene expression were identified between responders and non-responders at 3 months. This is likely due to power and inter-patient differences in baseline gene expression levels. We also tested for correlation between change in transcript abundance and change in DAS28 and sub-components in the good-responder subgroup (Additional file

 <italic>p</italic> values were observed; however, the sample size was small. These analyses are based on good- and poor-EULAR response. Future studies should extend this analysis to include patients across the full spectrum of response, including intermediate responders, and analyse continuous measures of response, including the DAS28 composite score and its sub-components, as secondary outcomes.

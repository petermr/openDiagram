<p>The morphology evolution of Li–B–Mg composite and pure Li after electrochemical cycling are characterized by SEM to further investigate the superior dendrite inhibition of Li–B–Mg composite and the results are presented in 
 <bold>Figure</bold>
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">
  <bold>6</bold>
 </xref>a. The first image in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a shows a relatively smooth and flat surface of the composite after 25 cycles cycled at 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with a fixed capacity of 0.5 mA h cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. This indicates that the 3D Li–B–Mg composite can successfully accommodate the electrochemically deposited Li. By contrast, a great deal of dendrites of several micrometers in diameter can be observed on the surface of Li foil (second row in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). These entangled dendrites grow randomly and form a porous layer on planar Li foil (Figure S8, Supporting Information). It has been reported that this porous layer would undoubtedly bring detrimental effect to Li
 <sup>+</sup> diffusion and contribute significantly to the generation of electrochemically “dead Li.”
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> The Li–B–Mg composite electrode also shows superior dendrite inhibition ability at increased cycle numbers and current density (the middle and right columns in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a).

<p>It is well known that prostaglandins play an essential role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems. COX inhibition and reduction of prostaglandin E production in mucosal dendritic cells, macrophages and monocytes, not only reduces the inflammatory effect of prostaglandin E, but also disrupts other immunoregulatory mechanisms [

All treatment groups demonstrated differences in the cell redox homeostasis and oxidative stress mostly in lung lesions, which is good evidence of the beneficial effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent on the redox status of cells in the site of the inflammation. It has been demonstrated that ibuprofen also acts independently of COX inhibition to disrupt signaling cascades leading to NOX2 activation, preventing oxidative damage in microglia [

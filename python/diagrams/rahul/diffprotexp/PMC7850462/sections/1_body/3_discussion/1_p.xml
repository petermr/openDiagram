<p>Sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized with detrimental host response to infection and may lead to life-threatening AKI when it occurs in the kidney. Diagnosis of septic AKI based on isolated urine output or SCr confers differential risk of the same staged AKI and both the two diagnosis standards have their limitations [

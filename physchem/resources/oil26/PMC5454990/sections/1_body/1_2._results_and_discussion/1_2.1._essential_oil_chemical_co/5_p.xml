<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The EO of <italic>O. cujumary</italic> leaves (<bold>Cuj-L</bold>) was rich in &#946;-caryophyllene (22.2%) and caryophyllene oxide (12.4%), followed by 2-tridecanone (7.3%) and &#948;-cadinene (6.6%). However, the EO of the branches (<bold>Cuj-B</bold>) was dominated by 2-tridecanone (30.0%), limonene (20.5%), and &#946;-caryophyllene (8.1%). The occurrence of fatty acid derivatives such as 2-tridecanone in Lauraceae species is not very common. However, &#946;-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and &#948;-cadinene were the main compounds of the EO oil from leaves of <italic>Cryptocarya mandioccana</italic> [<xref rid="B27-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

<p id="Par27">Burrowing mammals are known to affect vegetation composition in a variety of vegetation types and under diverse climatic conditions. For example, different plant communities exist at burrows relative to undisturbed areas in temperate forests

 </sup>. In this study, burrowing affected species composition strongly in the arid scrubland, with a weaker impact on species composition in the mesic grassland. The strong impact of burrowing on vegetation composition in the arid scrubland is probably due to burrow entrances being largely unvegetated (and not due to turnover in species composition). However, burrowing does not always affect vegetation composition

 </sup>, and in the semi-arid site vegetation composition was similar at burrows and in undisturbed areas. Therefore, similar to its impacts on species richness, burrowing did not have a consistent effect on species composition across the three environments.

0: S.  pasteurii can produce urease, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbonate ions and ammonium, and the resulting carbonate ions can react with extracellular calcium ions to form calcium carbonate precipitation [ 1,  13].
1: Although this mineralization has been used in a variety of applications, it still has some limitations, including its adaptability to different environmental conditions, uncontrolled bacterial growth or urease activity, instability in large-scale engineering, and the requirement of higher costs than chemical and conventional methods.

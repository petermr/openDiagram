<p id="Par48">Our novel findings suggest that AS6 at concentrations below 1 μM shows distinctive cytotoxicity and gene regulation profiles in a normal mammary epithelial and MCF7 cells: non-toxic and subtle changes in gene regulation in HUMEC but toxic and devastating alterations in gene regulation in MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). The genomics data presented here suggest the mechanisms by which AS6 functions to suppress the proliferation of MCF7 cells. AS6 signaling obstructs the transcription of DNA repair enzymes whose function is crucial for homology-directed DNA double strand break repair. The genome becomes unstable, and this instability triggers the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,B). In addition, AS6 provokes cell stress responses that promote apoptosis in MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). By contrast, the primary mammary epithelial cells show much greater resilience to AS6 at these same concentrations, in terms of the cellular stress level, cell growth, and the number of AS6-affected genes and -pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Therefore, we propose that AS6 below 1 μM induces cytotoxicity and derailed gene expression leading to cellular apoptosis in MCF7 cells, and potentially in malignant breast cancer cells, with milder impacts on surrounding normal breast cells.

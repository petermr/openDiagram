<p>In addition to microbial gene expression, metaproteomics can also measure host gene expression helping to infer hostâ€“microbiome interactions that underlie disease. Having both host and microbial gene expression data enables researchers to test for correlations between gene expression in the host and microbiome. Recently, Pathak and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] used metaproteomics to identify the gene expression responses of pathogens and the host during ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). They identified 66 unique pathogen peptides using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and endotracheal aspirate (ETA) specimens. In addition, they identified more than 3,000 human proteins in ETA, many of them associated with innate and adaptive immunity. These findings may guide future research in VAP diagnosis and antibiotic treatment alignment with specific pathogens. Using a similar metaproteomic approach, researchers proposed a set of bacterial and human proteins of the oral biofilm that allows the differentiation between healthy and caries-bearing individuals. The same authors also proposed that these findings may help in the development of personalized medicine in the prevention of tooth decay [

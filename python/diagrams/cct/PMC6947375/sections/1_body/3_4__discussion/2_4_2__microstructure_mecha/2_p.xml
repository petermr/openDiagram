<p>Mechanical properties of pearlitic steels were mainly affected by its microstructure, including the size of pearlite colonies and the thickness and spacing of cementite lamellae [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, these microstructural parameters were dominated by the chemical composition of the steel and the history of working and heat treatments [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The different mechanical properties were because of different sizes of ferritic grains and cementite particles in each steel. As far as the spheroidized steel is concerned, mechanical properties are determined by the sizes of ferrite grain and cementite particles, as well as the misorientation angle of ferritic grain boundaries and the distribution of cementite particles [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Cold deformation led to work hardening by introducing a large number of low-angle grain boundaries. Meanwhile, a few cementite particles dissolved, coarsened, and combined during cold working. After heat treatment, the size of cementite particles decreased and became uniform, but the ferritic grains became coarser. The microstructures consisted of spherical submicron-sized cementite, which was dispersedly distributed in the ferritic matrix. This led to a good match between strength and plasticity [

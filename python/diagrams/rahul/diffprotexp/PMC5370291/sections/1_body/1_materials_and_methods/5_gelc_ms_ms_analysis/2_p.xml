<p>Extracted peptides were separated using an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Dionex LC-Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with a 20 cm x 75 μm i.d. fused silica column custom packed with 3 μm 120 Å ReproSil Pur C18 aqua (Dr. Maisch, GMBH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). After injection, peptides were trapped at 30 μL/min on a 5 mm x 300 μm i.d. Pepmap C18 cartridge (Dionex-LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at 2% buffer B (buffer A, 0.05% formic acid in distilled water); buffer B, 80% ACN and 0.05% formic acid in MQ) and separated at 300 nL/min in a 10-40% buffer B gradient in 60 min. Eluting peptides were ionized at 1.7 kV in a Nano made Triversa Chip-based nanospray source using a Triversa LC coupler (Advion, Ithaca, NJ). Intact peptide mass spectra and fragmentation spectra were acquired on an LTQ FT hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). Intact masses were measured at a resolution of 50,000 in the ICR cell using a target value of 1 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> charges. In parallel, following an FT prescan, the top 5 peptide signals (charge-states 2+ and higher) were submitted to MS/MS in the linear ion trap (3 amu isolation width, 30-millisecond activation, 35% normalized activation energy, Q-value of 0.25 and a threshold of 5000 counts). Dynamic exclusion was applied to a repeat count of 1 and an exclusion time of 30 sec.

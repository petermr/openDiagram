<p>The present study recruited 13 patients from the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, between February 2016 and December 2018, including six males and seven females. The 13 patients were divided into two groups: Six patients aged 29-49 years in the normal group (NC), and seven patients aged 67-82 years in the knee osteoarthritis group (OA; average age 38.17±7.70 vs. 71.71±6.02 years). The NC group was made up of young patients with amputations without joint disease. Inclusion criteria for the NC group were as follows: i) No history of joint lesions; and ii) lower limb injury treated with amputation. All patients in the OA group were patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent total knee arthroplasty. The inclusion criteria for the OA group were as follows: i) Diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis based on clinical manifestations, combined with X-ray examination, knee pain and severely affected quality of life, with failure of conventional oral drug therapy; ii) patients with primary total knee arthroplasty; iii) knee flexion malformation &lt;15˚, varus deformity &lt;15˚ or valgus deformity &lt;15˚; and iv) Kellgren Lawrence III-IV level (

<p>CFH and MBL2 were in the complement protein-associated part of the network. Complement proteins, similar to the defense and clearance systems, serve an important role in the innate immune system. Pathogens activate the main complement protein C3 via one of the classical complement proteins, such as lectin, or alternative pathways to form C3b. The process is regulated to avoid excessive C3b production, which damages host cells, or a C3b deficiency, which induces an immune-compromised state via the main regulatory complement factor CFH (

MBL2 is a macromolecule that contains sugar-binding lectin and collagenous domains, and forms MBL-associated serine proteases to cleave complement proteins C2 and C4. The complex process is also known as the MBL pathway. A reduced level of MBL is associated with increased bacterial or viral infections in children, and MBL is known to serve a dual role in KD. Within children &lt;1-year-old, MBL may be associated with the resistance of infections, and in older children, MBL may be associated with endothelial damage (

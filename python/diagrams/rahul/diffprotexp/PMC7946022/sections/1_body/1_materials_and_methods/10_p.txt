0: In vitro evaluation of eDNA accumulation in single- and mixed-species biofilms .
1: 24 hr-preformed single and mixed-species biofilms were grown as described above using 6-well microtiter plates and eDNA was quantified as previously described with modifications [ 48].
2: Briefly, biofilm supernatant was aspirated and formed biofilms were harvested by scraping and resuspended in 1 ml PBS.
3: Suspensions were centrifuged for 10 mins at 5000 g to separate cells and the soluble biofilm matrix and the recovered supernatant was filtered using 0.22 m Millex syringe filters.
4: The amount of eDNA was quantified using the QuantiFluor dsDNA System kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as per manufacturers instructions.
5: Fluorescence was measured at 504 nm/531 nm (Ex/Em) in triplicates per sample in flat-bottom black-sides 96-well plates (Greiner, Kremsmunster, Austria) using Biotek Cytation 5 plate reader.

<p>Pituitary tumor samples were collected during transsphenoidal surgery and fixed in formalin for routine diagnostic procedures, including immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evaluation. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 48 patients, including 28 samples from patients with Cushing’s disease and 20 samples from patients with SCA from years 2013–2017, were included. Patients were diagnosed according to WHO criteria applied during the time of tissue sampling [

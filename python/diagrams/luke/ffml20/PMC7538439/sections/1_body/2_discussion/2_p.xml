<p id="Par34">The simulations reproduce the equilibrium temperature–pressure phase diagram for molecular phases (I, II, III, and melt, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 160 GPa). The maximum in the melt curve in hydrogen is highly counterintuitive—it requires that the liquid is denser than the hexagonal close-packed solid. By detailed simulation we resolve this by showing that certain molecular orientations (e.g. X) allow the molecules to approach more closely, while others (e.g. T) have lower quadrupole energy. By monitoring an order parameter corresponding to the quadrupolar interactions find that, at high pressures, Phase I develops intermolecular correlations which lower the energy, while the liquid has correlation which lower the volume.

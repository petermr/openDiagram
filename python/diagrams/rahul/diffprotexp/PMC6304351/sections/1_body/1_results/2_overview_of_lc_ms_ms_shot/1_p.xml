<p>12 LC-MS/MS runs were performed consisting of four independent biological replicates of three treatments [medium-chain alkane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub>), long-chain alkane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>), non-hydrocarbon control (Tween 80)] resulting in 191647 spectral counts that were assigned to 1792 proteins, representing 50% of the total protein-coding genes on the 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> MIL-1 genome (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>). Almost half (49%) of the spectral counts were assigned to the 100 most abundantly detected proteins and 83% were assigned to the 500 most abundant proteins. The remaining 1292 proteins (representing 17% of spectral counts) were detected with low spectral counts and many not across all biological replicates.

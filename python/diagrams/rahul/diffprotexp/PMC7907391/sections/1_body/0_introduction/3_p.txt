0: COVID-19 can range from asymptomatic and mild disease in most cases (~ 80%) to severe respiratory dysfunction and critical multi-organ failure (~ 20%), with an overall fatality rate of 23% 18.
1: COVID-19 can progress in patients through three stages, beginning with an initial 2- to 14-day incubation period, with or without detectable virus, during which time asymptomatic transmission can occur.
2: The second stage consists of a non-severe symptomatic period with detectable levels of virus 19.
3: Symptoms can be more evident, characterized by fever, fatigue, cough and shortness of breath, with many patients developing lymphopenia and pneumonia 9,  18.
4: Initially, effective restriction of severe disease progression by the host relies primarily on innate immunity and the type I interferon (IFN) response that can be triggered by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition 18.
5: Type I IFN robustly activates antiviral defense via over 200 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) 20, MX dynamin like GTPase 1 (MX1) 21, tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) 22, and SAM and HD domain containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase 1 (SAMHD1) 23,  24, which suppress viral replication and/or spread, thereby promoting clearance of infected cells 18,  25,  26.
6: In contrast, the virus expresses proteins that can delay or inhibit the early type I IFN response.
7: Deregulation of innate immunity can lead to a hyperinflammatory response with over-production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF- 18.
8: Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to type I IFN pre-treatment  in vitro27,  28; however, it is found to produce low type I and III IFN responses in vivo in ferrets and COVID-19 patients 28.
9: COVID-19 patients exhibit increased production of neutrophils, increased levels of serum IL-6, C-reactive protein, and decreased numbers of lymphocytes, correlating with more severe disease requiring intensive care 12,  14,  18.
10: Cytokine storm induction is thought to drive disease progression into stage three, severe respiratory disease with viral sepsis, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and potentially multi-organ failure leading to death 18,  19.

<p id="Par30">Despite the high Mn and Si content, these elements remained in inside the grain rather than becoming segregated at the boundaries. The Auger analysis technology has an atomic detection limit of a single atomic layer (atom percentage of 1/1000). Therefore, if the concentration of elements involved in surface segregation is higher than the detection limit there will be a signal. On the contrary, if the concentration is below the detection limit, no information is obtained from the analysis. The average boundary levels of S in martensite and bainite are âˆ¼1.6 at% and 1.1 at% respectively. Barrett

 </sup> reported that S promotes the formation of non-metallic inclusions and intergranular fracture in Cr-Mo steel, and is more effective than P in inducing embrittlement. S segregation occurs preferentially in correspondence of the high-energy boundaries, such as the prior austenite grain boundaries. Therefore, differences between the segregation of S in tempered martensite and tempered bainite result mainly from the different portions of high-energy random boundaries at the packet boundaries. The level of S segregation in martensite is significantly higher than that in bainite and, hence, martensite will be more susceptible to temper embrittlement.

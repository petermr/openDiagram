0: We analyzed 598 newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) samples from the CoMMpass dataset which contains whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq data that were uniformly processed.
1: Figure 1 shows a CONSORT flow diagram of the breakdown of available samples for the four different analyses performed on the data.
2: WES data were analyzed for mutations using a previously described pipeline.
3: 1,  19 RNA-seq data was analyzed using a pipeline that included the transcript aligner STAR 20 (v2.5.1b).
4: Salmon 21 (v0.7.2) was used to align reads to the transcriptome and quantify expression at the gene and transcript level.

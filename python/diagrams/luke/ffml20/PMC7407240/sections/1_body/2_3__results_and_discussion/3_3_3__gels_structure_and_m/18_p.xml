<p>Gentamicin sulfate, due to the presence of the -NH
 <sub>2</sub> groups (δ+) determines the second-highest crosslinking density among the drug-loaded hydrogels (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-01544-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Due to its large hydrodynamic radius, this molecule is less efficiently embedded in the polymer phase than tetracycline hydrochloride, being distributed mainly in the PVA-rich phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-01544-f010">Figure 10</xref>c). Since the mesh size of PVA is comparable to the hydrodynamic radius of gentamicin sulfate, this could explain the lowest release rate of this drug for all experimental instances studied in this paper. This molecule could act as a “plug”, reducing water the water uptake and swelling of the hydrogel. Amoxicillin, due to its lowest hydrodynamic radius can penetrate more efficiently into the polymer phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-01544-f010">Figure 10</xref>d). Due to the ionized (dissociated) carboxyl groups (δ−), amoxicillin promotes the highest spacer effect, repelling the carrageenan molecules, determining the lowest crosslinking density, and the highest water uptake at equilibrium among the drug-loaded hydrogels.

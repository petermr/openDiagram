<p>R package “Seurat” v3.1.2 was used for data pre-processing, and parameters were set and adjusted according to the features of captured transcripts in each sample. Doublets were examined by DoubletFinder v2.0.3 with its default threshold value of 0.075 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>. Meanwhile, a double-check for every type was executed to discard cells with abnormal gene expression (for example, cells that were over-high in a number of unique detected genes, or cells within a single-cell type but with highly expressed specific marker genes in other cell types). The four objects were integrated via “Anchors” (an integration strategy between single-cell datasets for identification of cell pairwise correspondences and constructing atlases into their shared space) 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>; through normalization, datasets scaling, and test for optimal parameter combinations of “dim.use” and “resolution”, clustering was generated with a series commands of “FindNeighbors”, “FindClusters”, and “RunUMAP”. In addition, the “FindAllMarkers” function was applied to identify marker genes in clusters, while gene differential expression analysis was performed with default parameters; the significantly expressed genes (DEGs) were defined with |avg_logFC| &gt; 0.25 and “p_val_adj” &lt; 0.01.

<p id="par0085">The control and HS-treated leaves were used for the extraction, purification and activity assay of MAPK using ADP-Glo™ Kinase assay kit (Promega, USA). In brief, sample was extracted in 40 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and further, 20 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 0.1 mg/mL BSA was added in the reaction mixture. The un-consumed ATP in the reaction mixture was depleted by adding 5 μL of ADP-Glo™reagent leaving only ADP. The RM was incubated at 25℃ for 40 min. followed by addition of 10 μL of Kinase Detection Reagent in order to convert ADP to ATP. The ATP was quantified using the luciferase - luciferin system. A standard curve was prepared based on the comparison between% ATP to ADP conversion and relative light unit (RLU). The kinase assay was calculated as μmol/min/ mg of proteins. The activity assay of recombinant MAPK protein was carried out by using diluted protein (1:50) and other steps were followed as mentioned above. The recombinant protein was exposed to HS (C - 22 ± 3℃, T
 <sub>1</sub> - 32℃, 2 h, T
 <sub>2</sub> - 38℃, 2 h). We also used denatured (DN) recombinant MAPK protein as negative control. Total soluble protein was estimated using the Bradford method [

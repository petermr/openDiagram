<p id="Par16">Morphological traits were evaluated at maturity for two durum wheat genotypes across treatment groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In DBA Artemis, plant height was significantly reduced under water-deficit stress in the progeny from the control parents, but did not have significant impact on the progeny from the stressed parents. However, both control and stressed progeny from the stressed parents exhibited significantly lower plant height compared with the control progeny from the control parents. Interestingly, in DBA Artemis, the control progeny from the stressed parents had the highest tiller number and fertile tiller number among all groups. Both tiller number and fertile tiller number were significantly reduced under water-deficit stress for the progeny from the stressed parents (AtWW vs AtWC), but showed no significant difference to that of both control and stressed progeny from the control group (AtWW vs AtCC, AtWW vs AtCW). No significant difference was detected for main spike length across treatment groups for both genotypes. For DBA Aurora, there was also no significant difference detected for plant height. Tiller number and fertile tiller number exhibited the same trend where significant reductions were observed between control and stressed progeny from the same parents.

<p>FSEC experiments confirmed the association of PcATP2 with PcCdc50B, as well as the stability of this complex in DDM/CHS detergent micelles (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Our data also suggested that the cholesterol analog CHS is important to stabilize this complex since its presence highly improved the yield of co-solubilization of PcATP2 and PcCdc50B with DDM (Figure supplement 3). In the recent cryo-EM structure of the human ATP8A1 in complex with Cdc50A, a CHS molecule was found at the heterodimer interface between TMs 7 and 10 of ATP8A1 and TM2 of Cdc50A, suggesting a potential role of CHS on preserving the heterodimer [

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites cannot synthesize

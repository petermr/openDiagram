<p>In order to prove that LINC00466 could regulate cell biological functions by binding to miR-137, we divided cell lines into 3 treatment groups (oe-NC+miR-NC, oe-NC+miR-mimic, oe-LINC00466+miR-mimic). As revealed by CCK8 assay, overexpressing miR-137 resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability, while such effect was significantly reversed when miR-137 and LINC00466 were simultaneously overexpressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4A</xref>). In terms of cell migration and invasion abilities, they were considerably decreased after overexpression of miR-137, while their abilities were revised when miR-137 and LINC00466 were simultaneously overexpressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">C</xref>). Finally, we tested the effects of miR-137 on LINC00466-attenuated glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ treatment. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4D</xref>, down-regulation of miR-137 expression significantly influenced LINC00466-mediated glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4D</xref>). Collectively, these findings illustrated that LINC00466 might regulated glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and sensitivity to TMZ by binding to miR-137.

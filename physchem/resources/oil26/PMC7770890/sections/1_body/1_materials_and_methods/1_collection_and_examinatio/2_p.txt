0: Among the 321 ACE2 orthologs, 30 sequences had one or more amino acids that were either nonstandard or incorrectly parsed, i.e., annotated as X, and thus these ACE2 orthologs were excluded from the detailed analysis ( Supplementary Table S1).
1: Moreover, sequence alignment analysis (see below) showed that the ACE2 proteins of six species had five or more missing S-RBD binding residues ( Supplementary Table S2), i.e.,  Acanthisitta chloris (protein accession ID: XP_009082150.1),  Apteryx mantelli mantelli (XP_013805736.1),  Salmo salar (XP_014062928.1),  Rhinopithecus bieti (XP_017744069.1),  Leptonychotes weddellii (XP_030886750.1), and  Petromyzon marinus (XP_032835032.1).
2: Subsequent binding analysis (see below) showed that these ACE2 receptors had a much higher binding energy (and thus a lower binding capability) than the others ( Supplementary Table S2), partly because of the incomplete binding interface.
3: Therefore, we cannot suggest whether these animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 based on the defective information.

<p>To determine if the decrease in progenitor markers might coincide with decreased proliferation, we next labeled cells undergoing proliferation, using the marker KI67 (any stage of cell proliferation) and the Phospho Histone 3 (PH3) marker, which labels a subset of cycling cells in mitosis (M) phase (

Analysis of KI67+ and PH3+ cells showed reduced numbers of labeled cells along with a qualitative reduction in numbers and ectopic positioning of postmitotic intermediate progenitor cells in the MIA group (TBR2+). Reduction in Ki67+ cells was observed in several regions of the developing cortex, including zones defined as S1 and S1DZ (

Quantification of Ki67+ cells and PH3+ cells in the neocortex confirmed the MIA-induced reduction in progenitor and mitotic populations at E17.5 (Ki67, p=0.0198; PH3, p=0.0003, two tailed Studentâ€™s t-test). The ratio of PH3+ (mitosis) cells to Ki67+ (all stages of cell division) cells was then used to determine whether cell cycle kinetics or the number of actively dividing cells in M phase was different in the MIA-exposed group. Ki67/PH3 ratios indicated a reduced proportion of progenitor cells in M phase in MIA brains at this specific time-point (p=0.0005 Chi-squared) (

These results provide evidence that the reduced proliferation signatures following MIA that were observed in the transcriptomic profiles are associated with changes at the protein level. Moreover, within the reduced progenitor cell populations at E17.5, the number of cells in the mitosis stage of the cell cycle are decreased to a greater extent.

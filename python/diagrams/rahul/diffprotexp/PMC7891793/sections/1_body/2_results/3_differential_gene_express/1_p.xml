<p>When lung lesion (LL) samples were compared across treatment groups in all combinations, only one gene was differentially expressed in the group 3 (placebo) vs group 2 (Ibuprofen day 5–10) comparison (ENSBTAG00000025952, no gene name (odorant-binding protein [Source: NCBI gene;Acc:785083]), two genes were differentially expressed in the comparison of group 5 (FPI and Ibuprofen day 5–10) vs group 2 (ENSBTAG00000025952 and CCDC113) and 94 genes were differentially expressed in lung lesion samples in the comparison between group 6 (FPI and Ibuprofen day 3–10) and group 2. Enrichment analysis in this set of genes revealed 21 enriched GO terms with p&lt;0.05 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246695.s005">S3 File</xref>, analysis was performed with GO term redundancy reduction by merging GO terms with 50% of overlap). Among them, 12 GO terms deserve special attention, because they were mapped into a network of functionally associated terms with multiple shared genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246695.g005">Fig 5</xref>). All these terms are related to cilia formation, assembly, structure, motility and regulation. Interestingly, in lung without lesions (LN), among all treatment groups comparison combinations only comparison of Gr 6 vs Gr 2 showed 12 differentially expressed genes, but these were different from the set of genes in lung lesions (LL). GO enrichment functional analysis revealed a group of 5 GO terms (with adjusted p&lt;0.05) combined into a strong network with shared genes and all the terms were related to chromosome structure and functioning (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246695.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). After the fusion of redundant terms by ClueGo they formed 2 terms: “metaphase plate congression” and “condensed chromosome kinetochore”. Another group of involved genes, separate from this group term, was “basement membrane”.

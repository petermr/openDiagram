<p>In recent years, LINC00466 has been found to be highly expressed in lung squamous cell carcinoma,

 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and lung adenocarcinoma.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In lung adenocarcinoma, Ma et al reported that the expression of LINC00466 in cancer tissues and cell lines was significantly higher than that in the corresponding adjacent normal tissues and normal bronchial epithelial cell lines.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the expressive status of LINC00466 in glioma is lack. The experiments of our study first showed that the expression of LINC00466 in glioma tissues and cell lines was significantly increased compared with adjacent normal tissue pairs and normal human brain astrocyte cell lines, which was consistent with the status of LINC00466 in other cancers. For clinical significance of LINC00466, it was significantly associated with clinical stage in lung cancer.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The relationship between LINC00466 expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed. We found LINC00466 expression level was significantly increased in WHO grade (III–IV) compared with WHO grade (I–II) of glioma samples. These studies consistently suggest that overexpression of LINC00466 may serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis of glioma patients.

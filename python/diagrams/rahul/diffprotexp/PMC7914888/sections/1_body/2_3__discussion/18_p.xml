<p>Pigmented and unpigmented B16 melanoma cells present an expected decrease in cell proliferation. It is possible to suggest that miRNAs share, through their potential targets, a reciprocal and coordinated regulation on the cell cycleâ€™s control dependent on the expression level of the specific group of miRNAs, without ignoring the possible differential effect that the regulation of each of them would exert.</p>

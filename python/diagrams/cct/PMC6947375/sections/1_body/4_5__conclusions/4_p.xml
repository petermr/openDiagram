<p>(3) EBSD study showed that the frequency of LAGBs after cold drawing significantly increased to ~90%. The presence of these LAGBs was beneficial to the diffusion of elements, such as carbon and chromium, accelerating the coarsening of cementite. The dissolution and coarsening of cementite particles occurred simultaneously during cold working. The decreasing interface energy actuated the coarsening of cementite particles, while the LAGBs and high density of dislocations played a key role in the element diffusion.</p>

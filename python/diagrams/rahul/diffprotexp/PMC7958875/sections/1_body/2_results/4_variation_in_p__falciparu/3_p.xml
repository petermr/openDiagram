<p>We next asked if parasites showed differential expression based on their host’s mating status or antibiotic treatment. We included the proportion of ookinetes as a covariate in the design to correct for differences in expression that were a result of different cell-type ratios. We identified 2 genes differentially expressed based on mating status and 24 differentially expressed based on antibiotic treatment (FDR &lt; 0.05) (

These included PF3D7_1216600 (CelTOS), and PF3D7_1449000 (GEST, gamete egress and sporozoite traversal protein) and PF3D7_1030900 (P28), which were all upregulated in untreated individuals (

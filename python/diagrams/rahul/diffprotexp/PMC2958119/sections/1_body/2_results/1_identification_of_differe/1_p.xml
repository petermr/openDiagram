<p>In order to investigate the involvement of critical primary proteins as well as to establish their influences in caste differentiation at an early post embryonic stage, proteomic profiles of queen and worker larvae were compared at 72 and 120 hours using 2-DE gels. In summary, a total of 288 and 259 protein spots were detected at 72 hours, and 274 and 236 protein spots at 120 hours in queen and worker larvae, respectively. Among these proteins, 59 spots at 72 hours and 51 spots at 120 hours were reproducibly detected with expression changing more than 2 fold between the two castes (

Furthermore, at 72 hours 40 protein spots (worker 18 and queen 22) and at 120 hours 41 protein spots (worker 22 and queen 19) were successfully identified by MALDI TOF/MS for the queen and worker larvae, respectively. From all the identified proteins at 72 hours, 15 were upregulated in the worker larvae and 12 in the queen larvae, and likewise, at 120 hours 14 proteins were upregulated in the worker larvae and 19 in the queen larvae (

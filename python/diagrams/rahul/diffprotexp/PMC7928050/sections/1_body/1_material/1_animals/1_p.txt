0: We used a total of 22 female C57BL/6 N mice, with an average age of all animals of 11.7 (1.4) weeks, mean weight was 21.8 (1.4)g. SWAT specimen of 4 animals were used before transplantation for RNA analysis.
1: All remaining animals (N = 18) had an autologous fat transplantation into a dorsal skinfold chamber as described previously[ 9].
2: Mean fat transplant weight was 0.01 (0.01)g. Randomized 9 animals were euthanized via cervical dislocation 7 days after transplantation and tissue samples were used for RNA analysis.
3: The remaining 9 animals were euthanized 15 days after transplantation, and transplanted adipose tissue was collected for RNA-analysis.

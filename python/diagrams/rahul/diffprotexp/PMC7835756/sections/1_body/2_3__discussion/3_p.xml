<p>It is pointed out that the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> can induce stress tolerance in plants when applied exogenously, and due to several redox-sensitive genes are involved in stress acclimation [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, recent evidence indicates a close relationship between the ROS regulation and the epigenetic regulation in a negative association. In several studies has been suggested that ROS accumulation causes DNA hypomethylation [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Our data agree with these assumptions, considering that most DmCs were hypomethylated. It suggested that the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> overproduction provokes a new methylation status in the genome, according to the necessities of the system to reach a balance. Due to this, the functional linkages pointed out by the GO analysis categories were photosynthesis and energy metabolism as the most affected by the DmCs on genes in response to the overproduction of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Some genes identified that also exhibited an up-regulation in DEG were associated with proton transport, as the V-type proton ATPase and the ABC transporter-like. These data corroborate that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2,</sub> as part of the ROS balance, plays a crucial role in the physiological adaptation of plants, such that the plant under continuous oxidative stress has reached a balanced state where the ROS metabolism has been adjusted through the respiration and energy processes.

0: Toxicity of garlic essential oil and commercially obtained diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide at the calculated LC 50 and LC 90 concentrations were compared.
1: Distilled water was used as a control.
2: The LC 50 and LC 90 of each compound were applied in larvae, pupae, and adults of  T. molitor.
3: Insects were individualized in Petri dishes with wheat bran and sugarcane.
4: A total of 240 larvae, 240 pupae, and 240 adults were used for each treatment, with a total of four replicates.
5: Mortality was recorded every 6 h for 48 h, and estimated lethal time values for 50% mortality (LT 50) were compared.

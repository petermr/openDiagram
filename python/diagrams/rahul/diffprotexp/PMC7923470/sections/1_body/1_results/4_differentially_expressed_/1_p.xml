 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hence, it is important to check if the expression of GA biosynthesis pathway-related genes were differentially modulated between WT and MT. We found that an N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic protein gpi1-like (gibberellin-regulated protein 6) (
 <italic>Ma06_g04390</italic>) was highly up-regulated in MT as compared to WT. We also observed a probable 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (
 <italic>Ma07_g15430</italic>) which was up-regulated in MT. Owing to cross-talk between BR and GAs, we looked for expression of related genes in our DEGs and observed the up-regulation of two BRI genes (gene-
 <italic>C4D60_Mb10t18040</italic> and 
 <italic>Ma10_g11870</italic>). Because LOB domain-containing genes are targeted by DELLAs, the decrease in the expression of one LOB domain-containing gene was differentially expressed [

 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb07t13750</italic>) and one TCP (
 <italic>Ma03_g32580</italic>). Among the highly expressed genes in MT, the increase in the expression of two interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 genes (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb08t19920</italic> and 
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb10t14420</italic>) with fold change values of 172.317 and 93.8, respectively, is an important observation. Previously it is known that plant stature-related receptor-like kinase 2 (PSRK2) acts as a factor that determines stem elongation toward gibberellins response in rice [

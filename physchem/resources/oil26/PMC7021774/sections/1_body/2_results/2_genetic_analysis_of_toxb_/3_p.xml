<p id="Par19">Investigation of the haplotypes defined by the 12 SNPs genotyped across the peak of the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus in the AM panel allowed a condensed five-SNP haplotype across the region to be determined (Supplementary Table 4). This defined 10 haplotypes, six of which were associated with low ToxB sensitivity (the ‘group 1’ haplotypes: 1.1 to 1.6) and four with high sensitivity (the ‘group 2’ haplotypes: 2.1 to 2.4), with the differences in ToxB sensitivity between these two haplotype groups found to be highly significant (Welch two sample 
 <italic>t</italic>-test: 
 <italic>t</italic> = 25.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> ~ 0) (Supplementary Figure 1). Additionally, clear recombinations proximal (haplotype 2.2) and distal (haplotypes 2.3 and 2.4) to 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> delimited the target region to a 1921-kb region between 231.063 Mbp (TraesCS2B01G046400) and 250.180 Mbp (TraesCS2B01G051000) in the AM panel. All three of the most significant SNPs identified by GWAS (−log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> = 52.63; BS00070050_51, BS00072620_51 and BS00075303_51) originated from gene model TraesCS2B01G048500, and all three cosegregate on the ‘NIAB Elite MAGIC’ genetic map at 34.38 cM. Additionally, BS00070050_51 was also identified as the marker immediately proximal to the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> QTL peak in the MAGIC IM and CIM analyses. In the AM panel, this SNP perfectly predicts sensitivity to ToxB, with alleles A:A and G:G diagnostic for sensitivity (score ≥ 1) and insensitivity (score ≤ 0.6), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Supplementary Table 2). When GWAS was repeated using the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic>-lined marker BS00070050_51 as a cofactor, no additional significant associations were found.

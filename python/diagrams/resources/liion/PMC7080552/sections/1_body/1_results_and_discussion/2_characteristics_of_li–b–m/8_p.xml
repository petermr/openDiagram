<p>To further elaborate the effect of Mg, the Li–B composite was synthesized without adding Mg during the preparation process. The component contents of Li–B alloy are 74 wt.% Li and 26 wt.% B. The obtained Li–B alloy is consisted of two phases of LiB compound and free Li according to XRD patterns in Figure S4a (Supporting Information). The practical available capacity of the prepared Li–B anode (below 0.1 V) is calculated to be 1890.4 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> based on the whole composite, which is a little higher than that of Li–B–Mg composite. After the free Li stripped (A stage marked in Figure S4b in the Supporting Information), the morphology of Li–B compound was shown in Figure S4c (Supporting Information). Compared with Li–B–Mg composite, the surface of LiB fibers is smoother with less adhesion after the free Li stripped (D stage) in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d. It demonstrates that after free Li stripped from Li–B–Mg, the remaining Li‐deficient Li(Mg) alloy helps connect LiB fibers to stabilize the whole skeleton. This is one of the advantage of addition of Mg.

<p>An online SCX-RPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify the proteins in the perfusates from the model and control rats. Five technical replicate analyses were conducted for each pooled perfusate sample. Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S2 lists proteins numbers and total spectral counts identified in each replicate analysis, with probabilities &gt;0.9, as calculated by ProteinProphet. The average numbers of proteins identified in the model and control perfusates mixture were 771 and 674, respectively. The average of the total spectral counts identified in the model perfusate mixture was 16,222, which was slightly less than the 19,241 total spectral counts identified in the control perfusate mixture. Considering this inconsistency, spectral count weights were used to estimate the relative protein abundances in the perfusates.

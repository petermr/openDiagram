<p>The present work, represent for the first time the co-loading of loratadine and sulpiride into nanoemulsion for nasal delivery as a new approach with enhanced therapeutic effect for the management of allergic rhinitis. Lecithin based nanoemulsions of combined loratadine and sulpiride were formulated. The developed nanoemulsions were investigated for inÂ vitro characterization. Biological studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the selected formulation in ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis rabbit models.</p>

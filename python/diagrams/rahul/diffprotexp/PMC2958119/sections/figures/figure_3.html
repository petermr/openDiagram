 <caption> Functional distributions of the identified proteins from queen and worker larvae at 120 hours (Q 120 h and W 120 h) of developmental stage. The percentage of each functional group was obtained based on the calculated absolute number of proteins under each functional group subtracted from the totally number of identified proteins at 120 hours ( table S4). </caption>

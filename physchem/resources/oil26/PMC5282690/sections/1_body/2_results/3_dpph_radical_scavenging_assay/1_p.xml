<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The radical scavenging activity of AcEO against DPPH radical increased significantly in dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>); the EC<sub>50</sub> values calculated from the graph was EC<sub>50</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;690&#160;&#956;g/ml. However, the radical scavenging activity attributed to ascorbic acid seems to be more important, characterized by a linear and stable shape of the graph with a maximum of 96.23% of the antioxidant effect (AA % higher than 50%).</p>

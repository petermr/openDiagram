<p id="p0065">Using livers and skeletal muscle from fasted WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, we measured the total amount and phosphorylation of 29 proteins involved in insulin signaling by western blotting (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>; 
 <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). We also calculated the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein for 14 paired molecules and identified those with a ratio of phosphorylated to total that was significantly different between WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice as the differentially phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). The only increased DPP in both the liver and skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice was the beta subunit of the insulin receptor (Irβ), which is consistent with the hyperinsulinemia observed in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). The only decreased DPP was the energy-sensing kinase Ampkα in the liver, which is consistent with increased ATP and decreased AMP in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>A) (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hardie, 2011</xref>). Akt and Foxo1 were liver-specific increased DPPs in the liver, whereas Erk, S6, and As160 were skeletal-muscle-specific increased DPPs.

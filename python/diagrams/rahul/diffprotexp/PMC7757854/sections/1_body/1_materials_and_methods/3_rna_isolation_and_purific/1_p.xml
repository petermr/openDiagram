<p>Total RNA was extracted from MEFs using a combination of TriZol (Life Technologies™) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen©), with modifications from the manufacturer’s protocols. Cells in each well were washed once with 1 ml of PBS prior to the addition of 1 ml of TriZol reagent. TriZol lysates were added to fresh 1.5-ml tubes. Approximately 0.2 ml of chloroform was added per ml of TriZol and was centrifuged at a speed of 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. The upper aqueous phase (~400 ml in volume) was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube. An equivalent volume of 70% ethanol was mixed with the RNA solution, and downstream purification was performed using a RNeasy Mini Spin Column (Qiagen©) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentrations were determined using a Thermo Scientific™ NanoDrop 2000™.</p>

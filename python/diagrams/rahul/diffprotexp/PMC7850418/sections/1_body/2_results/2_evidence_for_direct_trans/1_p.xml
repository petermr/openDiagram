<p>The D34 samples were all collected from hospitalized patients or health care workers (HCW) in the same geriatric rehabilitation unit in the Hospices Civils de Lyon (GRU-3), between April 2nd and April 9th, while the sample with the 26-nt deletion was collected one month earlier (March 10th) in a geriatric unit of another hospital (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The hospitals are 80 km apart and there was no evidence for the transfer of patient #73 with the 26-nt deletion into GRU-3. To track the origin of the deletion, all patients hospitalized in the GRU-3 geriatric unit and all samples collected between March 18th and April 9th with high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 (RT–PCR Ct value &lt; 20) were sequenced (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9). In total, 44% (4/9 patients) were infected with the WT SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 (samples collected between March 18th–30th), with no read carrying the deletion at a minor frequency. Out of the 4 WT SARS-CoV-2 ORF6, three sequences were very similar to D34 and carried a G27289 T SNP (D30Y), which has already been identified in three patients from England between April 20th and 27th, 2020 (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The other 55% (5/9 patients), in addition to 1 HCW, were infected with the 34-nt deletion (samples collected after April 2nd) with 100% of the reads carrying the deletion for each patient. Overall, 8/9 sequences of GRU-3, corresponding to those of the D34 variants and those of the three WT strains carrying the ORF6 G27289 T SNP were clustered together, while the sequence of the patient #38 was more divergent. We could not investigate whether the mutation spread within this unit after April 9th as only one COVID-19 patient was hospitalized in this geriatric unit since, for which their viral load (Ct &gt; 30) was too low for mNGS.

<p>However, it should be noted that the specific capacity of S cathode in all‐solid‐state battery using SCEs is still quite lower and its rate and cycling performance are poor due to the larger interfacial resistance between S cathode and SCEs and severe volume expansion. Therefore, integrated S cathode/SCEs architectures with lower interfacial resistance and highly stable structure should be further developed in the future research.</p>

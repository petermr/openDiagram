<p>For isolation of tissues and preparation of proteins, the Qproteome FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen) was employed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After the total protein content was measured by the Lowry method, protein samples (50 μg) were divided up for LC–MS/MS analysis. These protein samples were digested with trypsin (Protease MAX Surfactant; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and then extracted with a Zip tip C
 <sub>18</sub> pipette tip (Promega).

<p>Invasive enzymes are those synthesized by pathogenic bacteria during metabolism without destroying the host cells, while assisting in colonization, reproduction, and the spread of pathogenic bacteria. To date, several mycoplasmas have been identified to produce a variety of invasive enzymes, such as nucleases, immunoglobulin proteases, antioxidant enzymes, sialidases, and hyaluronidases. These enzymes play an important role in the mycoplasma growth and evasion of host immune surveillance. For a detailed introduction to these invasive enzymes, the readers can refer our previous review [

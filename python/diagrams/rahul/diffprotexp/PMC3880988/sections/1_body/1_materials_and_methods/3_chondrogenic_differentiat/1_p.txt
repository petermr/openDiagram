0: MSC- and AC-alginate beads were prepared using a 1.2% low viscosity alginate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed in 0.15M sodium chloride as previously described  11.
1: MSC and AC-alginate beads were then formed in a 102 mM calcium chloride solution at a density of 4  10 6 cells/mL.
2: Alginate beads were then washed with 0.15M sodium chloride.
3: Ten cell-alginate constructs were transferred to each well of a 6-well culture plate (Corning, USA) before being cultured in chondrogenic defined medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD USA) containing 10 ng/mL TGF-3 (Lonza, USA).
4: MSC and AC-alginate cultures were maintained at 37 oC in a humidified environment containing 5% CO 2 for 21 days.

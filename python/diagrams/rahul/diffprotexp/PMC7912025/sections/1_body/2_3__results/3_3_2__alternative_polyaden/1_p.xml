<p>SMRT sequencing provides genome-wide information about changes in APA site utilization (APAU) in response to RSV infection. In this study, 905 genes had statistically significant changes in APAU in response to RSV; of these, 108 transitioned to distal polyA site utilization, and 707 exhibited proximal polyA site utilization. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f003">Figure 3</xref>A shows a volcano plot of polyadenylation site switching between proximal and distal 3â€² untranslated tract (UTR) polyadenylation sites. In this analysis, a positive APAU fraction corresponds to transcripts with distal APA usage in RSV infection, whereas a negative APAU indicates the proximal APA site is utilized in RSV-infected cells. The filtered APAU genes (&gt;5% APAU) were next subjected to pathway analysis. Individual identities, expression values, and analysis metrics for APAU genes are given in

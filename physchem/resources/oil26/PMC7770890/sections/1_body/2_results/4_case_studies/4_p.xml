<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The second case is Malayan pangolin (<italic>Manis javanica</italic>), which has been suggested as a potential intermediate host in a
few studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Pangolin ACE2 shared an identity
of 84.8%, 65%, and 60% with hACE2 for all, interface, and the key
residues, respectively (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>). Although pangolin ACE2 had seven residues mutated compared with
hACE2, i.e., Q24E, D30E, H34S, D38E, L79I, M82N, and G354H, it still
achieved a relatively low binding energy of &#8722;51.73 EEU (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref>). In the hACE2/S-RBD
complex, Q24 forms a hydrogen bond with N487, and D38 forms a hydrogen
bond with Y449; D30 forms a salt bridge with K417; L79 and M82 form
favorable van der Waals contacts with F486 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b, left). In the pangolin-ACE2/S-RBD complex,
favorable interactions are also extensively formed. E38 could form
two hydrogen bonds with Q498 and Y449; E30 and E24 could form a hydrogen
bond with K417 and N487, respectively; S34 could form a hydrogen bond
with Y453 though it has a reduced van der Waals interaction due to
the small size compared to H34; I79 and N82 could also form favorable
packing interactions with F486 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b, right). Therefore, although pangolin ACE2 achieved
a higher binding score than hACE2, probably due to worse contacting
geometries, the extensive favorable interactions demonstrate that
pangolin ACE2 can still be an effective receptor to SARS-CoV-2. Thus,
the binding analysis and molecular details supported Malayan pangolin
as a possible intermediate host.</p>

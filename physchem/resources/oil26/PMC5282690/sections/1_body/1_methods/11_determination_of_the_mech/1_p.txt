0: The vascular tone was measured by referring to previously described procedure [ 52].
1: Wistar rats weighting 200-300 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (0.1 ml/100 g body weight).
2: The thoracic aorta was quickly and gently removed, cleaned of adherent connective tissue and cut into rings (3-4 mm in length).
3: Rings were gently introduced between two stainless-steel hooks and placed in organ chamber (emka technologies, Paris) containing 11 ml of Krebs solution gassed with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 and maintained at 37 C and pH 7.4.
4: One hook was connected to an isometric force transducer (emka technologies, Paris) and a tension of 1 g was applied to the vessels then they were allowed to stabilize for 30 min.
5: The composition of Krebs solution was as follows (mmol/L): NaCl 119, KCl 4.7, CaCl 2 2.6, MgSO 4 1.2, KH 2PO 4 1.2, NaHCO 3 25, and Glucose 11.
6: Endothelial integrity was monitored by the percentage of relaxation evoked by carbachol (10 4 M) after a steady contraction was reached with phenylephrine (10 6 M).
7: Rings with carbachol-induced relaxation less than 50% were discarded.
8: AcEO was dissolved in final concentration of 0.5% DMSO.
9: Control experiments showed that DMSO at 0.5% had no significant effect on the vascular tone.

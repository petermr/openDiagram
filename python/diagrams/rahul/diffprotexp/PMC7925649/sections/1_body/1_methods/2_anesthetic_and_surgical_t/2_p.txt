0: Bypass flow rates of 150 cc/kg/min were utilized, and pHstat blood gas management was used for all cases.
1: For aortic arch reconstruction, regional cerebral perfusion (RCP) was utilized at 18 C, along with deep hypothermic cardiac arrest for brief periods, and never for more than 20 min.
2: Hematocrit was maintained at 3035% during cooling and hypothermic periods and increased to 4045% during rewarming.
3: Regional oxygen saturations of the brain (rSO 2) were monitored throughout the perioperative period with a protocol that attempted to maintain rSO 2 > 50% before and after bypass and > 90% while on bypass (INVOS 5100B; Somanetics, Inc., Troy, MI, USA).

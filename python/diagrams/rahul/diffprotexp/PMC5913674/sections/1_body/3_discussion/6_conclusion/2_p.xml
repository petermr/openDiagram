<p>Last, we also provide novel insights through longitudinal surveillance of MtzR after discontinuation of drug selection, highlighting the loss of plastic traits and the potential of stable resistance traits. Our results also add to data that suggest 106-MtzR is both a clinically relevant [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] isotype, avoiding major fitness costs and retaining its MtzR phenotype

 <sub>50</sub> levels at 12 weeks (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, panel A). Among a range of changes observed at the level of post-translational modifications, 106-MtzR showed significant fluctuations in KAc and K-MMe modifications of H3 and H4 variants (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, panel B), the first evidence to implicate epigenetic modifications in the stability of Mtz resistance. The interrogation of specific acetylation and methylation marks, as performed for differentiation and antigenic switching [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], would be the next step in investigating the role of chromatin state and transcriptional plasticity in Mtz resistance. Furthermore, given cross-resistance of Mtz resistance lines to TSA, further screening and characterization of specific and targeted epigenetic, as well as broader PTM, chemical inhibitors are required to further probe post-translational regulation of Mtz resistance.

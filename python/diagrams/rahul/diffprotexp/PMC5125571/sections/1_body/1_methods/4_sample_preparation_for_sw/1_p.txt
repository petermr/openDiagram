0: Cell pellet (hemocytes) from each time point was resuspended with 200 l of lysis buffer containing 3 M Urea, 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, Protease inhibitor cocktail (EDTA- free), 50 mM Tris-Hcl and 0.5 mM MgCl 2 and homogenized on ice by sonication (Qsonica, Newtown, CT; 10 cycles of 10 s pulses) followed by incubation on a tube agitator at 4C for 30 min.
1: Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 12,000  g and left at 4C for 20 min.
2: The pellet was discarded and protein supernatant was concentrated using 10 kDa Amicon filters (Millipore).
3: Plasma proteins were directly concentrated using the same filters.
4: Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, USA).
5: The concentrated protein was then stored at -80C until use.
6: Twenty g of protein was applied onto a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis.
7: Protein reduction, alkylation and  in gel digestion were performed as described previously [ 47].
8: Briefly, protein samples were reduced by addition of 0.5 M dithiothreitol at 65C for 1 h, and then cysteine residues were alkylated with 0.5 M iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in darkness at 37C for 45 min.
9: Proteins were digested using trypsin (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37C overnight.
10: Prior to SWATH analysis, trypsin-digested samples from each time point were pooled and peptide amount normalized to 5 g using a C18 Zip-Tip (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 1 L of iRT Kit (Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) was added in order to normalize retention times.

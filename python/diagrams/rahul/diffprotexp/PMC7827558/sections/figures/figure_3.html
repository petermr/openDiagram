 <caption> High levels of p53β are associated with prolonged overall survival in patients with advanced stage (III/IV) breast cancer (TCGA breast cancer (BRCA) data [ 24, 25]). N = 277; unadjusted p-value = 0.00132. The “expression low” cohort represents the following combination of samples: HER2 negative (39.6%, N = 80), HER2 positive (17.3%, N = 35), NA (36.6%; N = 74; including HER2 equivocal), and triple-negative breast cancer (6.4%, N = 13). The “expression high” cohort represents the following combination of samples: HER2 negative (41.3%, N = 31), HER2 positive (16.0%, N = 12), NA (32.0%; N = 24; including HER2 unequivocal), and triple-negative breast cancer (10.7%, N = 8). The cohort was 32.5% ( N = 90) TP53 mutant and 67.5% ( N = 187) TP53 wild type (WT). HER2-negative status was determined as; (1) ER−, PR+; (2) ER+, PR−; (3) ER+, PR+; or (4) ER+, PR indeterminate. Methods for data analysis can be found in supplementary material. </caption>

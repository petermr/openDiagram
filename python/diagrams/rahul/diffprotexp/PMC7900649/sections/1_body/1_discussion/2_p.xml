<p id="Par31">Extremely complex gene regulatory changes occur in cells after virus infection. On one hand, to replicate in host cells, viruses develop strategies to disturb host gene expression or protein production. On the other hand, cells carry out various defense mechanisms. One way is through affecting sites of 3′ end processing of mRNA, which has consequences for transcript stability and mRNAs translation [

Since the 3′ UTR serves as a docking platform for posttranscriptional gene regulators, alterations of tandem 3′ UTR APA could influence the stability, localization and translation of the target RNAs. The length of 3′ UTRs influence the translation efficiency, and truncated transcripts lead to truncated proteins. In this work, we just focused on gene expression at the transcript level. In our results, APA switching genes were mainly clustered into cellular processes such as endocytosis, protein processing in ER and spliceosome. Moreover, the same pathways were enriched with the DEGs. Since IPEC-J2 cells were not immune cells, fewer genes affected are associated with immune reaction. Immune pathways such as antigen processing and presentation were found to be promoted in this research.

0: The SCEs are composed of flexible polymer hosts, dissolved lithium salt, and rigid inorganic fillers.
1: 3,  16 Polyethylene oxide (PEO) as a typical ionconducting polymer host is the most dominant one compared to others such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(vinylidene fluoridecohexafluoropropylene) (PVDFHFP), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), poly(vinyl carbonate) (PVC), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).
2: 9,  17,  18,  19,  20,  136 The lithium salts such as LiN(CF 3SO 2) 2 (LiTFSI), 21,  22 LiN(SO 2F) 2 (LiFSI), 23 and LiClO 424 are mostly applied in SPEs for their high electrochemical and thermal stability, good solvability, and promotion to formation of a stable SEI.
3: 18 The inorganic fillers could be classified into active fillers and passive fillers according to their ionconducting behavior.
4: 9,  25 The passive fillers generally include oxides (SiO 2, 26,  27 Al 2O 3, 28 ZrO 2, 29 etc.
5: ), minerals (such as montmorillonite 30 and halloysite 31), carbon materials, 32 metal organic frameworks (MOFs), 33 etc.
6: The active fillers commonly cover all the Li ionconducting materials, such as LISICONtype (Li 14Zn(GeO 4) 4), NASICONtype (such as Li 1.5Al 0.5Ge 1.5(PO 4) 3 [LAGP] and Li 1.3Al 0.3Ti 1.7(PO 4) 3 [LATP]), peroskitetype (Li 3La 2/3xTiO 3 [LLTO]), garnettype (Li 7La 3Zr 2O 12 [LLZO], Lasite: Ca, Sr, Ba, K, etc., and Zrsite: Ta, Nb, etc.
7: ), sulfide electrolyte (such as Li 10GeP 2S 12), and some other ceramics (LiPON, Li 3N, etc.).
8: 12,  34,  35,  36 Both the inactive and active fillers in polymer matrix can act as plasticizers to disorder the crystallization of polymer matrixes and thus increase the ionic conductivity of composite electrolytes, and facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts.
9: 17,  25 Moreover, the active fillers could provide highly efficient pathway for lithium ion transportation.
10: Hence, the reinforced SCEs attract increasing attentions for their higher ionic conductivity and wider electrochemical windows.
11: There are many reviews focused on the properties and mechanisms of passive fillerassisted composite electrolytes.
12: 9,  25,  37 Regrettably, up to now, there are few articles to systematically summarize the prospects and applications of the active fillerreinforced SCEs.
13: In this review, we present the advances of active fillerreinforced SCEs applied in allsolidstate lithium batteries and analyze the existing challenges to be conquered.
14: The main objective of this review is to provide possible strategies to solve the problems in allsolidstate lithium batteries with active fillerreinforced SCEs and highlight their inspiration for future research directions.

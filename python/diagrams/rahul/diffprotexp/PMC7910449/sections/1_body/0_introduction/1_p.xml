  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Circular RNA has various biological effects, including the regulation of cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. Autophagy is related to physiological states as well as a variety of pathological states, such as tumors, inflammation, and so forth
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Some studies confirmed the function of circular RNA in autophagy. CircHIPK2 participates in astrocyte activation by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy via sponging miR-124-2HG

 </sup>. CircDnmt1 promoted the proliferation and survival of breast carcinoma cells through the activation of autophagy. CircDnmt1 directly interacted with p53 along with AUF1 to promote their nuclear translocation

 </sup>. CircHECTD1 promoted TIPARP transcription and expression, thus activating autophagy and astrocytes

<p>For functional analyses, proteins can be classified into Clusters of Ortholog Groups (COG). Each COG represents a group of orthologous proteins from different microbes sharing the same functional characteristics (

 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] provide functional annotations. Furthermore, analyses of specific metabolic pathways through manual reconstruction or use of automated tools, such as Pathway Tools [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], can provide a more in-depth visualization of the functional state of the metaproteome. The commonly used pathway databases used to support pathway reconstruction are MetaCyc [

 <xref rid="ppat.1009245.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] offers a pipeline for downstream analyses of host–microbiome functional interactions. Information on additional tools for functional analyses and their validation can be found in a recent comparative study by Sajulga and colleagues [

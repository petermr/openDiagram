<p id="Par33">In present study, we screened 21,282 lncRNAs and 43,674 mRNAs. LncRNAs have synergetic relationship with mRNAs as most lncRNAs are located near protein-coding genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, wide location of lncRNAs in chromosomes of sheep indicated its pluripotency. Obviously, distribution ratio of lncRNAs and mRNAs on Chr2 (NC_019459.2), Chr3 (NC_019460.2), Chr1 (NC_019458.2) were greater than those on other chromosomes, which could be explained by close relationship between three chromosomes and pineal gland function. The exon size and ORF length of lncRNAs and mRNAs are mostly within 1000â€‰bp. These results showed the potential lncRNAs were reliable in the pineal gland.

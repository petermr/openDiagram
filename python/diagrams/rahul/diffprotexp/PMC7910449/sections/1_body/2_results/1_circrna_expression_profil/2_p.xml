<p id="Par18">The variations in circRNA expression between Torin 1-treated SKOV3 cells and NC (SKOV3 cells mixed with DMSO) were assessed using scatter plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). GO analysis found that these differentially expressed circRNAs participated in many cellular processes, including microtubule binding, actin filament binding, GTPase activator activity, and activities of activators for protein serine/threonine kinase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The pathway analysis found that the differentially expressed circRNAs participated in TGF-Î² signal transduction pathway, Wnt signal transduction pathway, Rap1 signal transduction pathway, Ras signal transduction pathway, and so on (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).

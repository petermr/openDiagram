<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" content-type="flushleft">Light sensitivity to daylight conditions in most mammals is conferred by a middle/long wavelength-sensitive (M/LWS) pigment, normally complemented by a short wavelength-sensitive visual pigment (SWS1), and rhodopsin (RH1) for dim-light vision, with the pigment opsin encoded by the genes <italic>OPN1MW</italic>/<italic>LW</italic>, <italic>OPN1SW</italic>, and <italic>RHO</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). While some lineages have lost the SWS1 opsin via relaxed selection linked to low-light niches (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the M/LWS opsin is functional across mammals, with a few exceptions (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>

<p>Raman spectra were recorded using a Horiba Jobin Yvon T64000 micro Raman system (laser wavelength of 532 nm) (Lille, France). The experiments were done at room temperature and a working power of 0.7 W. FT-IR spectroscopy was applied to identify the characteristic peaks and it was recorded using a Nexus 470 FT-IR Nicolet with an AVATAR OMNI-Sampler (Madison, WI, USA). UV-Vis spectra were collected with a Shimadzu UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan), model UV-3600. The used wavelength range was from 2000 to 400 nm.</p>

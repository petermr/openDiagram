<p>The κ-carrageenan hydrogels loaded with tetracycline hydrochloride (PC12K) present higher release rates (with 30–48%) and diffusion coefficients (with 47¨C55%) in comparison with the corresponding ι-carrageenan gels. These release parameters have a much lower variation for PC12K with the pH of the release medium (up to 27%) than in PC12 (up to 47%). Even if the sulfate groups in both carrageenans are completely ionized in the studied pH range, ι-carrageenan seems more sensible to the modifications in the ionic strength of the release medium. These modifications lead in principle to the reorientation in the macromolecular structural assembly, which is responsible for creating new diffusional pathways for the model drug.</p>

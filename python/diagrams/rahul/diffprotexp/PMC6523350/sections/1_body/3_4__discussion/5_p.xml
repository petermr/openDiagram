<p>Lyases proteins are known for their functions in the biosynthesis process. In total, four lyases proteins were found with attribution of two up-regulated and two down-regulated proteins. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) was a down-regulated protein and was found with high expression. Glutamate decarboxylase is a key enzyme for the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and it had many biological functions, such as promoting brain activity, calming the nerves, regulating hormone secretion, lowering blood pressure, treating epilepsy, enhancing memory, and improving menopausal syndrome. As compared with non-transgene, transgenic plants have a higher GAD activity and γ-aminobutyric acid content, which indicates that GABA accumulation can be achieved by enhancing GAD expression via genetic engineering [

Hydrolases are important for cell tissue regulation and biosynthesis processes. Out of 12, 7 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated proteins were found. PUL (limit dextrinase) and OsI_26372 were up-regulated proteins and found with most expression. PUL belongs to the starch debranching enzyme (DBE) in the starch synthesis pathway and is expressed at a high level in both the middle and late stages of seed development [
 <xref rid="B38-biomolecules-09-00130" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These two ligases contribute to the metabolism of small molecules, and both were up-regulated proteins. Therefore, the role of non-Se-enriched rice in starch synthesis pathway was slightly better than that of the natural Se-enriched rice.

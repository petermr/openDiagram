<p>After the strong-cation exchange clean-up, the iTRAQ labeled samples underwent isoelectric focusing (IEF) by using two 24 cm 3.7–4.9 immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (GE Healthcare). The samples were rehydrated in 8 M urea with bromophenol blue and 1% IPG buffer, subsequently loaded to the IPG strip and run according to previously published protocols [

 <caption> (a) Co K-edge spectra for a series of CoFe x Al 2– x O 4 spinels. Adapted by permission from Springer Nature, ref ( 329) (2019). (b) Determination of the occupancies of non-equivalent sites available for Pd in ligand-protected PdAu 24 clusters. The experimental Pd K-edge XANES spectrum is compared with the result of LCA fitting with three ab initio calculated spectra corresponding to non-equivalent sites. The calculated site-specific spectra are shown separately. Corresponding nonequivalent sites Pd–I, Pd–II, and Pd–III, and their occupancies, are shown in the insets. Experimental and simulated data taken from ref ( 202). </caption>

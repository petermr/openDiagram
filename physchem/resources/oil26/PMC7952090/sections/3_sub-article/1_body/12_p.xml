<p>4) A major concern with the paper is that while the methods are very well-thought out, there are some unresolvable limitations to the data available. As it stands, the manuscript does not sufficiently guide the reader through how these issues might influence the findings. One example of this problem is in the estimation of cancer risk. The risk is estimated on the basis of body size and life span. However, that lifespan is itself phylogenetically estimated from body size at least for the non-extant species. It is not clear from the manuscript whether all lifespans are so estimated, or whether observations are used for the lifespan of the extant species. If the later, caution is indicated, because lifespan data are highly uneven and often given as observed maximal lifespans, which can be misleading if taken from, for instance, zoo specimens. In either case, the manuscript needs to more clearly emphasize that these are statistically-predicted risks, not measured risks.</p>

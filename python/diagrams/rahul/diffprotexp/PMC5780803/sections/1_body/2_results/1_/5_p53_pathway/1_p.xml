<p>As demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>, S100A4 and S100 calcium-binding protein P (S100P) were downregulated in the Caki-1 cells. The S100 protein family belongs to the calcium-binding protein family, members of which have a similar structure, but a different function. S100A4 may be combined with the regulatory region of the p53 protein C terminal, and through protein kinase C, may inhibit the phosphorylation reaction of the full-length p53 protein (

 <xref rid="b21-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The results of the present study also demonstrated that there was a significant change (P=0.002) in the members of the S100 family following apoptotic stimulation (

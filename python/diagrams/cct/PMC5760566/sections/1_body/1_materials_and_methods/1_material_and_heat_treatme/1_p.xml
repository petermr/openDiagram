<p id="Par7">The chemical composition of the test steel (SA508 Gr.4N) with elemental composition as per ASME boiler and pressure vessel-section – materials–SA-508/SA-508M specification
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. The chemical composition of the steels is given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The carbon content was determined from the GB/T223.69-2008 steel and alloy carbon content. After combustion in the tube furnace, the gas volumetric method was adopted. The concentrations of Al, Ni, Cr, Mo, Mn, V, Ti, Nb were used to determine the multi-element content of GB/T223.79-2007 iron and steel via X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. In the testing standard, the minimum detectable content of P, S, Ti is 0.001%, and the lowest detectable content of Si, Mn, Cu, Al, Nb, Cr, Mo, V is 0.002%.

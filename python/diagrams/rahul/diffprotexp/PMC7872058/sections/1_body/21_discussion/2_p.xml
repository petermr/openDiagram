<p>Besides the cell receptor, a soluble form of TREM1 (sTREM1) has been described [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. sTREM1 may be produced from a splice variant or following the shedding of membrane-bound TREM-1 by metalloproteinase-mediated proteolytic cleavage [
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The biological function of sTREM is still unknown but based on data of other soluble forms of membrane receptors, sTREM1 may act as a negative regulator of TREM1 signaling by neutralizing TREM1 ligands and thus interfere with the pro-inflammatory function of the TREM1 receptor [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. sTREM1 can be detected in biological fluids during infection or inflammation, therefore, its relevance as a diagnostic biomarker is becoming important. There are several studies reporting that TREM1 plays a role in sepsis [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Plasma sTREM1 levels were positively correlated with high scores of severity and mortality [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Serum levels of sTREM1 have also been reported to predict bacteremia in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a recent study, the association between serum sTREM1 levels and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) showed that serum levels were significantly increased in TB patients and these higher serum levels correlated with disease severity and treatment outcomes [

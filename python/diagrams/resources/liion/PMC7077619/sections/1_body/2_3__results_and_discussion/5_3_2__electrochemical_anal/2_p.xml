<p>The typical charge discharge curve of prepared P2-NaFeMnO
 <sub>2</sub> material using PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane was showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Here, smooth charge discharge curve were obtained with initial discharge capacity of 178 mAh g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> between 2 and 4 V at 0.1 C rates 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. Even after 500 cycles, the cell exhibits 98% of columbic efficiency, which were evident for good ionic conduction through the PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane. In view of verifying the cycle life of the membrane with the NaFeMnO electrode cell couple, the measurement was extended to 500 cycles. It was found from the cycle life analysis that the discharge voltage of electrode material was stable at 3.7 V without much fading while using this PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membrane. This shows the ability of the as-prepared PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membrane is highly harmonious with the sodium electrode and withstanding in more number of cycles. The cyclic voltammetry was performed with the above-mentioned combination of cell couple in the potential range of 1.5 to 4.5 V at the scan rate of 0.1 mV/s, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f005">Figure 5</xref>b. In that, all the redox peaks are in good agreement and attributed to the corresponding electrode materials used in the cell according to the previous reports [

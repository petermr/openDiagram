<p>The essential oils and extracts of the medicinal plants have been used for food preservation, scenting agent and as a traditional healthcare since thousands of years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In the GC-MS analyses, apiol and m-diaminobenzene were found the major constituents of 
 <italic>A. sowa</italic> root essential oil. It was reported that apiol (20%) was found as the main compound in the root essential oil of 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> L. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the earlier studies, phenylpropanoid compounds were the rich level in leaf and stem part of 
 <italic>A. sowa</italic> L. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. On the other hand, apiol was also found in some umbelliferae plants like parsley (
 <italic>Petroselinum sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic>) which have accounted for 18.23 and 17.54% respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Moreover, m-diaminobenzene (68.2%) was also found as the highest amount in other 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> plant (
 <italic>Ligusticum jeholense</italic>) essential oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. On the other hand, carvone (27.8%) was found the main predominant compound in 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> L. followed by limonene (15.5%), α-phellandrene (14.7%) and apiol (3.1%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] while carvon, limonene and α-phellandrene were totally absent in the present study. The variations of oil composition with 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> species may be due to plant genetic base, development and mostly different environmental conditions.

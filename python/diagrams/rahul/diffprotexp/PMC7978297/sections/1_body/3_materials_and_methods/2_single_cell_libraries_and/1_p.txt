0: The single cells were then loaded onto a 10 Chromium chip B (10 Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) to generate single-cell gel beads in emulsion (GEMs), which was followed by cDNA amplification.
1: A 3 gene expression library was then constructed using a 10 Genomics Chromium Single Cell system with v3 chemistry (10 Genomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2: Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) by Berry Genomics (Chengdu, China).
3: Output reads (150 bp pair-ended) were yielded through Cell Ranger v3.1.5 using default parameters, including mkfastq and count pipelines.
4: The detailed information of captured cells for each sample after count flow is shown in  Figure S1B.

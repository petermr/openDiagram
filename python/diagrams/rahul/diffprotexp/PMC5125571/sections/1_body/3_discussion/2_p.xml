<p>In this study, we investigated the humoral and cellular responses of the freshwater snail 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>siamensis goniomphalos</italic> following exposure to 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> using a SWATH-MS proteomic approach. We compared the protein profiles in hemocytes and plasma of infected snails at 24, 48 and 96 hpi as early stages of development of parasite versus non-infected snails (control), since circulating hemocytes, in cooperation with humoral factors (plasma), are known to play key roles in the immune response against infection [

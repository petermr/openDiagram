<p>In summary, in our study we compared miRNA profiles of 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt corticotroph PitNETs and determined miRNAs with different expression levels. With target prediction and comprehensive miRNA and mRNA expression data analysis, we found that putative targets of DEMs are mainly the genes involved in processes and pathways of protein ubiquitination. However, differences in only a few miRNAs appear to affect the levels of genes with significantly diverse expression in corticotrophinomas with and without 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations. Thus, the difference in miRNA levels is not the cause of a pronounced differences in the gene expression between these tumors.

<p id="Par45">We hypothesized that H5N1 is highly pathogenic compared with H9N2, probably because of the upregulation and downregulation of the above eight mitochondrial proteins, which in turn inhibit T cell activation, antigen presentation, stress responses, and other processes. The increased mortality from H5N1 infection may also be due to metabolic abnormalities. A total of 42.3% of these differentially expressed proteins were involved in the apoptotic process, and we speculate that the altered levels of mitochondrial protein expression during IAV pathogenesis are due mainly to the difference in the endogenous apoptotic process. Our analysis also identified many other influencing factors, indicating that host cell infection is a complex process.</p>

<p>Enrichment analysis showed that, based on the common genes identified above, defensive responses to bacteria, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and canonical glycolysis were significantly up-regulated in sepsis patients, whereas interleukin-17 production, B cell activation, and T cell receptor signaling were significantly down-regulated (

KEGG results showed that Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were significantly up-regulated in sepsis, whereas Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, and T cell receptor signaling pathways were significantly down-regulated (

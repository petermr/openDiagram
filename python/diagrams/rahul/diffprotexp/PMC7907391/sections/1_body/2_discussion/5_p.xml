<p id="Par24">Subsequently, an analysis of the effects of patient factors such as age, sex, and smoking were examined in this current study. Specifically, we noted decreased expression of viral entry genes among pediatric compared to adult samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), supporting previous observations of decreased susceptibility of COVID-19 amongst children

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), which is consistent with sex differences in mortality from COVID-19

<p>A 100 mm high bar was cut from the ingot, homogenized in an air furnace at 1150 °C for 1 h to remove the inhomogeneous microstructures, hot rolled at 950 °C in 4 passes to a diameter of 40 mm (
 <italic>ε</italic> = ~20%), and then cooled to room temperature in air. The bar was heated to 790 °C and kept for 8 h (spheroidized annealing) and cooled to 520 °C with the furnace, subsequently air-cooled to room temperature. The spheroidized annealed bar was cold rolled to a final thickness of 30 mm via 4 passes (
 <italic>ε</italic> = ~25%) and then heated to 680 °C for 8 to 10 h for recrystallization annealing treatment. The experimental steel after cold rolling and recrystallization annealing was cold drawn, then heated to 680 °C for 8~10 h for recrystallization annealing. At last, the steel was heated to 510 °C and kept for 6~8 h for stress-relief annealing (

<p>The Golgi apparatus is an evolutionary-conserved cellular organelle that plays a key role in protein sorting and post-translational modification, as well as being a hub for signaling molecules and to thereby contribute to the outcome of signaling cascades [

 <xref rid="B77-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. A wide range of genes induce structural alteration of the Golgi apparatus [
 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. These alterations fall into two main categories: compaction and fragmentation of the Golgi. The available collection of genes that affect the Golgi structure might form a framework for analyzing the connection between Golgi alterations and cancer. The main challenge with genes that are linked to Golgi alterations is that they often form loosely connected networks, making it complicated to extract meaningful information with respect to enrichment of signaling pathways or metabolic processes.

<p id="p0100">While PAL values were positive for certain pathways in PC and FC, the PAL differences between the tumors and normal thyroid samples were not significant. To test that we calculated PAL level for each normal sample (Supplementary file 6). PAL level for a normal sample can be interpreted as an activation level of a pathway in a normal sample when compared to the average of all normal samples. This is needed to test the significance of the differences when comparing the group of normal samples with other groups. Lack of significance between normal samples and tumors is linked with a high heterogeneity of PAL values in normal samples (Supplementary file 4).</p>

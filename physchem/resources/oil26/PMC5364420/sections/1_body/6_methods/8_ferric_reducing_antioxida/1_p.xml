<p>The reducing ability was determined by using FRAP assay as previously described
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The absorption of the reaction mixture was measured at 593 nm after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Increased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated increased reducing power.

<p>To study the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release of loratadine and sulpiride from the prepared nanoemulsions, a dialysis bag method was adopted (Sood et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). 4
 <bold> </bold>mL sample was loaded into a dialysis bag of cellulose membrane (14
 <bold> </bold>kDa molecular weight cutoff). The bag was dipped in a beaker containing 100
 <bold> </bold>ml phosphate buffer solution, pH 6.8
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>0.5 kept at 37
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>0.1
 <bold> </bold>°C and stirred at 50
 <bold> </bold>rpm for 12
 <bold> </bold>hours. 2
 <bold> </bold>ml samples were removed at appropriate time intervals. Loratadine and sulpiride amounts were determined by measuring spectrophotometric absorbance at 395 and 218
 <bold> </bold>nm respectively. The resultant release profiles were compared to those obtained from the individual raw loratadine and sulpiride. Statistical analysis of the release data has been carried out using similarity factor, f2 whereas the release profiles were compared to a reference (Shah et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).

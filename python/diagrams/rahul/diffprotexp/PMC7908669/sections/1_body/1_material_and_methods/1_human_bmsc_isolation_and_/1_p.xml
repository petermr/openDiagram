<p id="Par9">The human BMSCs used in the present study were isolated from bone marrow tissues collected from healthy volunteers as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, 8 ml of bone marrow tissue from each volunteer was first washed with 12 ml of pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and separated by density gradient centrifugation (500 g; 20 min) using Lymphoprep medium (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway). The interface liquid layer containing the mononuclear cells was carefully collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco). After culturing at 37 °C in a humidified chamber supplied with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 h, non-adherent cells were removed by changing the culture medium. The remaining cells were cultured at 37 °C under normal cell culture conditions with the renewal of DMEM medium every 3 days and passaged when cell confluence reached over 80%. After three successive passages, the isolated BMSCs were used for various assays. The research was approved in advance by the Ethical Committee of Sun Yat-sen University. Written informed consent was obtained from each volunteer.

<p>RNA sequencing analysis was carried out following our established conditions [
 <xref rid="B39-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. RNA was extracted from LNCaP cells (stably expressing EV or CNTN1) using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON, Canada; No. 217004) according to the manufacturer’s instructions; libraries were prepared with TruSeq Ribo Profile Mammalian Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA; RPHMR12126) following manufacturer’s instructions, and sequenced by BGI using the HiSeq 4000 system. RNA sequences were quantified by BGI (

 <sup>6</sup>C/(NL/10

0: To explore the biological pathways of genes in a subnetwork, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis was performed based on TCGA dataset.
1: According to the cutoff value, the samples were divided into high and low expression phenotypes.
2: The gene set permutations were performed 1000 times per analysis.
3: Gene sets with |normalized enrichment score (NES)| > 1 and P < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched.

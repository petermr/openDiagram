0: Recently, notable progress in the understanding of pathogenesis of CD has been made [ 3], including the discovery of recurrent  USP8 mutations [ 4, 5, 6].
1: These mutations are observed in approximately 3040% of patients suffering from Cushings disease as well as in silent tumors [ 4, 6, 7, 8, 9].
2: Patients with Cushings disease with and without  USP8 mutations have a slightly different clinical profile according to previously published data [ 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
3: The studies showed that  USP8 mutation is related to lower tumor size [ 4, 5, 8] and clinical remission after surgery [ 8] [ 12].
4: Additionally, differences in expression of possible molecular predictive markers as  MGMT or somatostatin receptor were also observed in this group of patients [ 2, 8].
5: Perhaps testing the  USP8 mutation status in patients could provide some kind of clinically useful information; however, the clinical results published up to today are insufficient, and molecular consequences of this mutation are only partially recognized.

<p>Another important aspect of recycling concerns graphite. According to the classification of the European Union, graphite is considered to be a strategic material. When pyrometallurgical processes are used, carbon and graphitic fraction are lost. However, leaching is used to obtain pure graphite/carbon fractions during the process used by Recupyl [

Once recovered, these materials are purified and can serve as graphite source in manufacturing of new anode, thus replacing primary carbon sources. Such recycling method would be a great way of implementing circular economy principles.

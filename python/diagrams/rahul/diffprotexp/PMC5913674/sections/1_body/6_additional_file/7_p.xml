<p>Supplementary Figure S4: Protein interactome network for DEPs in WB MtzR (Top), 106 MtzR (Middle) and 713 MtzR (Bottom). Using the STRING software, proteins are represented with nodes and the interactions with continuous lines to represent direct interactions (physical), while indirect ones (functional) are presented by interrupted lines. Thickness of the line is to represent the strength of the data support of interaction evidence between network nodes. Colouring is performed according to MCL clustering. The coloured background and overarching functional annotations have been added to highlight protein-protein interaction networks of multiple nodes with direct interactions among DEPs in the MtzR lines.</p>

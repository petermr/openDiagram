<p id="Par34">The path-act-network analysis was conducted to identify the interactive network function of pathways enriched with the KEGG-based differential mRNAs, including membrane transportation, metabolism, cell cycles and signal transduction pathways. The STRING database was employed to perform gene-act-network analysis to uncover the network of the differentially expressed mRNAs based on relationships extracted from the database

 </sup>. Networks were developed based on complementary pairs between miRNA and mRNAs, and between miRNA and lncRNAs to infer the role of lncRNAs in ovaries of the Hu sheep. miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were included in the networks. Cytoscape (ver. 2.8) was employed to visualize the miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA networks.

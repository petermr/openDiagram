 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, kPCA plots of the Rad-6 chemical compound space for the intensive and extensive kernels are shown. Here, the two principal components mainly reflect the degree of saturation (the number of hydrogen atoms) and the oxygen/carbon ratio. The main difference in both projections is that the extensive kernel additionally displays a size-dependence, with small molecules (up to 4 heavy atoms) concentrated in the bottom right corner (see SI for more details).

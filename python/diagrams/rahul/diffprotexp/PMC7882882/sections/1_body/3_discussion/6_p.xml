<p>Third, the current analysis obtained hub genes and module lncRNAs with significant differential expression (CCR1, CCL3, CCL4, PACSIN1, CGNL1, TRIM69, STAB2, ATP8A1, CD48, NOL6, ZFP36, KLF4, CD247, REEP6, SQRDL, KCNJ6, ANXA2, SPRY2, KCNS3, ITM2C, THBS2, CTD-2515H24.2, LL21NC02-21A1.1, LOC200772, RP11-402C9.1, LINC01203, RP11-479G22.8, RP11-615I2.1, RP1-249I4.2, RP11-116N8.2 and RP11-288L9.4). As an example, ANXA2 is a pleiotropic calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that is abnormally expressed in a variety of cancer types (

 <xref rid="b60-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) and liver cancer (
 <xref rid="b61-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Liu 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b62-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) performed a meta-analysis and indicated that ANXA2-overexpression might be related to poor outcomes in patients with malignant tumors, which is consistent with the present findings. In addition, the current study reported that lncRNAs could be used as a prognostic signature. However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in NFPA have not yet been reported.

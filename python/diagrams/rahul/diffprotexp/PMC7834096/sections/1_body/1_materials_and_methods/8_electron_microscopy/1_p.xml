<p>Overnight cultures of EAEC strain 55989 
 <italic>agg3
  <sup>−</sup>
 </italic> carrying one of the plasmids pAAF/I, pAAUF/III, pAAF/IV, pAAF/V, and pBAD24 were diluted in fresh LB medium containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and cultivated at 37°C until an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.4–0.6 had been reached. Then, 10% arabinose solution was added to a final concentration of 0.3% for the induction of AAF fimbrial expression, and the incubation was continued for another 60 minutes at 37°C. A drop of bacterial culture of each sample was sedimented on a Formvar-coated, carbon-sputtered grid. After negative-staining with 1% phosphotungstic acid, the samples were analyzed at 80 kV with a Tecnai 12 electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Images of selected areas were documented with Veleta 4k CCD camera (emsis, Münster, Germany).

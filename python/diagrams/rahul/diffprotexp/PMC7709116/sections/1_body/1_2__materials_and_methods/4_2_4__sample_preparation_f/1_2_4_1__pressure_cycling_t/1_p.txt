0: Nuclei lysis and protein digestion were performed with a PCT-MicroPestle/Caps method in a Barocycler 2320 EXT (Pressure BioSciences, Inc., South Easton, MA, USA) as described [ 26].
1: The sorted nuclei (i.e., 50,000 of the approximately 80,000 that were obtained from the two mice that were used for each biological replicate) were first placed in microTubes (Pressure BioSciences, Easton, MA, USA) with a PCT-MicroPestle (Pressure BioSciences) in 30 L of lysis buffer (100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), 0.2% RapiGest, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) supplemented with cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
2: Although cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor was also included in the PCT/trypsin digest carried out by Shao et al.
3: [ 26], investigators may consider omission of this protease inhibitor cocktail from the nuclei lysis and digestion buffer as it may decrease the active trypsin concentration.
4: PCT-MicroPestle samples were processed with 60 cycles of 50 sec at high pressure (45,000 psi) followed by 10 sec at atmospheric pressure at 95 C for 1 hr in the barocycler followed by reduction and alkylation for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.
5: Thereafter, the PCT-MicroPestle was replaced with a PCT-MicroCap (50 L size) and samples were digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a concentration of 20 ng/L.
6: Digestion was performed in the barocycler at 37 C using 360 cycles, each consisting of 50 s at 25,000 psi (high pressure) and 10 sec at atmospheric pressure for 6 h. After digestion was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%, the samples were ready for on-column TMT labeling.

0: Ricin, a glycoprotein derived from the castor bean, is extremely toxic if taken in through oral, respiratory, or percutaneous routes.
1: In fact, ricin has been used in multiple assassination attempts because of its high toxicity [ 1].
2: Ricin is a putative lethal agent of biological warfare because it can be easily extracted from the waste mash of castor oil production and from the widely available castor beans.
3: With a molecular weight of 62-kDa, ricin consists of two glycoprotein chains linked through a disulfide bridge: 32-kDa A chain and 34-kDa B chain.
4: The 34-kDa B chain, a lectin that binds primarily to galactose-containing surface proteins, facilitates the internalization of the 32-kDa A chain, the toxic moiety.
5: Following endocytosis and retrograde transfer through the endosome, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, the A chain of ricin enters the cytosol where it depurinates a single adenine (A4324 in mouse) in the 28S rRNA ribosomes.
6: The depurination of the A4324 is directly responsible both for the inhibition of protein translation and for the initiation of upstream events that lead to inflammatory responses [ 2 5].

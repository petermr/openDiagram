<p id="Par9">In this paper we apply the machine-learning approach so create an interatomic potential for molecular hydrogen. We show that the potential describes the three molecular solid phases, with free-rotor Phase I, and broken-symmetry Phase II and a high-pressure Phase III. Furthermore, the melt line has a maximum, such that at high pressure the liquid is denser than the hcp solid, a feature we attribute to short-range directional order giving lower quadrupole–quadrupole interaction in the solid. The potential is trained on energies and classical Hellmann–Feynman forces derived from standard DFT in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation adopted by all standard DFT codes, so the interatomic potential is the same for deuterium, hydrogen-deuteride (HD) and hydrogen. The potential accounts for binding due to electronic structure: contributions from quantum-nuclear effects can be incorporated using lattice dynamics or path integral methods.</p>

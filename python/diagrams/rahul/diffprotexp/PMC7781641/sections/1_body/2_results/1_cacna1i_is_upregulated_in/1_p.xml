<p>Previous studies have indicated that changes at the transcriptional level of the dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia may underlie the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in several animal models [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref>]. Therefore, in order to determine the changes that may be occurring at the transcriptional level in FRICT-ION mice compared to control, we analyzed trigeminal ganglia (TG) gene expression by RNAseq 10 weeks after nerve injury. We found that the expression of the 
 <italic>Cacna1i</italic> gene, encoding the Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 ion channel, was increased by 40% (p &lt; 0.05, paired t-test; 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Cacna1i</italic> was one of only a few ion channel genes upregulated while most were downregulated at 10 weeks (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Genes encoding other channels upregulated 10 weeks after nerve injury included 
 <italic>Kcnh6, Clic4, Kcnj10, Hvcn1</italic>, and 
 <italic>Kcnj16</italic>.

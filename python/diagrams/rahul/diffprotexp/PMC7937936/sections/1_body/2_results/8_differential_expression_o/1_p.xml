<p>A total of 502 tumor tissues and 44 normal tissues were included in TCGA-HNSC data set. We used the “limma” package to analyze the expression of these three key genes and found that 
 <italic>CCR8</italic> and 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> were differentially expressed in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), while 
 <italic>CCR4</italic> exhibited no significant difference in expression between tumor and normal tissues (

 <italic>CCR8</italic> and 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> were significantly differentially expressed in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues, while 
 <italic>CCR4</italic> was not significantly different (

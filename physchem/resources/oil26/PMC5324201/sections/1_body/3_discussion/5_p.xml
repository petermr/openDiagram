<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Thermo-gravimetry is a technique in which change in the weight of a substance is recorded as a function of temperature or time. This technique is useful for the pre-formulation study of herbal preparation through physical and chemical changes. It detects the impurity, identified the complex mixture and thermal stability of the plant samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In the first stage, broad and shallow endothermic effect on the DTA curve indicated a small loss in mass by a dehydration reaction. This peak is due to desorption of moisture of the root powder material together with the evaporation of volatile components or essential oils. The chemical reaction was occurring in the second stage of decomposition by a strong exothermic effect on the DTA curve. A mass loss of the DTG curve was verified due to the elimination of moisture retained in this material. In the second stage, the highest mass loss was reflected by the TG and DTG curves which are due to the destruction and combustion of compounds contained in the root samples. The behaviour of the pyrolysis curve indicated hemi-cellulose and cellulose decomposition, as well as the loss of remaining adsorbed moisture. Lignin decomposition indicated that this structure presents a higher stability than hemi-cellulose and cellulose. The last stage indicated that the presence of oxides (mainly those of aluminium and silicon), which were stable at higher temperatures. The last stage was also associated with a large exothermic effect.</p>

<p>Laser welding led to a decrease in tensile strength to approximately 790 MPa in relation to that of the base material (820 MPa). Similar results were also obtained for MAG welded joints. The rupture took place in the fusion line area and was accompanied by the formation of a structural notch. The reduction of tensile strength was connected with the loss of properties obtained by steel S700MC in the TMCP process. The angle obtained in a bend test amounted to 180°. The above-named angle was obtained in relation to the tension affecting the face side as well as the root side. An impact strength test performed at a temperature of −30 °C revealed very low toughness values. The toughness in the weld area amounted to 23 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, i.e., significantly below an acceptable level of 27 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The toughness in the fusion area was similar to that of the weld. In the HAZ area, toughness amounted to 40 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. Fractographic images made after the impact strength test revealed that the material cracked without any noticeable plastic strain. The fractures of the specimens in the weld area were brittle and glossy with slightly visible drainage areas and single cavities of material extraction, which indicated the deterioration of plastic properties in the weld exposed to very low temperatures. The specimens fractured (using the Charpy pendulum machine) in other areas, i.e., in the fusion line, were also brittle. However, in the HAZ area, the fracture of the previously mentioned specimens was delaminated and predominantly matt with only a slight gloss content (

The previously presented type and shape of the fracture may indicate high material anisotropy, which likely results from the significant plastic strain of the material or from the presence of very small precipitates or impurities. MAG welded joints have significantly higher impact values, especially in the weld area. This is due to the reduced concentration of micro-additives as a result of mixing the base material with the filler material.

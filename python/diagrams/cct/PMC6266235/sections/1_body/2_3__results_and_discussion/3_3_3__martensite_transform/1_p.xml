 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the crystallography of CGHAZ and FGHAZ by EBSD. It is clear that CGHAZ had the larger grain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f007">Figure 7</xref>a) compared with FGHAZ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f007">Figure 7</xref>c). The EBSD superimposed figure in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f007">Figure 7</xref>b–d of band contrast and grain boundaries indicated that the number of boundaries with the misorientation &gt;15° in FGHAZ was greater than in CGHAZ, which means that the effective grain size in FGHAZ was smaller than that in CGHAZ. The comparison is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f007">Figure 7</xref>e. This agreed well with the in situ observation of martensite transformation.

<p>In the ischemia group, during the early stage of spinal cord ischemia and hypoxia, cells undergo glycolysis, presenting as lactic acid accumulation, which can inhibit the tricarboxylic acid cycle, thus, the expression of phosphotriose isomerase and lyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase, as key enzymes of glycolysis, was up regulated, while the expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was down regulated.</p>

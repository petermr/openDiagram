<p>During cooling, competing effects occur, as the increasing supersaturation with decreasing temperature leads to an increasing driving force for precipitation, while the precipitation itself depletes the matrix, leading to a slowed reaction. In addition, the diffusion rate is steadily reduced as cooling progresses, and the lattice misfit between precipitate and matrix changes due to the differing thermal contraction of Al and Si. Indeed, the thermal expansion coefficient of Si is much lower than that of Al, with the difference being higher than most other light-alloyâ€“precipitate combinations. These effects can combine to cause the same phase to form in two morphologies, as also shown for Ni-based superalloys, for instance [

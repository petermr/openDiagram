 </sup>. Our results show changes in the gene expression of RPGs, with differential patterns between pairs of ohnologs when compared to control conditions. Moreover, snoRNA genes are also differentially expressed, revealing additional changes in contributors to ribosomal biogenesis. We show also a differential expression of genes coding for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPGs). A different trend, moreover, characterizes the expression of the proteins of the mitoribosome versus the ones of the cytosolic ribosome.

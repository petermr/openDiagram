<p id="Par14">HTR-8/SVneo cells were seeded at a density of 400,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere for 24 h prior to treatment. Cells were treated for 12 h with medium alone (control) or DCVC (10 or 20 µM). The percentage of cells in each well in G
 <sub>1</sub>/G
 <sub>0</sub>, S, and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phases were measured using the Cell Cycle Phase Determination Kit (Cayman Chemical; Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and flow cytometry, performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This assay uses propidium iodide (PI) to label DNA. Briefly, after exposure, cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA and incubated for 2 min to detach adherent cells from the substrate. After incubation, trypsin was deactivated with FBS-containing medium, and the suspended cells were transferred to 5-ml round-bottom fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes. Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of assay buffer, resuspended in 500 μl of cell fixative assay buffer solution, and chilled for 2 h at − 20 °C. After fixation, cells were washed and resuspended in 500 μl PI staining solution, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and transported to the University of Michigan Flow Cytometry Core for analysis. Cell phases were quantified using a LSRFortessa Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA). Quantification and dye-based visualization were performed using BD FACSDiva Software (BD Sciences). Cell aggregates and cellular debris were excluded using the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) modes and the analysis was performed using 10,000 events per sample. PI was detected using the 488 nm laser.

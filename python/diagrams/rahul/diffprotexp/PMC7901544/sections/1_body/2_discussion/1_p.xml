<p>FAdV-4 is the causative agent for the disease of hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) in chickens. Since its first report in 1987, HHS caused by FAdV-4 has spread globally [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, the outbreak of highly pathogenic FAdV-4 and its co-infection with other viral pathogens in China significantly affect the sustaining development of poultry industry. However, little is known about the molecular basis for the infection and pathogenesis of FAdV-4. Recently, our group and other group both revealed that Fiber-1, but not Fiber-2, directly triggered the viral infection of FAdV-4 via its shaft and knob domains [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Zhang et al. reported that Fiber-2, but not Fiber-1, was identified as one of the major virulent determiners for the highly pathogenic FAdV-4 endemic in China [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In Zhangâ€™s studies, it should be noted that Zhang et al. used the same viral backbone to exchange Fiber-2 or Fiber-1 from the highly pathogenic FAdV-4 with that from the nonpathogenic FAdV-4 to determine the role of Fiber-2 in the highly pathogenic FAdV-4 [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The domain in Fiber-2 or any potential related host factor which determines the virulence of Fiber-2 is not elucidated. In this study, we revealed that Fiber-2 could efficiently interact with host KPNA3/4 and KPNA3/4 could assist the replication of FAdV-4. Except for KPNA3 and KPNA4, several other suspectable and uncharacterized proteins in chicken (Data not shown) with reliability to interact with the Fiber-2 of FAdV-4 were also found in the data from mass spectrum. The interaction between these uncharacterized proteins in chicken and Fiber-2 of FAdV-4, and their potential roles in the pathogenesis of FAdV-4 need to be further investigated.

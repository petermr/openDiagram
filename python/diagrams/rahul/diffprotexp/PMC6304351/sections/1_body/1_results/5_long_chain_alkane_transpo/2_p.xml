<p>The expression of a long-chain fatty acid transport protein (TOL_1625; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) increased ninefold in the presence of 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>28</sub> when compared to 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> with no expression detected on Tween 80 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This protein is a member of the Toluene_X family, which is a family of passive outer membrane transport proteins that include TodX from 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> (implicated in toluene catabolism) and FadL, a group of long-chain fatty acids transporters. Given that FadL family proteins have also recently been implicated in alkane transport across the outer membrane (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Shao, 2014</xref>), TOL_1625 likely allows passive uptake of 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub> into the periplasm (Figure

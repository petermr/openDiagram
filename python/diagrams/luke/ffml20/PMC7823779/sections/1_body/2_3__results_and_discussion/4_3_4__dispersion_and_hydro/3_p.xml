<p>In the results of the RDF diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f006">Figure 6</xref>b), the starting values are the same (0.85 Ã…), but the peak of the NGO/water system is lower than the GO/water system. It means the addition of these two-dimensional materials cannot strengthen the interatomic force, but the atomic aggregation in the NGO system is weaker than the GO system. The addition of GO can absorb more water molecules than NGO. Hence, NGO behaves worse hydrophilicity than GO, which is consistent with the concentration results. It means that NGO is expected to have better storage performance and a longer life span than GO.

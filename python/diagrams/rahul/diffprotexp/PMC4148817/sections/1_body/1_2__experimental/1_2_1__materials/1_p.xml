<p>CNTs were purchased from SES Research (Houston, TX, USA). Based on the manufacturer’s data, SWCNT (#900-1301) (long) were purified single-walled nanotubes with an outer diameter &lt;2 nm and lengths ranging from 5–15 μm. The purity was reported to be &gt;90%CNT (&gt;50% SWCNT) containing ash (&lt;2% wt) and amorphous carbon (&lt;5% wt). Purified MWCNT (# 900-1203) had a reported outer diameter of 40–60 nm with lengths ranging from 5–15 μm. The MWCNT were reported to be &gt;95% nanotubes with low level amorphous carbon (&lt;2%), and ash content (&lt;0.2%). </p>

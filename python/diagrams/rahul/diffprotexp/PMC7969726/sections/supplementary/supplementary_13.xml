  <p>CMPK1 was regulated by CPSF1. CPSF1 was knocked down or overexpressed in HepG2.2.15 and HCCLM3 cells. The mRNA level of CMPK1 
   <bold>(A)</bold> PDUI and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> PSI was determined by qRT-PCR. Statistical significance was calculated by one-sample Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Cell proliferation was detected using the CCK8 assay over five consecutive days. The relative absorbance was measured at OD
   <sub>450</sub>. Statistical data are presented as mean ± SD. *

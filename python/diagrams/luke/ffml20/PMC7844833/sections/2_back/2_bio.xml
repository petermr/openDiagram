 <p>Beatriz Roldan Cuenya is a Professor and Director of the Interface Science Department of the Fritz-Haber Institute of the Max-Planck Society in Berlin Germany. She received her PhD in solid state physics under the guidance of Prof. Werner Keune in 2001 from the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. She then went for a postdoctoral position at the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of California Santa Barbara (USA), where she worked under the supervision of Prof. Eric McFarland from 2001â€“2003. She joined the University of Central Florida (Orlando, USA) as an Assistant Professor of Physics in 2004, and in 2012 she became a full professor. In 2013, she moved back to Germany and became a Chair Professor of the Solid State Physics/Surface Physics group within the Department of Physics at the Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. In 2017, she became the director of the Interface Science Department at the Fritz Haber Institute. She is an honorary Professor at the Technical University of Berlin, Free University of Berlin, and Ruhr University Bochum (Germany), and distinguished Research Professor at the University of Central Florida (USA). Her research interests include studies of structural, electronic, vibrational, and chemical properties of size- and shape-selected nanostructures and their interfaces with gas and liquid environments using advanced synthesis methods and state-of-the-art

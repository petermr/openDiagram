<p>For each sample, 100 μg of protein was dissolved in 100 μL TEAB dissolution buffer and then diluted with 500 μL (50 mM) NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>3</sub>. After the reduction of disulfides and alkylation, 2 μg trypsin was added and then incubated overnight at 37 °C for protein digestion. An equal volume of 0.1% FA was then added for acidizing. Peptides were purified on the Strata-X C18 pillar, which was first activated with methanol and then balanced by adding 1 mL 0.1% FA for three times, washed with 0.1% FA + 5% ACN twice, and eluted with 1 ml 0.1% FA + 80% ACN. Eluted peptides were then dried with a vacuum concentration meter. The dried peptide powder was re-dissolved with 20 μL (0.5 M) TEAB for peptide labelling.

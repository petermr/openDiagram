<p id="Par13">Once the animals had learnt the reaching task (typically 4 weeks training) surgical implants of recording electrodes were made (see below). Following full recovery from the surgery, daily recording sessions commenced in which the cats performed approximately 80 food-rewarded reaching trials before they became sated and the session was stopped, and they were returned to their home pen. The progression of each recording session followed that of the human study and was divided into three stages. Stage 1: twenty baseline trials were obtained in which unperturbed reaching was performed and animals rapidly and smoothly placed their forepaw into the target reward tube. Stage 2: visuomotor adaptation trials in which a set of custom made 40 dioptre Fresnel laterally displacing prism glasses were placed in the animal’s line of sight (approximately 2 cm in front of the eyes). Initial trials in the presence of the prism glasses led to reaches laterally missing the entrance of the target reward tube. Adaptation to successfully reach into the target occurred after approximately 10 trials. After 20 consecutive accurate reaches, the prism glasses were removed. Stage 3: immediately after removal of the prism glasses the cats exhibited lateral misses to the opposite side of the tube, indicative of a motor adaptation aftereffect.</p>

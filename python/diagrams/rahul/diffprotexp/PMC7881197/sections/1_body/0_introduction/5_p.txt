0: AS6 is another arsenic compound that has been investigated and developed as an anticancer drug 25  29.
1: It has been suggested that AS6 has distinctive anticancer effects from arsenic trioxide 30.
2: Two recent studies indicated that AS6 induces apoptosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and autophagy in colon cancers 26.
3: Using targeted approaches, the studies suggested that AS6 induces cell death through effects on the p38 MAPK pathways in a colon cancer cell line, SW620 cells 26.
4: Another study reported that AS6 inhibits NF-B to stimulate TNF--induced cell death in MCF7 cells 31.
5: In spite of these efforts, the effects and anticancer mechanisms of AS6 on human cells are not completely understood and require unbiased approaches to identify them.
6: In addition, it is important to determine whether AS6 differentially affects normal and cancerous cells and to what extent.

0: The clean reads obtained from the RNA sequencing were then aligned with the human reference genome database using Bowtie2 software.
1: The back-splice algorithm was subsequently conducted to select for read junctions.
2: The CIRI software was used to predict and annotate the circRNAs from all mapped reads.
3: The differential expression levels of circRNAs in human BMSCs induced by MEL treatment after osteogenic differentiation induction were determined by calculating the RPKM (mapped back-splicing junction reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) value, which was calibrated to the total read numbers.
4: The significantly differential expression of circRNAs or mRNAs in MEL-treated BMSCs compared with BMSCs was determined using a log2Ratio of > 1 combined with a false discovery rate of< 0.05.
5: The differential expression of circRNAs and mRNAs were further analyzed by hierarchical clustering and scatter plots, which were established using the R software package (Version 0.2.3).
6: Subsequently, the functional categorization of differentially expressed mRNAs based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms was done by searching the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery.
7: The enrichment of differentially expressed mRNAs in signaling pathways was done by searching the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
8: The interaction between circRNA, microRNA, and mRNAs was predicted using String V10 software.

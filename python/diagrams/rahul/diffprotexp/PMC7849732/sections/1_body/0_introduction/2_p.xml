<p>The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is a critical site for pain transmission and modulation in the central nervous system (CNS). Based on the Rexed classification of transverse spinal sections [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], two main divisions of the dorsal horn include the superficial dorsal horn (SDH), composed of laminae I and II, and the deep dorsal horn (DDH), composed of laminae III to VI. The latter is marginally involved in processing noxious stimuli, with neural circuits that are primarily dedicated to processing non-nociceptive somatosensory inputs [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, the SDH consists of a complex nociceptive network that integrates sensory signals from peripheral nociceptive afferents with local interneuron processing as well as descending efferent modulation from the brain [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among the afferents that innervate the SDH, peptidergic nociceptive fibers that release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) terminate onto lamina I and the outer portion of lamina II [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with some collaterals that reach deeper laminae [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, CGRP is an excellent marker of the outermost, nociceptive portion of the SDH.

 <caption> Distribution of water molecules in the water subpopulations labelled as bulk‐like (blue) and slow (red) reorienting water dipoles for the 0.6 mol kg −1 MgCl 2 solution. Number of water molecules per MgCl 2 units. Slow water molecules compared to bulk water molecules are in 6 from the first shell of Mg plus 9 (beyond shell), corresponding to h=15 per MgCl 2 units. </caption>

<p>An additional 14, 5, and 1 non-NEK kinases as well as 3, 5, and 1 phosphatases were differentially expressed in WB-MtzR, 106-MtzR, and 713-MtzR, respectively. In 106-MtzR 3 regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) activity were upregulated (9058, 4079, 17 538), while inositol 5-phosphatase 4 (9077) and another serine/threonine phosphatase (2053) were downregulated. In 713-MtzR the single serine/threonine phosphatase (2053) observed as downregulated was upregulated in the WB-MtzR line. Similarly, an additional 2 phosphatases in WB-MtzR were upregulated, including the PP2Ac phosphatase (5010), known to regulate encystation [

Of the 14 differentially expressed, non-NEK kinases in WB-MtzR, 12 were upregulated, including a putative ethanolamine/choline kinase, while the 5 additional non-NEK kinases detected in 106-MtzR were downregulated, including a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (gPI4P5K) (13 606) involved in lipid-based signaling [

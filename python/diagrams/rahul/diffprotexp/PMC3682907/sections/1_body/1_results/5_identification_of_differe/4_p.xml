<p>The appearance of a number of components of electron transport chain complexes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6b1, subunit 6C, and subunit 4; NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 3, alpha subcomplex subunit 2, Fe-S protein 4, and Fe-S protein 6; and ATP synthase subunit e) among the list of potential differentially expressed proteins is interesting given the identification of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (32), subunit 5a (30), and subunit 5b (30, 31) as being differentially expressed in EAE or MS in previous studies. A recent proteomics study of spinal cord during the clinical course of EAE (33) identified 35 differentially expressed proteins out of 800 spots observed by 2D PAGE, including proteins involved in energy pathways and cell growth, and transport processes. Only a few mitochondrial proteins were differentially expressed, and none correspond to the mitochondrial proteins described here. Farias et al (33) found decreased expression of vacuolar ATPase subunit B in EAE relative to controls, while we observe vacuolar ATPase subunit G2 (Atp6v1g2) in differentially expressed band Q5. This V-type proton ATPase mediates the acidification of intracellular compartments.</p>

0: DNA microarray analysis has now become a standard tool for molecular studies of cancer [ 11].
1: The ability to complement this approach with methods of proteomic analysis [ 12] is crucial for identification of proteins that may serve as targets for new antibody-based therapeutic strategies [ 13].
2: Such proteomic research is particularly important for the characterization of gene products contributing to the metastatic potential of cancer [ 14].
3: Molecular screening of metastases by proteomic analysis has been done in several previous studies, including investigations of breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [ 15 17].
4: However, there has been little proteomic analysis of clinical samples of gynecological malignancies, including brain metastases.

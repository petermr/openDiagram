<p>SELDI-MS workflows enable the rapid analysis of a large numbers of protein samples and can generate patterns of differentially expressed proteins that may distinguish disease states from controls. However, protein identification usually requires separate purification of the proteins of interest by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to trypsin digestion and peptide mass fingerprint analysis, and confirmation of protein identity by Western blotting analysis. Unambiguous identification of differentially expressed proteins can be difficult if protein bands obtained from 1D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) consist of several proteins with similar molecular weights. However, the subcellular fractionation of the sample into cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions combined with ion exchange fractionation prior to 1D PAGE employed in the current work is actually a multi-dimensional separation, albeit with low resolution fractionations (3 subcellular fractions and 6 ion exchange fractions) for the first two steps, and one might expect more success in resolving individual proteins than with 1D PAGE alone.</p>

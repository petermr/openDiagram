It is observed that anode sheet layers (size about 5–10 μm) are uniformly dispersed with little agglomeration and have a porous structure (

An increased number of macropores enhances the specific surface area of electrodes and provides more channels for the transport of ions. In addition, the interpenetrating macroporous structure can reduce the resistance of ion transport and polymer chain scission migration while increasing the ionic conductivity.

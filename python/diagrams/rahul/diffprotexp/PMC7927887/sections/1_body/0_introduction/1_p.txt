0: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disorder and is the second most common hematological malignancy diagnosed in the United States.
1: MM is characterized by primary etiologic events involving the gain of odd numbered chromosomes seen in 50% of patients and structural variants involving rearrangement to the immunoglobulin loci.
2: These structural variants result in the relocation of a super-enhancer in proximity to an oncogene, resulting in its over-expression.
3: These events subdivide non-hyperdiploid MM into 5 main groups: t(4;14) (12%), t(6;14) (1%), t(11;14) (15%), t(14;16) (3%) and t(14;20) (2%).
4: 1,  2 Despite extensive work to characterize the myeloma genome, sequencing studies have only identified 63 key driver genes.
5: 1 The median number of driver events per sample is five, but in a subset of samples none are detectable suggesting that we are missing drivers.
6: Missing drivers may either be located in the non-coding genome or involve a mechanism that is difficult to demonstrate.
7: Alternative splicing is one such mechanism that has the potential to be a significant driver of disease.
8: 3-7 It is estimated that 90% of protein-coding genes undergo alternative splicing to produce multiple transcripts.
9: 8 Disruption of the splicing mechanism has the potential to have a large impact on the transcriptome and ultimately key regulatory pathways.

 <caption> (A) Spectral counts (means ± SE; n = 4) of differentially expressed chemotaxis proteins during growth on a medium-chain alkane ( n-C 14,), a long-chain alkane ( n-C 28,) and a non-hydrocarbon control (Tween 80) in Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1. ∗ denotes spectral counts significantly greater ( P &lt; 0.05) during growth on n-C 28 relative to growth on n-C 14 and TW. MCP, methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein; CheW, purine binding chemotaxis protein; CheA, histidine kinase. (B) Proposed chemotactic response of Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1 to long-chain alkanes. The cytoplasmic side of the MCP dimers interacts with two proteins CheW and CheA. When the MCP is not bound to an attractant, it stimulates CheA to phosphorylate itself using ATP. CheA auto-phosphorylation is inhibited when the attractant is bound to its MCP. CheW physically bridges CheA to the MCPs to allow regulated phosphotransfer to CheY. Phosphorylated CheY phosphorylates the basal body FliM which is connected to the flagellum. </caption>

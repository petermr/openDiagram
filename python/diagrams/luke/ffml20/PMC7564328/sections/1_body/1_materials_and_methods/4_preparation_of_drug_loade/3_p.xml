<p id="p0075">The preparation of SCU@DEX@CD-MOF was similar to that of SCU@CD-MOF. Generally, DEX and SCU were added into 100 mL ethanol at the molar ratio of 1:1 and 1:2 respectively, and then 726.5 mg of CD-MOF was added. After incubation, the obtained mixtures were washed and thoroughly dried under vacuum. DEX@CD-MOF at the molar ratio of 2:1 was prepared in the same way.</p>

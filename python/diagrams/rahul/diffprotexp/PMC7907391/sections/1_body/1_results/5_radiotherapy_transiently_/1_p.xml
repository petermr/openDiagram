 </sup> study, 5-mm biopsies of buccal mucosa were collected before, during (after day 7 of radiotherapy), and after radiotherapy (20 days post-radiotherapy) in eight patients with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. Using this publicly available data set (GSE103412), we investigated how radiation could modulate the expression of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CTSL</italic> in these samples. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> outlines the temporal expression patterns of these three genes. There were consistent trends towards elevation of gene expression during radiotherapy for all viral entry genes (
 <italic>ACE2</italic>: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.17; 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.34; 
 <italic>CTSL</italic>: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008). Post-radiotherapy, there was a decrease of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> and 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> below baseline levels, but a trend towards persistent elevation of 
 <italic>CTSL</italic>.

  <p>Expression of proinflammatory cytokines by Western blot analysis in myocardial tissue on d 7 and 14 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 in each group). (a) and (b) are the absolute intensity ratio of proinflammatory cytokines on d 7 and 14, respectively. On d 7, VMC mice with vagotomy exhibited significantly higher expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Whereas pnu282987 administration decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in VMC and VMC+Vag mice. No obvious differences were observed in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines across the five myocarditis groups on d 14. Data are expressed as means ± SD. *

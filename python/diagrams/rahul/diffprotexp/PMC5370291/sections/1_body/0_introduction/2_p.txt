0: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) possesses multipotent bioactivity that mediates various cellular responses, including proliferation, proinflammatory factor production, and cell death.
1: Particularly, TNF is known to involve in the pathophysiology of multiple liver disorders such viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injury.
2: The roles of TNF in liver injury acts as not only a mediator of cell death but also an inducer of cell proliferation  4,  5.
3: Moreover, continuous TNF production during chronic inflammation is reported to dysregulate diverse signaling cascades, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis  6.
4: For example, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) signaling that can be efficiently and specifically activated by trimeric form of TNF has been known to be closely associated with tumorigenesis  7.
5: Recently, high level of TNF has been recognized as an independent predictor of poor survival in HCC patients, and the combination of anti-TNF treatment and 5'-fluorouracil can promote apoptosis of HCC cells  8.

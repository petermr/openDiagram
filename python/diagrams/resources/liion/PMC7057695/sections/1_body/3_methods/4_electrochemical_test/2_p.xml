<p>The charge and discharge performance and open-circuit voltage of different SODs were examined by a LANHE CT2001A battery tester. The temperature is controlled by a programmable temperature-controlled incubator. Because the volume of the battery is very small compared with the incubator, we use the incubator temperature to represent the battery temperature. The SOD was adjusted by discharging at 0.1 C.</p>

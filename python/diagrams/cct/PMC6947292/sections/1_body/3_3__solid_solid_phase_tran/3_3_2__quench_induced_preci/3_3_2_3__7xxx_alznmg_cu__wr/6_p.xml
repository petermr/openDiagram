 <sub>2</sub> takes place on dispersoids. At least for Al
 <sub>3</sub>Zr dispersoids, it has also been shown that their nucleation activity for quench-induced η-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub> is dependent on the interface relation of the dispersoid to the matrix [

 <xref rid="B194-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>], and only incoherent Al
 <sub>3</sub>Zr dispersoid particles appear to be active nucleation sites for η-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub>. Al
 <sub>3</sub>Zr dispersoids are typically coherent with the Al matrix, although after thermo-mechanical processing, recrystallisation can occur. This recrystallisation in the Al matrix can change the interface of the dispersoid towards incoherence. An example of this phenomenon is seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f052">Figure 52</xref>, which shows a TEM image of hot-rolled 7150 [

 <xref rid="B194-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Subgrains and recrystallised grains were distinguished by the lattice orientation, as revealed by SEM-EBSD (see Refs. [

 <xref rid="B194-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>] for details). Quench-induced η-Mg(Zn,Al,Cu)
 <sub>2</sub> particles are found at subgrain-boundaries and in the recrystallised grain shown on the left, nucleated on incoherent Al
 <sub>3</sub>Zr dispersoids. However, in the non-recrystallised subgrains, the coherent Al
 <sub>3</sub>Zr dispersoids do not have quench-induced precipitates attached.

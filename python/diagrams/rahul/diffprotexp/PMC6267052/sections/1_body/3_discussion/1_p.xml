<p id="Par24">Articular cartilage remains the most studied tissue in OA, but the knowledge about the meniscus is still limited. In this study, a comparison of knee articular cartilage and meniscus was made in order to gain new knowledge of its composition and also to evaluate two analytical methods for MS: DDA and DIA. We identified several differences between the articular cartilage and meniscus proteome.</p>

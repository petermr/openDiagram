<p id="Par77">In vivo as MN axons extend, they have the potential to terminate on a muscle fiber at a cholinergic synapse, the site of ACh neurotransmission. In the pre-synaptic neuron, ACh synthesis is driven by choline O-acetyltransferase (ChAT) and we observed 
 <italic>ChAT</italic> gene expression to be increased in both eMNs and MNs. Expression of ion-channel-coupled nAChR subunits were also significantly altered: 
 <italic>CHRNA3</italic> was regulated in NSCs but downregulated in MNs and 
 <italic>CHRNA4</italic> was upregulated at the eMN stage. In the postsynaptic membrane these receptor components would contribute to neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions as previously described. Gene expression of acetylcholinesterase (
 <italic>AChE</italic>) was significantly increased late in MNs maturation (D18-D28), which encodes an enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of ACh into choline and acetic acid, a critical step in ACh recycling in the cholinergic synapse. Membrane transporter solute carrier family 5 member 7 (SLC5A7) is then able to import choline back into a cholinergic neuron for subsequent ACh synthesis. We found gene expression of 
 <italic>SLC5A7</italic> to be increased in both the eMNs and mature MNs.

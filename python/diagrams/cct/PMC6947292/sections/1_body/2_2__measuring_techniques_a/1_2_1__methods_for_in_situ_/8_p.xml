<p>Since precipitation is an exothermic process, and dissolution an endothermic one, they can be detected by thermal analysis. Cavazos and Colas used direct thermal analysis of Jominy-like end-quench samples, i.e., they evaluated the changes in slope of the measured temperature development at different positions in the sample [

   <p>With regard to the abovementioned detection limits, DSC offers the highest sensitivity of all techniques over the whole dynamic range. In particular, precipitation of any precipitate size and very small volume fractions of precipitation can be detected by DSC, and even cluster formation can be recorded [

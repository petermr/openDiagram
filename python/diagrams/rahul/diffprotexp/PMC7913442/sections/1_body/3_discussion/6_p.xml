<p id="Par46">An important result in our study came from the transcriptomic assessment of the onco-suppressor FOXO1 effect in our system. FOXO1 is the most abundantly expressed member of FOXO gene family, and regulates vital cellular processes including the cell cycle, apoptosis, energy homeostasis and ROS catabolism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. We previously studied the functional interaction between FOXO1, FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and it has been revealed the role of FOXO1 in the inhibition of CYP19 expression induced by the complex FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>/SMAD3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, FOXO1 had no influence on FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> action, indicating that its inhibitory action targets selectively on FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>-induced CYP19 expression in the presence of SMAD3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The FOXO1 competition with FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> in binding SMAD3 was the suggested hypothetic underlying molecular mechanism since literature has showed that FOXO1 can partner with SMAD3 in different biological occurrences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and can sequestrate it from FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Insulin signaling through the PI3K-AKT pathway is the main modulator of FOXO1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. FOXO1 phosphorylation during PI3K-AKT signaling promotes its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm and its consequent inactivation and proteasomal degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The activation of PI3K-AKT signaling is common across many tumor types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and the inactivation of FOXO1 in response to PI3K-AKT represents a common mechanism by which neoplastic cells prevent apoptosis and physiological cell cycle arrest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. It is well known that AKT inhibits FOXO through direct phosphorylation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Notably, FOXO1 can be indirectly targeted via the action of AKT inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].

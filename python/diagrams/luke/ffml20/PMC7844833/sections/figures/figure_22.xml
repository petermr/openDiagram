  <p>(a) White line region of Pt L
   <sub>3</sub>-edge XANES data for Al
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub>-supported Pt
   <sub>22</sub> NPs in H
   <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at pressures from 1 up to 21 bar. Spectra for a Pt foil and Pt NPs in He are also shown for comparison. (b) Difference spectra corresponding to different pressures, calculated by subtracting the spectrum acquired in He atmosphere. (c) H/Pt ratio calculated from the area of peak B in the difference spectra, compared with theoretical H/Pt ratios from ref (

   <sub>22</sub> NP model shapes are shown in the inset. Reproduced with permission from ref (

   <sub>3</sub>-edge XANES peak shown in panel (a) correlates with the (d) hydrogen-coverage-dependent shift of the center of unoccupied d-band states, as obtained in DFT simulations. Reproduced from ref (

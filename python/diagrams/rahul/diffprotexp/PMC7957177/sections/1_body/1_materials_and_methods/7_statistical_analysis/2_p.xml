<p>The absolute logFC value of the difference between the two group &gt;1, and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 is the standard of significantly differential expression. Due to the heterogeneity of IOD variance in different groups, the post hoc test was performed for the IHC results. Error bars for the experiments represent the standard deviation of the mean value (mean value ±S.D.). SPSS24 software was used to analyse all IHC results and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

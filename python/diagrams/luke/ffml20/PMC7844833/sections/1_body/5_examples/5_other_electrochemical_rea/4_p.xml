<p>Pd- and Au-based catalysts have also been considered for alcohol electrooxidation reactions due to their enhanced stability against CO poisoning. In particular, in a recent study of Au NPs for 2-propanol oxidation, 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS measurements revealed the presence of cationic Au species in the as-prepared samples due to a pretreatment in an O
 <sub>2</sub>-plasma. The cationic species, however, quickly became reduced under reaction conditions. Moreover, an increase in the average NP size was observed under reaction conditions, which was linked to the observed decrease in activity.

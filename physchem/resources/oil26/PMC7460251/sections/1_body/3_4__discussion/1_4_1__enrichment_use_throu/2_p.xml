<p>There was, however, some evidence to suggest that the aardvarks did find some of the exploring enrichment rewarding, as shown by the continued use of these items throughout the night. The aardvarks significantly decreased their use of foraging enrichment after the evening period, presumably due to the items being depleted of food. Although we do not know if the olfactory enrichment held its scent throughout the night, the aardvarks were more likely to spend time investigating the exploring enrichment compared to foraging enrichment during the last observation period of the night (04:00–05:00). Decreases in enrichment use over an animal’s active period are expected and have been documented [

The duration of engagement with specific enrichment items and stated enrichment goals could potentially be used to target behaviors that occur at a particular time of day or (in the case of nocturnal animals) night, when keepers are not present.

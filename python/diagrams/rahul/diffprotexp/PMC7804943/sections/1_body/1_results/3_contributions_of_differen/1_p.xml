<p id="Par11">We performed an in-depth examination of LF1, in which GE, and AS contribute to regional differences between CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). To quantify the correlation between a feature (e.g., differential GE or AS event) from each layer and the variation described by a factor, MOFA assigns each feature a score or loading. Hence, loadings with larger magnitudes indicate a stronger correlation or anti-correlation with a factor. To confirm that LF1 describes variation between CA1 and CA3, we compared the loadings assigned to features in the GE layer with the log
 <sub>2</sub> fold changes in GE (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Indeed, we observe a strong correlation between these two measurements (Pearson correlation

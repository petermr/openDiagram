<p>Another characteristic seen in lung lesions was depressed innate and adaptive immune functions. As expected, combined treatment with FPI and Ibuprofen, when started on the third day after infection, set this treatment group far apart from the placebo, especially in regard to pathways related to the innate and adaptive immune response to the pathogen in both LL and LN. Due to more advanced stages of the recovery process by day 10 post infection when tissues were harvested, most of the innate immune functions in the group treated with FPI and Ibuprofen for the longest time (group 6) were already reduced when compared to the placebo. But the highest level of difference was observed between group 6 and group 2 as they were on the opposite sides of the spectrum of viral loads as measured by viral shedding. Building upon the knowledge base this study has generated, future studies in which tissue samples are acquired earlier in the disease process could be designed to further demonstrate the mechanisms by which treatment with a COX inhibitor with and without an anti-viral agent can alter BRSV pathogenesis.</p>

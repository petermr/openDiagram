<p id="Par33">The primary aim of this study was to assess whether the pre-movement beta signals in the motor cortex contained information relating to adaptive processes, that could indicate enhanced sensorimotor processing and adaptive drive. In the human EEG data, GLMM analysis revealed a significant main effect of adaptation condition for both contralateral (F(5,893) = 31.57, p &lt; 0.0005, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) and ipsilateral hemispheres (F(5,743) = 67.79, p &lt; 0.0005, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that Early Adaptation trials had significantly lower contralateral beta power compared to all other epochs (p ≤ 0.013), while ipsilateral beta was only significantly decreased compared to the baseline epoch (p = 0.031).

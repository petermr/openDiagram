<p>An interesting observation from Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> is that much lesser proportion of proteins in cell cycle pathway is differentially connected between the two groups of patients in KIRC compared to LUAD and HNSC. So underlying molecular mechanisms related to cell cycle pathway may be a little different in KIRC compared to LUAD and HNSC.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. The specimens were finely minced using surgical blade before being digested in 0.6% type-II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at 37°C for 14 hours. This was followed by a centrifugation at 500

 <sup>2 </sup>in DMEM/Ham's F-12 Nutrient Mixture (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.0025% ascorbic acid and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS) (Gibco, USA). The cells were then incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 14 days, the cultured cells were used at passage 2 for cell differentiation assay.

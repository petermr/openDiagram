<p id="Par20">Expression plasmid encoding N-terminally Flag-tagged hFOXO1-3A (#13,508) was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, pCDNA3 backbone). FOXO1-3A has Ala residue substitutions at Thr-24, Ser-256 and Ser-319 and is thus constitutively active. The usage of this mutant was based on the fact that protein remains in the nucleus due to the inability of insulin/growth factor signaling to phosphorylate the mutated residues. Like FOXL2 wild type (FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup>), the FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> mutant is also localized in the nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and thus FOXO1-3A is the best construct for our transcriptomic study. N-terminally Flag-tagged human FOXL2wt (pCS2 + backbone) was kindly given by Dr. Louise Bilezikjian [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and its mutant (FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>) was made in our laboratory as previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The expression plasmids encoding human SMAD3 were kindly provided by Drs. Kohei Miyazono [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and Louise Bilezikjian [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

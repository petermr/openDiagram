<p>The zeolite H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 25, obtained from Zeolyst International, was calcined in air at 500 °C for 24 h. The BET surface area and total pore volume of the calcined zeolite are 390 m

 <sup>–1</sup> and 0.23 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively. Mesopore surface area determined by t-plot method is 34 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup> indicating that the total surface area of the zeolite is mainly arising from micropores.

<p id="Par56">Cytoscape analysis of two potential biomarker proteins that were exclusively expressed on P3, Parvin and SPARC, revealed potential binding partners relevant to their function (data not shown). Parvin was found to putatively interact with Ilk, whereas SPARC was found to associate with the Kcnma1, also known as the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, or BK. CoIP and reciprocal coIP was used to verify these putative protein-protein interactions. The immunocomplex capture method was used for the coIP and reciprocal coIP of Parvin with Ilk and SPARC with Kcnma1. Kcnma1 coprecipitated SPARC as demonstrated by a peptide species of 50 kDa and SPARC coprecipitated BK as demonstrated by a peptide species of 135 kDa (Fig.

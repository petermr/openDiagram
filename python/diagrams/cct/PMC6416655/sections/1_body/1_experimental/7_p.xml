<p id="p0060">Because the in-situ segregation detection could only provide the overall segregation image in a large area, the small area segregation detection was realized by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS, S3400N, Hitachi, Japan) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA, JXA-8530F, Jeol, Japan) to study the mechanism of cracking. The measurements were loaded with sample obtained in the same width direction of the slab.</p>

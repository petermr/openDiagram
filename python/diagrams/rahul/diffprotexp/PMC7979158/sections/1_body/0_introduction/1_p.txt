0: Epidemiological association between maternal infection and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has been found for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), anxiety, and major depressive disorder (MDD) ( Brown, 2011;  Estes and McAllister, 2015;  Parboosing et al., 2013;  Patterson, 2009).
1: Indeed, maternal immune activation (MIA) itself is sufficient to produce NDD-relevant outcomes in offspring in animal models ( Canetta et al., 2014;  Machado et al., 2015).
2: Offspring from female mice exposed to the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist and viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], and offspring in maternal immune activation models using the bacterial mimic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( Depino, 2015;  O'Loughlin et al., 2017;  Simoes et al., 2018), recapitulate neuropathologies and aberrant behaviors seen in offspring born to flu-infected dams ( Shi et al., 2003;  Smith et al., 2007).
3: MIA in mice produces behavioral and cognitive abnormalities with relevance across multiple NDD diagnostic boundaries ( Estes and McAllister, 2016;  Malkova et al., 2012;  Richetto et al., 2014).

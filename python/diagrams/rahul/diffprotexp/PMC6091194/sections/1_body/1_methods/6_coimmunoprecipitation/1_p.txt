0: Lysates were prepared from 16 P3 CBA/J mice cochleae sensory epithelia.
1: The lysate for each experiment was divided equally into three tubes and diluted ~ 2 fold with lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 500 g/mL AEBSF, 10 g/mL leupeptin, 100 g/mL pepstatin, 2 g/mL aprotinin, and 1 mg/mL microcystin.
2: One tube was used for an IP of the protein itself (positive control), the second was used to coprecipitate a partner, while the third tube was used as a negative control.
3: IPs were performed using the immunocomplex capture method by first adding 5 g of either anti-Kcnma1 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon; aa 11841200 of mouse Kcnma1) or anti-integrin-linked protein kinase polyclonal antibody (Proteintech Group) to two of three tubes containing lysate and then incubating by rocking for 1 h at 4 C. Negative controls consisted of incubating lysate in the third tube with ChromPure rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories).
4: Thirty L of rec-Protein G Sepharose 4B Beads (Invitrogen) were then added to the three samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 C. Immunocomplexed beads were washed 1X in PBS, 3X in PBS/0.1% Triton x-100, 1X in PBS, and immunocomplexes recovered by heating at 95 C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma-Aldrich).
5: Samples were fractionated on a 7.5% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences).
6: Blots were blocked at RT for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20] with 4.5% milk and probed with either anti-SPARC polyclonal antibody at 1:1000 (Proteintech Group) or anti-Parvin polyclonal antibody at 1:800 (Proteintech Group) with rocking O/N at 4 C to determine the Kcnma1 and Ilk coprecipitates, respectively.
7: The secondary antibody for both consisted of a mouse anti-rabbit light chain at 1:15,000 with rocking at RT for 1 h. Bands were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and Magic Mark XP (Invitrogen) was used as the standard.

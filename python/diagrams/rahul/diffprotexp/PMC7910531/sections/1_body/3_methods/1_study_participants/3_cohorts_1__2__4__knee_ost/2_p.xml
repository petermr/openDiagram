<p id="Par26">We confirmed a joint replacement for osteoarthritis, with no history of significant knee surgery (apart from meniscectomy), knee infection, or fracture, and no malignancy within the previous 5 years. We further confirmed that no patient used glucocorticoid use (systemic or intra-articular) within the previous 6 months, or any other drug associated with immune modulation. For cohort 1, cartilage samples were scored using the OARSI cartilage classification system

 </sup>. From each patient, we obtained one sample with high OARSI grade signifying high-grade degeneration ('high-grade sample'), and one cartilage sample with low OARSI grade signifying healthy tissue or low-grade degeneration ('low-grade sample').

 <italic>Materials Characterization</italic>: Phase structure was characterized via XRD analysis by Rigaku Deskto X‐ray diffractometer (Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The XRD samples were wrapped in transparent tape and then fixed on the specimen holder. To avoid oxidation, the whole procedure was conducted in Ar‐filled glove‐box (O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O &lt; 0.5 ppm). The XRD spectrum of the tape was also tested. The morphology was characterized by SEM (Hitachi SU8010, Japan). The SEM samples were loaded into a transfer vessel under Ar protection which could be opened inside the SEM. The ex situ XRD and SEM samples were obtained from the disassembled batteries and they were washed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) followed by subsequent drying in Ar‐filled glove‐box overnight. To study the affinity of Li and the skeleton, the round composite ingot and Li plate were respectively heated on the Al foil on a hot plate to 300 °C in Ar‐filled glove.

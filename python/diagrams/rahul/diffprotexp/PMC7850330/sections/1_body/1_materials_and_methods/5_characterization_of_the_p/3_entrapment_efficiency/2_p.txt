0: Centrifugation method was employed to establish the entrapment efficiency of the co-loaded loratidine and sulpiride nanoemulsion (Prabhakar et al.,  2013).
1: Briefly, 2.0  mL sample was centrifuged at 3500  rpm for 15  minutes.
2: The aqueous phase or the supernatant was separated, while the residue was washed two times with distilled water and recentrifuged to ensure entire separation of the free drugs.
3: The separated supernatants were added together, mixed with equivalent volume of ethanol, and mixed for five minutes using a vortex mixer.
4: The amount of free loratadine and sulpiride was established by measuring the spectrophotometric absorbance at 395 and 218  nm respectively using a-1900PC UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shanghai Puyuan Instrument Co., LRD, China) and adopting ultraviolet spectroscopy chemometric technique (Gad et al.,  2013; Sood et al.,  2014).
5: The drug amounts entrapped in the oil phase were estimated by calculating the difference between the total drug amount incorporated and the free drug amount detected in the aqueous phase.
6: Entrapment efficiency (%EE) was computed using the subsequent equation:  EE (%) = W entrapped drugW initial drug 100

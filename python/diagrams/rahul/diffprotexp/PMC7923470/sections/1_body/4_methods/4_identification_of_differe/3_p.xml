<p id="Par64">After analyzing the expression of genes, we selected five DEGs (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">7</xref>) that showed varied expression in WT and MT pseudostems and performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on a Rotor-Gene 6000 machine (Qiagen, Shanghai, China) as following. cDNAs were synthesized from RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem, MA, US). Two constitutively expressed genes i.e. 
 <italic>Actin</italic> (F:CTCCTATGTTGCTCGCTTATG, R:GGCTACTACTTCGGTTCTTTC) and Histone 
 <italic>H3.3</italic> (F:GCGGTAATAGGAGTGAAGTC, R: TCAGCCTCAGCCAATGGCAC) were used as reference [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The temperature profiles, reagents, and volumes for PCR reactions were similar to previously described conditions [

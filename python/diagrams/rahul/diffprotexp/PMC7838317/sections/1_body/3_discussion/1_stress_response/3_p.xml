<p id="Par17">The up-regulation of transcripts coding for antioxidant enzymes suggests that captive mussels were also subjected to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are natural byproducts of aerobic metabolism, however stress can disrupt the balance between production and elimination and lead to increased ROS levels, i.e. oxidative stress, and consequently damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA

 </sup>. Because ROS are eliminated by antioxidants, the up-regulation of numerous antioxidant transcripts indicates that captive mussels were experiencing oxidative stress. The increased presence of antioxidants could be caused by a wide variety of stressors, similar to our findings regarding heat shock proteins. Environmental factors that may cause oxidative stress in aquatic organisms include changes in temperature, oxygen availability, metal ions, and pollutants

 </sup> found that freshwater mussels living downstream of an urban area were exposed to complex mixtures of contaminants and exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress. The FMCRC is supplied with flow-through water from the Scioto River, mimicking ambient temperature and food availability. The Scioto and Muskingum Rivers are both large river systems but episodic or persistent variation in any of the aforementioned environmental variables could potentially cause stress in translocated mussels.

<p>The increased risk of coronary artery complications in patients with KD results in increased morbidity and mortality. The pathological processes of coronary artery lesions include endothelial dysfunction, the destruction of the internal elastic lamina, thrombocytosis and hypercoagulability. CAD and CAA are the main complications of KD, and may cause cardiovascular events (

In the present study, serum protein level differences between healthy volunteers, patients with CAD and patients with CAA were investigated. The results suggested that several pathways, including those involved in the response to wounding, lipoprotein remodeling, platelet activation and blood coagulation, may differ between healthy volunteers, patients with CAD and patients with CAA.

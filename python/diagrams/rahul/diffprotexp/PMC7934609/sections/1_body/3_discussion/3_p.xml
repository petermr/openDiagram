<p>In our study, we found that paramyosin were significantly expressed in the oncosphere, when compared with adults and the protoscolex, respectively. The expression level of the protein between the oncosphere and adults differed by 2.906 times, while between the oncosphere and the protoscolex there was a difference of 3.224 times, reaching a significant level of difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). A previous report showed that the paramyosin of 
 <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> can evade immune attack by combining with the host complement during the process of infecting mice [

 <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We speculated that it appears in the oncosphere with strong invasion ability. The highly expressed protein may also have similar effects. In addition, the host infected by 
 <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> has an obvious feature, i.e., after the formation of stable solid endoparasites (adults) and intractable lesions (CE cyst) at the later stage of infection, the host’s immune attack and rejection capabilities are significantly reduced. We speculated that the paramyosin protein antibodies may become candidate markers for detecting echinococcosis infection during the early stage of infection, especially for the oncosphere. Meanwhile, there is also potential for paramyosin to become an epitope vaccine against CE, as other reports have shown in other parasites and hosts [

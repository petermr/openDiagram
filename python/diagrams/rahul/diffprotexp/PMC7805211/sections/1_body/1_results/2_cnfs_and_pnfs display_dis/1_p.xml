<p id="Par8">Next, we sought to determine if nuclear organization and higher-ordered chromatin states differed between CNFs and PNFs. Chromosomal DNA is organized into A/B compartments that largely correspond to being either transcriptionally active DNA compartments (A compartment) or silenced DNA compartments (B compartment) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As such, DNA compartmentalization is a critical determinant of gene expression leading to cell fate determination and coordinated tissue development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Typically, chromatin compartments are identified using HiC or other assays to directly measure long-range chromatin contacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, it has been demonstrated that Infinium Human Methylation 450K or EPIC array can reconstruct higher-order chromatin structure similar to HiC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, we inferred A/B group-level compartments in CNF and PNFs at 100 kb resolution. We show that the 3D genomic organization between CNFs and PNFs is 80–85% concordant whereas 15–20% of the compartments are inverted or discordant between CNF and PNFs. This discordance of PNF and CNFs compartments is observed genome-wide (X chromosomes were not assessed) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). These data provide additional support that CNFs and PNFs possess distinct epigenomes. Given that individual CpG methylation changes and associated effects are difficult to interpret in isolation unless they are placed in the context of neighboring CpG loci and summarized into region-level changes, we used the differentially methylated probes identified above to call 6,004 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs; 
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) using DMRcate. Using an ad hoc threshold of two-fold changes, a total of 1655 differentially methylated regions were significantly different (
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) between CNF and PNFs (Supplemental Fig. 6a). A focused evaluation of the top 250 DMRs in terms of fold-change (Supplemental Fig. 6b) revealed that 100 of these sites were found to occur in the genomic contexts of promoter and enhancer space, providing evidence that these DMRs may play a regulatory role in modulating gene expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Notably, we observed that areas of promoter/enhancer overlap were evenly distributed in these top differentially methylated regions across all chromosomes except chromosome 17 which was disproportionately affected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d). Chromosome 17 contained 13 top DMRs, while other autosomal chromosomes contained on average, 3.95 ± 2.20 DMRs. Intriguingly, these DMRs spanned the entire length of Chromosome 17, including putative regulatory space of key genes such as 
 <italic>NF1</italic>, 
 <italic>TP53,</italic> and 
 <italic>MAP2K3</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Taking into account all significant DMRs (q &lt; 0.05), genomic context distributions revealed a broad distribution that extended beyond the promoter and enhancer space, including CpG islands, shores, and shelves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e), in line with the features targeted by the Illumina EPIC methylation arrays. Taken together, these results provide evidence that 
 <italic>NF1 </italic>deficiency in transcriptionally and genomically similar lesions possess distinct epigenomes as evidenced through genome-wide differences in higher-order chromatin structure and differentially methylated regions. These results link 
 <italic>NF1 </italic>deficiency with differential methylation events that likely alter signaling fates through epigenetic alterations in regulatory space and culminates in broad remodeling of chromatin architecture throughout the genome. Given the lack of transcriptional and genomic differences between CNF and PNFs, these data strongly suggest that epigenomic differences contribute to the morphological and pathological variation observed in NF1 patients.

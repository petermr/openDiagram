<p>Based on analysis of variance, WGCNA and differential expression analysis, we identified genes that may be associated with sepsis and septic shock. Enrichment analysis revealed that the genes involved in inflammatory and metabolic responses were up-regulated in sepsis, whereas the genes corresponding to immune responses were significantly suppressed. This is similar to previous findings.
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Increased galactosylation of the crystallizable immunoglobulin G fragment has been linked to increased complement-dependent cytotoxicity, which in turn may contribute to pediatric sepsis.
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In patients with sepsis, increased levels of both C3a and C5a in serum have been reported.
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Monocytes from sepsis patients have significantly higher basal glycolysis than monocytes from healthy controls.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Aerobic glycolysis has been found to contribute to sepsis development by regulating inflammasome activation in macrophages.
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Both bacterial and fungal sepsis have been observed to cause a shift in cellular metabolism towards glycolysis, which is associated with an impaired ability of leukocytes to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines upon a second stimulus.
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Moreover, lymphocyte loss, equally affecting B and T cells, was demonstrated in septic patients.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Accumulating evidence supports that immunosuppression is one of the major contributors to sepsis-related mortality, and that T cell exhaustion is one of the most severe responses.

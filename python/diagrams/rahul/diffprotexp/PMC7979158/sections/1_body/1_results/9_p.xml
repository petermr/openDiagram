<p>MIA has been associated with altered cortical thickness and reported to cause cortical dysplasia in young adult MIA offspring (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Soumiya et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Tsukada et al., 2015</xref>), with stereotypic dysplasia impacting lamination localized to the somatosensory cortex reported in one MIA model (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Shin Yim et al., 2017</xref>). A number of cortical layer markers were DE at E17.5 in RNA, with validated changes at the protein level (

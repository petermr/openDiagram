<p>Although technologies like LC-MS/MS and 2-DE-gel have been used to study the protein composition of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> at a certain developmental stage [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and extended the existing proteomic data [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there are few reports on the regular pattern of the screened proteins during the consecutive development of the parasites. This study could help in understanding how 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> adapts to its different and complex parasitic life cycles, and universal molecules among diverse groups of cestodes to escape from host immune response.

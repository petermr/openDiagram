 </sup>. Moreover, alterations of RPL5, RPL10, RPS15, RPL11, and RPL22 ribosomal proteins have been described in 10 to 40% of tumor types. This highlights that the somatic ribosomal proteins mutations influence the ribosomal functioning, resulting in what is called an oncogenic rewiring of the protein expression mechanisms

 </sup>. In addition, changes in translation mechanisms favoring IRES-dependent protein synthesis where shown in human apoptosis, promoting apoptotic proteins formation

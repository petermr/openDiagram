<p id="Par17">The USE and ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of different states were determined by fitting the Boltzmann function fitting (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). As the table shows, irrespective of the heat-treatment state, the USE increases gradually and the DBTT decreases when the QCR is increased. This indicates that the impact toughness of SA508Gr.4N steel can be improved by increasing the QCR. After the step-cooling heat treatment, the USE and DBTT both increase, and ΔDBTT increases with increasing QCR. This indicates that martensitic microstructures are more susceptible to temper embrittlement than bainitic microstructures

0: Pulpal repair in response to dental tissue damage caused by caries or trauma is a complex inflammatory process [ 3].
1: As caries progresses from the tooth surface toward the dentin-pulp complex, activation of both the innate and adaptive immunities occurs [ 4].
2: For a relatively mild stimulus, such as slowly progressing caries or tooth wear, the dentin-pulpal complex produces tertiary dentin.
3: In contrast, under conditions of more rapidly progressing disease, a more intense immune and inflammatory response occurs, resulting in pulp tissue death [ 5].
4: During healing after dental tissue injury, induction of necrosis of pulp tissue, including odontoblasts, occurs followed by reparative dentinogenesis, a result of continuous and interrelated processes, including chemotaxis, proliferation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and cell differentiation [ 6].
5: Wei et al.
6: [ 6] reported that after tissue injury, the unique dentin-pulp complex might undergo complete regeneration, including the differentiation of various cell types and induction of new proteins.
7: Smith et al.
8: [ 7] reported the presence of a broad spectrum of bioactive molecules in the dentin-pulp complex.
9: Eckhardt et al.
10: [ 8] pointed out that identifying the bioactive proteins may facilitate a better understanding of their potential involvement in regenerative and other tissue responses.
11: Therefore, elucidation of differences in the protein expression between healthy and diseased pulp tissue may help assess whether these differences offer novel clinical therapeutic methods [ 7, 8].

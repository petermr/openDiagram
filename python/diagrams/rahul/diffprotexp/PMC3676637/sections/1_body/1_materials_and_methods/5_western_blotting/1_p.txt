0: Protein samples (10 g each) were mixed in sample buffer at 100 C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide gels.
1: Then, the samples were transferred to enhanced chemiluminescence membranes (ECL; Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) that had been blocked for 1 h in ECL Advance Blocking Agent.
2: These membranes were incubated with rabbit antitransgelin-2 (TAGLN2) polyclonal antibody (1:200; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA), rabbit antitriosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI-1) polyclonal antibody (1:200; GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), or rabbit antienolase 1 (ENO1) polyclonal antibody (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at room temperature.
3: After washing for a total of 30 min with 5 exchanges of Tris buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled immunoglobulin G of the appropriate species for 1 h at room temperature.
4: After washing a further 5 times with TBS-T, immunoreactive proteins were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection System kit (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and an LAS-3000(Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).
5: After stripping, the membranes were reprobed with mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (1:2,000; Sigma) as a loading control.

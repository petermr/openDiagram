<p>The cooling step (quenching) is the most critical step in the age-hardening heat treatment process with regard to technological applications. This is because some alloys require very fast cooling to achieve a completely supersaturated solid solution, and in several cases, it is hard to achieve these fast cooling rates in technological applications. Thicker products may also give variations in the material properties across the thickness, due to varying cooling rates. The tendency towards quench-induced precipitation and variation in properties across the thickness are often referred to as quench sensitivity. If cooling takes place at less than a certain critical cooling rate, detrimental quench-induced precipitates grow during cooling. These undesired precipitates are coarse compared to precipitates originating from ageing, and thus lower the amount of solutes available for ageing. Due to the combined effect of coarse quench-induced precipitates and a lowered solute concentration, and thus a reduced fraction of the strength-increasing nano precipitates, several properties are affected and mostly degraded; for instance, the strength improvement, which is often important, is reduced. In many applications, other properties are even more important, such as toughness, fatigue resistance and stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Moreover, quench-induced precipitation also affects the presence and width of precipitation-free zones (after ageing) as well as the kinetics of natural and artificial ageing.</p>

<p id="p0145">It is worth noting that the cobalt content can influence the deposition of Mn compound. Manganese oxide cathodes with different cobalt contents were compared in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S13</xref>. The increase in cobalt content provides a better capability for the deposition of Mn compounds on the cathode, thereby leading to faster increases of capacities (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S13</xref>B). The improvement of the deposition of Mn compounds is not very significant when the Co/Mn ratio is higher than 0.10:1 (atom %), indicating that the cobalt-induced facilitation of the deposition of Mn compounds may have a limitation. Also, the deposition of Mn compounds may be influenced by the concentration of the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion. As presented in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S14</xref>, batteries with lower Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations demonstrated higher retention rates. This could be associated with the higher ionic conductivities and higher pH values of the electrolytes, which are both beneficial to the deposition of Mn compounds (

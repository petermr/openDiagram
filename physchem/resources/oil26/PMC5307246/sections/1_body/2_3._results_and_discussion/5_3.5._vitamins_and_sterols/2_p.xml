More than 700 carotenoids have been identified in 89 plant foods and in the human body, but the overwhelming majority (ca. 90%) in the human diet is represented by <italic>&#946;</italic>-carotene, <italic>&#945;</italic>-carotene, lycopene, lutein, cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The carotenoid content of<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil was 4.62&#8201;mg/kg of oil (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>). This value was similar to that reported for<italic> Capparis spinosa</italic> L. (4.57&#8201;mg/kg of oil) and lower than those of<italic> Phoenix canariensis</italic> seed oil (55.10&#8201;mg/kg of oil) and<italic> Rubus idaeus</italic> L. seed oil (230.00&#8201;mg/kg of oil) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The forms of carotenoids found in<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil were lutein and <italic>&#946;</italic>-carotene. Lutein was the most abundant form, accounting for 80% of the total carotenoids.</p>

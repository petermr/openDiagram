0: Whole cell proteins were isolated using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay reagent (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) and an equal mass of total protein (40 g) from each lysate was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE.
1: Following electrophoresis, separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and were blocked with TBST containing 10% powdered skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature prior to being incubated with antibodies against XIAP (cat no.
2: PRS3331; 1:2,000) and GAPDH (cat no.
3: G9545; 1:20,000; both Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) overnight at 4C.
4: Next, the substrate was catalyzed to emit light, the exposure stripe was scanned, and the ratio of the grey values of XIAP and GAPDH was taken as the relative content of XIAP protein.

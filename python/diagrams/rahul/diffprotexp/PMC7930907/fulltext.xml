Subcutaneous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SASCs), perirenal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PASCs), and epididymal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (EASCs) were isolated from Sprague Dawley rats. RNA and metabolites were extracted and sequenced using transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses, respectively. There were 720 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EASCs and 688 DEGs in PASCs compared with SASCs; there were 166 unique DEGs in EASCs, 134 unique DEGs in PASCs, and 554 common DEGs between EASCs and PASCs. Furthermore, there were 226 differential metabolites in EASCs, 255 differential metabolites in PASCs, 83 unique differential metabolites in EASCs, 112 unique differential metabolites in PASCs, and 143 common differential metabolites between EASCs and PASCs. The transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses identified four hub genes, one in EASCs and three in PASCs. There are functional differences among multisite ASCs that may be related to the hub genes <italic>Atac2</italic>, <italic>Rrm1</italic>, <italic>Rrm2</italic>, and <italic>Gla</italic>. The relevant signaling pathways are the Ras signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and the p53 signaling pathway. In conclusion, compared with SASCs, our multi-omics analysis identified that EASCs with higher <italic>Acat2</italic> expression may be more correlated to fat metabolism and insulin resistance, while PASCs with abnormal expression of <italic>Rrm1/2</italic> and <italic>Gla</italic> may be more correlated with some malignant tumors and cardiac-cerebral vascular disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>metabolites</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity, which poses a grave threat to humankind, has become one of the most important chronic diseases. By 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults over 18 years of age were overweight worldwide, of whom more than 650 million were obese (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chandramouli et al., 2019</xref>). Obesity has become an increasing concern because it is a major risk factor for diseases including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cancer (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Renehan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aune et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As early as 1956, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Vague (1956)</xref> proposed that obesity as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease is related to the distribution of adipose tissue in the human body, not just the increase of total adipose tissue. There are two types of adipose tissue in mammals: white adipose tissue (WAT), which is the main form of energy storage in the body, and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT is primarily composed of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). WAT can be enlarged by increasing adipocyte size (hypertrophy) or adipocyte number (hyperplasia); adipocyte hypertrophy is associated with adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation, whereas hyperplasia is involved in the improvement of insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Silva and Baptista, 2019</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the expansion of SAT is dominated by adipocyte hyperplasia, while VAT [including omental, mesenteric, and perirenal adipose tissue (PAT)] is primarily increased by adipocyte hypertrophy (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Joe et al., 2009</xref>). Compared with SAT and VAT secretes higher levels of proinflammatory factors and lower levels of anti-inflammatory factors; therefore, it is easier to break down to increase plasma-free fatty acids (FFA). High concentrations of FFA can inhibit insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle and liver, induce insulin resistance, and increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">McFarlane et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rocchini, 2002</xref>). Therefore, the accumulation of VAT is more closely associated with cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, hypermetabolism, and cancer (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dobbelsteyn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tchernof and Despr&#x000e9;s, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Silva and Baptista, 2019</xref>). In addition, compared with other VATs [such as epididymal adipose tissue (EAT)], PAT has some characteristics of BAT. In adults, PAT depot is one of the most frequent depots where BAT have been found (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the expression of UCP1 in PAT is related to blood pressure (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas, some investigators indicate that EAT maximum thickness is better associated with cardiovascular risk factors (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kawamoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nishina et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Adipose tissue is mainly composed of adipocytes (90%), nonadipocytes (preadipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, inflammatory cells, etc.), connective tissue matrix, blood vessels, and nervous tissues (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ibrahim, 2010</xref>). <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Girousse et al. (2019)</xref> stated that adipocytes mainly originate from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), and <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Silva and Baptista (2019)</xref> demonstrated the different pathophysiologic properties of ASCs in different adipose deposits. A widely different function among Subcutaneous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SASCs), epididymal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (EASCs), and perirenal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PASCs) were illustrated including a higher potential of lipogenesis in EASCs and PASCs (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jeffery et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, the contributions of different original ASCs in different adipose deposits are still not clear. We designed this study to investigate the functional differences among different original ASCs by multi-omics analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Functional Annotation of DEGs Among SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs</title><p>To explore the functional differences of SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs, 720 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EASCs and SASCs (FC &#x0003e;2.0, adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value (FDR) &#x0003c;0.05, 497 downregulated, and 223 upregulated), and 688 DEGs between PASCs and SASCs (FC &#x0003e;2.0, FDR 0.05, 468 downregulated, and 220 upregulated) were found by RNA-Seq.

Compared with VAT, the enlargement of the SAT can be beneficial to patients by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing the risk of type II diabetes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoffstedt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Arner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dalmas et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, excessive accumulation of VAT increases the risk of diseases such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>According to previous studies, VAT secretes higher levels of proinflammatory factors and lower levels of anti-inflammatory factors, decomposes FFA, and increases plasma more easily than SAT. As reported, high concentrations of FFA can inhibit insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle and liver, induce insulin resistance, and eventually increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, blood pressure can be elevated by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and mechanisms related to insulin resistance (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">McFarlane et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rocchini, 2002</xref>). Therefore, measuring waist circumference to quantify VAT can be used as an independent risk factor for type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dobbelsteyn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tchernof and Despr&#x000e9;s, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, SASCs, EASCs, and PASCs were extracted from three different adipose deposits in rats, and transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were used to reveal that there were 720 DEGs in EASCs and 688 DEGs in PASCs compared with SASCs. In addition, there were 166 unique DEGs in EASCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS7">Supplementary Table 7</xref>), 134 unique DEGs in PASCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>), and 554 common DEGs between EASCs and PASCs. Furthermore, there were 226 differential metabolites in EASCs, 255 differential metabolites in PASCs, 83 unique differential metabolites in EASCs, 112 unique differential metabolites in PASCs, and 143 common differential metabolites between EASCs and PASCs.</p><p>Collectively, we found that immune response and cytoskeleton remodeling in pathway maps, response to organic substance and response to organic cyclic compound in GO processed, and cytoskeleton and cell adhesion in process networks are common in EASCs and PASCs. Interestingly, cytoskeleton remodeling was the most enrichment of upregulated DEGs both in EASCs and PASCs, while immune response was the most enrichment of downregulated DEGs both in EASCs and PASCs. Also, KEGG analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) showed ASCs derived from different deposits of VAT were both involved in cytokine&#x02013;cytokine receptor interaction, Rap1 signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, lysosome, and focal adhesion. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway has been reported to primarily regulate the transcription, translation, proliferation, growth, survival, and other basic functions of extracellular signals. These new findings proved that the functions of ASCs derived from different deposits of VAT were similar, while different functions of immune response and extracellular matrix remodeling vary compared with the ASCs derived from SAT. As reported previously, the adipose tissue from subcutaneous and visceral showed a significant difference in immune response in obesity and other metabolic diseases (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Klimcakova et al., 2011</xref>). Compared with our studies, these differences may be most relevant to the different ASCs from SAT and VAT. Whereas, further studies on this point are required for confirmation. Furthermore, the function of extracellular matrix remodeling was reported as a critical microenvironment in different sites of adipose tissue (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 2014</xref>), and, by standard 2D culture or 3D culture, Strieder-Barboza et al. proved that adipocytes from different sites of adipose tissues have different metabolic profiling in murine obesity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Strieder-Barboza et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Under the conditions of obesity, excessive FFAs will lead to glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, which eventually weaken the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, thereby inducing insulin resistance (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bathina and Das, 2018</xref>), which will further affect the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This ultimately leads to a vicious cycle of obesity and type II diabetes. In addition, the abnormality of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is the most common genomic abnormality in breast, ovarian, bladder, and other cancers (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Serra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Aziz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Rap1 is a small G protein of the Ras superfamily that is present in a variety of important cellular processes, which regulate cell survival and proliferation through the regulation of PI3-AKT. Ras proteins can act as molecular switches that control the integrity of actin cytoskeleton, regulate cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell migration. Overactive Ras signaling can lead to cancer (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Goodsell, 1999</xref>). The Ras signaling pathway activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, participates in cell growth and division, stimulates protein synthesis, and inhibits cell apoptosis. In conclusion, VAT-derived ASCs may make patients with excessive VAT more susceptible to insulin resistance by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thus increasing the risk of multiple tumor diseases in obese patients.</p><p>Phagosomes, which are individually involved in EASCs, are associated with inflammation by producing proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-12 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aderem, 2003</xref>); PI-3 kinase and PLC are also involved in triggering inflammation.</p><p>The unique signaling pathways of PASCs were the HIF-1 signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Previous studies indicated that the HIF-1 signaling pathway is associated with multiple tumor progressions (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Talks et al., 2000</xref>), and dysregulation of cell cycle components may also lead to tumorigenesis, which results in cell proliferation by p53 or other signaling pathways (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Champeris Tsaniras et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of apoptosis can also lead to a variety of cancers, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kaczanowski, 2016</xref>). Therefore, the increased risk of cancer in obese or overweight patients may be related to PASCs.</p><p>In our combined multi-omics analysis of SASCs and EASCs, the hub gene <italic>Acat2</italic> was found to be associated with nine metabolites in 10 metabolic pathways. <italic>Acat2</italic> is a cellular enzyme that converts cholesterol and fatty acids into cholesterol esters and is mainly expressed in the liver and intestine (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1998</xref>). Studies have shown that atherosclerosis is reduced in mouse atherosclerosis models when <italic>Acat2</italic> is deficient (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Willner et al., 2003</xref>); <italic>Acat2</italic>-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia or cholesterol stone formation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Buhman et al., 2000</xref>). Lower levels of <italic>Acat2</italic> activity in the human liver can delay the development of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Parini et al., 2004</xref>); therefore, improving the stability of <italic>Acat2</italic> may be an effective treatment strategy for type II diabetes (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the above findings, the higher expression of <italic>Acat2</italic> in EASCs rather than SASCs may be more related to fat metabolism and insulin resistance.</p><p>In the multi-omics analysis of SASCs and PASCs, three hub genes, <italic>Rrm1</italic>, <italic>Rrm2</italic>, and <italic>Gla</italic>, were mainly involved. In 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reported that obese and overweight patients had an increased risk of colon cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, renal cancer, and esophageal cancer (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Basen-Engquist and Chang, 2011</xref>). In 2003, a cohort study by Calle (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Calle et al., 2003</xref>) involving 9,000,000 adults in the United States showed that obesity also increases the risk of other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myeloma. In early reports, <italic>Rrm1</italic> and <italic>Rrm2</italic> are regulatory subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, negative rate-limiting enzymes for DNA synthesis and repair, playing crucial roles in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, aging, and tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>). <italic>Rrm1</italic> and <italic>Rrm2</italic> are widely found in 25 different human tissues, which is normal at low expression levels. However, <italic>Rrm1</italic> and <italic>Rrm2</italic> are overexpressed in various malignant tumors, acting as tumor drivers (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). At present, the mechanism by which obesity is associated with the risk of multiple malignant tumors is still unknown. We speculate that the increased risk of some malignant tumors may be associated with the overexpression of <italic>Rrm1</italic> and <italic>Rrm2</italic>, and the main signaling pathways involved may be related to the HIF-1 signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, and apoptosis.</p><p><italic>Gla</italic> is widely found in 27 different tissues in the human body, including the adrenal gland, bone marrow, brain, adipose tissue, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, uterus, placenta, spleen, stomach, and other tissues. <italic>Gla</italic> gene inactivity or deficiency will lead to Fabry disease, mainly affecting the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, skin, lung, and nervous system, ultimately leading to multiple organ damage. Patients showed nerve injury in the early stage of Fabry disease, with the main symptoms of paroxysmal burning pain in the extremities in childhood and then relief in adulthood. With the increase of age, the severity of kidney injury increases. Some patients present with renal failure at approximately 30 years old (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Germain, 2010</xref>) and die from uremia or complications of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases between 40 and 50 years old (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>).

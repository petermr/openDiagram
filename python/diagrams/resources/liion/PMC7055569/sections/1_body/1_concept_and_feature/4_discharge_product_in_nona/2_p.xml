 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Li forms unstable lithium superoxide (LiO
 <sub>2</sub>) whereas, Na can form the stable NaO
 <sub>2</sub> when reacting with oxygen during the discharge in a metal–O
 <sub>2</sub> cell. Therefore, during discharge in a nonaqueous Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> cell, there is a strong competition between the formation of NaO
 <sub>2</sub> and Na
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Thermodynamically, the formation of Na
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is favorable (

 <sup>0</sup> (NaO

 <sub>2</sub> involves only one electron transfer per formula unit which makes it kinetically preferred in comparison to the two‐electron transfer toward Na
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> formation (Figure

0: We assessed the PCA in R code under the plot PCA function.
1: To summarize the systematic patterns of variation in the readings obtained from the sequencing in principal components, we achieved orthogonal transformation by reducing each sample at one point [ 115], provided separate samples by expression variation, and identified possible outliers for each sample.
2: For the construction of the 3D PCA, we used the first three principal components.

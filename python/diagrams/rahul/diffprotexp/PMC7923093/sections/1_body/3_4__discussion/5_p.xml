<p>Single tissue-specific miRNAs have been identified in specific mammalian organs such as heart, liver or brain [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, all of the miRNAs up-regulated we observed in this study have been reported as highly-expressed in muscle and belong to mammalian skeletal and cardiac muscle miRNA, involved in proliferation and differentiation during muscle formation. MiR-1, miR-133 and miR-206, for instance, are collectively known as the “myomiRs” for their prevalence in skeletal and cardiac muscle [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. MiR-1 and miR-133, which are clustered on the same chromosomal loci, are transcribed together in a tissue-specific manner during development [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although miR-1 and -206 are closely related in terms of expression and function, they differ based on chromosomal loci, specific targets and individual transcriptional activation [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-11-00535" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The function of these three miRNA families on muscle development could be generalized as both miR-1 and miR-206 promoting myoblast-to-myotube differentiation. In contrast, miR-133 promotes proliferation of myoblasts, and inhibits their differentiation.

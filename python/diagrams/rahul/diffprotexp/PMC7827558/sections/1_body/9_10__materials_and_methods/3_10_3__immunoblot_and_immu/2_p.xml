<p>At 24 h post doxycycline induction, GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from SY5Y-inducible cell line lysates by GFP-TRAP
 <sup>®</sup> agarose beads (Chromotek Munich, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The eluted GFP-tagged proteins and their associated proteins were subjected to MS performed by the Duke Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource. On-resin digestion of the GFP immunocomplex and quantitative proteomic analysis of these samples was performed followed by quantitative MS.

0: To assess the extent to which enrichment items achieved the overall goals, we modeled total time foraging, total time investigating, or locomotion as target variables.
1: For these models, we used data aggregated by night in GLMM with negative binomial distributions and log link functions.
2: We used two-week period of the study (four total periods) as a continuous predictor and enrichment (specific or stated goal) as fixed factors, but we were unable to fit models with terms for interactions between time and enrichment.
3: These models used the same random slopes previously described.
4: Models for foraging and investigating included a variance components covariance structure, while the model for locomotion used an AR1 covariance structure.

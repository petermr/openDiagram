<p>S100A13 showed significant up-regulation in cPTCs (mean 244 pg/ml) as compared to benign lesions (mean 230 pg/ml), which is consistent with the LC-MS/MS data and partially with Western blot findings (p&lt;0.05). ROC curve analyses of ELISA data revealed 230 pg/ml or more as an optimal cut-off for S100A13, showing sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 35%, PPV of 59%, NPV of 86%, PLR of 1.44 and NLR of 0.17, which is consistent with AUC (0.69) data indicating poor diagnostic accuracy (p = 0.02) (

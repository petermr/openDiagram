<p>GSE analysis was applied to identify the pathways where the identified target genes are overrepresented. The results showed that target genes of DEMs, especially those with negative miRNAâ€“mRNA correlation, are related mainly to pathways and processes of protein ubiquitination. Since direct effects of 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations are the changes at protein ubiquitination level [

 <xref rid="B5-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we believe that the different expression of miRNAs that are involved in editing ubiquitin marks may reflect this major biological difference between 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt corticotroph PitNETs. Protein ubiquitination processes are directly orchestrated by a high number of proteins belonging mainly to three classes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3) [
 <xref rid="B30-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The enzymes of each class catalyze the subsequent stages of protein ubiquitination and the reverse reaction of protein deubiquitination is conducted by deubiquitinating enzymes [
 <xref rid="B30-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Each class of the enzymes involved in editing ubiquitin marks includes multiple proteins, and genes encoding for proteins belonging to each class were found as putative targets of DEMs.

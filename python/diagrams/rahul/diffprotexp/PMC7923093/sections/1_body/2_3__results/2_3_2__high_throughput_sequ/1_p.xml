<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00535-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 50 differentially expressed miRNAs (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, FDR &lt; 0.01) were obtained by primary screening at FDR &lt; 0.01 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in which 22 were down-regulated and 28 were up-regulated. Furthermore, seven miRNA (miR-206-3p, miR-133a-5p, miR-133b-3p, miR-1-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-1b and miR-486) were screened by the secondary sequencing of FC &gt; 2 or FC &lt; 0.5 which were all up-regulated by arginine (

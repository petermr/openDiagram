Among the genes DmC-DEG associated with stress responses, the legume lectin, the armadillo-like protein, and SNARE11 were identified in our data. Also, two genes related to the methylation process (5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate -homocysteine methyltransferase and histone-lysine N-methyltransferase) and three associated with DNA repair (ATMRK serine-threonine protein kinase-like, Telomerase activating protein, DNA mismatch repair protein) were found. Also, the presence of some genes associated with RNA binding proteins and nucleic acid binding proteins suggested that the H

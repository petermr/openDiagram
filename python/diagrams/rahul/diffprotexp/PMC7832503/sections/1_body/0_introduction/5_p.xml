<p>In this study, we used an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 host-based WGS approach to identify novel genetic risk loci associated with severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and explore its hidden mechanisms. We separately excavated the contributions of common SNVs and rare functional SNVs in the process of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyse genetic factors associated with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection using a host-based WGS method. Our study will be helpful to improve the treatment of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected patients and develop new vaccines.</p>

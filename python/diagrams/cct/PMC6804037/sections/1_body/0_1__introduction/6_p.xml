<p>Eventually, a finite element model (FEM) was employed for the simulation of the LSTH of AISI 4130 steel. For this purpose, a cylindrical heat source was modelled to simulate the surface hardened. A continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curve for AISI 4130 steel was employed for the validation of the numerical model. The results show that the model can predict with accuracy the temperature profile and the size and the shape of the laser hardened region.</p>

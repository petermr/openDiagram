<p id="Par4">One of the ways to make salt stress tolerant crop plants is to genetically engineer them to sustain their growth and productivity in challenging environments. This requires exploring gene pool of wild relatives of crop plants. This can be achieved by analysing global gene expression of salt tolerant species to reveal the underlying regulatory and metabolic mechanisms. Glenn et al. (1999)

Next-generation sequencing coupled with bioinformatics tools provides a platform for high-throughput analysis of key metabolic pathways involved in stress response and adaptation. Here, we used RNA sequencing to identify the genes present in a highly salt tolerant non-model plant species, 
 <italic>Urochondra setulosa</italic> and identify the genes associated with salt tolerance.

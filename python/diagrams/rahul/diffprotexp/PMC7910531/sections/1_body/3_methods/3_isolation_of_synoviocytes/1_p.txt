0: We followed a previously established protocol to process synovial samples 36, with details as follows.
1: Synovial samples were transported in serum free media, as described above.
2: The synovial membrane was dissected from underlying tissue then trypsinised for 1 h. Tissue was then digested in 1 mg/ml Collagenase Blend H (Sigma Aldrich) in serum free media overnight at 37 C on a flatbed shaker.
3: The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 100 m cell strainer (Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min.
4: Subsequently, the cell pellet was washed twice in serum free media and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min.
5: The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in serum free media.
6: Cells were counted using a haemocytometer and the viability checked using trypan blue exclusion (Invitrogen).
7: The optimal cell number for spin column extraction from cells was between 4  10 6 and 1  10 7.
8: Cells were then pelleted and homogenised.

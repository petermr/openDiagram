<p>Citric acid remains the most studied among the wide range of organic acids tested by various research groups. According to Li et al. and Chen et al., along with a reducing agent such as H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, citric acid solubilized efficiently (95% to 100%) all valuable metals from spent LIBs [

 <xref rid="B189-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. According to Li et al. and Golmohammadzadeh et al., at high temperature, the reaction with citric acid was chemically controlled for Li, Co, Ni, and Mn [

 <xref rid="B190-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. However, kinetics curves from the shrinking core model shown by Li et al. deviated from linearity during the first 4 to 8 min for Co, Ni, and Mn between 50 °C and 80 °C. The reaction could instead follow a two-step mechanism for transition metals. Interestingly, Chen et al. replaced H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by green tea waste, reaching similar leaching efficiencies for both reducing agents (from 96% to 99%). Although the residue of green tea provided attractive leaching results and allowed reclamation of an industrial waste, this process may be difficult to apply at a larger scale due to difficulties related to reducing agent dosage. The authors did not provide a method to quantify the reductive power of the green tea waste, although they suggested a mechanism for the oxidation reaction.

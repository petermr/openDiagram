<p id="par0060">For the cloning of identified transcripts, total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, UK). The qualitative assessment of total RNA was carried out using visualization on non-denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis followed by reading of Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, U.S.A.). Total RNA having A260/A280 ratio of &gt;1.9 was subsequently used for the cDNA synthesis using the Revert
 <sup>Aid</sup> H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientificâ„¢, USA) following the manufacturers instruction.

<p>The second approach, variant B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), was to simulate the coiling process of the steel sheet. During industrial manufacturing, a very long time is necessary to cool down the rolled coil. This gives the opportunity to use this step to stabilize the austenite. During the manufacturing process, the coiling temperature is usually in the range of 800 to 500 °C. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f003">Figure 3</xref> (theoretical calculations) during continuous cooling, the ferrite should start forming at a cooling rate of 0.1 °C/s. Hence, the intercritical region of the steel can be used to form a microstructure composed of ferrite and austenite.

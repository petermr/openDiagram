<p id="Par27">Western blotting, protein synthesis measurement, cell cycle determination, and proliferation experiments were performed independently and repeated a minimum of three times. When applicable, technical replicates were averaged within each experiment and these values were analyzed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test for comparison of means. GraphPad Prism software version 7 was used for statistical analysis (GraphPad Software Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA). Data are expressed as means ± stand error of the means (SEM).

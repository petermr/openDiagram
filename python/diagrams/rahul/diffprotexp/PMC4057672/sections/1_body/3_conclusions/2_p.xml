<p>The present study developed an aerosolized ricin-poisoned mouse model. With proteomic analysis, we found that six proteins, including Apoa1 apolipoprotein, Ywhaz 14-3-3 protein, Prdx6 Uncharacterized Protein, Selenium-binding protein 1, HMGB1, and DPYL-2 occurred at different levels in lung tissue pre-and post-exposure to aerosolized ricin. These proteins might be the key proteins related to ricin poisoning. Further studies will focus on clarifying the mechanism and the roles for these proteins in the ricin-poisoning process.</p>

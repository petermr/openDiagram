0: As previously described 22, we conducted a sucrose preference test (SPT) to measure the rat depression-like behavior (anhedonia).
1: The behavioral-based formula was used to assess sucrose preference: sucrose preference = (sucrose intake/total fluid intake)  100%.
2: Afterward, a forced swimming test (FST) was conducted to gauge despair-like behavior, as formerly illustrated 22.
3: The behaviors of the rats were determined in a water-filled Plexiglas cylinder and recorded using a video monitoring system.
4: Meanwhile, the anxiety-like behavior of rats was evaluated by an elevated plus-maze test (EMT), as previously described 22.
5: During the CMS process, the rat body weights were recorded every week.

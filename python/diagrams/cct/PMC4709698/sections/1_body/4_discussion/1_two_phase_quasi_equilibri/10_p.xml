<p>The resulting microstructure consists of two metastable phases and therefore we use the term “quasi-equilibrium” in this context. The mole ratio of both phases should then be governed by the lever rule and the composition of the supercooled liquid, which then transforms into a glass, should be

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. However, a two-phase quasi-equilibrium can also occur between two metastable phases when their chemical potentials are identical. Metastable phase diagrams have been used to understand the formation of metastable phases via solidification

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, for instance. Lee 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> have also constructed a pseudo-binary equilibrium phase diagram by measuring the melting points of several Zr-based BMGCs containing β-Zr and used the metastable phase diagram to explain the evolution of the different microstructures in their samples. However, they did not address the influence of the cooling rate on volume fractions and compositions as well as they did not focus on the underlying mechanism. The current concept of a two-phase quasi-equilibrium successfully reveals the influence of cooling rates and designed mole fractions of β-Ti on the microstructures of BMGCs as we discuss below.

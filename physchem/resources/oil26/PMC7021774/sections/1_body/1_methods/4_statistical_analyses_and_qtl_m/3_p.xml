<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par12">MAGIC QTL mapping was carried out using 7369 unique mapped SNPs, with genetic map positions as described by Gardner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). Four QTL analysis approaches were used: (1) SMA (single marker analysis): regression against single markers using R/lme4. (2) IBD (identity by descent): regression against haplotype probability estimates calculated using the &#8216;mpprob&#8217; function in R/mpMap (Huang and George <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>) implemented in R/qtl (Broman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>) with a threshold of 0.5. (3) IM (interval mapping): conducted in R/mpMap using R/mpMap haplotype probability estimates. (4) CIM (composite interval mapping): conducted in R/mpMap with 5 or 10 covariates using R/mpMap haplotype probability estimates. For IBS and IBD analyses, multiple-test correction was carried out using <italic>R</italic>/<italic>q</italic> value, with a threshold of <italic>q</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05. For IM/CIM an empirical <italic>P</italic> threshold of 0.05 was determined for QTL analyses by conducting 100 simulations, using the sim.sigthr function in <italic>R</italic>. This value, together with a window size of 100 markers was used to determine QTL peaks using &#8216;find.qtl&#8217;. &#8216;Fit.qtl&#8217; was then applied, and QTL retained which had <italic>P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 in the fitted model, as well as percentage variation explained&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1%.</p>

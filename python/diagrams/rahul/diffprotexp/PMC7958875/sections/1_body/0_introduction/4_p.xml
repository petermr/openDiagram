<p>Using this framework, we investigate variable patterns of gene expression in 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ookinetes across two vector species as well as within and between individual mosquito midguts (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 1</bold>
 </xref>). We identify genes that are differentially expressed across these environments as well as a subset of genes that are highly variably expressed independent of developmental time and the vector host. We then revisit bulk RNA-seq data from individual vector midguts from mated or virgin 
 <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic> infected with 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dahalan etÂ al., 2019</xref>) and identify variable genes that may be responding to vector host physiological factors. We find that ookinetes display subtle differences in gene expression not only based on the vector species, mating status or antibiotic treatment, but also within one mosquito individual. Our findings suggest that a fine balance between adaptive gene expression and intrinsic variant gene expression act together to ensure successful gut colonization.

0: Magna RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) kit (Millipore, USA) was used to complete RIP assay in T98G cells.
1: The cell lysate was cultured in RIP buffer containing magnetic beads and then combined with human rabbit anti-Ago2 antibody.
2: Input was used as positive control.
3: IgG was used as negative control.
4: Protease K was used to purify and immune-precipitate RNA.
5: The sample and Input were digested by protease K and then RNAs (LINC00466 and PPP1R14B) were extracted for subsequent qRT-PCR analysis.
6: All the antibodies used were listed in  Supplement Table 4.

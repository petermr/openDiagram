<p id="p0170">PXRD studies showed a dramatic change of SCU crystallinity when incorporated in CD-MOF (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), suggesting that the drug was embedded inside the CD-MOF cavities. The crystalline SCU had intrinsic diffraction peaks (7.97°, 10.06°, 14.31°, 16.05°, 25.90°, 26.80° and 28.93°) that were different from CD-MOFs (3.96°, 5.64°, 6.91°, 13.32°, 16.58° and 17.07°). The physical mixtures of CD-MOF and SCU displayed both peaks. Interestingly, the SCU@CD-MOF had an amorphous structure showing that both the drug and the vehicle lost their crystallinity during SCU loading owing to the super-loading of SCU in CD-MOF

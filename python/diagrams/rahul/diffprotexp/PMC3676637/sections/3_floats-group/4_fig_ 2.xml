  <p>Western blot analysis of ENO1, TPI-1, and TAGLN2. Proteins from primary and metastatic tumors were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, followed by detection using the respective primary antibodies and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. In endometrial and ovarian cancers, the expression of ENO1 and TPI-1 was higher in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors, and the expression of TAGLN2 was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors. Further, in cervical cancer, the expression of TPI-1 and TAGLN2 was lower in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors.

<p id="Par43">To further characterize the effects of DCVC treatment on differential gene expression in placenta, RNA sequencing analysis was performed on another first trimester in vitro model, villous explants-a model that retains the native cells and tissue structure of the villi functional unit (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>; Suppl. Table 5). In MDS diagrams depicting samples plotted on relevant covariates, clustering by donor placenta, sex, and gestational week were observed (Suppl Fig. 6). Gestational week (
 <italic>P</italic> = 4.00 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>) and placental donor (
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.00 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>) were associated with MDS dimension 1. Gestational week (
 <italic>P</italic> = 4.00 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>), and placental donor (
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.00 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>) were associated with MDS dimension 2. Twelve-hour 20 µM DCVC treatment altered gene expression levels in villous explants by a magnitude logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &lt; 1.3] for 2684 genes, compared to non-treated controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a). Among these genes, 1499 were upregulated and 1185 downregulated. Although differential expression for many genes surpassed the logFC criterion, as indicated, no genes met the primary false discovery rate criterion (FDR &lt; 0.05).

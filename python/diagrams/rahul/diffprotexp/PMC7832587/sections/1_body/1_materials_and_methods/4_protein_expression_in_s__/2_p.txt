0: For large-scale cultures used for membrane fractionation, the first pre-culture was diluted to a OD 600 of 0.1 in 50 mL of S6A media and incubated at 28C for another 24 h. Then, this second pre-culture was diluted to an OD 600 of 0.05 in 500 mL of YPGE2X media.
1: The cells were grown for 36 h at 28C to consume the majority of glucose.
2: The culture flasks were cooled down to 18C, and 2% (w/v) of galactose were added to induce protein expression.
3: After 13 h at 18C, a second addition of 2% (w/v) galactose was done and the culture was left for five more hours.
4: The cells were centrifuged at 4000   g during 10 min at 4C and washed two times with cold water.
5: The cell-pellet was weighted and re-suspended in 2 mL of cold TEKS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M KCl and 0.6 M sorbitol) per gram of cells.
6: After incubation at 4C for 15 min, the cells were centrifuged and the resulting pellet was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80C.

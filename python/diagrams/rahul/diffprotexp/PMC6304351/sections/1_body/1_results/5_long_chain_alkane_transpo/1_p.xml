<p>Due to the size and hydrophobicity of long-chain alkanes (e.g., 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>28</sub>) multiple passive and active transport systems may be required for uptake. Four proteins possibly involved in long-chain alkane transport were significantly differentially expressed during growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub> compared to 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub> and Tween 80 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Expression of an outer membrane TonB-dependent receptor (TOL_0244; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) increased sevenfold during growth on 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>28</sub> compared to Tween 80 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This receptor has a 40.3% similarity to OmpS (B5T_01485), a TonB-dependent receptor in 
 <italic>Alcanivorax dieselolei</italic>, which was found to be essential for alkane detection and utilization (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Shao, 2014</xref>). This suggests the receptor may carry out detection, high-affinity binding and energy-dependent uptake of 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>28</sub> into the periplasm (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

0: Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma, is a multifactorial disease with unclear pathogenesis, characterized by retinal ganglion cell death and irreversible damage of the optic nerve [ 1,  2].
1: Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) represents the main risk factor involved in the onset and progression of POAG, due to an imbalance between aqueous humor production and outflow [ 3,  4].
2: POAG trabecular meshwork (TM) displays chronic inflammation and long-standing tissue remodeling [ 5,  6].
3: These molecular events are mainly of endogenous origin and related to the long-term accumulation of oxidative damages arising from mitochondrial failure and endothelial dysfunction [ 7].
4: Proteins deriving from the damage occurring in endothelial TM cells underwent dramatic variation, reflecting oxidative damage, mitochondrial damage, neural degeneration, and apoptosis [ 8,  9].
5: Structural changes encompass extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, typified by increased collagen, fibronectin and elastin deposition (thickness of trabecular sheets), impaired growth factors release, unbalance in ECM enzymes and unusual myofibroblast development [ 10 15].
6: Apoptosis of endothelial cells and targets of oxidative stress (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], a glycolytic enzyme; heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 [HSP72], a stress protein; and glutamine synthetase, an excitotoxicity-related protein) were detected in POAG TMs, supporting the presence of a continuous inflammation, remodeling and immune system activation [ 16,  17].
7: While many components of TM ECM have been identified, only few studies address the entire TM proteome.
8: Cumulating data point to impaired synthesis/release of transforming growth factor beta (TGFs), nerve growth factor (NGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL)1, IL2, IL8, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and their receptors, detected by single conventional approaches [ 18 22].
9: Some pro-inflammatory/fibrogenic factors have been detected in the aqueous humor, suggestive of future applications [ 23 25].

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> summarizes the results obtained based on the intensive kernel ML model trained with an intensively selected FPS set of 9582 UFF structures. Shown are the reduced reaction networks extracted as those parts of the full network that are accessed at increasing simulation times. These reduced networks are highly revealing, as they form a hierarchy of different chemistries relevant to combustion. For example, in line with general expectations

 </sub> intermediates also comprise generally anticipated molecules like methanol (CH

 <sub>2</sub>OO). Interestingly, the formation of the main product CO

 <sub>2</sub> intermediates like ethylene (C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>) and ethane (C

 <sub>6</sub>). Finally, the largest subgraphs shown include already more complex molecules like propane (C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>) and propene (C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>) and comprise a total of 887 reactions.

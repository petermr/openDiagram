<p>Differentiated and undifferentiated MEFs were washed with 1 ml of 1X PBS (Corning) once before fixing for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. After fixation, MEFs were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and once with 60% isopropanol and were completely air-dried. MEFs were then stained with Oil Red O (ORO) [6 ORO:4 ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O ratio] (Sigma©) for 10 min at room temperature. Excess stain residue was removed with four ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O washes. Approximately 1 ml of PBS was then added for microscopic visualization. Images were processed at 460x magnification using a 20x objective lens, with transmitted bright-field light (EVOS® FLoid® Cell Imaging Station). For quantification, ORO stain particles were eluted with 100% isopropanol and analysed using Thermo Scientific™ Varioskan® Flash for spectrophotometry readings at 514 nm.

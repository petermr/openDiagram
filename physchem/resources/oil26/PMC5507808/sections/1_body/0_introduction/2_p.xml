Essential oils as well as derived compounds possess a wide range of activities of which, the antimicrobial activity is most studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Their applications as preservatives in food or antiseptics and disinfectants have been widely investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several studies have revealed the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of essential oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which could be an effective alternative to the use of synthetic chemical preservatives in food conservation.</p>

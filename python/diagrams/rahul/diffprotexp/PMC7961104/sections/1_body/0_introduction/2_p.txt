0: Obesity impairs metabolic regulation of multiple organs, including the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to the dysfunction of the inter-organ metabolic cycle and subsequently to metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus ( Gancheva et al., 2018;  Samuel and Shulman, 2016).
1: Obesity perturbs metabolic regulation through changes in hormones, metabolites, and metabolic enzymes in the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to systemic metabolic dysfunction.
2: Insulin resistance that is associated with obesity represents a well-characterized factor contributing to metabolic dysfunction ( Kahn et al., 2006;  Roden and Shulman, 2019); however, the effect of obesity on inter-organ metabolic cyclesthe glucose-alanine cycle, the glucose-lactate cycle, and ketone body metabolismhave yet to be explored.

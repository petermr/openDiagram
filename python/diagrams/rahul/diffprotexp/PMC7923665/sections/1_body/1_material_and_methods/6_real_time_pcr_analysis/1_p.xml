<p id="Par22">Reverse transcription was done in 500 ng of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase as per manufacturer’s (Promega Corporation, USA) protocol. The cDNA preparations were used for the amplification of transcripts with primers specific for the genes. GAPDH was used as the endogenous control, and the expression of all genes were measured with Power SYBR Green Master Mix. The GAPDH and list of gene-specific qRT-PCR primers were used for this analysis (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The pABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) was used for the analysis. Thermo cycler conditions were as follows: 48 °C, 30 min; 95 °C, 10 min; 95 °C, 15 s; and 60 °C, 1 min; for 40 cycles. The ct values were generated automatically from the software SDS 2.4. Specificity of PCR products was confirmed through the detection of a single peak in the dissociation curve. mRNA fold change was calculated using the formula, 2 (ct value of target gene − ct value of control gene).

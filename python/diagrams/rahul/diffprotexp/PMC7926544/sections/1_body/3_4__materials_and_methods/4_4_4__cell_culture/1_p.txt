0: Opossum kidney cells (OKP cells) were grown in DMEM complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 U/mL) at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2.
1: Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
2: For DNA transfection, cells were grown to 6080% confluence on plastic culture dishes and then were transiently transfected for 5 h with plasmids using Lipofectamine plus kit according to manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen).
3: For protein degradation assays, transiently transfected cells were treated with MG132 (2 M) or chloroquin (100 M) for 6 h prior to cell lysis.

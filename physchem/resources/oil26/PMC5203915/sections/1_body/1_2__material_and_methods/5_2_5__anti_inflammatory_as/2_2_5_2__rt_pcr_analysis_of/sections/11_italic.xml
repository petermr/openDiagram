The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95&#176;C for 3&#8201;min, denaturation at 94&#176;C for 1&#8201;min, annealing at 55&#8211;65&#176;C for 1&#8201;min, and extension at 72&#176;C for 2&#8201;min. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Further procedures are described in a previous study by Sitarek et al. [

<p id="Par27">In proteome, metabolome, and transcriptomics analysis, we obtained 141 differential proteins, 37 differential metabolites, and 831 differential genes. By combining the differential genes in the three omics of the proteome, transcriptome, and metabolome in the analysis, a total of 24 genes were screened for associated differences in the proteome, transcriptome, and metabolome. The functions of these genes mainly include genes related to RNA editing, respiratory electron transport chain, anther development protein, energy transport-related protein, tapetum development protein, and oxidative phosphorylation protein (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the high-generation near-isogenic line materials, the significant differences in restoration genes led to differences in protein, metabolic, and transcription levels. Therefore, we screened for protein interactions between the

 <italic>orf224</italic> and the restoration gene 
 <italic>Rfp</italic> by yeast two-hybridization to understand further the mechanisms of sterility and restoration genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). RT-PCR validated the genes validated by yeast two-hybridization, and only three genes were found to be insignificantly different, while all other genes were significantly different (Fig. S

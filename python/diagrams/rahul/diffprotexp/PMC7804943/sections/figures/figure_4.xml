  <title>Expanded analysis of whole-brain reveals coordinated regulation by all layers.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Summary of latent factors inferred by MOFA and the contributions of each layer to each factor (see Fig. 1b for details). 
   <bold>b</bold> Beeswarm plots illustrating the variation described by the latent factors inferred by MOFA (see Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> for description of Beeswarm plots). 
   <bold>c</bold> Combined scatter and contour plots comparing the loadings for pairs of latent factors: LF1 versus LF2 (left), LF3 versus LF5 (middle and right). The contours indicate the density of cell types for a specific attribute. In particular, age is a highly correlated with LF1 (left), excitatory neurons are correlated with LF3 (middle), and PNS neurons are correlated with LF4 (right). unk = unknown.

<p id="Par89">Human iPSCs (WTC-11, Coriell Institute) were cultured and maintained on vitronectin (ThermoFisher Scientific) treated culture plates in Essential8 medium (ThermoFisher Scientific). Differentiation of iPSCs into MNs was directed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with slight modifications that substituted the NSC growth in suspension (D7-D13) with a growth on vitronectin substrate to improve the cell survival rate and to ensure gene expression profile characteristic to motor neuron progenitor cells (MNP). Briefly, iPSCs were cultured in neural media which consisted of 1:1 DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal medium supplemented with N2, B27, 1x Glutamax and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (all from ThermoFisher Scientific), and 0.1 mM ascorbic acid (StemCell Technology). On days 0–6 3 μM CHIR99021 (StemCell Technology), 2 μM DMH-1 (Tocris) and 2 μM SB431542 (StemCell Technology) were added to the neural medium; days 6–12 the same media was used with the addition of 0.1 μM RA (StemCell Technology) and 0.5 μM Pur (Sigma); days 12–18 cells were maintained with 0.1 μM RA and 0.5 μM Pur added to the neural media; finally from day 18 on cells were cultured with 0.5 μM RA, 0.1 μM Pur and 0.1 μM CpdE (StemCell Technology), IGF-1, BDNF, and CNTF (all from R&amp;D Systems, 10 ng/ml each). For optimum neuronal network formation, cells at the MNP differentiation stage (D12) were plated on MEA at 60% area density.

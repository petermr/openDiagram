<p>Therefore, one of the most important messages that we hope to convey with this Review is that the seemingly simplicity of the XAS method is often misleading, especially, when 
 <italic>operando</italic> XAS studies are undertaken to study transformations taking place in realistic catalysts under working conditions. The disordered nature of the catalysts, the coexistence of different species within the catalyst, possible multiple active sites, a limited signal-to-noise ratio of the XAS data collected under harsh reaction conditions or in strongly attenuating sample environments, or the lack of sufficient contrast in the XAS spectra for different structural motifs put stringent requirements on the instrumentation but also require that one exerts extreme caution during the data analysis steps.

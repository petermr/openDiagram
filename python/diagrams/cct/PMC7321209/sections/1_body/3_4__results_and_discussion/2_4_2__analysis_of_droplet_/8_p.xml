 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f009">Figure 9</xref>aâ€“c exhibited near net shaped quality for CTWD adjustment of 12 mm and welding velocities from 0.2 to 0.6 m/min. Thereby, little curvature at the structure beginning and end, an even overall height and low spatter formation were observed. In addition, high frequency of short circuits (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f008">Figure 8</xref>) led to homogeneous wetting behavior and melt bead solidification. As a result, the required amount of post-processing was limited due to geometrical properties close to the final contour. Increasing welding velocity results in the formation of structures with decreased height, which could be explained by reduced material transfer per unit length at a constant wire feeding speed.

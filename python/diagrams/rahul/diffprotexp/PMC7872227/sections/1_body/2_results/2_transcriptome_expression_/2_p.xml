<p>In addition, there were a number of pathways that require the utilization of nitrogen showing enhanced expressions of related functional proteins, such as amide biosynthetic process (GO: 0043604), organic substance biosynthetic process (GO: 1901576), and organonitrogen compound biosynthetic process (GO: 1901566) (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246818.g011">11</xref>). It was noteworthy that numerous functional genes related to the digestion and absorption of nitrogen-containing substances were also enhanced, including peptide metabolic process (GO: 0006518), cellular protein metabolic process (GO: 0044267), protein metabolic process (GO: 0019538), cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO: 0034641), and so on. Among them, what attracted us most was the expression change of urease. Given the function of urease, its associated seven genes were involved in three types of metabolic processes, cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO: 0034641), nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO: 0006807) and organonitrogen compound metabolic process (GO: 1901564). As with the overall changes in those three metabolic processes, all urease genes showed enhanced expressions in the absence of nitrogen sources (Figs

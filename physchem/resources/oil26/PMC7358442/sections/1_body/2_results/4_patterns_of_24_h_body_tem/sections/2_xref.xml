<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), that nadir, averaged for six aardvarks for which we retrieved body temperature data, was below 34&#176;C. Variability in body temperature between aardvarks, as indicated by the standard deviation, was much higher during the drought winter month than in the non-drought winter month, when aardvarks had remarkably similar body temperatures. In the summer months, drought had little influence on that variability.

  <p>Statistical analysis of differentially expressed proteins and urine protein markers with significant differences between early and late stage lung adenocarcinomas. (a) The heat map of changed in urine proteins. (b) The heat map of changed in serum proteins. (c) Prostate-specific antigen expression in lung adenocarcinoma groups was significantly lower in the metastatic groups than in the non-metastasis groups. (d) Prostatic acid phosphatase expression of the metastatic groups was significantly lower than that of the nonmetastatic groups in lung adenocarcinoma. (e) The expression of neutrophil defensin in the lung adenocarcinoma groups was significantly higher than that in the metastatic group than that in the nonmetastatic groups.</p>

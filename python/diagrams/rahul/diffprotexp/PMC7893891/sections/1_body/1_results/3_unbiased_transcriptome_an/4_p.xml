<p id="Par63">By focusing our analysis on cellular development pathways, we found significantly altered gene expression profiles of genes involved in TGFβ, Notch, and Shh signaling pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, 7 days after chemical inhibition of TGFβ, we observed a significant downregulation of genes acting as negative regulators of TGFβ signal transduction: 
 <italic>PMEPA1</italic> and 
 <italic>TGIF1</italic>, repressors of SMAD2 function, and 
 <italic>SKIL</italic> the nuclear repressor of TGFβ-responsive genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. At the same time, a gene positively regulated by TGFβ signaling, 
 <italic>JUNB</italic>/
 <italic>AP1</italic>, was upregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). These data indicate there was a transient inhibition (lasting less than 7 days) of the TGFβ signaling pathway, when small molecules were present in the culture media to target ALK receptor kinases. In the Notch signaling pathways, we observed a downregulation of 
 <italic>Hes1</italic>, 
 <italic>NOTCH2</italic>, and 
 <italic>PRKCA</italic> after NSCs conversion into MNPs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b; D13). Interestingly, gene expression of 
 <italic>Hes5</italic> and 
 <italic>JAG1</italic> was upregulated until D18 when cells entered the eMN developmental stage. The final MN maturation phase required the addition of CpdE, a Notch signaling pathway inhibitor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], along with growth factors: insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Our results indicated that downregulation of Notch regulators 
 <italic>JAG1</italic> and 
 <italic>Hes5</italic> gene expression was required for the maturation of MNs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b; D28). Shh signaling is essential for patterning and specification of neuronal cells. Significant activation of a key Shh receptor gene, 
 <italic>PTCH1</italic>, was observed at D7 prior to the addition of Pur, and remained upregulated throughout the differentiation process but decreased in MNs (D28), indicating that this gene may act as a positive regulator of cell division in human neuronal cells. In contrast, 
 <italic>ARHGAP36</italic> and 
 <italic>CRMP1</italic> genes were downregulated upon transition of iPSCs to NSCs (D7) and responded to Pur with gradual stimulation of gene expression in MNs at D18–28 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).

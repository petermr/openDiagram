<p id="Par41">We, respectively, visualized the genomic locations of binding sites of LMNA alone (MACS) and LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes (SICER) using the ChIPseeker by R package. We found that the majority of binding sites of LMNA and LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes were located in distal intergenic regions, followed by introns, promoters, and to a lesser degree in exons, 3′ UTRs and 5′ UTRs. Compared with LMNA binding sites, the locations of intergenic regions were significantly reduced in binding sites of LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes, meanwhile, the locations of promoters were obviously increased. Furthermore, these pie charts also illustrated that the promoter regions of binding sites in both LMNA and LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes in DCM were significantly lower than control groups (Fig.

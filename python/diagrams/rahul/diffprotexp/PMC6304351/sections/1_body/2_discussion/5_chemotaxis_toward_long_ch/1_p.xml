<p>Chemotaxis allows the movement of flagellated bacteria toward or away from chemical gradients in the environment and this process plays a role in hydrocarbon degradation by bringing cells into contact with alkanes (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Parales and Harwood, 2002</xref>). A methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) detects the presence of attractant/repellent via a periplasmic sensing domain. Binding of the chemoeffector (alkane) causes the MCP to undergo a conformational change that is transmitted across the inner membrane through to cytoplasmic chemotaxis protein. The signal is transmitted to the flagellar via CheW and the sensor histidine kinase CheA, which can phosphorylate the response regulator CheY. Phosphorylated CheY controls swimming behavior by binding to the flagellar motor to reverse the default direction of flagellar rotation from counter-clockwise to clockwise. This signaling cascade results in movement toward or away from the chemical attractant or repellent. During growth on

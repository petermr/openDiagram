 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the microstructural features of the hot rolled 1.0C-1.5Cr steel. One could clearly see that netlike pearlite and pre-eutectoid carbide coexisted in the as-hot rolled steel. Nevertheless, pre-eutectoid carbide mainly located at grain boundaries, leading to grain boundaries light (arrows indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b). During cooling, the carbide network first precipitated along grain boundaries of the austenite, and then the carbide network gathered to form a banded structure during the subsequent rolling. It was reported that the pro-eutectoid carbides were dendritic, and the dendrite arms preferentially grew along the grain boundary interface [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b). The different stress states during the rolling process should be responsible for the appearance of these distinct morphologies. The cementite lamella underwent bending deformation during the rolling process as the pearlite lamellar was at a large angle with the rolling direction. In contrast, pearlite remarkably refined to form FLS as the pearlite lamellae were at a small angle or parallel to the rolling direction [

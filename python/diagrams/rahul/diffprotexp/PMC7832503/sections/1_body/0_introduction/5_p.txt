0: In this study, we used an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 host-based WGS approach to identify novel genetic risk loci associated with severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and explore its hidden mechanisms.
1: We separately excavated the contributions of common SNVs and rare functional SNVs in the process of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.
2: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyse genetic factors associated with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection using a host-based WGS method.
3: Our study will be helpful to improve the treatment of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected patients and develop new vaccines.

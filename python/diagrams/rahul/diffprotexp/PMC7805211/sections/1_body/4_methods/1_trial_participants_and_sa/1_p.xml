<p id="Par21">45 cutaneous neurofibromas, 17 plexiform neurofibromas, and 9 normal skin and nerve samples were collected from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. These samples were collected prospectively under an approved Spectrum Health/Van Andel Research Institute IRB protocol (SH/VAI IRB#2014–295) (NCT02777775). Additional specimens were analyzed according to ethical standards and under a Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol (JH IRB # J1649, PI Pratilas). The JH NF1 biospecimen repository is supported by a grant from the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP, n-tap.org), to C.A.P. Analysis by Sage Bionetworks is supported through the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP, n-tap.org). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Tumor samples were isolated by microdissection to remove adjacent normal tissue then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. Quality parameters included assessment of percent content (&gt; 95%) and viability (&gt; 90% nuclear viability) by H/E staining. Biospecimen handling was performed according to BRISQ guidelines.</p>

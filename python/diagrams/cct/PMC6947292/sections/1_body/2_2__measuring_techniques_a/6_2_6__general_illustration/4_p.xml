<p>As the most compressed illustration of information on quench-induced precipitation in Al alloys, CCP diagrams describe the precipitation behaviour of aluminium alloys during continuous cooling from solution annealing, as a function of temperature and time. Since a very broad time (cooling rate) range is physically and technologically relevant, the time axis is scaled logarithmically. We define the time axis as ranging from 0.1 s to 1,000,000 s in each case, while the plotted temperature range is fixed at 550 °C to 0 °C. This allows us to cover the relevant time and temperature scales for most alloys.</p>

<p>The reversed austenite generally nucleated at grain boundaries, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Especially, the pre-existing retained austenite took a positive role in improving austenite nucleation sites. The filmy retained austenite grew directly in one dimension, which implies a larger nucleation number in the present investigated steel. The large initial nucleation number caused the slow grain growth. On the other hand, the grain grew in the boundary migration way, which is controlled by the relatively short distance of carbon diffusion. Therefore, the grain growth rate was small below 1100 Â°C.

<p id="Par20">Unlike EOC, LMP tumor is a unique epithelial subtype of ovarian tumor that intermediates between benign and malignant tumors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Meanwhile, LMP tumor is also known as borderline malignant ovarian cancer due to lack invasion of the underlying stroma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, the prognosis of LMP and EOC differ considerably due to their different invasiveness, with 5-year survival rate &gt; 90% for LMP versus a &lt; 30% survival for advanced high-grade EOC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, unilateral oophorectomy should be considered in LMP patients in view of its younger onset age, which is different from EOC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, a portion of LMP tumors display diffuse non-invasive extra-ovarian implants, and accurate identification of these implants can be very difficult [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, approximately 20–30% of LMP cases are finally confirmed to be EOC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, it can be seen that the diagnosis based on histopathology without using molecular markers will lead to inaccurate diagnosis of LMP. Therefore, identifying potential differential diagnostic markers for LMP and EOC may improve the diagnostic accuracy and also contribute to the development of novel therapeutic &amp; preventive strategies for EOC.

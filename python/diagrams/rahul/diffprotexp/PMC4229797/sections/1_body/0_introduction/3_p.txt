0: Only a few studies have analyzed the proteome in seminal plasma.
1: [ 111213141516] I.e.
2: Pilch and Mann reported 923 proteins in human seminal plasma from healthy men by mass spectrometry (MS).
3: [ 14] Recently, approximately 2300 unique proteins have been identified by MS in semen specimens from fertile control and postvasectomy males.
4: [ 11] In seminal plasma, 59 putative biomarkers of prostatitis have been recognized that need further validation for diagnosis and monitoring.
5: [ 12] In addition, Milardi  et al.
6: [ 13] found 919 proteins in the seminal plasma from a group of fertile men and showed that semenogelin I and II are the main proteins in human semen.
7: These proteins were previously reported to play an important role for fertility.
8: [ 17] However, many seminal plasma proteins are poorly known.

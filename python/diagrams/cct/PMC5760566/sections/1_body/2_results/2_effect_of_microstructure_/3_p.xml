<p id="Par16">The temperature dependence of the Charpy impact energy of the SA508Gr.4N steel is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The Charpy energy curves can be divided into three regions corresponding to the: upper shelf energy (USE), change in temperature, and lower shelf energy. The curves are basically S-shaped. When the test temperature is reduced, the impact force decreases and the impact energy decreases rapidly at the transition temperature. When the temperature is reduced to a certain extent, the rate of change of the impact force decreases gradually and becomes stable at a relatively low value. ASME specifies an impact performance of &gt;48 J at a test temperature of −30 °C

 </sup>. With the increase of QCR, the Charpy energy curves shifted to the lower-temperature zone on the left, indicating an increased toughness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The impact energy at −30 °C of the QT and the QT-S.C states at a quenching cool rate of 4.4 °C/min were higher than 78 J and 70 J, respectively, above the values indicated by ASME.

<p>By combining evidence from microgravimetry, vibrational spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and adsorption modeling, we showed that birnessite exposed to water vapor accommodates no more than a single monolayer of water in its interlayer region at 25 Â°C. The 2 W state of birnessite, known as buserite, is therefore not achieved by exposure of water vapor under ambient pressure and temperature.

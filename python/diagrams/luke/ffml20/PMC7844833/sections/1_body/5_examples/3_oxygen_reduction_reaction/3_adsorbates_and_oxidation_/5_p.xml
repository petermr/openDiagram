<p>The presence of oxides is also important in the context of catalyst degradation since the catalyst oxidation was linked to the dissolution of Pt and ripening of Pt NPs.

 </sup> For example, recently Kim et al. reported the enhanced performance of Pt catalysts on carbon supports functionalized with oxygen-containing groups in comparison with that for the catalysts without such functionalization. However, more severe degradation was observed for the oxygen-functionalized sample. The analysis of Pt L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge XANES data suggested an increased oxidation state for Pt atoms in this catalyst even at reducing potentials, which can explain both, the enhanced performance as well as poor durability of this material.

<p>Proteomics is a large-scale study of proteins expressed in cells, mostly detected using a mass spectrometer. Proteomic findings have been widely used to identify and quantify proteins involved in the research of drug treatments, biomarkers and diseases, including PD. For example, a previous study reported a proteomic approach using 2D gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to explore the protein expression pattern in primary skin fibroblasts of patients with PD (

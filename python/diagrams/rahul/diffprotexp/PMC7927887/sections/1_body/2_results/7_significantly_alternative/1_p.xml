<p>We identified protein-protein interactions (PPI) using the list of significantly alternatively (JunctionSeq &amp; DEXSeq) spliced genes as input (n=618) and only selected high confidence interactions (minimum interaction score of 0.700). The resulting PPI network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig005">Figure 5B</xref>) identified a large cluster of differentially spliced genes associated with mRNA processing and splicing pathways. Genes identified in the mRNA processing pathway included 
 <italic>SRRM2, SUGP1</italic>, and 
 <italic>PPIE</italic>. Other pathways in the differentially spliced gene clusters included RNA decay and protein ubiquitination.

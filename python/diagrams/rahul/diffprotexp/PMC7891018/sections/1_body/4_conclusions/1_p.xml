<p id="Par46">In this study, we infected A549 cells with H5N1 and H9N2Â AIVs, then extracted the mitochondrial proteins of the infected cells for differential protein analysis. Through analysis of the functions of the differential proteins, it was found that compared with that in the H9N2 group, T cell activation in the H5N1 group was reduced and antigen presentation was weakened. Based on GO analysis, most of these differential proteins were related to apoptosis. To a certain extent, the pathogenicity of different IAVs is related to their ability to cause apoptosis. In our research, we identified different proteins, such as Stress-70 protein, peroxide reductase-5, enoyl-CoA hydratase, Stomatin-like protein 2, ATP synthase, and 60-kDa heat shock protein. These identified proteins play an important role in apoptosis. This study aids the analysis of the pathogenic mechanism of influenza viruses with different virulence, and provides a reference for the selection of anti-influenza virus host targets.</p>

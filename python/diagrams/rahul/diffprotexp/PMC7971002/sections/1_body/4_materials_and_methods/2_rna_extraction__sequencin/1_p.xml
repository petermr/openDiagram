<p id="Par29">The Hu sheep ovaries were harvested and total RNA was extracted from the ovaries using the TRIZOL RNA extraction kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA concentration and purity were checked using Nano Drop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The integrity of the RNA was validated using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). A total of 1.5 μg of RNA was used per sample as the input material to remove rRNAs. This was done using Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). The Sequencing libraries for six samples (HPgroup, n = 3; LP group, n = 3) were generated by NEBNextR UltraTM Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for IlluminaR (NEB, USA). The sequences for each of the samples were labelled with index codes. Fragments of 150-2 bps were selected by purifying the library fragments using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Three (3) μlUSEREnzyme (NEB, USA) was subsequently used alongside size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNAs at 37 °C for 15 min prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR was then run using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and index (X) Primer. PCR products were finally purified (AMPure XPsystem, Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA) and quality of the library was evaluated using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The previously index-coded samples were aggregated on acBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kitv3-cBot-HS (Illumia) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Library preparations were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq platform after cluster generation, and paired-end reads were generated. The purity and size of the library were assessed by the Agilent 2100 system (Agilent, California). The transcript sequences of ovaries used for the study have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (SRA accession number: PRJNA638028).</p>

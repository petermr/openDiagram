<p id="p0115">It is important to note that cobalt element in the state of unbound Co
 <sup>2+</sup> in the electrolyte did not facilitate the deposition of active Mn compound. As presented in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S12</xref>, LSV of SS in the electrolyte with and without additional 0.01 M CoSO
 <sub>4</sub> demonstrated similar onset potentials of ∼1.9 V, indicating no beneficial effect on facilitating the Mn compound deposition. Therefore, the promoted deposition of active Mn compound would be ascribed to the cobalt hydroxides and cobalt-containing species that bound on the solid cathode. This result is vital for the analysis in the following section.

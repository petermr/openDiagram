<p id="Par19">p38 is involved in the direct recruitment of SWI/SNF complexes to gene promoters resulting in chromatin modification and enhanced expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Although the methylation states of SWI/SNF complex family member DMRs were not discordant between CNFs and PNFs, it is plausible that reinforced MKK3/p38 signaling would exert its effect through SWI/SNF leading to the observed conformationalÂ changes. Further studies are needed to determine how SWI/SNF affects expression of genes involved in growth, proliferation, and inflammation. Moreover, the effects of targeting p38 may be amplified by expected loss of recruitment of SWI/SNF complexes to target genes.

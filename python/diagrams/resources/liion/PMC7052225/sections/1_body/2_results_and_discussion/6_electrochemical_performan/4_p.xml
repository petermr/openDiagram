<p id="Par42">Although the resulting Coulombic efficiency becomes better by rapidly performing five cycles at 5 C, this improvement has no significant impact on the cyclability because 80 and 91% of the initial discharge capacity at C/10 are obtained after 70 charge/discharge cycles at C/10 for the electrodes composed of VGCF–COOH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>, □) and a mixture of VGCF–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H and CNT–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI9</xref>. It is evident that the use of a small quantity of CNT–SO
 <sub>3</sub>H in the composition of the electrode enhances not only the discharge capacity delivered but also the cyclability over hundreds of cycles. The rapid capacity loss observed after 80 charge/discharge cycles in the self-standing film composed of VGCF–COOH is probably caused by the degradation of the Li metal anode

 </sup>. This is confirmed by the additional electrochemical results obtained using PTCDA electrodes with higher active mass loadings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI10</xref>, Supporting Information), which sustain a rapid capacity decay after only 70 cycles. In fact, the increase in active mass induces the increase in the cycling current, which promotes the formation of lithium with a high surface area and leads to an insufficient cycle life

<p>The diffusion behaviors of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O through the PI matrices were analyzed. The representative trajectories of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules in the three PI systems during 10 ns simulation run are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f012">Figure 12</xref>. Additionally, the displacements |r
 <sub>i</sub> (t) − r
 <sub>i</sub> (0)| of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S11</xref>. The curves for 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI have been shifted vertically for better visualization in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S11</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f012">Figure 12</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S11</xref>, the diffusions of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules in the polymer matrix involved random oscillations within the available free volume and occasional jumps from one voids to another [
 <xref rid="B49-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The length of the trajectories for O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecules in the three PI matrices decreased in the order: Kapton ˃ 2,7-CPPI ˃ 2,7-CPI. The jumps frequency and lengths of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PI matrices followed the same trend (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S11</xref>). It also can be seen that H
 <sub>2</sub>O showed lower mobility than O
 <sub>2</sub> in a particular PI matrix.

Specimens were identified by Pr. Fethia Harzallah-Skhiri, University of Monastir. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Laboratory of Nutrition - Functional Food &amp; Vascular Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Monastir, Tunisia and referenced as SO011. The experimental zone is a semi-arid bioclimatic area with a mean rainfall of 450 mm/ year situated at an elevation of 30 m above sea level (latitude 35&#176;54'N, longitude 10&#176;33'E). Particle size analysis of the soil revealed the following composition: silt (14.0 %), clay (12.5 %) and sand (73.5 %). The soil characteristics were: electrical conductivity (2.07 mmho/cm), organic matter (1.65 %), pH (8.38), CaO (1084 ppm), Na (875 ppm), K<sub>2</sub>O (149 ppm) and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (48 ppm). </p>

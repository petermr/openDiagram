<p>To explore the porous properties of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> in detail, the water adsorption isotherm was acquired at 298 K. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>, water was adsorbed with a large hysteresis and a step was present at

 <sub>0</sub> = 0.7, which is typically observed in the sorption isotherms of flexible MOFs in which structural transformations occur.

 <sub>0</sub> = 0.92, the adsorption was 238 cm

 <sup>–1</sup> (at STP), which corresponds to the adsorption of 15 water molecules per HHTP/HAT-CN dimer. This stepwise sorption behavior suggests that the structural transformation or lattice expansion occurred at

 <sub>0</sub> = 0.7. N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption measurements of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> at 77 K were also performed, and the obtained N
 <sub>2</sub> isotherm showed that 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> does not adsorb nitrogen at this temperature. This result suggests that 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> adsorbs only polar molecules (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, H
 <sub>2</sub>O and DMF) in the intercolumnar space or that the structural transformation requires a higher temperature due to the high activation energy necessary for the diffusion process. The XRPD pattern after the water-sorption experiments (Fig. S9
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>) is similar to that prior to water adsorption. In addition, SEM imaging confirmed that the morphology was maintained after water adsorption (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3f</xref>), suggesting that recrystallization did not occur during the adsorption measurements and water adsorption did not destroy the 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> columnar structure. These results demonstrate that the pseudo-hexagonal columnar packing is retained during water adsorption.

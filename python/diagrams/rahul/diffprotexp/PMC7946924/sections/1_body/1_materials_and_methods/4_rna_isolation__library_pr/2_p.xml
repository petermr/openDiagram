<p id="Par10">Small RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq Small RNA Sample preparation protocol (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) at Genotypic Technology Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India. One microgram RNA was used as starting material for the assay. Then 3′ adapters were ligated to the specific 3′OH group of micro RNAs followed by ligation of 5′ adapter. Adapter ligated fragments were reverse transcribed with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Cat# 18080044, Invitrogen, USA), enriched and indexed by 15 cycles of PCR amplification. The libraries were quantified by Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and its fragment size distribution was analyzed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The libraries were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina, SanDiego, USA) for 75 bp single read chemistry following manufacturer’s procedure.</p>

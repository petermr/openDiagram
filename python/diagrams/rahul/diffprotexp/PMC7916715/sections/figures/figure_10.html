 <caption> The LE gene panel robustly predicts PC recurrence. ( A) hazard ratio (HR), 95% CI, and p values for LE panel scores in predicting PC relapse. ( B) Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The time scales above and below are for the MSKCC and TCGA PanCancer cohort, respectively. ( C– F) Kaplan–Meier survival curves and the risk score waterfall plot are for the TCGA ( C, D) and MSKCC ( E,F) cohort. For waterfall plots, the cutoff points were used as the baselines. Statistical analyses were performed using log rank test. </caption>

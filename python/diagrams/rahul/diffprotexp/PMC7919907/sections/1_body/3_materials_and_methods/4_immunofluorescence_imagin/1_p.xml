<p>HCoV-OC43 immunofluorescence staining was performed similarly as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] with minor modifications. For drug time-of-addition experiment using immunofluorescence staining, RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 at an MOI of 1. Viral infection started at the −2 h time-point and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h to allow virus attachment. At −1 h time-point, unbound virus was removed and cells were washed with ice-cold PBS buffer. Same volume of medium without virus was added into each well and cells were incubated at 33 °C for 1 h to allow virus entry. At 14 h post infection (hpi), cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for another 10 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum, cells were sequentially stained with anti-Coronavirus antibody, HCoV-OC43 strain, clone 541-8F (Cat#: MAB9012, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) as primary antibody, and anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-488 or Alexa-546 (Cat # A-11029, Cat # A-11030, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Nuclei were stained with 300 nM DAPI (Cat#: D1306, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) after secondary antibody incubation.

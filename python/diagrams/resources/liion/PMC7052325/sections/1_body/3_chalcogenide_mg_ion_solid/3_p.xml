<p>In 2017, Canepa, Bo and Ceder demonstrated the discovery of spinel chalcogenides MgX
 <sub>2</sub>Z
 <sub>4</sub> [X = (In, Y, Sc) and Z = (S, Se)] as a class of fast Mg ion solid conductors with the combination of theoretical and experimental studies (Canepa et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The ambient-temperature ionic conductivity could reach as high as ~10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for MgSc
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub> at 25°C. The fast diffusion of Mg ions was achieved by the occupation of stable Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> site in its unfavorable tetrahedral coordination environment within spinel structure (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Such rationale could be used as a general design rule for multivalent-ion solid conductors. However, the electronic conductivity of MgSc
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub> is ~0.04% of the ionic conductivity, which is substantially larger than other state-of-the-art alkali solid-state electrolytes (σ
 <sub>e</sub>/σ
 <sub>i</sub>~10
 <sup>−4</sup>-10
 <sup>−6</sup>%) and hinders MgSc
 <sub>2</sub>Se
 <sub>4</sub> as an applicable solid-state conductor.

<p>Our result is the first report showing the role of YjbH as a virulence factor of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in animal models, both silkworms and mice, and the first to show the function of YjbH regarding virulence is related to oxidative stress in the host. Previous studies had determined the viability of the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> and the 
 <italic>yjbI</italic> genes-disrupted mutants in organs of infected mice [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, our microbial viability data were different from the previous report [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the killing ability of the mutants in mice systemic infection model and found that under our conditions, the mutants were less virulent. Moreover, transcriptome analysis suggested that YjbH acts as a regulator of expression of multiple genes and many of which were related to virulence and oxidative stress. Furthermore, YjbH seems to be necessary for the expression of various proteins located on the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface and proteases.

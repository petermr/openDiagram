0: Reversed austenite transformation behavior plays a significant role in determining the microstructure and mechanical properties of heat affected zones of steels, involving the nucleation and growth of reversed austenite.
1: Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) was used in the present work to in situ observe the reversed austenite transformation by simulating welding thermal cycles for advance 5Mn steels.
2: No thermal inertia was found on cooling process after temperature reached the peak temperature of 1320 C. Therefore, too large grain was not generated in coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ).
3: The pre-existing film retained austenite in base metal and acted as additional favorable nucleation sites for reversed austenite during the thermal cycle.
4: A much great nucleation number led to the finer grain in the fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ).
5: The continuous cooling transformation for CGHAZ and FGHAZ revealed that the martensite was the main transformed product.
6: Martensite transformation temperature (Tm) was higher in FGHAZ than in CGHAZ.
7: Martensite transformation rate was higher in FGHAZ than in CGHAZ, which is due to the different grain size and assumed atom (Mn and C) segregation.
8: Consequently, the softer martensite was measured in CGHAZ than in FGHAZ.
9: Although 10~11% austenite retained in FGHAZ, the possible Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) effect at 60 C test temperature may lower the impact toughness to some degree.
10: Therefore, the mean absorbed energy of 31, 39 and 42 J in CGHAZ and 56, 45 and 36 J in FGHAZ were exhibited at the same welding heat input.
11: The more stable retained austenite was speculated to improve impact toughness in heat-affected zone (HAZ).
12: For these 5Mn steels, reversed austenite plays a significant role in affecting impact toughness of heat-affected zones more than grain size.

<p>To achieve a high number of peptides, and consequently, a high number of proteins identified, sample complexity needs to be reduced by separating either proteins or peptides. The most common separation approach consists of on-line separation of peptides by nano-LC using a reversed-phase column (RP) and injection into the mass spectrometer. In addition, a second on-line separation step (2D-LC) can be used by adding a second column (e.g., strong cation exchange) upstream of the RP column [

As an additional step, proteins can be pre-separated by 1D-SDS PAGE gel electrophoresis and peptides prepared by in gel digestion prior to nano-LC (GeLC method). The separation approach of choice will depend on the sample and LC instrumentation available [

<p>TSP isomerase catalyzes the reversible interconversion of G3P (glycerol-3-phosphate) and DHAP (dihydroxy acetone phosphate). TSP isomerase is essential for energy production, because only G3P can be used in glycolysis. TSP isomerase allows two molecules of G3P to be produced for every glucose molecule, hence doubling the energy yield. In Se-enriched yeast (SEY), the level of TSP isomerase is lower than that found in regular yeast (RY) [

In the present study, the levels of TSP isomerase in groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met were lower than those treated with sodium selenite and without Se (control). As for the level of TSP isomerase in SEY, it can be concluded that the Caco-2 cells can assimilate more nano-Se and Se-Met than sodium selenite at the same concentration. Nano-Se treatment had been demonstrated to present a higher accumulation of Se compared with sodium selenite treatment in the medaka (

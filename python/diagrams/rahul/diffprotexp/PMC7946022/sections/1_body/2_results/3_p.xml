  <italic>In vivo</italic> vancomycin therapy reduces 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> recovery from single species but not from mixed-species infected catheters
 </bold>. After confirming the suitability of the model for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm development, vancomycin therapy was administered twice daily for 5 days starting 3-days post-catheter implantation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4a</xref>). Based on microbial recovery from explanted catheters, vancomycin treatment resulted in significantly less 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> recovery from catheters from animals with single-species infection (****, p &lt; 0.0001), but had no impact on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> recovery from animals with mixed-species catheter infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4b</xref>). Vancomycin had no effect on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> recovery under all conditions tested (suppl. Fig S1).

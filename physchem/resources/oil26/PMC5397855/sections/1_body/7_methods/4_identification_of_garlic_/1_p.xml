<p>Quantitative analyses of the garlic essential oil formulation were performed using a gas chromatograph (GC-17A series instrument, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The following chromatographic conditions were used: a fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.22 mm) with a DB-5 bonded phase (0.25 μm film thickness); carrier gas N
 <sub>2</sub> at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>; injector temperature 220 °C; detector temperature 240 °C; column temperature programmed to begin at 40 °C (remaining isothermal for 2 min) and then to increase at 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 240 °C (remaining isothermal at 240 °C for 15 min); injection volume 1.0 μL (1%w/v in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>); split ratio 1:10; column pressure 115 kPa.

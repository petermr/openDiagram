  <p>CPSF1-depletion inhibits HCC proliferation and migration. CPSF1 was knocked down or overexpressed in HepG2.2.15 and HCCLM3 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of CPSF1 were determined by qRT-PCR 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and western blot 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, respectively. Statistical significance was calculated by one sample Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. Cell proliferation in the 
   <bold>(C)</bold> CPSF1-silenced or 
   <bold>(D)</bold> CPSF1-overexpression groups was detected using the CCK8 assay over five consecutive days. The relative absorbance was measured at OD
   <sub>450</sub>. Fold enrichment was normalized to the absorbance on day 1 and assessed by ANOVA. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Colony formation assays were used to determine the effect of CPSF1 on cell growth in the indicated groups. The number of colonies was counted using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States) and analyzed using Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Anchorage-independent assays showing that overexpression of CPSF1 promotes colony formation in HepG2.2.15 and HCCLM3 cell lines. 
   <bold>(G)</bold> Flow cytometry assays were used to determine the percentage of cells in various phases of the cell cycle following CPSF1 knockdown or overexpression. Statistical data were assessed using two-way ANOVA. Statistical data are presented as mean ± SD. *

0: The membranes from electrophoretic analysis were equilibrated in 0.5% Triton, blocked in 3% BSA, incubated with the primary antibodies (0.20.8 g/mL, 18 h; MMP2 (sc-10736) and MMP7 (sc-130819) were from Santa Cruz; TGF1 (mab240) and VEGF (AF-293-NA) were purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Il) and labeled with secondary specie-specific POD-conjugated antibodies (1/7000, 90 min; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA).
1: The specific signals were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Trial (Pierce).

 <bold>DNAse treatment of mixed 
  <italic>S. aureus-C. albicans</italic> biofilm enhances vancomycin efficacy against 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>
 </bold>. To determine whether increase in eDNA contributes to the enhanced 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> tolerance to vancomycin in mixed biofilm, vancomycin susceptibility testing was performed in the presence of DNAse. Based on CFU counts, DNAse treatment of mixed biofilms significantly sensitized 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to vancomycin (*, p &lt;Â 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6b</xref>). In contrast, DNAse did not impact 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptibility to vancomycin in single-species biofilm. DNAse alone had no significant effect on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> viability compared to untreated controls.

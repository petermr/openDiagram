<p>The costs for metaproteomics analyses per sample are similar to those of metagenomics or metatranscriptomics experiments, and rapid developments in the area of LC and MS are decreasing overall measurement costs. One of the major cost drivers in metaproteomics is the amount of run time needed on the LC-MS/MS system per sample. The amount of run time needed is changing in recent years, for example, runs in the past would often take 24 hours or more per sample for protein identification, whereas today runs of 2 to 6 hours are often sufficient. The hands-on time for metaproteomic sample preparation is around 1.5 to 2 days, and large numbers of samples can be prepared in parallel [

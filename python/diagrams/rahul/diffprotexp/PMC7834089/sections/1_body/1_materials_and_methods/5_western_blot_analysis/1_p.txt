0: The total protein from heart tissue and splenic CD4 + T cells was lysed in Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) Lysis Buffer (ThermoFisher, 89,900), with protease inhibitors (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China, ST506-2) and phosphatase inhibitors (Applygen Technologies, Beijing, China, P1260) for 30 min under rotating agitation.
1: The splenic CD4 + T cells were purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany).
2: A BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, 23,235) was used to measure protein concentration.
3: Then, 40 g heart tissue protein or 1020 g CD4 + T cell protein were mixed with one-fifth volume of 5 loading buffer.
4: The mixture was denatured by boiling at 100C for 10 min.
5: Samples were separated with 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane.
6: Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 2 h. After incubation with primary antibody at 4C overnight and secondary antibodies, membranes were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
7: The antibodies used included the following: rabbit anti-IL-1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #12,426), rabbit anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #12,912), rabbit anti-TNF- monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #11,948), rabbit anti-T-bet polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Abcam, #ab53174), rabbit anti-GATA3 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab106625), mouse anti-Ror- monoclonal antibody (1:1000; R&D System Technology, #600,214), rabbit anti-Foxp3 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, # ab54501), rabbit anti-IFN- polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab216642), rat anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab11524), rabbit anti-IL-17 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam, #ab79056), rabbit anti-NF-B p65 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #8242), rabbit anti-phospho-NF-B p65 (Ser536) monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #3033), rabbit anti-IB- monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #4812), rabbit anti-phospho-IB (Ser32) monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #2859), rabbit anti-JAK2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #3230), rabbit anti-phospho-JAK2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #4406), rabbit anti-STAT3 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #12,640), rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #9145), and rabbit anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #5174).
8: The experiment was repeated 3 times for each sample.

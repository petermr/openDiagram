<p>Then, the correlation between the expression levels of identified potentially interacting miRNAs and mRNAs was assessed using normalized read-count data from small RNA sequencing and matched data from gene expression profiling for the same tumor samples (GSE132982 dataset). Spearman rank correlation was calculated using data from expression profiling of 24 tumors in R environment. Unadjusted

 </sup> to exhibit a layered structure. It consists of interlayer domains in between calcium silicate networks that contain water molecules. While Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a shows a representative atomistic structure of C–S–H with a Ca/Si ratio of 1.09, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b plots the variations of water content as a function of Ca/Si molar ratio. The model construction process and relevant details are provided in the methods section. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b clearly shows a significant increase in water content with an increasing Ca/Si ratio. Such trend can be attributed to the increase in the degree of depolymerization and increase in interlayer spacing with increasing CaO content in C–S–H. A similar observation has also been reported in the literature

0: To determine whether activity loggers could reliably indicate the beginning and end of aboveground activity of aardvarks, we time-matched logger data to camera trap footage of an aardvarks times of emergence from a burrow, or an aardvarks time of return to a burrow after foraging.
1: Occasionally after emergence from a burrow, an aardvark remained at the burrow to rest before initiating foraging; in these cases, the time of emergence was identified as the time at which the aardvark started foraging.
2: For each data point from the activity logger, we calculated the median of six values before and six values after this data point (i.e., median activity over a duration of 65 min).
3: If the median exceeded 5% of the maximum activity recorded for each individual, we considered the aardvark to be active; if not, it was considered to be inactive.
4: We classified the time-stamp of the data point at which the 65-min median activity level changed from inactive to active to be the time of emergence, whereas the reverse change from active to inactive marked the time of the aardvarks return to a burrow.
5: To ensure accuracy of our calculated times of emergence from and return to burrows, we validated calculated times against the actual times obtained from camera trap footage where logger data were available at the same time as camera trap footage ( N = 176).

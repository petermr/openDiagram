<p id="Par27">The other protein that was statistically significantly different in abundance between meniscus and articular cartilage, after FDR control, was BGH3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). We found that BGH3 had a 5-fold higher expression in meniscus than articular cartilage. BGH3 is known to be expressed in several tissues and has been suggested to have a negative effect on chondrogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although it is not known exactly how BGH3 is incorporated into the ECM, it has been observed to bind to several collagens as well as fibronectin, decorin and biglycan [

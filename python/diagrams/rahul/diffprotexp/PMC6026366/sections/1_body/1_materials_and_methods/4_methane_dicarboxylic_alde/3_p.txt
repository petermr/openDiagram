0: The extent of lipid peroxidation in whole tissue was estimated by measurement of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) formation  [12].
1: The MDA assay was performed using an MDA kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer's instructions.
2: In brief, 0.2 mL thiobarbituric acid and antioxidant reagents were respectively pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube containing 0.1 mL of wild type or RGE-treated homogenate and MDA standard solution.
3: Tubes were vortexed and then incubated at 95C for 40 min and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min.
4: Then, 0.3 mL of the supernatant from each of the tubes was transferred to the quartz sampling cell, and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Lite; Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).
5: The content of MDA was expressed as nmol MDA/mg homogenate protein.
6: The total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

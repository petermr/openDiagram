<p>Alloying elements are of importance in affecting the austenite grain growth. Microalloying elements, like Nb, V and Ti, suppress the austenite growth as (Nb,V,Ti)(C,N) precipitates pin the austenite grain boundaries before complete dissolution at 1200 Â°C on heating [

 <xref rid="B12-materials-11-02127" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some elements, like B, easily segregate at grain boundaries. Thus, they reduce the austenite growth rate and result in finer grain at room temperature in CGHAZ. Ni is an austenite former element. When enriched in retained austenite in the original microstructure, it may enhance the reversed austenite nucleation site and lead to the final finer grain [

Other main elements, e.g., Mn should play a role in influencing the austenite grain growth due to either austenite former element or segregation to the grain boundaries. However, there is a lack of information about the Mn effect on austenite growth during welding.

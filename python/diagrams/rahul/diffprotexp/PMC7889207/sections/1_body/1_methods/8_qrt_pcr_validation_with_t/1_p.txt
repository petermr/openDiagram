0: Differentially expressed genes identified from the PCR arrays were further assessed by qRT-PCR using Taqman probes.
1: Complementary DNA was generated by reverse transcribing a total of 20 ng RNA using the High Capacity Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies, CA, USA) following instructions from the manufacturer.
2: Taqman gene expression probes and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) were used to measure the transcriptional status of  Slc27a3 (Rn01455596_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) in SAT and VAT from STD and CD-fed rats.
3: Relative expression levels were calculated using the standard curve method.
4: B2m (Rn00560865_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and Rplp1 (Rn03467157_gH, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) were selected as the two best endogenous controls from the PCR array using Norm finder [ 16].
5: The selected probes spans exons, and thus, RNA did not require DNAse-treatment.

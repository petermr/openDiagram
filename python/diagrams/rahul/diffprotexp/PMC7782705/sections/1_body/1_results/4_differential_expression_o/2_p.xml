<p id="Par14">Next, we set out to evaluate alterations in the expression of genes encoding for proteins of the splicing machinery between the same Braak stages. We found that among 441 genes related to “splicing” or “spliceosome” terms (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">6</xref>), 79 were DEGs at high compared to low or mid-Braak stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). In contrast, we could not detect any DEG in the comparison of mid vs low Braak stages. Among DEGs detected in the comparison between high and low/mid-Braak stages, we observed that several genes specifically associated with the neuronal splicing regulatory network

 </sup>, such as RBFOX1 and 2 (RNA binding Fox-1 homolog 1 and 2), ELAVL2 (ELAV like RNA binding protein 2), MBNL3 (muscleblind like splicing regulator 3), PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1), and NOVA2 (NOVA alternative splicing regulator 2) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, highlighted in red). A similar correlation between pathological burden and differential expression of the same 441 splice-related genes was observed in the comparison between all AD versus control subjects of the different datasets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F). Changes in the expression of those genes were hardly observed in FL (low number of gDTUs—Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), but were frequent in TL samples (high number of gDTUs—Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), albeit to a lesser extent than that observed in the comparison between different Braak stages (likely due to the effects of combining low, mid and high Braak stages in the AD group). Remarkably, the majority of the splicing-related genes with altered expression in the Mayo dataset was not reproduced in the MSBB BM36 dataset, and vice versa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). This could help to explain the dissimilar consequences of alternative splicing events observed in those datasets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>) and suggest that a myriad of proteins could be involved in altered splicing in the AD brains.

<p>Unlike for the RMC method, the only input that is required for the application of the trained ML routine for EXAFS analysis is the experimental EXAFS spectrum itself. Moreover, a very large number of spectra can be processed within seconds, making this approach highly attractive for high-throughput analysis. The issue of coexisting species can also be simply addressed in the ML approach by using for the ML training not just model spectra and RDFs for model compounds but their artificial linear combinations. Moreover, since the ML training is carried out with realistic MD structure models, the ML output is constrained to be some physically reasonable RDF, even for input spectra with limited data quality.</p>

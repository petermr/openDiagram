  <p>The PirB protein induces hemocytes apoptosis. (a) SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant rPirB proteins. (b) Apoptosis of primary hemocytes after 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with rPirB protein. The number of apoptotic cells (hemocytes) was determined at 4 h post-treatment with rPirB (0.1 µM), PBS (negative control) or Apoptosis inducer A (positive control) using by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The Q3-LR region of the graph represents early apoptotic cells, while the Q3-UR region represents late apoptotic cells. (i) Number of apoptotic cells. (ii) Percentage of apoptotic of hemocytes post-treatment with rPirB. (c) Analysis of shrimp hemocytes apoptosis after 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment with rPirB. Hemocytes were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h from shrimp injected with 0.8 µM rPirB proteins or PBS (negative control) and then analyzed by flow cytometry. (i) Number of apoptotic cells. (ii) Relative apoptosis ratio of hemocytes. The relative apoptosis ratio for the control at each time point was set to 1. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 4) for three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t-test relative to PBS treatment and the 
   <italic>p</italic>-values indicated on plots

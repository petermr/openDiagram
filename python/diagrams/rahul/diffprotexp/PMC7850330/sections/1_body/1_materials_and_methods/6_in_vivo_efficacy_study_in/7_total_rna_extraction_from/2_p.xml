 <bold> </bold>mg of Sino-nasal tissue was homogenized for extraction of total RNA by ultrasonic homogenizer (Sonics-Vibracell, Sonics &amp; Materials Inc., Newtown, USA) in 1
 <bold> </bold>ml TRIzol reagent (Amresco, Solon, USA). The entire RNA concentration was determined at A260 nm and the purity was calculated according to the ratio A260/A280. Samples have a purity ≥ 1.7 was used for qRT-PCR using GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as a reference housekeeping gene for determination of the relative expression of IL-1, TGF-β, and TNF-α.

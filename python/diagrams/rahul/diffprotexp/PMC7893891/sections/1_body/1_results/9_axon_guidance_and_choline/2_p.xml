<p id="Par76">We found netrin-G1 (
 <italic>NTNG1</italic>) to be initially downregulated as iPSCs transitioned into NSC, but then upregulated in eMNs and MNs from D13â€“28. Deleted in colorectal carcinoma 
 <italic>(DCC</italic>) was also significantly upregulated as iPSCs transition through NSCs to become MNPs, indicating its critical role in prompting axon extension. 
 <italic>SLIT1</italic> was upregulated at D7 and both 
 <italic>SLIT1</italic> and 
 <italic>SLIT2</italic> were upregulated as the NSCs became MNPs (D7-D13). HB9 tightly regulates Robo2 expression to regulate motor axon guidance in ventrally-projecting MNs [

 <italic>ROBO2</italic> downregulation in NSCs, during which time HB9 transcripts were initially accumulating (Fig.

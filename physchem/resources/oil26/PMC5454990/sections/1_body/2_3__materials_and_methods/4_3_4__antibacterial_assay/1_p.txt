0: The antimicrobial activity of EOs was determined against  Bacillus cereus (ATCC No.
1: 14579),  Escherichia coli (ATCC No.
2: 10798),  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC No.
3: 27853),  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC No.
4: 29213), and  Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC No.
5: 12228), using the microbroth serial dilution method as previously reported [ 45].
6: Thus, 50 L of 1%  w/ v solution of the samples in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was placed in the top well of 96-well microtiter plates and 50 L of cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB) was added.
7: The sample solutions were then serially diluted (1:1) by transferring 50 L of sample-CAMHB mixture to the next lane and adding 50 L fresh CAMHB to obtain a concentration range from 2500 to 12.5 gmL 1.
8: The bacteria were harvested from a fresh culture and added to each well at a concentration of approximately 1.5  10 8 colony forming units (CFU)mL 1.
9: The plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h and the final minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined as the lowest concentrations free of turbidity.
10: The antibiotic gentamicin was used as positive control and DMSO solvent was used as negative control.

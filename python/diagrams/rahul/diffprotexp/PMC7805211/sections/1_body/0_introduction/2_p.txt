0: NF1 loss of heterozygosity is thought to be the initiating event in CNF and PNF formation, making  NF1 the most commonly mutated gene in these tumors.
1: Other genetic alterations have also been described but are inconsistent between and across tumor types.
2: Previous genomic studies observed that approximately one third of CNFs exhibit focal chromosomal imbalance; however, there were no consistent chromosomal microstructure alterations among the samples analyzed [ 6].
3: Expression profiling studies have yielded mixed results as to whether CNFs and PNFs can be distinguished based on gene expression alone [ 5,  7].
4: It is important to note that these studies were not powered specifically to address differences between CNFs and PNFs, but rather focused on distinguishing PNFs and MPNSTs.
5: Even though CNFs and PNFs arise in distinct anatomic sites, mouse models have demonstrated that CNFs and PNFs share a common cell of origin in Schwann cell progenitors (i.e., skin-derived precursor (SKP) [ 8] or GAP43 + PLP + precursors) [ 9].
6: Currently, it is not well understood how tumor microenvironment impacts neurofibroma progression [ 10], however inflammation from  NF1 haploinsufficient mast cells is requisite for PNF development [ 11].
7: Prior work examining epigenetic modifications in CNFs and PNFs has also been confounded by the lack of tissue- and patient-matched controls, which are not always available in the context of  NF1 deficiency.
8: Thus, there are insufficient data to adequately explain why CNFs and PNFs exhibit such distinct clinical behavior.

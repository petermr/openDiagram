<p>NDHs were purified and enriched using as described by Golden et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with some modifications: 500 mL NDHs was cultured in BG110 for 72 h and sedimented at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4°C. To eliminate contamination by vegetative cells, NDHs were treated with a high concentration of lysozyme, Triton X-100, and long-term cell lysis to ensure that all vegetative cells were completely lysed. The precipitate was re-suspended in 50 mL lysozyme solution for 1 h at 25°C (5 mg/mL lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100 in TE buffer). Most vegetative cells were lysed during this period, whereas the heterocysts remained intact, as determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1D1 and 1D2</xref>). The microscopy results showed that heterocysts were mixed with impurities produced by lysed vegetative cells because of the strong adhesion of heterocysts (

 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], who suggested that the impurities were ruptured remains of vegetative cell or heterocyst protoplasts, and heterocysts mixed with cell contents were used to extract RNA from the heterocysts. To eliminate possible RNA residue from the ruptured remains of vegetative cells, the heterocyst-containing sediment was re-suspended in 500 μL TE buffer containing 50 μg/mL RNAase at 37°C for 1 h, followed by three washes with TE buffer. Finally, the purified heterocysts were mixed with mill silica sand (0.6–1.5 mm), ground into powder in liquid nitrogen, and diluted in deionized water for RNA extraction according to the instructions of the kit mentioned previously.

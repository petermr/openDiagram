<p>RCN3 is a novel ER-resident calcium-binding protein with multiple EF-hand motifs and a carboxyl-terminal HDEL sequence (
 <xref rid="b30-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). There is crosstalk between the unfolded protein reaction and calcium signals in the ER. The destruction of the calcium pool in the ER may lead to ER stress (

 <xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> demonstrates that the ratio of RCN3 is markedly upregulated prior to and following the induction of apoptosis (
 <xref rid="f7-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Therefore, XIAP may be associated with ER stress.

<p>We set the following criteria to determine the potential drug target protein among DIPs in docking studies: (i) its interactions should be activated in the disease state, and (ii) it should have at least 5 interactions. Among DIP proteins of pRCC, MET protein satisfied all the criteria and came to the forefront as a potential drug target. Through virtual screening, potential molecules targeting MET were determined. To have an insight into the ligand-receptor interactions, the available X-ray crystal structures of MET were fetched from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (

 <xref rid="B19-jpm-11-00158" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. PDB entry 3DKF was chosen for all the docking studies according to the resolution, Ramchandran outliers, and structural similarity between the screened ligands and the co-crystallized ligands. Virtual Screening binding analysis was carried out on the assigned binding site of the X-ray crystal structure of MET [

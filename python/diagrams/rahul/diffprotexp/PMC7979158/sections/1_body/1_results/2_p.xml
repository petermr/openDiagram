<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of MIA and control RNA-seq samples showed developmental age accounts for the majority of variance across samples, with some additional separation between MIA and control groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>). We performed stage-specific differential expression analysis for male and female samples and for both sexes with sex as a covariate. For each time-point, DE genes were defined using a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 threshold and a more inclusive p &lt; 0.05 threshold (

Sex-stratified analysis indicated generally concordant DE differences between male and female samples following MIA, although DE effect sizes appeared stronger in females at E14.5 and E17.5, leading to a larger number of DE genes identified independently in females compared to males (

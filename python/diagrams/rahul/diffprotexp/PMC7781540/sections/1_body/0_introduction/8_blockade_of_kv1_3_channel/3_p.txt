0: Pre-incubation of cells with the K V1.3 inhibitor ShK-223 did not significantly affect resting [Ca 2+] i ( Figure 3d,g), but eliminated peak SOCE responses larger than 300 nM and shifted the maximum of the distribution of peak SOCE values from 130 nM ( Figure 3b, control) to 70 nM ( Figure 3e, ShK-223).
1: The difference between the values of peak SOCE in control cells and cells preincubated with ShK-223 was significant ( Figure 3h).
2: The relationship between resting [Ca 2+] i and peak SOCE still displayed a mild positive correlation ( figure 3f).
3: Taken together, our data indicate that similarly to T lymphocytes, blockade of K V1.3 channels significantly reduces SOCE in LPS differentiated microglia.
4: The extent of the inhibition varied among cells with a greater effect on cells expressing large magnitude (> 300 nM) SOCE.
5: The specific characteristics of the cells with high and low peak SOCE remain to be determined.

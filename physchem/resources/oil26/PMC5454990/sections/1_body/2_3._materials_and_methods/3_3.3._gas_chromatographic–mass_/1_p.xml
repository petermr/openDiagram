<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The volatile compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography using an Agilent 6890 GC with an HP-5 ms column, and mass spectrometry with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (MSD) operated in the electron impact (EI) mode with electron energy = 70 eV. The scan range was 40&#8211;400 atomic mass units (amu) and the scan rate was 3.99 scans/s. The data were processed with an Agilent ChemStation data system. The gas chromatography (GC) column was a fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase that had a film thickness of 0.25 &#956;m and a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm. Helium was the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a column head pressure of 48.7 kPa. The injector temperature was 200 &#176;C and the detector temperature was 280 &#176;C. The GC oven temperature was programed to start with an initial temperature of 40 &#176;C, which was held for 10 min. The temperature was then increased at a rate of 3 &#176;C/min to 200 &#176;C, and then increased at 2 &#176;C/min to 220 &#176;C. A 1-&#956;L injection of a solution (0.2% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic> in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) of the sample was performed using a splitless injection technique. The percentages of each component were based on total ion current and are reported without standardization. Individual components were identified by comparison of both their mass spectra and GC retention data with authentic compounds present in commercial libraries [<xref rid="B44-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and our own in-house library.</p>

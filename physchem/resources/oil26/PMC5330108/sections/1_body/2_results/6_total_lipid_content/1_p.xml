<p>The effect of MPE on the total lipid content of 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. The lipid content of pathogen is decreased after treating with MPE. The total lipid contents of 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> after incubation with MPE at MIC and MFC for 120 min were 120.1 ± 3.5 and 80.4 ± 4.6 mg/g dry weight, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of control (160.2 ± 3.8 mg/g dry weight).

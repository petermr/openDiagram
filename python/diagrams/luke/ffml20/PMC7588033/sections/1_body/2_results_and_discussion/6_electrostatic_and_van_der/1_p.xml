<p>SMD simulation allows for the analysis of the interactions between the compounds and the lipid bilayer into individual contributions, for example, van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic interactions. Such interaction profiles with respect to the compound’s position are provided in the

A careful look at these profiles suggests that the vdW interactions (short range) are more pronounced in the central region of the bilayer with a width of about 4 nm. In contrast, the electrostatic interactions (long range) between the compound and the lipids are less pronounced in the very central region between the two layers and within a region with width of about 2 nm in the

By considering the magnitude of both the vdW and the electrostatic interactions for every position within the bilayer, we observe that these interactions are overall most pronounced at a distance ±2 nm from the center of the lipid bilayer. However, the electrostatic energy profiles appear to be slightly asymmetric with the energy obtaining lower values in the left part of the lipid bilayer. In contrast, the vdW interactions indicate some asymmetry in the right part of the bilayer, which may indicate the effect of steric interactions between the compounds and the lipids as the compound enters the bilayer.

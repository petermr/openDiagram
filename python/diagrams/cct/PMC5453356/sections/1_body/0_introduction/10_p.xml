<p>Another issue associated with this calorimetric technique is of more fundamental scientific importance. Zhuravlev 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="b35-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] investigated the crystallization of poly(ε-caprolactone) out of the liquid state and mentioned that the temperature range below the maximum of crystallization rate (which is comparable to the nose in isothermal TTP diagrams for aluminum alloys) is generally not accessible for non-isothermal cooling experiments, because the sample becomes amorphous (or supersaturated in the case of aluminum alloys) at the required cooling rates. Isothermal experiments after fast quenches extend the temperature range down to, and below, the glass transition temperature. This problem is basically also valid for the investigation of precipitation reactions from a supersaturated solid solution. Therefore, isothermal DSC experiments, which directly follow a cooling process that is faster than the critical cooling rate, enable the investigation of precipitation below the commonly known “nose” of a C-curve.

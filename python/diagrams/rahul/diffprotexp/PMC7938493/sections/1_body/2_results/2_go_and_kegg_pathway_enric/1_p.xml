<p id="Par50">To investigate the potential function and mechanisms of the identified RBPs, we divided these differentially expressed RBPs into upregulated and downregulated groups and performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The GO enrichment analysis showed that the biological processes of the upregulated RBPs were mainly enriched in ncRNA processing, tRNA metabolic processes, and RNA splicing, while the downregulated RBPs were mainly enriched for RNA splicing, regulation of cellular amide metabolic processes, and regulation of translation. The cellular component analysis indicated that the upregulated and downregulated RBPs were all primarily enriched in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein and ribonucleoprotein granules. The molecular function analysis showed that the upregulated RBPs largely enriched in catalytic activity, acting on RNA and ribonuclease activity; meanwhile, the downregulated RBPs were mainly enriched for translation factor activity, RNA binding, and mRNA 3′-UTR binding (Fig.

<p id="Par20">Only MS1 data from the DIA and DDA analysis was included in the statistical analysis which was performed in Stata (Release 14, StataCorp, 2015). All peak area intensity values for each precursor ion were added together, resulting in one peak area value for each protein in each fraction. In order to get one peak area value for each patient, the two fractions for each sample were added together and this value was used for further analysis. By selecting the top 3 peptides for each protein in the DIA analysis and calculating a mean value, we received a peak area value comparable to the DDA data. Only proteins with quantitative information in all patients from both tissues (
 <italic>n</italic> = 90 proteins) were included in the statistical analysis. Data was analysed using a linear mixed-effect model fitted through restricted maximum likelihood using the ANOVA method for computing degrees of freedom. The tissue donor was included as a random effect and the tissue (meniscus or articular cartilage) was included as fixed effect. Data was log2 transformed before the analysis. To mimic a typical analysis of data in proteome studies, we also performed an analysis with a control of the false discovery rate (FDR), using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg [

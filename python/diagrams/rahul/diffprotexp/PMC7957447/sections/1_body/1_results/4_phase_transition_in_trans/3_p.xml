<p id="Par14">As we collected multiple samples at different time-points of disease progression in each patient, the differences in sample number and sampling time may impact the results. We adjusted individual (different samples from the same patient) and sampling time (sampling day from disease onset), then re-analyzed the differentially expressed genes and their enriched pathways. Up-regulated genes were enriched in protein catabolism, erythrocyte development, mitophagy, and ferroptosis, whereas down-regulated genes were related to endothelial cells (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2). The robustness of the up-regulated genes indicates that protein catabolism, erythrocyte development, mitophagy, and ferroptosis are likely to be major changes that occur during Cluster 1-to-2 transition. We also assessed what clinical features contributed most to gene expression variance using the Adonis test (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2). Individual and sampling time ranked 3 and 6 in the list, suggesting that the donor and sampling time were not the most important factors. Interestingly, Hb ranked higher than sampling time (Additional file

0: Qualitative analysis was performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 7,890 coupled to a Agilent mass spectrometer model 5975 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20 m  0.18 mm; 0.18 m).
1: The oven temperature was 50C and remained constant for 3.2 min; then, it was increased to 300C at a rate of 8C/min.
2: The injector temperature was 280C.
3: Ionization was obtained by electron impact at 70 eV, and the electron multiplier was maintained at 2200 eV.
4: The temperature of the ion source was 230C.
5: Mass spectral data were acquired in the scan mode in the range m/z 33450.
6: The flow of carrier gas (helium) was set at 0.9 ml/min; compound identification was made by comparison of their spectra and RI with those of libraries such as Adams ( 2008), Nist ( 2008), and Koning, Hochmuth, and Joulain ( 2001) and were incorporated in the laboratory.

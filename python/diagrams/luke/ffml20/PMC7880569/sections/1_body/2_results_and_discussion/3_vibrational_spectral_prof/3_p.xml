 </sup> These chemometric analyzes revealed that only two spectral components accounted for over 96% of the variance of the spectra over the 0â€“98% RH range. Because additional components could not be extracted from these data, contributions from intercalated, adsorbed, and condensed interparticle water are implicitly overlapped in component C1. We ascribe the difficulties that arise in separating these contributions to the lack of variance in the spectra resulting from the concurrent binding of different water populations of highly comparable spectral profiles.

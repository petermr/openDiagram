<p>Several years later, a group of scientists from Merck modified A-317,567 in the region that links the amidine moiety which is found to be critical for inhibition of ASIC3, and an evaluation of a series of indole amidines modified at the 2-position of the indole ring led to the discovery of a potent ASIC3 blocker, “compound 9g” (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 490 nM, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6c</xref>), which at 10–30 mg/kg produced similar analgesic effects to naproxen (20 mg/kg) in CFA-induced mechanical hyperalgesia [
 <xref rid="cit0188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. The same group continued to explore the SAR around A-317,567 and linked the 2-napththimidamide and tetrahydroisoquinoline moieties and produced several derivatives. The compound with an acetylenic linkage (“compound 10b”, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6d</xref>) was also highly potent (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 356 nM) ASIC3 channel blocker, which was also found to reverse mechanical hypersensitivity in the rat iodoacetate model of OA, although sedation was noted [
 <xref rid="cit0189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Sedation was also observed in ASIC3
 <sup>−/-</sup> mice, suggesting that sedation (and thus possibly also analgesia) are mediated independent of ASIC3 inhibition [
 <xref rid="cit0189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. To identify novel chemical scaffolds against ASIC3, Merck also carried out a high-throughput electrophysiological screening of their proprietary fragment library. From the initial hits, subsequent optimization led to significant improvement of potency (0.7 mM to 3 μM) with retention of good ligand efficiency and incorporation of reasonable physicochemical properties, off-target profile, and pharmacokinetics in rats [
 <xref rid="cit0190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. The best lead compound (‘compound 24’, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6e</xref>) from this fragment-based approach had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.1 μM when measured in vitro, but to date there has been no evaluation of this or other compounds from this (late 2010) report against pain in in vivo models.

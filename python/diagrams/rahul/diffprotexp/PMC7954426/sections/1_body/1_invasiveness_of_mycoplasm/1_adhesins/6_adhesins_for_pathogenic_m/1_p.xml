<p>There are two adhesins in 
 <italic>M. arthritidis</italic>, Maa1 and Maa2, both of which can induce protective immunity; however, monoclonal antibodies against Maa1 and Maa2 only partially inhibit cytadherence [
 <xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Maa1 is a major adhesin that is sensitive to trypsin, and its pathogenic role warrants further investigation. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>M. arthritidis</italic> Maa2 mutant showed enhanced cytadherence [
 <xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which Maa2 regulates adhesion remains unclear and may be associated with epitope masking or “on/off”-switched phase variation.

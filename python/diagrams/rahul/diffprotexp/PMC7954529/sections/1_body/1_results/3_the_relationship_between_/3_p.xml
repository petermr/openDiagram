<p>To provide possible mechanistic insight into the relationship between PAS usage and gene expression, we identified AU-rich elements (AREs) in 3' UTRs in both human and chimpanzee. AREs in 3' UTRs have been linked to destabilization of mRNA transcripts and translation repression (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). AREs are recognized by a diverse group of binding proteins, leading to multiple models for why the pathway exists (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barreau et al., 2005</xref>). Of note, AREs and the associated binding proteins have been associated with exosome, stress granules, and P-bodies suggesting that AREs are important for response to physiological cell stress signals (

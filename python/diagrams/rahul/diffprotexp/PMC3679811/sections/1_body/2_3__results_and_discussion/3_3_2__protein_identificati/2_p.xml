<p>For the ten identified proteins, 4 upregulated and 6 downregulated proteins were found in DM peritoneal dialysate. The ten proteins were positively identified as apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4), Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein (AZGP1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A isoform 1 (EIF4G1), human class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA-A) (upregulation), albumin (ALB), alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin preproprotein (AMBP), apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), immunoglobulin G1 Fc fragment (IGHG1), mutant retinol-binding protein (RBP4), haptoglobin alpha2 (HP) (downregulation), which may serve as potential protein indicators of DM.</p>

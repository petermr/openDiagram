0: In Italy, pistachio crops are typically Sicilian, mainly grown in the territory of Bronte (CT), situated on the eastern part of Sicily and characterized by lava-rich soils and very particular climatic conditions [ 21, 22] which confer to the pistachio nuts superior organoleptic and nutritional characteristics.
1: For this reason, the European Union recognized the variety Bronte as a D.O.P.
2: (Protected Designation of Origin) product.
3: Pistachio nuts are considered a rich source of many important biofunctional compounds that are useful for the human diet and known for their various pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and anti-nociceptive activities [ 23].
4: Recently, we analysed and described the nutraceutical, antioxidant, and cytoprotective activity of crude phenols and anthocyanins-rich extracts derived from ripe pistachio hulls ( Pistacia vera L., variety Bronte), a by-product of the pistachio industry [ 23, 24].
5: These studies managed to identify this matrix as a promising source of healthy compounds.
6: The results obtained highlighted antioxidant and cytoprotective properties directly correlated to the high total phenol content, in particular flavonols, phenolic acid, and flavan-3-ols and, among anthocyanins, to the high content of cyanidyn-3- O-galactoside [ 23, 24].
7: The presence of these compounds makes pistachio hulls an attractive source of health-promoting compounds, which are potentially helpful against several oxidative stress-related diseases.

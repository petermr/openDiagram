 </xref>a) depicts the processing course of the Li–B–Mg composite as well as the Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition behavior during electrochemical cycling. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b schematically shows the electrodissolution/electrodeposition behavior of pure Li during electrochemical cycling. From Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a it can be noted that the synthesized composite ingot is mainly composed of randomly oriented LiB fiber skeleton that is in situ formed and free Li (Mg solubilizes in Li phase, marked as Li(Mg)). The composite ingot has been densified after rolling and the density of the composite plate is measured to be 0.844 g cm
 <sup>−3</sup>. During the rolling process, some LiB fibers may align roughly in parallel along with the rolling direction. When Li is electrochemically dissolved, the skeleton maintains the integrity of the composite anode while in the reverse process it regulates the electrochemical deposition of Li and inhibits dendrite formation. In addition, the introduction of Mg forms Li(Mg) solid solution filled in LiB skeleton. Besides the enhanced affinity to Li and regulation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> flux, it could transform into a Li‐deficient phase during Li stripping process and connect the fibers, contributing to the stability of the electrode. In comparison, Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows that pure Li foil would experience large volume change and inevitable growth of dendritic Li during electrochemical cycling could occur.

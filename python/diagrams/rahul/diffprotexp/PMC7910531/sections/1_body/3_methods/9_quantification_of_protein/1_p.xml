<p id="Par43">To carry out protein identification and quantification, we submitted the mass spectra to SequestHT search in Proteome Discoverer 2.1. The precursor mass tolerance was set at 30 ppm (Orbitrap Velos data, cohort 1) or 20 ppm (Fusion data, cohorts 2–4). For the CID spectra, we set the fragment ion mass tolerance to 0.5 Da; for the HCD spectra, to 0.02 Da. Spectra were searched for fully tryptic peptides with maximum two miss-cleavages and minimum length of six amino acids. We specified static modifications as TMT6plex at N-termimus, K and Carbamidomethyl at C; dynamic modifications included deamidation of N,Q and oxidation of M. For each peptide, we allowed for a maximum two different dynamic modifications with a maximum of two repetitions. We used the Percolator node to estimate peptide confidence. We set the peptide FDR at 1% and based validation on the 
 <italic>q</italic> value and decoy database search. We searched all spectra against a UniProt fasta file that contained 20,165 reviewed human entries. The Reporter Ion Quantifier node included a TMT-6plex (Velos data, cohort 1) or TMT-10plex (Fusion data, cohorts 2–4) custom Quantification Method with integration window tolerance at 20 or 15 ppm, respectively. As integration methods, we used the Most Confident Centroid at the MS2 or MS3 level. We only used peptides uniquely belonging to protein groups for quantification.

 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. is one of the most abundant protozoan in the environment and commonly isolated from soil and water. 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. trophozoite usually feeds on bacteria, fungi, algae or small organic particles by phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="b1-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, some bacteria have developed strategies to resist phagocytosis, survive intracellularly and exploit 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. for multiplication [
 <xref rid="b2-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These bacteria are able to survive in encysted 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. which protects the endosymbionts from adverse environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="b3-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. not only enables the endosymbionts to persist in the environment but also enhances its pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="b4-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, since mammalian macrophages and amoebae show similar interactions with endosymbionts, investigating the endosymbiotic relationship between intracellular pathogens and 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. would contribute to understanding how these organisms behave in the mammalian cells and its evasion of the human immune system.

0: Skin samples were obtained from the dorsal region of the inner upper arm of each participant, maintained in tubes with DMEM, stored at 4 C and processed within 4 h. Fibroblast harvesting was performed by explant, isolating the dermis from the epidermis with scalpels and scissors.
1: Passaged cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
2: All culture media and reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.
3: Skin fibroblast cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% CO 2 at 37 C. All experiments were performed on cells with 6-11 passages.
4: When cell density reached 80% confluence, the cells were washed and harvested in 1X PBS using a cell scraper.
5: Next, the cells were washed 2-3 times with PBS by centrifugation at 721 x g for 10 min at 4 C. The pelleted cells were stored at -80 C until required for use in the enzyme activity and protein identification assays.

<p>Recent genome-wide studies have focused on cell-specific metabolism in cyanobacteria by comparing gene transcript levels under different growth conditions or stage-specific gene expression signatures in response to nitrogen step-down. RNA sequencing was used to study transcript expression levels in filaments at different periods of nitrogen step-down using a mixture of heterocysts and vegetative cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Using samples collected during the differentiation in three developmental states, a DNA microarray containing 6,893 gene fragments were was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulating the differentiation of heterocysts, akinetes, and hormogonia in the cyanobacterium

 <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 were identified by oligonucleotide microarray technology, and the results for an 
 <italic>nrrA</italic> deletion mutant suggested that 
 <italic>nrrA</italic> facilitates heterocyst development [

Therefore, the function of vegetative cells and heterocysts may have been biased in sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Compared with vegetative cells, heterocysts cells of 
 <italic>Anabaena</italic> have thicker walls and better resist adverse external environments, providing a theoretical basis for the separation and purification of the two types of cells. In general, two strategies are used to isolate and purify heterocysts from the mycelium: sonication treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or lysozyme treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Vegetative cells easily crack during these treatments, resulting in the isolation of heterocysts without vegetative cells. Heterocysts can be isolated from mycelium containing both vegetative cells and heterocysts of 
 <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain 7120 with lysozyme for RNA-Seq analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We evaluated important candidate genes involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis in vegetative cells and heterocysts from 
 <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 at the transcriptome level and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis in both cell types.

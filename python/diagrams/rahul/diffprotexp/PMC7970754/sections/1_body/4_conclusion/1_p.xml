<p>In conclusion, this study determined a potential anticancer mechanism of RSV against TNBC by conducting bioinformatics and experimental studies. Accordingly, RSV was found to promote the apoptosis of TNBC cells by reducing POLD1 expression, thereby activating the respective apoptosis pathways. However, since this study is a basic mechanism study, this method has not yet been applied to human patients.</p>

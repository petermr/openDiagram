<p>Adipocyte differentiation is a dynamic process tightly regulated through a multistep process conserved across species [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The process involves temporal expression of various signalling cascades that regulate the expression of transcription factors and thereby pro-adipogenic genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-у (PPARG) [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Adipocyte differentiation is characterized by significant changes to cell morphology – from a fibroblast to a rounded spherical form – and acquisition of functional characteristics of AT cells [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These properties are directed by the expression of PPARG, which is central to adipogenesis. This receptor is encoded by 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> and cooperate with members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (CEBPs) family of transcription factors, specifically CEBP-β (CEBPB), encoded by 
 <italic>Cebpb</italic>, and CEBP-α (CEBPA), encoded by 
 <italic>Cebpa</italic>. Several studies have demonstrated the interplay among these factors during adipocyte differentiation and in enhancing adipogenic cell fate [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref>]. Mechanistically, induction of CEBPB, at an early phase of adipogenesis, promotes induction of PPARG and CEBPA by binding to their proximal promoter regions. Therefore, this results in activating several pro-adipogenic genes [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref>] that support the progression of preadipocytes cells into mature adipocytes [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,

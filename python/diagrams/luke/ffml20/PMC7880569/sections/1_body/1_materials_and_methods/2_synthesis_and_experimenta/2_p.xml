<p>The birnessite samples used in this work are important analogues to the most common vernadite and biogenic Mn oxides in nature and thus especially informative to understand natural and technological processes.

 </sup> To this end, we prepared birnessite formed in acidic (AcidBir) and alkaline (δ-MnO

 <sub>2</sub> with a hexagonal structure.

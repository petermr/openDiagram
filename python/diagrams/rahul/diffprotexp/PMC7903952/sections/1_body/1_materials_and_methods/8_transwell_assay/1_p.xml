<p>T98G and A172 cells in logarithmic growth stage were starved for 24 h, and the cells were digested, centrifuged and resuspended on next day. The upper Chambers of the Transwell filter chamber are coated with Matrigel or not (50 ÂµL, 356234, BD, franklin lakes, NJ) per well. The cells were inoculated into the apical cavity of the Transwell filter and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 hours (medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the basolateral cavity). The invasive/transitional cells below the filter were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted microscopically. The invasion/migration ability of each group was determined by the number of cells in the gum.</p>

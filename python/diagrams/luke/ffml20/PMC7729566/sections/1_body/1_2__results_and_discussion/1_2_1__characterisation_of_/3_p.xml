<p>The aqueous phase diagram of [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl with CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05570-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. Prior to any discussion, it is important to stress that [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl is soluble in CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH in the absence of water along the entire composition range, yielding a homogenous solution liquid at room temperature. This is markedly different to the reported acid aqueous biphasic systems of [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl with inorganic acids such as HCl, with the inorganic acid acting as a salting-out for [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl resulting in a biphasic system at high acid concentrations [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The divergence in the underlying mechanism of phase separation in the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH + H
 <sub>2</sub>O system is evidenced by its unusual closed “Type 0” phase diagram. “Type 0” diagrams are characterized by an immiscibility gap in the ternary region while all the binary mixtures are fully miscible [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The formation of aqueous biphasic systems using ionizable species, such as [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl and acetic acids, leads to a complex system with potentially five species (four ionic + water). Specifically, the extent of carboxylate anion concentration depends on the acid pKa and solution pH. The pH of the studied systems never exceeded 3.5, implying that acetic acid (pKa = 4.75) can be primarily considered as the protonated non-ionic specie.

0: Different inflammatory parameters were determined prior and post treatment to assess the efficacy of the selected nanoemulsion (F3).
1: These parameters include TNF- that is a powerful pro-inflammatory cytokine having fundamental responsibilities in stimulating leukocyte staffing to injured spots via provocation of expression of inflammatory chemokines and adhesion molecules.
2: Another inflammatory parameter is TGF- that is known as a very effective immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory cytokine, conflicting TNF- activities, stimulating the production of T regulatory cells, and facilitating the anti-inflammatory activities of these cells  (Ohno et al.,  1992; Hamaguchi et al.,  1994; MULLOU et al.,  1995).
3: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) also is a cytokine that is essential for triggering the inherent immune response, facilitating the staffing, stimulation, and adherence of phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), and ending the inherent immune response is the same as TNF- (Ott et al.,  2007).

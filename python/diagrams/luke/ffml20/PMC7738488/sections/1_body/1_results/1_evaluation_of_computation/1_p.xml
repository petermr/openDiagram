<p id="Par6">Essentially like all molecules, the PAMAM (Polyamidoamine) dendrimer structure shows correspondence with properties and its utilization. The synthesis of highly branched structures with potential practice is directly or indirectly dependent on intrinsic features such as molecular weight, van der wall forces. The UFF elucidates the forces workable for simulation of atoms within dendrimer structure, exhibiting the sum of molecular properties as well as electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, Fig.Â

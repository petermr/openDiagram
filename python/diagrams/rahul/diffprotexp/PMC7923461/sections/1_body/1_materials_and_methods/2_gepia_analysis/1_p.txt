1: To determine the expression of TUBA1C in LUAD tissues, we performed GEPIA and constructed boxplot, pathological stage plot, and survival curves, such as overall survival (OS) curve and disease-free survival (DFS) curve.
2: Meanwhile, the relationship between TUBA1C and immune infiltrating cells was analyzed by GEPIA.
3: The Spearman method was used to determine the correlation coefficient of the relationship.

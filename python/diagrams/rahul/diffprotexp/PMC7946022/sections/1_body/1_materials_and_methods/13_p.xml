 <bold>Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) analysis of vancomycin diffusion through single and mixed-species biofilms with and without DNAse treatment</bold>. To visualize the effect of eDNA enzymatic digestion on vancomycin diffusion through single and mixed biofilms, confocal scanning laser microscopy was performed as we previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with modifications. Single-species 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> or mixed-species 
 <italic>C. albicans-S. aureus</italic> biofilms were grown on glass coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek Co., Ashland, MA), as described above, for 24 hrs. Following incubation, biofilms were treated with DNAse I (0.625 mg/ml) or fresh RPMI (control) and fluorescent vancomycin conjugated to BODYPI FL (1 µg/ml; 488/650) was added to both control and treated biofilms, and the system was incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells were stained with concanavalin A (ConA) conjugated to Alexa 657 (50 µg/ml; 650/668 nm) and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with calcofluor-white (0.05%; 433/355). Biofilms were gently washed and immediately observed in an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon T2i). At least three random fields were visualized for each sample, and representative images of the reconstructed Z-stacks are presented.

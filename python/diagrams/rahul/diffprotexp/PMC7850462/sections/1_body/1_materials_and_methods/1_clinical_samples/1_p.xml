<p>The study involved 30 septic AKI patients from Fujian Provincial Hospital, including 19 males and 11 females, aged from 24 to 57 years, with an average age of 39.3 ± 7.8 years. The normal group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers, including 17 males and 13 females, aged from 24 to 55 years, with an average age of 37.8 ± 8.1 years. Diagnosis of septic AKI conformed to the diagnostic standards outlined in Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the diagnostic criteria for sepsis [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The diagnosis of AKI was confirmed by absolute increase (26.5 μmol/L) of serum creatinine (SCr) within 48 h, increase of SCr by ≥50% within 7 days of disease onset, or urine output ≤0.5 mL/(kg·h) for consecutive 6 h. Sepsis was determined by the following two or more symptoms: hypothermia or pyrexia (&lt;36 °C or &gt;38.5 °C), tachycardia (&gt;90 beats/min), tachypnea (&gt;20 breaths/min or PaCO2 &lt; 32 mmHg), leukocytosis (&gt;12,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), leukopenia (&lt;4000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), and increase of immature cells (&gt;10%). Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded: end-stage renal disease, a history of kidney transplantation, cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and treatment of high doses of steroid. All patients received venous blood tests at the time of diagnosis. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min, and the serum was collected and preserved at −80 °C for later use. The sample collection was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fujian Provincial Hospital and all participants had signed the informed consents.

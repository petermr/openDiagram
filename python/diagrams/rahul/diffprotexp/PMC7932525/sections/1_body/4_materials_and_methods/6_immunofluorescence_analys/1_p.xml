<p>Immunofluorescence analysis of nitrogenase iron protein was performed as previously described with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. After 72 h culture under nitrogen-replete and deprivation conditions, strain PCC 7120 was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 25°C. The samples were rinsed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), and then incubated for 5 min in PBST at 25°C. The samples were incubated for 1 h with 6 μg/mL affinity-purified anti-NifH antibody (Agrisera, Vaesterbotten, Sweden) diluted in PBST containing 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin and three washes with PBST. The samples were incubated in the dark with rabbit anti-chicken IgY conjugated to FITC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 45 min and then washed twice with PBST. The samples were mounted in Vectashield medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA H-1500) and viewed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2).

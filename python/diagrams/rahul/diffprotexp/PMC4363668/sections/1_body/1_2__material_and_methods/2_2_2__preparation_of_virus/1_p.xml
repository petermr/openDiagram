<p>EV71 were amplified by using RD cells. Virus was propagated in RD cells which were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and antibiotics. Briefly, 80~90% confluent monolayers of RD cells were inoculated with the virus; once 90% of the cells showed cytopathic effect (CPE), the culture medium and cell debris were harvested and were repeated freezing and thawing three times, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>L membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at −80°C before use. Furthermore, the virus titers were determined by a plaque assay using vero cells as described in [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Plaques developed by series dilute suspension of EV71 virus in Vero cell cultures 96 h postinfection after crystal violet staining. Scoring was done by counting the plaques in each well.

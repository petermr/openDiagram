<p>The fruit-bodies of 
 <italic>S. luteus</italic> were searched in the masson pine forest by trampling. The collected fruit-bodies were cleaned to get rid of any surface contamination. The cleaned fruit-bodies were individually numbered and placed in a Ziplock bag, placed in an icebox, and brought back to the laboratory. Young and tender fruit-bodies were selected for further experiment. Separation work was carried out on an ultra-clean workbench. The surface of the fruit-bodies was disinfected with 75% alcohol and rinse twice with sterile water. The fruit-bodies were then transferred to Pachlewski medium and placed in an incubator for dark culture at 25 °C with a 50% humidity level. Hyphae were collected after appearance and cultured in a new medium until the strain was purified [

Active mycelium was collected and transferred from the solid cultured colony to the Pachlewski medium and observed for ten days of cultivation. The samples with no contamination were stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for later use [

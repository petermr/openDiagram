<p>The LTR in 7150 has been shown to relate to a previously unknown thin plate phase that is enriched in Zn and Cu, and it was labelled as the Y-phase [
 <xref rid="B143-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Y-phase platelets have been confirmed to form during cooling by others too [
 <xref rid="B198-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. An example of a Y-phase platelet can be seen in the high angle annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM images in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f053">Figure 53</xref>. Based on the interrupted quenching method, we conclude that the LTR in a temperature range of about 250–150 °C is dominated by the precipitation of the Zn–Cu-rich thin plate Y-phase (compare

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f049">Figure 49</xref>). The Y-phase features strong structural similarities to the T1 phase in Al-Li alloys, with a hexagonal symmetry (a = 0.429 nm, c = 1.385 nm). The authors of Ref. [
 <xref rid="B88-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] assume the low-temperature precipitation to refer to the η’-phase.

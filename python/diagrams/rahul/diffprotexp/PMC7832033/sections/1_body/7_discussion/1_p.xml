<p>Our study demonstrated that the whole blood transcriptome of melioidosis patients who survived was distinguishable from non-survivors, with 283 DEGs significantly associated with mortality. The majority of these DEGs were related to the immune response, cellular functions and metabolism. Twenty-eight DEGs were selected by functional enrichment and pathway analyses and RT-qPCR of these genes in a validation cohort confirmed 16 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated gene associated with mortality. ROC analyses of the validation set identified the 15 most predictive genes. Subsequent RT-qPCR of four selected genes (

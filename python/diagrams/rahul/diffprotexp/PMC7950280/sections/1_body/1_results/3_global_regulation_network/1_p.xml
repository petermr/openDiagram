<p>The scatterplot of GS versus MM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) showed a strong correlation between intramodular connectivity and genetic phenotypes in the blue and turquoise modules (blue: correlation coefficient = 0.79, P = 5.9e-96; turquoise: correlation coefficient = 0.6, P = 6e-98). In the global regulation network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>), low expression of BDNF interacting with DEGs was presented. Functional enrichment analysis identified the intersection pathways of BDNF, and all the genes enriching in cAMP, MAPK and Ras signaling pathways were exhibited in

<p>The gas chromatography (GC) mass selective (MS) analysis of the essential oils was performed using a Hewlett–Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph, fitted with a fused silica HP – 5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, in thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature varied from 40–250 °C with the scanning rate of 3 °C/min. Helium (purity 5.6) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The GC was equipped with Hewlett–Packard 5972 Series MS detector. The MS operating parameters were ionization voltage 70 eV and ion source temperature 250 °C. The diluted samples of essential oils (1/100, v/v in HPLC methanol) of 1 μL had been injected manually. To avoid overloading the GC column, the essential oils were diluted 1:100 (v/v) in methanol. The identification of peaks was tentatively carried out based on library search using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-2013. Relative Retention Index (RRI) was calculated for HP-5MS column. For RRI calculation a mixture of homologues 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C9-C18) was used under the same chromatographic conditions as for analysis of the essential oils.

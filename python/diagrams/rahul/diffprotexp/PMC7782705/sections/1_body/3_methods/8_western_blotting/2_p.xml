<p id="Par42">Protein quantification was performed using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). In total, 10–20 μg of total protein from extracts were separated in SDS–polyacrylamide gels 4–12% (NuPAGE Bis-Tris, Thermo Scientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Next, membranes were incubated in milk (5% in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, TTBS) to block non-specific binding sites during 1 h at RT, followed by several washes with TTBS. Immunoblotting was carried out with primary antibodies anti-BIN1 (Abcam, ab182562), anti-β-ACTIN (Sigma-Aldrich, A1978), and anti-GAPDH (Millipore, AB2302) overnight at 4 °C on 20 RPM. The membranes were washed three times in TTBS, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson, anti-mouse 115-035-003 and anti-rabbit 111-035-003; Thermo Scientific, anti-chicken A16054) overnight at 4 °C on 20 RPM agitation. The membranes were washed three times in TTBS, and the immunoreactivity was revealed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal, Thermo Scientific) and imaged using the Amersham Imager 600 (GE Life Sciences). Optical densities of bands were quantified using “Gel Analyzer” plugin in Fiji

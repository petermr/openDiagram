 <xref rid="pone.0126472.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables) according to previously published protocols [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, 4 μm FFPE tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in graded series of ethanol and incubated in citrate buffer (Dako, Sweden) for 20 min at 95–99°C for antigen retrieval. Slides were incubated in 0.5% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to deactivate endogenous peroxidase. Unspecific binding sites were blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were incubated overnight with a primary antibody: polyclonal rabbit anti-S100A13 (HPA019592, Atlas Antibodies AB, Sweden) at dilution 1:1,500; anti-annexin A3 (HPA013398, Atlas Antibodies AB) at 1:1,500; polyclonal rabbit anti-CMBL (HPA036571, Atlas Antibodies AB) at 1:1,000; monoclonal mouse anti-CK-19 (clone RCK 108, Dako) at 1:300; or anti-human mesothelial cell (clone HBME-1, Dako) at 1:400. A secondary biotinylated antibody was applied followed by an avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Vectastain, Vector Burlingame). The result was visualized with diaminobenzidine and counterstaining in hematoxylin.

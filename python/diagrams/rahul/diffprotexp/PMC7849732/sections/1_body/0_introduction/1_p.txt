0: Poorly managed pain is a global health concern.
1: Women, in particular, show a high prevalence and sensitivity to both visceral and somatic pain and an increased tendency to develop certain chronic pain diseases [ 1, 2].
2: To develop better treatment approaches for these conditions, the molecular underpinnings of pain processing need to be fully characterized.
3: Unfortunately, the vast majority of investigations into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of spinal nociceptive processing have been conducted in male rodent models of pain only.
4: Direct comparison of the molecular determinants of spinal excitability between males and females is therefore essential to understand which potential pain targets are conserved or diverge across sex.

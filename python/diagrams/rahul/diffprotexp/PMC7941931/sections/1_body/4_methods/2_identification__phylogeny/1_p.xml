Expression analysis of these identified miRNA biosynthesis genes in Tartary buckwheat was performed using RNA-seq data from 4 organs (root, stem, leaf, and flower) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and three developmental-stage seeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The expression heatmaps of these genes were generated by using TBtools software [

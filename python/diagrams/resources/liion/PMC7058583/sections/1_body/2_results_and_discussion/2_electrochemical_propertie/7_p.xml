 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> plots the cycling performances of the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich composites at a constant current density of 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. It was obvious that the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> electrodes could not afford prolonged cycling and rapidly decayed to zero after 170 cycles, while the 3D flower-like composites exhibited extraordinary cycling behavior and still maintained a reversible capacity of 1,036 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 500 cycles. SEM test results reveals that after 500 cycles, the structure of the 3D flower-like composites was still intact without obvious pulverization (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>). The high reversible capacity and remarkable cycling behavior of the 3D flower-like composites were also reflected in the rate performance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> shows the rate cycling behavior of the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich composites at various current densities of 100–2,000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Compared with the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens, the 3D flower-like composites presented an excellent rate performance. Their specific capacity remained at 579 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> when current density continuously increased to 2,000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. In contrast, commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens failed completely before the cycling current increased to 500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. In addition, when the current density changed to 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the specific capacity of the 3D flower-like composites almost returned to their initial value, and remained stable throughout the subsequent cycling.

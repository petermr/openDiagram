<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The antimicrobial activity of EOs was determined against <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC No. 14579), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC No. 10798), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC No. 27853), <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC No. 29213), and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (ATCC No. 12228), using the microbroth serial dilution method as previously reported [<xref rid="B45-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, 50 &#956;L of 1% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic> solution of the samples in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was placed in the top well of 96-well microtiter plates and 50 &#956;L of cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB) was added. The sample solutions were then serially diluted (1:1) by transferring 50 &#956;L of sample-CAMHB mixture to the next lane and adding 50 &#956;L fresh CAMHB to obtain a concentration range from 2500 to 12.5 &#956;g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The bacteria were harvested from a fresh culture and added to each well at a concentration of approximately 1.5 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The plates were incubated at 37 &#176;C for 24 h and the final minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined as the lowest concentrations free of turbidity. The antibiotic gentamicin was used as positive control and DMSO solvent was used as negative control.</p>

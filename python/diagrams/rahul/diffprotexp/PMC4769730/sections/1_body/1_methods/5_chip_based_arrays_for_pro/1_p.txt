0: The proteome array was performed on customized chip-based arrays provided on glass-slides, according to the manufacturers procedures with minor modifications (RayBio technology; Norcross, CA).
1: Each glass-slide (array) comprised 14 identical subarrays containing 60 biomarkers assembled on demand.
2: The scheme of each chip is reported in Fig.
3: 2a.
4: Inter-assay normalization was conducted by including multiple positive markers and negative controls for each sub-array.
5: The minimum sensitivity range for detection of each protein varied, ranging from 3.8 to 56 pg/mL.

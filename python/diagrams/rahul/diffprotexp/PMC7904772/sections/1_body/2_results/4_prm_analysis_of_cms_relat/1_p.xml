<p id="Par24">In the present study, 20 differential proteins of interest from the significantly enriched KEGG pathways and networks were further independently validated by the PRM analysis. Overall, these PRM results mirrored the data from the iTRAQ-based experiment (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Similar to other proteomics studies

 </sup>, there were some discrepancies between the two quantitative data sets. Besides the detection difference of the two methods, the additional pooling step in the iTRAQ-based analysis workflow might be another cause

 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>, the expressions of Gfap and Uqcrh were significantly upregulated, whereas Rhog, Gnai2, and Ppp1r1b were downregulated in the depression-susceptible group when contrasted to the control group. It could be observed that the expressions of Urod, Cul1, Spred1, and Gpcpd1 were significantly upregulated, while Tubb6 was downregulated in the anxiety-susceptible group compared with the control group. Moreover, we found that the expressions of Grm2 and Mtor were significantly upregulated while Acadl, Ppp1r1a, Lsm8, Cplx2, and Tsta3 were downregulated among the insusceptible group when contrasted with the control group. In addition, the expression level of Thy1 was shown to be significantly downregulated among the depression-susceptible group, whereas it was upregulated in the insusceptible group compared with the control group. The reduced level of Unc13a in both the depression-susceptible and insusceptible groups, and the elevated level of Adcy1 in both the anxiety-susceptible and insusceptible groups were recognized when compared with the control group.

<p>Although 132 out of 1,321 DEGs were upregulated and 54 out of 1,379 DEGs were downregulated more than 10 fold in 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> 24 hr pi, approximately 60% of these DEGs (78 DEGs and 30 DEGs) were identified as hypothetical proteins. Strong inhibition of DEGs were observed in both 12 hr pi 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> (90 DEGs) and 24 hr pi 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> (53 DEGs). Among the DEGs demonstrating 10 fold or greater changes, 47 genes were upregulated while 90 genes were downregulated within the initial 12 hr pi (
 <xref rid="t1-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="t2-kjp-59-1-67" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Conversely, by 24 hr pi, 132 upregulated and 54 downregulated DEGs were observed. From these results, we supposed that 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection facilitated reduced 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> gene expression during the early stage of infection to inhibit phagocytic digestion, while enhancing the expression of specialized 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> genes during the late infection stage for LCV lysis and access to host cell machinery for intracellular replication.

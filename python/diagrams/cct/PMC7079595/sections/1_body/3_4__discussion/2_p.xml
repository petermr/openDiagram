<p>The presented results showed that the investigated steel does not exhibit any bainite or ferrite transformation. This was not expected as aluminum content at a level of 1.6% should strongly encourage the transformation, aluminum is an alpha forming element, and therefore, it is expected to accelerate bainite and ferrite reactions during heat treatment. The increase of bainitic kinetics was obtained by Tian et al. [

 <xref rid="B19-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], who stated that Al increases the driving force for gamma/alpha transformation. However, for the present steel, it was not the case. The reason for this is the high manganese content (5%), which is an austenite stabilizer. According to theoretical calculations, aluminum and manganese influence the driving force of transformation (

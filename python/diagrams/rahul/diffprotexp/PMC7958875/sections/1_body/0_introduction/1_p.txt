0: Malaria is a devastating mosquito-borne disease caused by single-celled apicomplexan parasites belonging to the  Plasmodium genus.
1: Transmission begins with ingestion of an infectious blood meal by the mosquito.
2: This initiates the most extreme population bottleneck in the parasites life cycle, where sexual stage parasites must rapidly undergo fertilization, develop into invasive ookinetes, and transit through the midgut epithelium of the mosquito before beginning sporogonic development.
3: Only a small proportion of ookinetes will successfully cross the midgut ( Smith et al., 2014).
4: Although the ookinete stage is a critical bottleneck in the life cycle, relatively little is known about the molecular and population-level processes that drive successful midgut invasion of ookinetes.
5: We also lack information on how this life stage copes with the variable environment it encounters including for example potentially highly diverged mosquito species and also highly variable microbiota between individual mosquitoes.

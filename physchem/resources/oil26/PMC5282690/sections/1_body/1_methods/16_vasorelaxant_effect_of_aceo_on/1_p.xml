<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To confirm the involvement of voltage operated, and /or receptor operated calcium channels, and the enhancement of calcium release form internal stores in the vasodilator effect of AcEO, two sets of experiments were carried out as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. First, cumulative doses of the AcEO (0.1&#8211;100&#160;&#956;g/ml) were added to aorta precontracted with both K<sup>+</sup> (80&#160;mM) and Phen (1&#160;&#956;M). In another set of experiments, a comparative profile of the vasorelaxant effect of ACEO cumulative doses (10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>&#8211;10<sup>&#8722;1</sup> mg/ml) and verapamil (10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>-10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> M) was challenged on the aorta precontracted by K<sup>+</sup> (80&#160;mM).</p>

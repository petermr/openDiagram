<p>It has been reported that numerous genes mutated in familial PD alter RNA metabolism, particularly mRNA translation, which may contribute to PD pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="b54-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Garcia-Esparcia 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b55-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) showed that the machinery of protein synthesis was altered, and several ribosomal protein (RP) subunits were abnormally regulated in the brain of patients with PD. The present study showed that the expression levels of several proteins involved in RNA metabolism, including RPL18, RPSA, RPS2, HNRNPC, HNRNPA1, HNRNPA3 and YBX1, were altered in the fibroblasts of patients with PD carrying 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants. All these proteins are categorized in the group of mRNA metabolic process (GO:0016071). Among these, the level of RPL18 exhibited the greatest degree of upregulation in the GBA fibroblasts of patients with PD, and it was involved in three GO processes. It is likely that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants may contribute to alterations of RNA metabolism; however, further studies are needed to investigate how GBA affects RNA metabolism.

<p>Although perfect separation cannot be achieved, current practices and recent technologies indicated that it is feasible to efficiently sort a stream of mixed spent batteries, as stated in a report published in 2000 by the European Portable Battery Association [
 <xref rid="B80-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Sortbat (Tienen, Belgium) implements manual pre-sorting and residue scrubbing operations followed by mechanical and automatic sorting of batteries by size and chemistry [
 <xref rid="B81-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The automatic sorting is based on the magnetic resonance response of the batteries, and seven types of batteries can be separated, including LIBs. The purity achieved could reach up to 99.7% [
 <xref rid="B82-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Other types of sorting machines include X-ray and optical sorters or automatic label readers [
 <xref rid="B81-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The nominal capacity on automatic sorters is approximately 5â€“24 cells/s (approximately 500 kg/h to 3 t/h) [

<p>No significant difference on the vasorelaxation effect of AcEO (0.1–100 μg/ml) on phenylephrine precontracted aorta have been observed in the presence of NO synthase inhibitor; L-NAME (97.27% ± 2.82; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), in the presence of NO scavenger; hydroxocobalamin (93.99% ± 2.32;

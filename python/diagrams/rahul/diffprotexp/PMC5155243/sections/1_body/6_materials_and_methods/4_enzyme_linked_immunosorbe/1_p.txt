0: Another 20 mice (only MT+/+) were administrated with DU at a dose of 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg.
1: The fourth day post DU injection, kidney tissues were lysed, and the total protein content was determined.
2: The level of ETHE1 in the kidney tissue was measured by ELISA kit (CUSABIO, Wuhan, Hubei, China).
3: The absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a microplate reader.
4: The concentration of ETHE1 was measured by calculation from a standard curve.
5: The limit of detection for ETHE1 was 7.8 pg/ml.

<p>However, DSC also has certain disadvantages and limitations. In particular, DSC detects the heat effects of all occurring reactions in sum. Since different reactions occur simultaneously in several cases, it can be hard to distinguish the different parts of the signal that belong to specific reactions. This makes the interpretation of DSC heating experiments particularly complicated, as opposite heat effects from endothermic dissolution and exothermic precipitation can occur during heating [

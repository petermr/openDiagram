<p id="Par58">Within a 13-day period, we observed changes in cell morphology, including a gradual reduction in the cell soma and multiple extensions of thin neurites upon iPSCs conversion into MNPs. Furthermore, we monitored protein accumulation of tissue-specific markers via immunohistochemistry staining (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Consistent with the morphological features exemplified by high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and compact multilayer colonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the undifferentiated iPSCs expressed a key pluripotency marker, Oct4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b; D0). We noted the formation of NSCs at D7 by the disappearance of Oct4 and the accumulation of Nestin and Pax6. Nestin, implicated in cell division and radial axon growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], was downregulated by D13 which coincided with increased expression of the pan-neuronal filament protein class III β-Tubulin (βIII-Tub). Cells entered the MNP developmental stage on D13 and transformed to eMNs on D18 when both Nestin and Pax6 expression was significantly downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, d). Finally, we detected mature MNs featuring high levels of the structural proteins, βIII-Tub and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2); and increased accumulation of MN specific markers: MN homeobox protein (HB9), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and the synaptic vesicles protein (Synaptophysin) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d). HB9 is an essential transcription factor and early marker of cholinergic neurons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and ChAT is an enzyme required for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The changes in morphology were pronounced as dendrites extended and expressed MAP2, a neuron-specific cytoskeletal protein critical for successful projection of dendrites [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d) at D28 of the iPSC differentiation indicated at formation of cell populations enriched in mature MNs.

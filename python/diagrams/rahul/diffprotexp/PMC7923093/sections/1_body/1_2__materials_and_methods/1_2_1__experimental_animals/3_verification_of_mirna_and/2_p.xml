<p>For qPCR experiments of mRNAs, reverse-transcription was performed using a FastQuant RT Kit (with gDNase) (Cat. # KR106, Tiangen, Beijing, China). qPCR was performed using SYBR SuperReal Premix plus (Cat. # FP205, Tiangen, Beijing, China) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following real-time PCR protocol was used: polymerase activation (95 °C, 15 min), 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 10 s), annealing and extension (60 °C, 32 s) and melting curve analysis. The primers used for the target mRNA are designed by Intivrogen (Shanghai, China) and listed in

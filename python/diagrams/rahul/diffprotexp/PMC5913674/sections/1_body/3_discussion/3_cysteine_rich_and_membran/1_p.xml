<p>Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative damage to cell membranes and their constituents can disrupt downstream, lipid-based signaling [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A range of proteins associated with lipid metabolism or the membrane (TableÂ 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>) were differentially expressed in each MtzR line, along with kinase and non-kinase proteins linked to lipid-based signaling. Oxidative damage to the membrane, particularly via lipid peroxidation or mutually competitive modifications, is well documented in other systems [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], but not in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic>, nor specifically in the context of oxidative stress or Mtz resistance. As such, metabolic analyses of the lipid and oxylipid composition of MtzR and MtzS lines would offer insights into the relationships between oxidative stress, Mtz, and resistance.

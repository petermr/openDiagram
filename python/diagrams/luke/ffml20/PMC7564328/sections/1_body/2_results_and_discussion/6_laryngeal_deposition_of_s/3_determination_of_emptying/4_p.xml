<p id="p0220">The laryngeal deposition rate of DEX@CD-MOF was 36.64 ± 4.29% (not statistically significant compared to CD-MOF), while DEX and SCU were co-loaded into CD-MOF, the laryngeal and pre-separator deposition of SCU@DEX@CD-MOF were significantly increased with the reduction of stages 1–3 (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The statistical analysis of laryngeal deposition showed that there was significant difference between CD-MOF and SCU@DEX@CD-MOF (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). This was similar to the results of SCU loaded into CD-MOF, which further proved that SCU had an improved effect on the aerodynamic behavior of CD-MOF particles and delivered DEX to the throat. On the other hand, it did not require a large amount of SCU to deposit more particles in the throat. The laryngeal deposition of SCU@DEX@CD-MOF (feed molar ratio of 2:2:1) was 47.35 ± 2.68%, lower than that of 1:2:1 feed molar ratio (54.00 ± 4.34%), which meant it was possible to reduce the content of SCU during the modification of CD-MOF particles and more conducive to the evaluation of biological safety in the later stage. Between 47.35% and 54.00%, there was no single concept/parameter that proved to be correlated. To the reason why laryngeal deposition rate of SCU@DEX@CD-MOF in different molar ratio was significantly different, one was because NGI results were related to multiple factors of ambient temperature, humidity, and particle distribution, the other one was because the molar ratio may changed the guest molecules’ configuration in the molecular voids in CD-MOF, which may changed the interaction between the particles and the artificial throat.

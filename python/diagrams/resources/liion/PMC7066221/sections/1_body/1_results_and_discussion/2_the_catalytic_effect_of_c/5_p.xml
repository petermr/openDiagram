<p id="p0110">The high valent state of the Mn compound of the SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> sample after scanning to 1.85 V (★) indicates the readiness to be reduced and to provide capacity in a subsequent discharge process. In 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E, the SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> electrode was CV scanned (1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>). No reduction peak was found at the first negative scan from open circuit voltage (∼1.28 V) to 1.0 V, indicating that no significant discharging capacity was provided from SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. The following positive (oxidation) scan from 1.0 to 1.85 V shows the oxidation of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and further oxidation as mentioned earlier, after which the subsequent negative scan shows two well-defined peaks at ∼1.4 and ∼1.2 V (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E), matching well with the reduction peaks observed from the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode in a typical Zn-ion battery (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).

<p>TEM micrographs showed that the microstructures of 0.10C-1.50Cr steel after spherodizing annealing consisted of ferrite matrix and spherical or irregular cementite in size of a few hundred nanometers. The surrounding of the cementite particles was clean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). After recrystallization annealing, the small particles were in the majority, and the size distributions of cementite became homogeneous. Interestingly, numerous particles emerged with circles, indicating that a dissolution process of cementite occurred during recrystallization annealing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). The dissolution of smaller cementite is beneficial to decrease the total interfacial energy per unit volume [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f007">Figure 7</xref>d presents the marked patterns. Obviously, the Pitsch-Petch orientation relationship was fulfilled between the cementite and the ferrite because the diffraction pattern of Fe

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f008">Figure 8</xref> exhibits the morphology of 0.10C-1.50Cr steel after cold rolling and cold drawing, respectively. There was a significantly high dislocation density in the cold drawn steel than in the cold rolled steel. The key reason was that there was a large level of deformation during cold drawing. The isotropic hardening stress component is proportional to the square root of the statistical stored dislocation density (

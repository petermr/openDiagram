<p>In addition to free volume, the local mobility of polymer chains also has a vital impact on the gas transport performances of polymers. The backbone mean square displacements (MSD) of Kapton, 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI systems were calculated and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f010">Figure 10</xref>. It is evident that the MSD of the three PIs decreased in the order: Kapton ˃ 2,7-CPPI ˃ 2,7-CPI. The introduction of ether bonds into the main chains of Kapton facilitated its chains mobility, while the rigid planar carbazoles in 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI hindered the chains mobility. The 2,7-CPI showed lower chains mobility than 2,7-CPPI. The dihedral angle profiles of the polymer chain segments were employed to analyze the mobility of linking groups in 2,7-CPPI and 2,7-CPI, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f011">Figure 11</xref>. Compared to 2,7-CPPI, the dihedral angle peaks of the 2,7-CPI were relatively higher and narrower, demonstrating that the rotational freedoms of imide rings and carbazoles along the axis of C‒N bond were restricted [

In addition, the more number of hydrogen bonds formed in 2,7-CPI also contributed to its lower chains mobility. The lower chains mobility was another reason for the high barrier properties observed in 2,7-CPI. The mobility of polymer chains has a crucial effect on the channel formation for the gas molecules to permeate [
 <xref rid="B48-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The poor chain mobility of 2,7-CPI reduced the degree of channel formation for gas diffusion, thus led to the high gas barrier. The high chain mobility of Kapton contributed to its high gas permeability.

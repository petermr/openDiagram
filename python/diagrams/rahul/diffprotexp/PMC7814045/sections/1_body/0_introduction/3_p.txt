0: The ribosome structure organization in yeast requires a fine-tuning in the gene expression of many of its components, involving 200 assembly factors.
1: The 60S ribosomal subunit contains three rRNAs (25S, 5.8S, and 5S) and 46 ribosomal proteins, while the 40S subunit is composed of a single rRNA (18S) and 33 proteins 23.
2: The yeast genome is reported to encode 137 ribosomal protein genes (RPGs), 150 rDNA repeats, and 76 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), that are mainly involved in the post-transcriptional modifications of the rRNAs 24,  25.
3: Changes in the expression of each single components participating in the overall process may affect the ribosome biogenesis 25  27.
4: RPGs in yeast are characterized by couples of paralogs 28.
5: In particular, among the 137 RPGs annotated in the  S. cerevisiae genome, 116 were identified to be ohnologs, i.e., duplicated genes, or paralogs, originated by a whole genome duplication 29.
6: In 2019, Ghulam et al.
7: 30. demonstrated that the stoichiometry of ohnolog RPGs changes in response to variations of environmental conditions.
8: In particular, under physiological conditions, the ribosome population is dominated by the presence of one of the two paralogs that was defined as the major paralog.
9: When cells are exposed to stress conditions, decreased expression of the major paralog and/or overexpression of the minor one, in ohnolog pairs of ribosomal proteins, reduce the relative proportion of the major versus the minor paralog content in the cell 30.

Such partitioning is noticeably different from that observed in salt-IL ABS where the IL and inorganic salt accumulate in opposite phases. The protonated carboxylic acid does not present a traditional salting-out inducing nature, yet the mixture of [P

 <sub>3</sub>COOH presents a synergistic enhancement in hydrophobicity despite both individual components being fully miscible in water. Rather, the observed trend in

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Such systems, above a certain solute concentration, phase-separated into a phase concentrated in both IL and solute and a diluted phase. Importantly for the reusability of the [P

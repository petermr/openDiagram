 <xref rid="B25-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The charge–discharge performances of the prepared PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane was tested with P2-Na
 <sub>0.66</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.5</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> material as cathode and sodium metals as anode. Furthermore, electrochemical characterization performed for the P2-Na
 <sub>0.66</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.5</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> electrode material encompassing the slurry of 85 wt.% active material powder, 10 wt.% conductive carbon black, 5 wt.% PVdF binder, and the NMP used as solvent. The slurry was coated on aluminum foil as current collector and it was dried at 80 °C in vacuum oven for overnight. Then, the CR 2032 coin-type test cell was made with prepared electrode, PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane soaked with 1 M NaPF
 <sub>6</sub> electrolyte solution. All the preparation of cell couple was carried under inert atmosphere in glove box with moisture level of 0.1 ppm. The galvanostatic charge discharge tests of the cells were conducted at cut-off voltages of 1.8–4.0 V at 0.1 C rate and cyclic voltammetry was performed between 1.5 and 4.5 V at scan rate of 0.1 mV/s.

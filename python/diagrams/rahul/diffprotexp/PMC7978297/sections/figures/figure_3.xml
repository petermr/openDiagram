   <bold>Differential expression of stage-specific germ cells with or without DEHP treatment. (A)</bold> Volcano plots of germ cells with three developmental stages. The left panel illustrates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of germ cells at the pre-stage of PF formation with or without DEHP treatment for PD0 and PD3, respectively. The middle and right panels refer to pre- and late-stage. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Venn plots of germ cells with three developmental stages. The light green and violet red circles represent the number of DEGs at PD0 and PD3. 
   <bold>(C-D)</bold> GO terms of key DEGs at early- (C) and late-stages (D) of PF formation.

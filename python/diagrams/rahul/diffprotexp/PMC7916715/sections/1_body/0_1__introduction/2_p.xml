<p>Contactin 1 (CNTN1) is an Ig-like neural cell adhesion protein [
 <xref rid="B21-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; it plays an important role in the central nervous system through promoting axon elongation in the cerebellum, formation of the septate-like junctions between axons and myelinating glial cells, and generation of the neuromuscular junction [
 <xref rid="B22-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recent evidence clearly reveals CNTN1-derived oncogenic actions [
 <xref rid="B25-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. CNTN1 facilitates lung cancer metastasis [
 <xref rid="B26-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and associates with poor prognosis in patients with lung, esophageal and oral squamous cell carcinomas [
 <xref rid="B26-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and hepatocellular carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B29-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. CNTN1 upregulation and its association with worse clinical features have been reported in breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B30-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], astrocytic glioma [
 <xref rid="B31-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], thyroid cancer [
 <xref rid="B32-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and stomach cancer [
 <xref rid="B33-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In prostate cancer, CNTN1 upregulation occurs in cancer stem cells and primary cancer [
 <xref rid="B34-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Functionally, CNTN1 promotes PC metastasis [
 <xref rid="B34-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Clinically, CNTN1 is associated with PC relapse [
 <xref rid="B34-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nonetheless, CNTN1 is a relatively new oncogenic protein, particularly in PC; its contributions to PC progression remain largely uncharacterized.

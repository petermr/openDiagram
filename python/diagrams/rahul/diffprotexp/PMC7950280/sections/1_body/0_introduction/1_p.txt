0: Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction and psychiatric alterations [ 1].
1: The genetic cause of the disease is an expansion of CAG repeat in the mutant huntingtin (mHtt) gene, contributing to cortical atrophy and the preferential demise of medium spiny neurons in the striatum [ 2,  3].
2: A number of studies have shown that long-term survival of aforementioned neurons depends on the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is reduced due to the mHtt-mediated mechanism in HD [ 4,  5].
3: Although there is no cure currently available for the disease, BDNF is thought to be an excellent therapeutic target for the clinical hallmarks of HD [ 6].

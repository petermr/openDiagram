<p>Three proteins were chosen for Western blot analysis: Beta-2-microglobulin (B2-M), Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF 21) and 14-3-3 protein α/β (Ywhab). The plasma for the validation studies was collected from another 8 pairs of model and control rats. Each rat’s plasma was collected at three time-points: on days 0, 6 and 12 (before surgical inoculation and on the sixth and twelfth days after inoculation, respectively). An equal volume of plasma from each rat was loaded onto a gel and analyzed via Western blotting.</p>

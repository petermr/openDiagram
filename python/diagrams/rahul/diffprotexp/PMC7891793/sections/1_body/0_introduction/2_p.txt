0: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, caused by human orthopneumovirus, has virtually the same symptoms and pathogenesis as bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection in calves.
1: Based on the similarity of the disease and genetic and antigenic similarity between bovine RSV and human RSV, bovine calves are considered an excellent model for experimentation and trials as the results are easy to extrapolate to human infants [ 5].
2: Bronchiolitis in infants is the major cause of hospitalizations and morbidity in the United States and other countries [ 6 8].

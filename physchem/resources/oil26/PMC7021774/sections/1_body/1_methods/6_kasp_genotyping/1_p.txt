0: To validate the conversion of selected SNPs from the Illumina 90 k array to the Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) genotyping platform (LGC Genomics, UK), DNAs were extracted from the eight MAGIC founder varieties.
1: Marker co-dominance was investigated using a 50:50 mix of DNAs from two varieties known from the 90 k SNP dataset to contrast for allele call.
2: Additionally, DNA was extracted from a panel of 48 UK varieties that post-date the AM panel, released to the AHDB Recommended List between 2009 and 2017 (Supplementary Table 2).
3: All DNAs were extracted from two week old leaves using a modified Tanksley protocol (Fulton et al.
4: 1995), and concentration was determined using a Nanodrop 200 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
5: DNA sequences flanking each targeted SNP were used to design KASP primers using the software PolyMarker (Ramirez-Gonzalez et al.
6: 2015).
7: Primers were synthesised by Sigma-Aldrich (Cambridge, UK) and KASP genotyping undertaken as described by Cockram et al.
8: ( 2015).
9: The results were visualised using SNP Viewer v.1.99 ( https://lgcgenomics.com/).
10: The subset of plants that post-dated the AM panel were grown and phenotyped for ToxB sensitivity and genotyped with the KASP marker, following the methods described above.

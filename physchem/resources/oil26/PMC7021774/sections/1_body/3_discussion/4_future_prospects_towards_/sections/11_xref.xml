<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). While the &#8216;W7984&#8217; contigs have low (55%) genome coverage and have short length (contig N50 6.7&#160;kb), we nevertheless thought it useful to undertake an analysis of the potential gene space in a ToxB-sensitive line. This analysis allowed the identification of additional candidate genes within the ToxB-sensitive line &#8216;W7984&#8217; super-contig that were not present in ToxB-insensitive variety &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;, providing potential leads for future analysis. We did not further our analysis of the &#8216;W7984&#8217; genome sequence due to its fragmented nature, and because a number of projects are currently resequencing additional hexaploid bread wheat varieties. These include the 10&#8201;+&#8201;Wheat Genomes Project (

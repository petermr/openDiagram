<p id="Par14">Chromatin conformational states differed significantly between CNFs and PNFs and were strongly linked to both site-specific and geographic-specific methylation events. These findings suggest that chromatin accessibility broadly affects gene expression in CNFs and PNFs. More work is needed to determine how epigenetic alterations affect regulatory genes that are known to contribute to tumor size and, ultimately, cancer predisposition. Based on our probe-based analysis of tumor tissue, we identified 34 CpG methylation sites that were statistically correlated with CNF size. Unfortunately, the genes corresponding to the individual methylation probe sites could not be identified with statistical confidence, nor could we link these methylation events with specific biological processes or signaling pathways. Regardless, these data confirm that CpG methylation influences CNF tumor size, possibly through a novel mechanism. More work is needed in this area.</p>

From this solution, a dilution series was prepared to obtain the concentrations of solutions 500, 400, 300, 200, and 130&#8201;ppm. For each replicate of a treatment, 10 larvae were used, pipetted into a beaker containing 100&#8201;mL of distilled water. Then, the larvae were removed from the beaker into the test container, thus minimizing the time between the preparation of the first and last sample. The safety of the solvent was observed in the concentration used, with the same present also in control of the replicas. During the experiment, the average water temperature was 25&#176;C. After 24 and 48 hours, dead larvae were counted, being considered as all those unable to reach the surface. The data obtained from the mortality (%) &#215; concentration (ppm) were analyzed by SPSS in probit graph to determine the lethal concentration that causes 50% mortality of the population (LC<sub>50</sub>).</p>

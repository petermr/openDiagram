0: Total protein concentration in the different samples was measured by the Bicinchoninic Acid Assay (BCA).
1: Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Merck).
2: The ATP2 proteins fused to the BAD tag were detected with the Avidin HRP-conjugate probe (Invitrogen), diluted to 1:20,000 in 5% (w/v) milk in PBS-Tween buffer (PBS + 0.02% (v/v) Tween20).
3: Cdc50 proteins fused to the 10xHis tag were detected using the HisProbeTM-HRP conjugate (ThermoFisher) diluted to 1:2000 in 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS-Tween buffer.
4: GFP-tagged proteins were detected with a primary mouse antibody IgG1 K Anti-GFP (Roche) diluted to 1:1000 in 5% (w/v) milk in PBS-Tween buffer, followed by a incubation with a second Goat Anti-Mouse IgG-HRP conjugate antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted to 1: 3000 in 5% (w/v) milk in PBS-Tween buffer.
5: The ECL Western Blotting Detection kit (GE healthcare) was used for western blot revelation, and luminescence was detected by a CDD camera.

<p>Several alkane-specific chemotaxis genes have been found in alkane-degrading bacteria. For example, 
 <italic>tlpS</italic>, which is located downstream of the alkane monooxygenase gene 
 <italic>alkB1</italic> on the 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 genome, has been predicted to encode an MCP that plays a role in alkane chemotaxis (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Smits et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly 
 <italic>alkN</italic> appears to encode a MCP in 
 <italic>P. putida</italic> GPo1 (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">van Beilen et al., 2001</xref>). Raman microspectroscopy showed chemotaxis in 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> toward alkanes is highly specific and the chemotaxis proteins therefore follow the same behavior (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the coupling protein CheW2 is from 
 <italic>A. dieselolei</italic> was found to be only induced by long-chain alkanes (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Shao, 2014</xref>). However, both MCP and CheA were upregulated in response to all types of alkanes, including 
 <italic>n-</italic>C
 <sub>8</sub> to 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>32</sub> and pristane. This data demonstrates an entire chemotaxis complex differentially expressed during growth on long-chain alkanes.

<p>To illustrate which specific pathways may involve in severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, we downloaded two classic collections of gene sets from MSigDB. Overall, we detected some pathways statistically significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) related with severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. The results of canonical pathways testing suggested that hypoxia inducible factor-1 transcription factor (HIF-1 TF) pathway was the most significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.89 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>), indicating it might play an important role in severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The GO testing revealed that positive regulation of response to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and dendritic cell cytokine production terms were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 7.75 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> respectively) associated with severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (

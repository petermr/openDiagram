0: Spikelets on apical and basal part of panicle on main shoot of rice plant were excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at different stages of post-anthesis period.
1: Spikelets on the upper-most two branches reaching anthesis first in the panicle were considered apical (superior) spikelets.
2: The spikelets of lowermost two primary branches of panicle reaching anthesis 5 days later were basal (inferior) spikelets.
3: The spikelets were collected on 0, 5 and 10 days after anthesis for both cultivars SR-159 and SR-157.
4: The six samples, comprising three each of apical and basal spikelets in SR-159 were combined into Group-1.
5: Similarly, the six samples of SR-157 were combined into Group-2.

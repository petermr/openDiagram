<p>Differences in the protein expression of the six protein spots were subsequently evaluated in fold change between three groups (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). For MSC and AC groups, all proteins except TAGLN2 were differentially expressed (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). CFL1, ALDOA, TAGLN2 and EF1-ALPHA were up-regulated in MSC while MYL6B and GAPD were highly expressed in AC. The expression of MYL6B and GAPD were higher in cMSC than MSC (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), whereas the remaining proteins (i.e CFL1, ALDOA, TAGLN2 and EF1-ALPHA) were higher in MSCs than cMSCs (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). All proteins except GAPD were differentially expressed between cMSC and AC (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). However, only CFL1 was more highly expressed in cMSC than the rest of the proteins (i.e MYL6B, GAPD, ALDOA, TAGLN2 and EF1-ALPHA).

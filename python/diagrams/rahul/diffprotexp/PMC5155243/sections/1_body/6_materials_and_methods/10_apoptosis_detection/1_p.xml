 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. HEK293 cells transfected with or without ETHE1-specific siRNA or control siRNA were incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. Then cells (approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/tube) were washed in cold phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) (Dojindo) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Data were acquired by a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) and analysed using FlowJo 7.6.4 software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). In addition, a Calcein-AM and PI double staining kit (Dojindo) was also used for analysis of the living cell and dead cell levels as above.

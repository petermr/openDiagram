 <sup>−1</sup>. The fit of the results for the modified MWCNTs to the Langmuir isotherm was unsatisfactory, so this model was no longer taken into account. This simple model is based on the assumption that the process of adsorption takes place on a homogenous surface endowed with equivalent adsorption sites, with neither bond generation nor interactions between the adsorbed molecules. That is why the poor fit of the model to the results seems logical. The correlation coefficient calculated assuming the Freundlich model (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9658) confirms the heterogeneous distribution of active sites and well represents the nature of the process. On the basis of the tight fit of Langmuir isotherm, many authors have suggested single-layer adsorption of DOX on CNTs [

Despite good correlation factors obtained assuming the Langmuir model to adsorption process of DOX onto modified MWCNTs, Wang and co-authors have proved by the morphological observation that in the above-mentioned case the adsorption is not of single-layer type [

It is worth noticing that the presented simulation of DOX adsorption on CNTs also suggests that their coverage by a monolayer is implausible (

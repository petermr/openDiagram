<p id="p0010">Aging, a spontaneous and complex process with the passage of time, is one of the most important risk factors for increasing susceptibility to multiple diseases 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It involves much morphological and functional deterioration in biological systems, which are associated with various molecular, cellular, and organic changes 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Aging features a progressive accumulation of oxidative agents associated with decreased efficiency of antioxidant defense mechanisms. Related to this is a progressive decrease in immune activity or immune senescence. As animals age, their mitochondrial function and thus cellular metabolism systematically decline, leading to a loss of cellular homeostasis and the occurrence of multiple disorders 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, a number of efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms of the processes of aging and to discover new compounds that retain antiaging activities.

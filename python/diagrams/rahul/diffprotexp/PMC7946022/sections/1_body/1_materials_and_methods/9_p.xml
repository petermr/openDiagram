  <italic>In vitro</italic> evaluation of biofilm formation of the 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> lrgA and lrgB mutant strains
 </bold>. Biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> knock-out mutants defective in cell autolysis regulation (∆lrgA and ∆lrgB) was comparatively evaluated to the WT strain. 24 hrs biofilms were evaluated based on metabolic activity measurement using the MTS-assay as per manufacture directions (Promega; Madison, WI). Total biofilm biomass was evaluated by the crystal violet staining assay where 24 hr-grown biofilms were fixed in methanol for 20 mins, air dried and stained with crystal violet solution (0.2%) for 20 mins. The excess crystal violet was removed, plates were washed twice with PBS and cell-bound crystal violet was dissolved in 33% acetic acid. 100 µl of the extraction solution was transferred to 96-well plates and absorbance was measured at 595 nm.

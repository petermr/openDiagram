0: Tongue cancer is the most frequent type of malignancy in the oral cavity, and is characterized by remarkable aggressive biological behavior  1- 4.
1: This is partly due to that tongue cancer is comparatively silent and progresses fast from a premalignant state into invasive carcinoma.
2: This feature causes delay in diagnosis and thus leading to poor prognosis  5,  6.
3: Thus, even the currently understanding of cancer development and progression is rapidly increasing, tongue cancer is still a serious health issue in many counties with significantly lower 5-year survival rate in patients  7,  8.
4: Hence, expanding our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism to develop effective methods for early screening and diagnosis and identification of new therapeutic targets are urgently required for tongue cancer.

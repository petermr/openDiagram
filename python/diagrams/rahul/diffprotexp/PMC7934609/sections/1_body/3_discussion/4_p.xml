<p>Heat shock proteins are a class of heat emergency proteins widely found in parasites and mammals. When an organism is exposed to high temperatures, it will be stimulated by heat to synthesize this protein to protect itself. Studies have shown that many heat shock proteins could participate in the process of worm differentiation and can enhance its virulence, and can also be used as main protein antigens [

0: Melanin was quantified by spectrophotometry and fluorometry following previously reported protocols [ 23, 24].
1: In short, we dissolved synthetic melanin (Sigma-Aldrich) 100 g/mL and melanin from B16F1 cells with 1 M NaOH (Merck) at 80 C, the collected supernatants after centrifugation (1 min at 12,000  g at 4 C), and we assess the optical density (O.D.)
2: by spectrophotometry at 405 nm.
3: For fluorescence melanin quantification, after incubation with 15% ( m/ v) hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) (Sigma-Aldrich), we read the supernatants on the Glomax equipment with a wavelength of 470 nm and 550 nm excitation and emission, respectively.
4: We described the results according to the number of viable cells after determining cell number by MTT reductase assay.
5: Data were expressed as the average of three independent trials  standard deviation and analyzed by unpaired  t-test with Welch correction and a 95% confidence interval.

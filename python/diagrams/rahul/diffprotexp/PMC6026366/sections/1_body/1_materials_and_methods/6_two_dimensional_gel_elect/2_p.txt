0: Proteins (both wild type and RGE-treated) were first separated with isoelectric focusing using linear precast immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (17 cm, 310 linear pH gradients; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
1: IPG strips with 1.2 mg of proteins were rehydrated for 12 h and focused at 15,000 Vhs (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
2: First-dimension strips were stored at 80C or equilibrated immediately in first equilibration solution [75nM TrisHCL, pH 8.8, 6M urea, 2M thiourea, 30% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 0.002% bromophenol blue] with 100mM DTT for 15 min, followed by the second equilibration with 250mM iodoacetamide for 15 min.
3: 2-DE was performed using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels at 90 V for 30 min and 140 V for 45 h at 20C in Bio-Rad systems (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

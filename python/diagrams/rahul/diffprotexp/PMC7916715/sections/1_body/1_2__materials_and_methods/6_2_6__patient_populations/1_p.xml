The TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) PanCancer PC dataset contains 492 PCs and MSKCC contains 140 PCs with follow-up data, respectively. The data sets were used to analyze the LE multigene panel biomarker values in predicting PC recurrence. The TCGA PanCancer ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) dataset consists of 512 patients with primary ccRCC. Both PC and ccRCC TCGA PanCancer datasets have been well-demonstrated for its suitability in survival (relapse for PC and overall survival for ccRCC) biomarker studies [

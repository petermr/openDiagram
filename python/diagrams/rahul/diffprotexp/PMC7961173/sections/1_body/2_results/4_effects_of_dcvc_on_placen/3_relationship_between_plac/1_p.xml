<p id="Par45">In addition to conducting separate evaluations of DCVC-induced differential gene expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells and explants, a comparison of altered gene expression across the two models was evaluated by calculating pairwise correlation coefficients of logFC estimates. Differential expression for all dually expressed genes between cells and tissues was correlated [

 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>a). A separate pairwise comparison of logFC values for the 383 ATF4-regulated genes targets in HTR-8/SVneo cells versus explants further revealed that the two models were more strongly correlated with ATF4-regulated gene expression [

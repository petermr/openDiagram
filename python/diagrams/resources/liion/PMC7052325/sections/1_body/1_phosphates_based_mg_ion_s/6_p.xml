<p>Adamu and Kale proposed a sol-gel method to synthesize MZP (Adamu and Kale, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The MZP synthesized in this work showed an ionic conductivity of 7.23 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 725°C. They attributed improvement in the conductivity to the sol-gel preparation route, which ensured synthesis at the molecular level and avoid the impurity produced by the solid-state route due to the inhomogeneous mixing.

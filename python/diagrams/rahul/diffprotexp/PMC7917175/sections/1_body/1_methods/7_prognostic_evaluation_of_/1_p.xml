<p id="Par41">The prognostic values of the immune subtypes were evaluated using log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate cox regression, with stage and grade as covariates, and OS and RPS as the endpoints. ANOVA was used to determine the association of immune subtypes with different immune-related molecular and cellular characteristics. The most frequently mutated genes were screened using the chi-square test. DAVID program was used to functionally annotate each gene module through gene ontology analysis. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) was used to calculate immune enrichment scores for each sample, which is the measure of genes that are coordinately up- or down-regulated within a sample.</p>

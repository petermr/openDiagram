 <caption> Number of hydrogen bonds at the position of the maximum force experienced by the compound in the case of the GROMOS54a7 force-field with the DOPC model and pulling velocity v = 0.5 nm/ns as a function of logBB, TPSA (top panel), and logPS (bottom panel). The square of the correlation coefficient, R, for each case is indicated on the top left corner of each graph. </caption>

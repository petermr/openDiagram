<p>We detected the different types of inactivated mutation in 
 <italic>ACPT</italic>. Furthermore, selective pressure uncovered that the selective constraints have been relaxed among all toothless and enamel-less lineages. In addition, our results supported the hypothesis that mineralized teeth were lost or degenerated in the common ancestor of crown Mysticeti through two shared single-base sites deletion in exon 4 and 5 of 
 <italic>ACPT</italic> among all living baleen whales. Together with our evidence, 
 <italic>ACPT</italic> might be a good marker to research the mechanism of tooth loss. By comparing the molecular time with the fossil time, we found there might be different mechanisms of degeneration of tooth/among toothless and enamel-less lineages during evolution, which is needed further researches.

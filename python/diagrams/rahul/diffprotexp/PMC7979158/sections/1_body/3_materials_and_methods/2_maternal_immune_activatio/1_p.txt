0: Assessment of females baseline immunoreactivity before pregnancy and maternal immune activation were performed as previously described ( Estes et al., 2020).
1: Since female mice display a wide range of baseline immunoreactivity to poly(I:C) that dictates susceptibility and resilience of offspring from later pregnancies to MIA, virgin females in the lowest 25th percentile of immune responsiveness to poly(I:C) (IL-6 serum levels) were excluded from the study to reduce variability and ensure sufficient immune responsiveness of all included dams.
2: E12.5 pregnancies were determined by visualizing vaginal seminal plug (noted as E0.5) and by body weight increase.
3: IL-6 serum levels were measured at 2.5 hr post-injection.
4: Temperature, weight, and sickness behavior were tracked as previously described ( Estes et al., 2020).

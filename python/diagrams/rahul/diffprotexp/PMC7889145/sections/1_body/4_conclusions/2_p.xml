<p>We have identified the genomic insertion site of the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> mouse transgene, and this finding has important implications for the use of this mouse model in studies of adipocyte biology. The identification of the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene insertion site was facilitated by initial localization through linkage analysis with the 
 <italic>Adam10</italic> locus. The approach used in our study is however generalizable to the identification of other transgene insertion sites but may be less successful when there are multiple transgene insertion sites throughout the genome. In the ideal situation, the 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgene is limited to a single insertion site and this prevents unwanted phenotypic drift in model systems that use the 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mouse. 
 <italic>Cre</italic>-driver lines are best when the transgene location is known, the transgene is inherited as a single unit, 
 <italic>Cre</italic>-expression is appropriate, and passenger genes in the transgenic construct are limited. Highly parallel DNA sequencing provides an excellent tool for identifying or confirming transgene insertion and choosing founders which have these characteristics. We hope that this approach will be used more often in the future to help prevent unwanted consequences of transgene insertion, to better understand the advantages and limitations of the model developed and promote reproducible scientific inquiry.

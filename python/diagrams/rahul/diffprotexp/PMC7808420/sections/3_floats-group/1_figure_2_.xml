   <bold>Type I IFNs-dependent upregulation of ISGs are associated to control of SLEV replication</bold>. WT and ABR
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice in the SV129 background were inoculated intracranially with 10
   <sup>2</sup> PFU of SLEV and euthanized on days 1, 2 and 3 p.i. Brain samples were processed and assessed for viral load, by plaque assay (a), and for the expression of IFNα4 (b) and ISGs (c-g) by RT-qPCR. Results are expressed as SLEV PFU per 100 mg of homogenized brain (A), or as fold increase in expression relative to uninfected controls (b-g) (Mock). (h) HEK293T cell cultures were transfected with a plasmid encoding constitutively active human RIG-I to generate cells transiently expressing RIG-I or transfected with an empty vector. HEK293T cultures were infected with SLEV at a MOI of 0.01. At 24 and 48 h p.i., culture supernatants were collected and assess for SLEV load by plaque assay. (i) Cells were also collected and assessed for recombinant protein expression by Western blot confirming the expression of FLAG-RIG-I. Actin was used as loading control. Results are expressed as mean in a scatter plot (g) and as protein bands by Western Blot (I). Data are representative of two experiments (N = 4–8). *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 relative to the infected WT group. Mock – uninfected mice inoculated with saline. FLAGƟ – cells transfected with empty vector, RIG-I – cells transfected with plasmid encoding flag-tagged human RIG-I

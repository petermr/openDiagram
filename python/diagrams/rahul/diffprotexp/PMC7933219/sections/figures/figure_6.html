 <caption> (A) The relative expression of PRKAA2 was significantly upregulated in the TC-EC model, compared with EC alone. (B) The prediction of miRNAs targeted at PRKAA2, using miRDB, RNA22, and Targetscan database. (C) qPCR analysis of relative expression levels of 4 predicted miRNAs targeted at PRKAA2, in which the expression of miR-124-3p was significantly decreased in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M. (D) Predicted binding sites within the 3’UTR region of PRKAA2 with miR-124-3p using the Targetscan database. The data are presented as the means ± SD. ( n = 3, ** P &lt; 0.01, **** P &lt; 0.0001, TC-EC vs. EC). </caption>

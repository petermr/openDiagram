<p>Li-ion batteries comprise a wide variety of electrochemical systems that feature different anode and cathode materials, and also various electrolytes and other components. Five major types of cathodic compounds are commercially available, namely lithium-cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), lithium-manganese oxide (LMO), lithium-nickel-aluminum oxide (NCA), and lithium-iron phosphate (LFP). According to Avicenne Energy, in 2015, NMC represented the largest percentage of the worldwide LIB market (~29%), followed by LCO (26%) and LFP (23%) [

Anodic materials are also diverse; graphite is the most important anode material, lithium-titanate (LTO) is used for specific applications, and metallic Li is expected to expand its marketability in the next decade. This diversity of technologies and its rapid evolution represent challenges for the design and operation of recycling processes [

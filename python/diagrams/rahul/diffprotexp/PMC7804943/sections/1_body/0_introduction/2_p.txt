0: Alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) play numerous critical and multifaceted roles in the vertebrate nervous system 10  12.
1: These forms of post-transcriptional gene regulation generate multiple transcript isoforms from the same gene by differential selection of splice sites and 3 end poly(A) sites, respectively.
2: Both mechanisms are widespread in multicellular eukaryotes; more than 90% of human genes produce transcripts that are alternatively spliced 13,  14 and ~80% of human genes have multiple poly(A) sites 15.
3: The importance of coordinated regulation of neural-differential AS is highlighted by the concentration of AS programs in genes that function in key processes associated with nervous system development and function, such as neurogenesis, axonogenesis, synaptic biology, neurotransmitter trafficking, and signaling.
4: It has been estimated that approximately one-third of neural-regulated exons function in the remodeling of proteinprotein interaction networks 16, with many belonging to a class of neural microexons that are less than 27 nt in length 17.
5: Moreover, to-date, dozens of individual neural-differential exons, and the trans-acting factors that control them, have been functionally characterized and shown to play critical roles in these processes 18.

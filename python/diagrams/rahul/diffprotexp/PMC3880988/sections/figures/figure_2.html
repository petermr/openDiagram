 <caption> Histochemical analyses of adipogenic and osteogenic capacities of MSCs. MSCs were cultured in (2A) adipogenic medium and (2B) osteogenic medium for 14 days. The cultures were stained with Oil Red O for validation of intracellular lipid (2A; magnification 100X) and with Alizarin Red S for mineralized matrix (2B; magnification 100X). </caption>

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">While transcript abundance estimates inferred from RNA-Seq data can suggest that genes are functional, recent non-functional duplicates can still be transcribed. Therefore we inferred if each duplicate shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C/D</xref> encoded a putatively function protein by manually curation, specifically to identify premature stop codons and overall sequence conservation. Most genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C/D</xref>, such as <italic>STK11</italic>, <italic>CD14</italic>, <italic>SOD1</italic>, and <italic>BRD7</italic>, were well conserved and lacked premature stop codons. We also find that the <italic>STK11</italic>, <italic>CD14</italic>, and <italic>BRD7</italic> genes in the manatee were also well conserved, suggesting that extant manatees may also have enhanced tumor suppression and an augmented stress response. However, some of the duplicate genes in the mantatee genome have premature stop codons suggesting they are not translated into functional proteins, including the additional copies of <italic>MAPRE1</italic>, <italic>BUB3</italic>, and <italic>COX20</italic> as well as at least one of the duplicate copies of <italic>CNOT11</italic>, <italic>HMGB2</italic>, <italic>MAD2L1</italic>, <italic>LIF</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic>. For <italic>TP53</italic>, we have previously shown that duplicate copies of genes containing premature stop codons may still serve a functional role in regulating its progenitor's function. Thus, some of the genes with premature stop codons, such as duplicate <italic>COX20</italic> and <italic>MAD2L1</italic> which are expressed in RNA-Seq data, may encode functional lncRNA transcripts or truncated proteins. Some copies, including for <italic>CASP9</italic> and <italic>PRDX1</italic>, contained partial RBBH hits with no premature stop codons; however, they also lacked the totality of the coding sequence and thus may represent cases of pseudogenization, subfunctionalization, or neofunctionalization.</p>

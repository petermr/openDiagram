<p>As a final investigation, we assessed whether the changes introduced by the 
 <italic>Adipo-Cre</italic> transgene could influence high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and carbohydrate metabolism tolerance. Weight gain during 12 weeks of HFD feeding was similar between 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic>
 <sup>±</sup> mice and 
 <italic>Cre</italic>-negative littermate controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4a</xref>). Prior to starting HFD, initial glucose tolerance was tested in 12-week-old 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic>
 <sup>±</sup> and 
 <italic>Cre</italic>-negative males and no changes were observed between the groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4b</xref>). Furthermore, no changes were observed in glucose tolerance between 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic>
 <sup>±</sup> mice and 
 <italic>Cre</italic>-negative controls after 12-weeks of HFD feeding, suggesting that any changes introduced by the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene have a limited effect on HFD-induced weight gain and glucose tolerance.

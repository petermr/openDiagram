0: Prior to each experiment, a DCVC stock solution aliquot was thawed in a 37 C water bath and then diluted in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Anti-Anti (villous explants) or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S (HTR-8/SVneo) to final concentrations of 10 or 20 M DCVC.
1: PBS alone was used as the 0 M DCVC negative control.
2: These concentrations of DCVC were chosen because we previously demonstrated that they did not induce cytotoxicity at the time points used in the current study (Elkin et al.
3: 2020a,  2019,  2018; Hassan et al.
4: 2016).
5: Moreover, these concentrations are comparable to the average concentration of the DCVC precursor  S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl) glutathione (DCVG), 13.4 M, measured in the serum of female volunteers exposed to 100 ppm of the parent compound, TCE, by inhalation for 4 h (Lash et al.
6: 1999).

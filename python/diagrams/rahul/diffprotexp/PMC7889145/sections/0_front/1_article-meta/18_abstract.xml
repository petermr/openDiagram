 <p>The 
  <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse is widely used in the development of adipocyte-specific genetic manipulations for the study of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the process of developing a new mouse model utilizing the adipocyte selective 
  <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse, strong genetic linkage between a gene of interest, 
  <italic>Adam10</italic>, and the 
  <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene was discovered. Whole-genome sequencing of the 
  <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse model identified the genomic insertion site within the 
  <italic>Tbx18</italic> gene locus on chromosome 9 and this insertion causes a significant decrease in 
  <italic>Tbx18</italic> gene expression in adipose tissue. Insertion of genes 
  <italic>Kng2, Kng1, Eif4a2</italic> and 
  <italic>Rfc4</italic> also occurred in the 
  <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse, and these passenger genes may have functional consequences in various tissues.

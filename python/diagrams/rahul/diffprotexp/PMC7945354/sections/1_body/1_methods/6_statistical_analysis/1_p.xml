<p id="Par39">Statistical analysis was mainly performed in SPSS (v26.0) and GraphPad Prism (v.8.0). Most of the data between the two groups were presented as means ± SDs (Std. Deviations) if not noted and were compared by Student’s t-test or the Mann–Whitney test. Correlation analysis was evaluated by Pearson’s correlation analysis. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the biomarkers, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was estimated for each individual protein. For all analyses, P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

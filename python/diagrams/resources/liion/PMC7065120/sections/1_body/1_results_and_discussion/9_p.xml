<p>For conversion‐reaction mechanism materials, there is clearly a large experimental difference between the first and second lithiation, but the subsequent cycles are identical.
 <xref rid="anie201914760-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> Indeed, during the first lithiation process, large and well‐crystallized particles are transformed into nanosized and amorphous particles. Only after this irreversible morphological change, the lithiated material becomes the true cycling material. Thus, the experimental profile of FeNCN at the second cycle at a rate of C/50 (corresponding to the reaction of one mole of Li per mole of FeNCN in 50 h) is depicted (as a dashed line) for comparison.

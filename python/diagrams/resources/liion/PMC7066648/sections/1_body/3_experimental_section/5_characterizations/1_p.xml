<p>The surface morphologies of the anode, cathode, and electrolyte were observed by optical microscopy (DM-XTL7045) and SEM (FESEM, SU8010). EDS mapping was obtained to quantitatively identify the elements in the cathode. The cross section of the yarn-shaped battery was also imaged with optical microscopy (DM-XTL7045). The voltage of the battery was measured with a multimeter (VC890C+). The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements, rate performance evaluation, and constant-capacity cycling tests were conducted using a LAND battery testing system (CT2001A) at room temperature. EIS and CV were performed by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.).</p>

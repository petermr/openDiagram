0: According to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen), total RNA was prepared using TRIZol reagent and first strand cDNA was synthesized by RT II kit (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany).
1: Subsequently, using an Applied Biosystems 7300 Sequence Detection system, qRT-PCR was performed.
2: The reaction system was follows: 10 L RNase-free water (Qiagen),1 L cDNA, 2 L 10  miScript Primer Assay, 2 L 10  miScript Universal Primer and 10 L 2  QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix.
3: PCR conditions were as follows: 95 C for 10 min, 40 cycles at a melting temperature of 95 C for 15 s, followed by 60 C for 1 min.
4: All primers were synthesized by Qiagen, and housekeeping gene was U6.
5: All experiments were performed in triplicate.
6: The C T data were determined using default threshold settings, and the mean CT was calculated from the triplicate PCRs.
7: CT = CT treatment-CT control.

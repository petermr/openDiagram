<p>While many of the problems and examples considered here are common for both XAS investigations of electrocatalysts and of thermal catalysts, we chose to especially highlight the former ones. One of the reasons for this selection is that there is still a reduced base of fundamental knowledge available on electrocatalysts while at work. Furthermore, there are also pressing environmental concerns coupled with the need of developing a sustainable energy economy, which have brought to the forefront of fundamental and applied research the understanding of electrocatalytic processes that might lead to cost-effective and environmental friendly chemicals and fuels. Indeed, technologically important electrochemical processes such as alcohol oxidation reactions in fuel cells, the electrochemical water splitting for the production of green hydrogen, the electrochemical reduction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> (CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR) to valuable chemicals and a number of additional electrochemical reactions still require more efficient catalysts. In many cases, fundamental understanding of the working principles of existing catalysts is still lacking, which also hinders the development of novel catalytic materials.

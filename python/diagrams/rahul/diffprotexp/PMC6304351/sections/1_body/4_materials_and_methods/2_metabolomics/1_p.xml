 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> MIL-1 (DSM 14913) was grown in sterile 160 ml Nunc Cell Culture Treated Flasks containing 100 ml of ONR7a media (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dyksterhouse et al., 1995</xref>). Cultures were enriched separately with the medium-chain alkane 
 <italic>n</italic>-tetradecane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub>), or the long-chain alkane 
 <italic>n</italic>-octacosane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>). Cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker (16°C, 60 rpm) over a period of 7 days. Each day triplicate cultures of 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub> and 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub> were agitated through water sonication for 30 min and pre-concentrated through solid phase extraction (SPE) by Supel-Select HLB cartridges (Supelco, 200 mg, 6 ml) and eluted with 12 ml of chloroform. Samples were further concentrated through evaporation of the chloroform to 200 μl with nitrogen. The concentrated solvent was analyzed to detect the alcohols produced from the oxidation of the alkanes used as growth substrates. GC-MS analysis was carried out as previously described (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">McKew et al., 2007b</xref>). The mass spectrometer scanned m/z values from 10 to 550, with identification of target analytes based on retention times of analytical standards; 1-tetradecanol, 2-tetradecanol and 1-octacosanol (Sigma-Aldrich).

<p>Throughout microstructural testing, no structural defects such as a lack of fusion (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f011">Figure 11</xref>) or porosity could be found. Herein, low energy input per unit length (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f005">Figure 5</xref>) led to the formation of small and stable melt beads with enhanced decarburization. Furthermore, the increased silicon content of 1.0% (compare 
 <xref rid="materials-13-02491-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in the filler wire provided enhanced binding of oxygen during solidification.

<p id="Par29">Other upregulated development-related factors include MYBBP1A, TEF, and MYNN. The first two have important roles in embryonic development

 </sup>. On the other hand, downregulated transcripts identified as NRL/MAF (neural retina leucine zipper, Maf type), EGR1 and FOXA, have all been associated with differentiation mechanisms. The former has been shown to have an essential role in rod photoreceptor development

 </sup>; EGR1 has a vast range of activities including differentiation and proliferation, most importantly its association with other factors that regulate cell growth
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>; FOXA has a role in competence establishment of the foregut endoderm and induction of liver specific genes for hepatogenesis

 </sup>. Finally, it is worth mentioning that two transcripts annotated as KLF13 and ZNF260 were found, respectively upregulated and downregulated at day 1. Both belong to the Kr√ºppel family of transcriptional regulators involved in modulation of numerous developmental features
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. Downregulation of most of these transcripts appears reasonable since their differentiation role is contrary to the dedifferentiation processes taking place at the onset of regeneration.

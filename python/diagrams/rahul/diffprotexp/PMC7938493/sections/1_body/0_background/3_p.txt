0: Recently, various RBP-related mechanisms in cancer onset and progression have been clarified, including genomic alterations, transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, and posttranslational modifications [ 5].
1: In addition, RBPs directly or indirectly affected oncogenic and tumour-suppressive signalling pathways [ 6].
2: However, only a few RBPs have been completely studied and identified as vital players in human cancers.
3: For example, PNO1, a novel RBP isolated from the human kidney, functions as an oncogene in urinary bladder cancer by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of urinary bladder cancer cells [ 7].
4: ZFP36L1, a tandem zinc-finger RBP that mediates mRNA decay, acts as a tumour suppressor to regulate mRNAs involved in hypoxia and the cell cycle [ 8].
5: A recent study demonstrated that IMP3, a member of the insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA binding protein (IMP) family, was significantly upregulated in muscle-invasive BLCA compared to non-muscular invasive tissues and could serve as an independent prognosis predictor for BLCA patients [ 9].
6: Previously, most research mainly focused on the correlation between a single or a limited number of RBPs and BLCA.
7: A comprehensive study of RBPs functions will help us to fully understand their roles in BLCA.
8: Therefore, this study downloaded RNA sequence data and corresponding clinical information concerning BLCA from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to screen for RBPs differentially expressed between tumour and normal samples.
9: Subsequently, a series of bioinformatics analysis methods were performed based on these differential RBPs to finally identify eight independent prognosis-associated RBPs, which were then used to construct prognostic and nomogram survival models.
10: The results of this study might facilitate the development of prognostic assessment models based on RBPs in patients with BLCA.

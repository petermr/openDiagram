0: For protein analysis, samples were divided into methylation high, methylation intermediate, and methylation low groups based on the beta-values across MAP2K3 DMR1 and samples from each group were randomly chosen as a representative subset of the discovery cohort.
1: Protein lysates were prepared by manually homogenizing frozen tissue in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche).
2: Proteins were separated on a 420% TGX SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen).
3: Blots were blocked in 5% dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mmol/L TrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated at 4 C overnight in primary antibody; MKK3 (Cell Signaling #5674), p38 (Cell Signaling #9219), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling # 4511), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101), and -Actin (Cell Signaling #3700).
4: Densitometry was done in ImageJ.

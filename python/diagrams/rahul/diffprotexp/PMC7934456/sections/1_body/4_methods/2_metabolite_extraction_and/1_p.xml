<p id="Par39">The sample preparation and metabolite extraction procedures were as follows: 100 ± 1 mg of 3–4-stage anther was put in a 2 mL EP tube, and 0.6 mL extraction buffer (V
 <sub>methanol</sub>: V
 <sub>dH2O</sub> = 3:1) was added, followed by 20 μL of adonitol (1 mg/mL stock in dH
 <sub>2</sub>O) as per the internal standard. The column used was Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18 (1.8 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm. The mobile phase used was as follows: Phase A, ultrapure water (containing 0.04% acetic acid); Phase B, acetonitrile (containing 0.04% acetic acid). The elution gradient program was as follows: 0.00–10.00 min 0% B; 10.00–11.00 min 95% B; 11.00–11.10 min, 5% B; 11.10–14 min, maintained at 5% B.” At 10.00 min, B’s ratio increased linearly to 95% and remained at 95% for 1 min. From 11.00 to 11.10 min, B’s ratio decreased to 5% and maintained till 14 min. The elution conditions were as follows: The flow rate is 0.35 mL/min; the column temperature is 40 °C; the injection volume is 4 μL. The mass spectrometry conditions are as follows: the electrospray ionization temperature is 550 °C; the electrospray ionization temperature is 550 °C. Mass spectrometer voltage, 5500 V; curtain gas 30 psi; collision induced dissociation parameters [

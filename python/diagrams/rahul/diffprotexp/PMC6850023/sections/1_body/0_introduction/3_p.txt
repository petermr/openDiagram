0: The ubiquity of  Alancaivorax and its success as an alkane degrader may result from the ability to also efficiently utilize branched alkanes as the sources of carbon, which provides a competitive advantage over other OHCB which are unable to utilize these more difficult to degrade substrates (Pirnik  et al.,1974; Hara  et al.,2003).
1: In the previous reports, branched alkanes, such as pristane and phytane, which are the abundant branched alkanes present in many crude oils, induce the expression of AlkB1 and the longchain alkane monooxygenase AlmA in  A. hongdengensis A113 and  A. dieselolei B5 (Liu  et al.,2011; Wang and Shao,  2012b).
2: Sevilla  et al.,2017 demonstrated through transcriptional fusions of the three cytochrome P450 genes from  A. borkumensis to a green fluorescent protein reporter gene and fluorescence assays that expression of P4503 was higher on pristane compared to  nalkanes or pyruvate.
3: However our knowledge of the proteins involved branched alkane degradation remains very limited.
4: This study is first to compare the differences in protein expression during linear and branched alkane degradation in  A. borkumensis SK2 T. It provides insights into the metabolic pathways in this environmentally relevant hydrocarbon degrader.

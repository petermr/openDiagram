<p id="Par5">Although we have a growing understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of fetal programming, it is still unclear to the extent these differences can be attributed to the coordinated function of genes and the regulation of specific pathways. Therefore, we hypothesized that maternal nutrient restriction from breeding to day 50 of gestation would negatively affect fetal cerebrum, liver, and muscle development and function through differential gene regulation. Herein, by measuring the geneâ€“gene interactions, we uncovered the regulatory interplay between genes and showed that these fetal tissues were differentially regulated in response to maternal nutrition.</p>

0: Deficits in glucose availability and disruption of mitochondrial functions were also seen in Alzheimers disease (AD) patients [ 10].
1: Furthermore, an impairment of glycolysis was demonstrated to sensitize human astrocytes to amyloid beta toxicity and to induce amyloid aggregation [ 11].
2: Another recent study reported a decreased expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1, MCT2, MCT4) and lactate dehydrogenase A and B (LDH-A and LDH-B) in the brains of double transgenic amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD [ 12].
3: MCTs are membrane-bound proteins with body-wide distribution, which enable the intercellular shuttling of energy metabolites such as lactate and pyruvate, whereas LDH isoenzymes enable the reversible conversion of pyruvate to lactate and thus play a critical role in glycolytic metabolism.
4: Earlier, we showed that PrP c overexpression enhances MCT1 protein level in HEK 293 cells [ 13].
5: Interestingly, we also found that LDH-A and LDH-B protein expression levels were markedly increased in the brain of wild-type (WT) vs. Prnp knockout mice when exposed to ischemic (stress) conditions, but exhibited invariable expression under non-ischemic conditions [ 13].
6: The latter finding is significant in the light of a well-known fact that PrP c mice exhibit a higher tolerance toward different stress conditions as compared with  Prnp  / mice [ 14, 15].

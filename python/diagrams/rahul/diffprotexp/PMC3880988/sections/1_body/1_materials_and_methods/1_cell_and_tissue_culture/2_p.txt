0: ACs were aseptically isolated from cartilage tissues as described by Ab-Rahim  et.
1: al.
2: (2008) 9.
3: The specimens were finely minced using surgical blade before being digested in 0.6% type-II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at 37C for 14 hours.
4: This was followed by a centrifugation at 500  g for 10 minutes before the cell pellet was being seeded at 100,000 cell/cm 2 in DMEM/Ham's F-12 Nutrient Mixture (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.0025% ascorbic acid and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS) (Gibco, USA).
5: The cells were then incubated at 37C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2.
6: After 14 days, the cultured cells were used at passage 2 for cell differentiation assay.

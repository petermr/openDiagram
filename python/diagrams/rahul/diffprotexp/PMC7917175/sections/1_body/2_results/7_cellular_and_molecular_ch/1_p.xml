<p id="Par49">The response to mRNA vaccine depends on the tumor immune status. Hence, we further characterized the immune cell components in the 5 immune subtypes by scoring 28 previously reported signature genes in both TCGA and ICGC cohorts using ssGSEA. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, the immune cell components were divided into five clusters. IS4 and IS5 showed similar immune cell scores in ICGC cohorts, while similar distribution was observed in IS1 and IS2. Nevertheless, the immune cell composition was significantly different among the subtypes. For instance, the scores of CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> natural killer (NK) cells were significantly higher in IS4 and IS5 compared to IS1 and IS2, while that of eosinophils, activated CD8 T cells, activated B cells, monocytes and effector memory CD4 T cells were higher in IS1 and IS2 relative to IS4 and IS5

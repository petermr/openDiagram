<p>In order to check if the heterologous expression of the AAF subunits also resulted in the expected cell surface structures of host strain EAEC 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <bold>
  <sup>−</sup>
 </bold>, we subjected the bacteria to EM analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>, thin surface structures resembling the previously described fimbriae of the corresponding wild type cells could be detected when EAEC strain 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <bold>
  <sup>−</sup>
 </bold> was heterologously expressing AAF/I, III, IV, and V, but not when containing the empty plasmid (NC). Irrespective of the plasmid, strain 55989 
 <italic>agg</italic>3
 <bold>
  <sup>−</sup>
 </bold> was expressing flagella that were substantially longer and thicker than the fimbriae, which were readily distinguishable from the flagella, as expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>).

 <sub>2</sub> solution purchased from Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd., into the nutrient solution, a standard treatment acting as a buffer to avoid possible interface between Al ions and solution ions [
 <xref rid="B51-life-11-00177" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Due to the unstable Al ions, the high concentration of phosphorus in the nutrient solution can cause a reaction with Al ions and reduce the actual Al concentration of the treatment. Hence, after adding a low concentration of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> can preempt the binding site of Al
 <sup>3+</sup>, which ensures the target Al

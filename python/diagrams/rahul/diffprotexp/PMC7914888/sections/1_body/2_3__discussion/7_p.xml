<p>A global change in miRNA expression profiles by exposure to L-Tyrosine generated 61% of under-expressed miRNAs and 39% over-expressed, compared to 34% and 65% 5-Brd-2′-dU. These results suggest that 5-Brd-2′-dU’s melanoma cells exposed to genotoxic or metabolic stress by L-Tyr generate two expression profiles for the same genetic background, explaining the reduction in growth and changes in the pigmentation described here, depending on the potential regulation on its molecular targets.</p>

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">According to the bioassay, the species<italic> M. piperita</italic> has a low potential larvicide at LC<sub>50</sub> 367.6&#8201;ppm, <italic>p</italic> (value) &lt; 0.01, and coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) of 0.9980; these results are statistically significant. The study is similar to research by Kumar et al. [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Reduction of LC<sub>50</sub> in periods of 24 or 48 hours (111.9 and 98.66&#8201;ppm) in the potential larvicide of the species was observed. The bioactivity is ineffective for the larvae, because they develop from pupas into adults in the 60&#8211;72&#8201;h period.</p>

<p>To verify the sequencing results of the lncRNAs, three upregulated lncRNAs (ENSG00000261496, ENSG00000273447 and ENSG00000269971) and three downregulated lncRNAs (ENSG00000257477, ENSG00000254369 and MSTRG.119041) were randomly selected. The expression levels of the six lncRNAs were detected by RT-qPCR in 13 cartilage samples (six NC and seven OA). The results of the RT-qPCR analysis were consistent with the microarray data (

<p>The extended oxidoreductase network was examined, specifically enzymes involved in cofactor abundance and electron transport, which showed trends towards upregulation in 106-MtzR (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, panel 2). The magnitude of differential expression in these enzymes was lower overall than DEPs in the antioxidant network, and again no common expression profiles emerged between MtzR lines. While glutamate synthase was differentially expressed in all 3 lines, it was upregulated in 106- and 713-Mtz, and downregulated in WB-MtzR. Recent models suggest this enzyme may be more structurally similar to trimethylamine dehydrogenase of bacteria [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Many of the changes related to enzymes consuming Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or NADH are better contextualized relative to electron transport via ferredoxin-containing enzymes (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Thus, 106-MtzR upregulates multiple enzymes that may increase electron transport and the reducing potential available to antioxidant enzymes that activate Mtz. Lower transcript levels of glutamate dehydrogenase in all 3 lines [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], hypothesized to similarly conserve NADPH, were not observed in protein expression, with 106-MtzR, in fact, displaying a higher abundance than its MtzS parents. In agreement with existing transcriptomics, threonine dehydratase was downregulated in WB- and 713-MtzR, perhaps indicating a preference for pyruvate over alpha-ketobutyrate as a PFOR substrate, as well as its downstream metabolite acetyl-CoA.

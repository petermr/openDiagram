  <p>The ERAD of NKCC2 mediated by STCH involves both the proteasome and the lysosome. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Mannose trimming is required for STCH effect on NKCC2. OKP cells transiently transfected for with Myc-NKCC2 alone or with GFP-STCH, were treated with 25 μM of kifunensine (KIF) or without for 12–14 h prior to cell lysis. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Myc and anti-GFP antibodies.

   <bold>B</bold>) STCH decreases NKCC2 expression in a proteasome-dependent and lysosome dependent manner. 16 h post-transfection, HEK cells were treated with or without 2 μm MG132 or 100 μm chloroquine for 6 h prior to cell lysis. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-GFP antibodies.

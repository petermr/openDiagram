<p>STRING version 11.0(
 <xref rid="b25-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) was used to predict the potential PPIs of proteins affected by 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants. PPI networks were constructed by mapping the top 25 proteins with the highest differential expression levels in patients with PD with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants compared with those of the healthy control group. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis (

 <xref rid="b27-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was used to identify the biological processes in which the proteins affected by both variants are involved. The top three biological processes with the smallest false discovery rate (FDR) values were selected.

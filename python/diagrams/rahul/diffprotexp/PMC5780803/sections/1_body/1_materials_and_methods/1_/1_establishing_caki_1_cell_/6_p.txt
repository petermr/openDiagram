0: Cell viability was determined by MTT assay.
1: An MTT kit (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to detect the inhibition rate of cells at varying drug concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50, 100 g/ml).
2: Etoposide was used as an apoptosis inducer.
3: DMSO was used to dissolve the purple formazan, and viability was subsequently analyzed at a wavelength of 570 nm.
4: In an additional experiment, in order to improve the experimental efficiency, flow cytometry with BD FACSDiva Software 6.0 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used to detect early apoptosis according to the manufacturer's protocol.
5: The percentage of apoptotic cells was detected by flow cytometry using an Annexin V/FITC and PI Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences; cat.
6: no.
7: 556547; Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit).
8: BD Cellquest Pro software (version 5.1; BD Biosciences) was used to analyze the experimental data.

0: Cells lysates were prepared in a lysate buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM -glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 g/mL leupeptin, and 10 g/mL aprotinin.
1: A total of 50 g of whole cell lysate was separated on SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK), followed by blocking with 5% skim milk at room temperature for one hour.
2: Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 C with agitation, and secondary antibodies incubated for one hour at room temperature.
3: Signals were then developed (ECL Western blotting Kit, Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK).
4: Primary antibodies used were anti-CNTN1 (1:200; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MI, USA) and anti-Actin 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TE, USA).

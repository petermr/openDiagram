This approach compares all possible triplets of genes by exploring the concepts of partial correlation and mutual information reporting the significantly correlated pairs after accounting for all the other genes in the network

 </sup>. For the tissue-to-tissue network inference, all the genes (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,160) selected as DEG, TS genes, or TFs from the previous analyses were used considering all animals and tissues together. Significant co-expressed pairs were determined based on partial correlation values greater than |0.9| (

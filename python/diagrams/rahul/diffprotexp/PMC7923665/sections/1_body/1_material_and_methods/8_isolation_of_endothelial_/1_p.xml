<p id="Par24">Endothelial cells were isolated from fresh human brain AVM tissues and control tissues. Briefly, surgically excised fresh tissue samples were collected in ice cold PBS and finely minced with sterile scissors. Finely chopped tissue was transferred to 5 ml of 1 mg/ml collagenase/dispase solution and allowed to stand at 37 °C for 45 min. Later, single-cell suspension was made by aspirating the digested tissue with a 5-ml pipette. The cell suspension was passed through a 70-μl cell strainer, and the strainer was washed with medium + FBS to stop the enzymatic action. The cell suspension was then pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 0.1% BSA in PBS and transferred to three 1 ml eppendoff tubes. Subsequently, the cell suspension was incubated with 22.5 μl of anti-CD31 conjugated dynabeads and tumbled at room temperature for 12 min. After tumbling, the beads were kept in the magnetic particle separator, and the supernatant was removed. Later, magnetic beads were washed five times in 0.1% BSA. Finally, RNA was isolated from the enriched cells.</p>

<p>The position of the absorption edge is defined as the onset of transitions to delocalized continuum states. The corresponding energy is very sensitive to the oxidation state of the atom and can change by several eVs when the valence state of the atom changes by one electron. The XANES spectrum after the absorption edge (post-edge region) changes relatively smoothly, and the observed features can be understood within a full multiple scattering (FMS) formalism as a result of the interactions between the photoelectron and the neighboring atoms.

 </sup> Similarly to the EXAFS features, the postedge XANES features are sensitive to the materials crystallographic structure, interatomic distances, and particle sizes, although their quantitative interpretation may be even more challenging.

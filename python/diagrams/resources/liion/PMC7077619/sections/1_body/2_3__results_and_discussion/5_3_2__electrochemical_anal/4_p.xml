<p>Herein, the β-phase transformation in PVdF occurs during the incorporation with inorganic fillers (SiO
 <sub>2</sub>), where it can convince the change in structure due to new nucleation sites in PVdF. That can transform the predominant nonpolar α-phase of PVdF to polar β-phase. Where it may expect to provides free kinetics for Na+ ions in the polymer electrolyte, that can be due to the weaker interaction between the Na+ ion with high electronegative fluorine in the polymer matrix. Basically, in the gel polymer electrolyte type, the ionic liquid introduced in to the polymer network was occupied by the pores in the membrane and then penetrated into the chains of polymer matrix to swell its amorphous domains. As the consequence of these phenomena, the ion carriers can be easily transferred through membrane. Therefore, the increase in ionic conductivity is mostly attributed to the liquid electrolyte where it can be trapped in the pores of the polymer network and the swelling of the amorphous domains by the electrolyte solution [

<p>This section is divided in sub-sections depending on the leaching process and leaching agent used. It includes leaching with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, HCl, HNO
 <sub>3</sub>, organic acids, and other mineral acids or alkaline leaching agents. For each section, the current literature for leaching processes and for leach solution purification or extraction techniques is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Tables S1â€“S10</xref> in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Supplementary Materials</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Tables S1, S3, S5, S7, and S9</xref> summarize the types of pretreatments performed prior to leaching, accepted battery chemistries, states of feed material, reducing agents, leaching conditions, including acid and reducer concentrations, temperature, leaching time and solid concentration, and also the recovery rates. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Tables S2, S4, S6, S8, and S10</xref> describe the solution purification processes, including the reagent schemes, final products obtained, recovery rates, and process specific additional information.

<p>So it appears that the presence of MBP in the mitochondrial fraction is an artifact of tissue freezing and storage. Nevertheless, differential expression of MBP isoforms and proteolytic fragments appears to be a consistent feature of EAE. Increases in expression of MBP isoforms also have been observed in mitochondrially-enriched fractions from MS brain tissue relative to controls, where the differential expression of MBP was an important factor separating MS samples from controls in principal component analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We have identified the peak at 13,954 Da, which decreases in EAE relative to controls, as MBP8 (the 14.2 kDa isoform). There is also a peak at 12,448 Da, which increases in EAE relative to controls, and is identified as MBP1, the canonical MBP, but in fact, the relatively small number of peptides (five) and sequence coverage (15%), mean this peak could be any MBP isoform except isoform 3. Its m/z ratio is consistent with it being a proteolytic fragment of MBP. The reduction of the 14.2 kDa MBP isoform and the increase in the 12.4 kDa MBP fragment in EAE animals with stage 3 diseases is clearly evident in the SELDI mass spectra shown in Figure

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Several proteases have been implicated in the degradation of myelin proteins and the generation of immunogenic peptides in multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) including calpain, trypsin 4, matrix metalloproteinase, myelencephalon-specific protease (MSP), plasminogen activators and cathepsin D [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Liu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] reported fragmentation of MBP following traumatic brain injury, and linked this to the protease calpain with a major cleavage site between Phe-and Lys of the peptide TQDENPVVHFF-–K. They reported the degradation of the 21.5 and 18.5kDa MBP-isoforms into N-terminal fragments of 10 and 8 kDa in the cortex. They also observed a similar degradation of the 17 and 14 kDa MBP-isoforms. Their identification was based on three matching tryptic peptides, two of which, DTGILDSIGR and TQDENPVVHFFK, were observed in our study. Ottens et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] reported significant proteolysis of the 21.5, 14.2, and 18.5 kDa isoforms in a traumatic brain injury model. Six predicted calpain fragments of MBP were described including a 12.6 kDa fragment which may be related to the 12.4 kDa MBP fragment identified in our fraction Q3. Another EAE study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] showed that the 18.5 and 14.2 kDa MBP isoforms were substantially degraded by calpain to 10 and 11 kDa fragments. Additionally, Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are reported to play a significant role in the fragmentation of MBP and demyelination leading to multiple sclerosis and EAE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The mechanisms of myelin breakdown in MS are not clearly established but degradation of MBP has been thought to be the initial step in the breakdown of myelin in demyelinating diseases. This hypothesis is supported by the degradation and loss of protein from MS plaque believed to be associated with increased activities of the proteolytic enzymes in demyelinating conditions such as MS and EAE.

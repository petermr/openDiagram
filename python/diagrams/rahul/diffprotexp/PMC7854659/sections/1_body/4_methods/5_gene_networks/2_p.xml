<p id="Par45">To shed light on the coordinated gene expression and identify the conditional regulatory relationships underlying the differences between RES and CON groups, a differential gene co-expression network analysis was performed by using the R-package DGCA v.1.0.2

 <italic>n</italic> = 11,432; liver, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10,146; and muscle, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11,439) were used. Significantly correlated gene pairs were determined based on the adjusted p-values (
 <italic>q</italic> ≤ 0.05). The DC gene pairs were grouped in one of the eight differential correlation classes proposed by McKenzie et al.

 </sup>. These classes (+/+ ; +/− ; +/0; − /− ; −/+ ; −/0; 0/+ ; 0/−) show the correlation signal [positive, negative, or not significant (0)] for each gene and condition when contrasting the groups (CON 
 <italic>versus</italic> RES).

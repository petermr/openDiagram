<p>Co-immunoprecipitation studies (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), together with the relative distribution of PcATP2 and PcCdc50A or PcCdc50B between P2 and P3 membrane fractions (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and detergent-solubilization screenings (Figure supplement 3, panels 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>) demonstrated that the yeast-produced PcATP2 is able to associate with both PcCdc50B and PcCdc50A, two of the three 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-encoded Cdc50 isoforms. This promiscuous capacity to associate with more than one Cdc50 β-subunit is known in other P4-ATPases [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although the physiological meaning of this dual interaction remains to be determined. We also found that 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>-expressed PcCdc50A was N-glycosylated (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the majority of PcCdc50B expressed in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> seemed not to contain N-glycosylation (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). N-glycosylation is a typical signature of Cdc50 proteins [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and its role seems to be organism-dependent. While in 
 <italic>Leishmainia infantum</italic> Cdc50 glycosylation affects the catalytic activity of the P4-ATPase/Cdc50 complex [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], N-glycosylation of the Cdc50 β-subunit of the human ATP8A2 is required to form a stable complex with the P4-ATPases, with no apparent role on its catalytic activity [
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>P. yoeli</italic> Cdc50A expressed in both gametocytes and ookinetes does not seem to be glycosylated as judged by the western blots bands ([
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Jing Yuan, personal communication). Clearly, due to its potential functional and/or stabilizing role, further studies to unravel the glycosylation state of Cdc50A and Cdc50B in the parasite are necessary.

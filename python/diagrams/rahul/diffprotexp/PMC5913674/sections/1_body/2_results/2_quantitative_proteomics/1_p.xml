<p>The complete datasets for each isogenic pair, including protein identification and quantitation results as well as label ratios and statistical test results, can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>. Peptide-to-spectrum matching was performed for all 3 isolates using the A1 subassemblage genome (WB C6, ATCC 50 803). This reference has few single-nucleotide polymorphisms relative to other sequences to date [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and has been previously used as a database for proteomic analysis of all 3 isolates with no significant differences in peptide identifications [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A nonredundant total of 1,571 proteins was identified across the TMT 10plexes analyzed, with 1,220, 1,126, and 1,060 proteins identified in 10plex 1–3, respectively (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).

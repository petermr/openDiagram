0: Proteins were loaded on a 12% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore).
1: Membrane was blocked for an hour with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer at room temperature and incubated at 4C with anti-Ca v3.3 antibody overnight (Alomone Labs, Cat# ACC-009, diluted 1:200 in 2.5% milk in TBST).
2: The membrane was subsequently washed with TBST and then incubated with anti-rabbit secondary with HRP for 1 h at room temperature (Abcam ab6721, diluted 1:1000 in TBST).
3: The washing was repeated and then the blot developed with chemiluminescent substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat#32,106).
4: The blot was then imaged using a Li-Cor Odyssey FC imaging system.
5: Signal intensity was normalized to actin, which was used as a loading control (Abcam ab8227, 1:2000).
6: Signal intensity was analyzed using ImageJ for comparisons.

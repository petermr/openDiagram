<p id="Par30">Modified Denka and CNT carbons were also tested in the composition of the electrodes and the electrochemical results of such cathodes are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI3</xref>. Despite water-soluble CNTs gave a small improvement of electrochemical performance at high C-rates, the modified VGCF remains the best choice for making the electrode for economic reasons.

0: A process flow chart of the preparation of submicron LLZNO powder and the sintering of LLZNO ceramics is showed in  Figure 1.
1: LLZNO powder was synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction [ 44].
2: Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOHH 2O, 98%, Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd., Shantou, China), lanthanum oxide (La 2O 3, 99.99%, Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), zirconia (ZrO 2, 99%, Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and niobium oxide (Nb 2O 5, 99.99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were used as the raw materials and 10 wt% excess of LiOHH 2O was added to compensate for the lithium loss in the high-temperature calcination and sintering process.
3: Yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ, 4~8 mm in diameter) and isopropanol (IPA) were used as the ball-grinding medium.
4: The ratio of raw material to grinding balls was 1:5 and the mixed raw material powder was wet-ball ground at 800 rpm in the planetary ball mill for 6 h. The mixture was dried at 70 C for 14 h, then calcined at 950 C for 12 h in an alumina crucible with ambient air to obtain the cubic-phase LLZNO powder.
5: LLZNO slurry was attrition milled (Shanghai ROOT mechanical and electrical equipment Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China, 0.7 L volume, 70% filling rate) at 1000 rpm for 2 h, taking YSZ (0.4 mm in diameter) and IPA as the grinding medium, and the solidliquid ratio was 1:5.
6: The LLZNO slurry was dried at 70 C for 14 h to obtain submicron LLZNO powder, from which green pellets (mass of 3 g, 19 mm in diameter and a thickness of about 4 mm) were pressed at 200 MPa under a cold uniaxial press.
7: After that, the green pellets were sintered in a muffle furnace (Changsha Yuandong Electric Furnace Factory) without mother powder at 11001200 C for 30360 min and then cooled down naturally.
8: At the same time, the green pellets were put on a platinum wire and placed in a crucible of MgO with the lid on to prevent impurity migration and a large amount of volatilization of lithium during the process of high-temperature sintering.
9: For further testing, LLZNO ceramic pellets were polished with 400 and 1000 mesh sandpaper.

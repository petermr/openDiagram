<p id="p0185">We investigated potential mechanisms of dysfunction of ketone body cycle in liver and skeletal muscle. We extracted the trans-omic subnetwork of fatty acid degradation pathway from the trans-omic networks in the liver and skeletal muscle according to information of “fatty acid degradation” (mmu00071) and “glycerolipid metabolism” (mmu00561) in the KEGG database (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kanehisa et al., 2017</xref>). TAG and DAG, which are intermediate lipids in the fatty acid degradation pathway, increased in the liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A), consistent with the previous findings (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Perfield et al., 2013</xref>). Nine enzymes were increased DEMEs in the liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, whereas 4 enzymes were the decreased DEMEs. Among the increased DEMEs, Acsl5, Acadm, Ecsh1, Hadh, Hsd17b4, and Acaa1b showed the increased expression at the transcript level by the increased DRTFs, 
 <italic>Pparg</italic>, 
 <italic>Srebf1</italic>, 
 <italic>Esr1</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klf4</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). Taken together, these results imply that fatty acid degradation pathway is potentially activated at enzyme level in the liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. In addition, there was some allosteric regulations by the DEMs such as ATP and GSH in the liver of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (3 activating and 4 inhibiting regulations) (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S12</xref>C). In skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, TAG was also identified as the increased DEM (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B), consistent with the previous finding (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mastrocola et al., 2015</xref>). All eight DEMEs increased in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>D), and of these increased DEMEs, Cpt2, Acadm, Acadl, Acadvl, and Ecsh1 have been previously reported to increase (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schönke et al., 2018</xref>). Expression of Hadhb and Acaa2 was regulated at the transcript level by the increased DRTFs such as 
 <italic>Nfatc2</italic> and 
 <italic>Egr1</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Acadm and Echs1 were identified as the increased DEMEs common both in the liver and skeletal muscle (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7B). These results suggest that the fatty acid degradation pathway is potentially activated at enzyme expression level both in liver and skeletal muscle.

<p id="Par5">This was a single-institution prospective observational study performed at the Texas Children’s Hospital Heart Center. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Baylor College of Medicine. All experiments were performed according to the guidelines approved by IRB. Since the subjects were minor, an informed consent was obtained from legal guardian/parent of each enrolled patients. We enrolled 13 neonates diagnosed with HLHS, between July 2016 and August 2017, who were scheduled for a Norwood procedure. Exclusion criteria involved patients with weight &lt; 3 kg at the time of surgery, a known prenatal chromosomal disorder, or gestational age &lt; 34 weeks.</p>

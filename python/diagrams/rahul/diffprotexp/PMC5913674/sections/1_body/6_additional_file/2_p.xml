<p>Supplementary Data S2: Functional annotation for differentially expressed proteins in MtzR lines. Supplementary for TMT1 (WB MtzS vs MtzR) is presented on the first tab, TMT2 (106 MtzS vs MtzR) is presented on the second tab and TMT3 (713 MtzS vs MtzR) is presented on the third tab. Each supplementary tab shows the functional annotation, including for GO, Interpro and SignalP for each of the DEPs which met 
 <italic>P</italic>-value and fold change cutoffs for differential expression in each MtzR lines. A significant 
 <italic>P</italic>-value (&lt;0.05) has been highlighted in yellow. Proteins above the upregulated fold change cutoff are highlighted in red, while proteins below the fold change for downregulation are highlighted in green.

<p>With the advances in synchrotron-based techniques, the set of tools available to researchers for studies of catalysts under working conditions is increasingly expanding. A prominent example includes photon-in/photon-out X-ray spectroscopies, which provide unique possibilities for probing electronic excitations in the material. By measuring the fluorescence spectrum at a fixed incident X-ray radiation energy, X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) data are collected. In the case where the incident energy exceeds that of the absorption edge, the XES spectrum provides information about the occupied electronic states in the material and yields complementary information to that from XAS (which probes the density of unoccupied states).

 </sup> Such nonresonant XES can be also used as a sensitive probe for the materials oxidation state.

 </sup> At the same time, when the energy of the incident radiation is just below the absorption edge, the excitation of the photoelectron is possible at the expense of the energy of the emitted X-ray photon through the so-called resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) process. By collecting XES data corresponding to the RIXS transitions, high energy resolution off-resonant spectroscopy (HEROS) probes the density of occupied states and provides information that is equivalent to that in a XAS spectrum. Nevertheless, it proposed an important advantage versus conventional XAS, namely that it can be collected with a much better time-resolution because there is no need to scan the incident energy.

 </sup> For instance, Szlachetko et al. used this approach to monitor changes in the oxidation state of Pt catalysts during CO oxidation with subsecond time resolution.

 </sup> Moreover, HEROS data do not suffer from self-absorption effects, which, as discussed above, plague XAS data acquisition in total fluorescence mode.

 </sup> Nevertheless, the disadvantage of the HEROS approach is its requirement of a very high photon flux due to the low probability of RIXS processes.

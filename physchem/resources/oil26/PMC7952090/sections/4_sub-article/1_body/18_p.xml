<p>However, we do have genomes from hyrax and manatee which allows us to identify gene duplicates in these lineages and determine which gene duplication events are ancestral and derived in each lineage. For example, a gene that is duplicated in all Proboscideans but not in either manatee or hyrax will be reconstructed as duplicated in the Proboscidean stem-lineage.</p>

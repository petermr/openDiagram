<p>To further support LE gene panel’s prognostic biomarker values in urogenital cancers, we analyzed the panel’s potential in the stratification of low and high mortality risk groups of papillary RCC (pRCC), the second common type of RCC [
 <xref rid="B59-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and bladder cancer. For this analysis, the SurvExpress website (

The program calculates a multigene panel risk score using the multivariate Cox system [
 <xref rid="B60-genes-12-00257" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] which is the system used here. The LE panel significantly separates low-risk and high-risk pRCC (

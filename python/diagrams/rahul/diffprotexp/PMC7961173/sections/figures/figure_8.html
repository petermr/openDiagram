 <caption> DCVC effect on principle proteins involved in ISR activation. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0 (control) or 20 μM DCVC for 12 h. Western blotting was used to measure eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 protein levels by a blot scanning system as described in the methods section. Graphical representation of: a relative eIF2α phosphorylation and b relative ATF4 protein concentrations normalized to total protein. Bars represent means ± SEM. Data were analyzed with student t-test. Asterisks indicate significant difference compared to control: * P &lt; 0.05. N = 4 independent experiment, with 3 replicates per treatment in each experiment. Representative western blot images for c eIF2α/eIF2α and d ATF4 (All western blots are included in Suppl Fig. 7) </caption>

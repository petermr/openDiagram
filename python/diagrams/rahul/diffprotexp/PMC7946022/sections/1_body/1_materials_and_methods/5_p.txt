0: Polymicrobial catheter infection mouse model.
1: The previously described rodent model [ 44, 45] was adopted, with modifications.
2: Mice were immunosuppressed by the addition of dexamethasome (Sparhawk Laboratories; Lenexa, KS) in drinking water at final concentration of 0.4 mg/L one day prior to infection, which was maintained throughout the study.
3: 58 fragments of polyurethane triple-lumen central venous catheters (1 or 0.5 cm in length) (Jorgensen Laboratories; Loveland, CO) were pre-coated overnight with fetal bovine serum (GibcoTM; Waltham, MA) at 37C.
4: Catheters were then inoculated with single or mixed-species cell suspensions of  S. aureus and/or  C. albicans in RPMI 1640-HEPES at final concentrations of 1  10 6 cells/ml for 90 mins at 37C to allow for microbial adhesion to catheters.
5: For each experimental set,  in vitro-infected catheters were processed for assessment of microbial recovery to confirm standardized microbial adherence to catheters prior to implantation.
6: For implantation in animals, following  in vitro infection, fragments were rinsed with PBS and kept on ice until implanted.
7: Mice were anesthesized by intraperitoneal injections (0.5 ml) of TBE solution (250 mg/kg body weight) and the dorsum was shaved; small incisions were aseptically made ( Figure 2a-i), and a subcutaneous tunnel created allowing for insertion of 58 pieces of catheters ( Figure 2a-ii).
8: Incisions were sealed using 3M VetbondTM tissue glue and lidocaine analgesic gel was applied to the incision area ( Figure 2a-iii).
9: Animals were placed in a supine position under a heating lamp and monitored until they recovered from anesthesia, and then daily for any developing clinical signs of distress.
10: Animals were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation and catheters were harvested individually.

0: It has been demonstrated that RSV infection increases expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human alveolar epithelial cells.
1: In a cotton rat ( Sigmodon hispidus) model RSV increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with the peak on day 5 [ 9].
2: Similarly, BRSV can increase COX-2 cellular expression in airway bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages of neonatal lambs ( Ovis aries) [ 10].
3: Increase of PGE2 and thromboxane B2 concentrations were reported in plasma and lung lavage of calves ( Bos taurus) infected with BRSV [ 11].
4: This makes COX-2 a good target for therapeutics, helping to minimize potential damage caused by excessive production of prostanoids and alleviate pathological consequences of BRSV and RSV infection.
5: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX inhibitors have the potential to diminish the prostanoid surges that follow RSV infection.
6: Pretreatment with NSAIDs or treatment at 24 hours post RSV inoculation decreases the histopathological changes in a cotton rat model [ 9].
7: Ibuprofen is one of the widely used COX inhibitors and has been proven to be safe to use in pediatric practice [ 12 14].
8: We have previously shown improved clinical scores, but increased viral load when ibuprofen was administered to calves experimentally infected with BRSV [ 15].

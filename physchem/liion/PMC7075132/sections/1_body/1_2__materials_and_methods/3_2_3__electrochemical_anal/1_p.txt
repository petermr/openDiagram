0: The working electrode was prepared by mixing the active materials, polyvinylidene fluoride binder, and conducting carbon (acetylene black, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in  N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone to form homogeneous slurry with a weight ratio of 8:1:1.
1: The slurry was doctor bladed on copper foil current collector and then dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The copper foil coated with the active materials was then stamped into the rounds with a diameter of 14 mm.
2: Electrochemical measurements were executed using the CR-2032-type coin cells which were assembled in a glove box (O 2 and H 2O contents< 1 ppm) filled with highly pure argon.
3: A pure lithium foil was used as the counter electrode, with the Celgard 2400 microporous polypropylene membrane (Celgard, 2400, 25 m in thickness, Charlotte, NC, USA) as the separator and 1 M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), with a volume ratio of 1:1 as electrolytes.
4: The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were carried out on a Neware battery measurement system (Neware Technology Ltd., Shenzhen, China).
5: The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were implemented on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China).
6: The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement was done with an electrochemical analyzer within a frequency range of 10 50.01 Hz.

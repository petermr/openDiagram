<p>Cultured neonatal mouse and rat microglia, as well as acutely isolated microglia from mouse brain or tissue printed microglia from rat brain have been shown to express K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 currents by whole-cell patch-clamp that increase substantially following 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> intracerebroventricular injection with the TLR-4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14–18</xref>]. Stimulation with the gram-negative cell wall component LPS is widely used to induce a “classically” activated “M1-like” state of microglia simulating general inflammation like would be associated with a bacterial infection [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the field of neuroimmunology LPS stimulated microglia should ideally be called M(LPS) microglia based on the stimulus used to induce polarization to avoid using the M1/M2 terminology, which is regarded as oversimplified [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but nevertheless widely used because of its therapeutic attractiveness. Following stimulation with LPS increased K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 expression can be observed at the mRNA level and at the protein level by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and as increased current density measured by whole-cell patch-clamp [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref>]. A similar, but slightly less intense increase in Kv1.3 expression occurs when cultured neonatal microglia are stimulated with oligomeric amyloid-β (AβO) or α-synuclein [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], two proteins that are misfolded and aggregated in Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, and which are often used to create an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model of microglia responses associated with the respective disease.

0: The flow SA--Galactosidase assay was adapted from [ 8].
1: In brief, SY5Y-inducible cell lines were treated with 1 g/mL doxycycline for the indicated time before being subjected to PI staining or flow SA--Gal assay.
2: For the flow SA--Gal assay, sub-confluent cells were first treated with 100 nmol/L bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) for 1 h in fresh DMEM plus 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics medium at 37 C, 5% CO 2.
3: A final concentration of 33 mol/L DDAOG (Setareh Biotech Eugene, OR, USA) was added to the medium for an extra 2 h of incubation.
4: The cell monolayer was then washed twice with room-temperature PBS and harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation at 200  g for 10 at 4 C. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS at a concentration of 1  10 6 cells/mL and run immediately on BDCalibar.
5: Data were collected and analyzed using CellQuest following the instructions of the manufacturers manual.

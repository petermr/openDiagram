<p>Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide, with 12,990 new cases and 4120 cancer deaths reported in the United States in 2016.

 </xref> The development of cervical cancer is a multi‐step biological process initiated by a series of genetic and transcriptional changes. Cervical cancer in early stages is overwhelmingly likely to be cured through a combined treatment of surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In contrast, options for patients in late stages involve alternative treatment such chemo‐radiotherapy, with a poor prognosis.

 </xref> Therefore, diagnosing cervical cancer at an early stage allows for effective treatment and substantially improves outcomes. In nearly all cases, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the primary risk factor for the development of cervical cancer, and HPV16 and HPV18 account for 70% of cervical cancer and precancerous cervical lesions.

 </xref> Although routine Pap smears and HPV tests have largely improved the outcome of cervical cancer in developed countries, in many developing areas, the disease is often not identified until advanced stages.

 </xref> Furthermore, HPV tests have low specificity for cervical cancer because many HPV infections are transient and are not prone to malignant transformation.

 </xref> Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC‐Ag) is used clinically to predict squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); however, it lacks specificity for cervical cancer.

 </sup> In the cobalt boride sample, the Co K-edge EXAFS data of the as-prepared sample were dominated by metallic Co, with a relatively weak contribution of Co–B bonds.

 </sup> However, the expanded interatomic distances detected confirmed the presence of the boride. Nevertheless, CoO

 </sub> species were detected by XPS on the catalyst surface after OER. However, since these measurements were done 
 <italic>ex situ</italic>, reoxidation of the catalyst could not be excluded. For the Ni boride system, the contribution of metal-B bonds could be significantly enhanced with increasing annealing temperature,

 <italic>Operando</italic> XAS measurements for this sample carried out at 1.7 V revealed that the oxidation state of Ni increases from ∼2+ to ∼3+. In addition, the contribution of Ni–B to the EXAFS spectra was not affected by the exposure to the reaction conditions, while the contribution of the oxide phase changed (the corresponding Ni–O and Ni–Ni CNs were reduced), suggesting structural transformations involving an increase in the disorder and transformation of the original Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>-like phase to the active NiOOH (

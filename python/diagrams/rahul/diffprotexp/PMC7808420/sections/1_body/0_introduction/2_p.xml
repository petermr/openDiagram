<p>Fluctuant reports of outbreaks or clusters of SLEV-related encephalitis are registered annually in Americas, where SLEV is endemic [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>].The largest epidemic of St. Louis encephalitis occurred in the central states of the United States in 1975 recording nearly 2,000 cases of neurological disease [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SLEV incidence is likely underestimated, as symptoms are usually mild and disease undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as other endemic arboviral illnesses, such as Dengue fever, West Nile encephalitis or Zika fever [

 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>]. SLEV biology and disease pathogenesis is not completely understood and there is no specific diagnostic tool or treatment for St Louis encephalitis, besides intensive care [

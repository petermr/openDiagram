<p id="par0075">Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as explained in above section. We have used diluted cDNA (100 ng μL
 <sup>−1</sup>) for qRT-PCR reactions. Oligo’s for the qRT-PCR was designed using Genefisher2 software. We selected heat-responsive transcription factors - 
 <italic>HSFA6e</italic> (acc. no. KU291394.1), 
 <italic>WRKY</italic> (acc. no. KU562861.1), HSPs - 
 <italic>HSP17</italic> (acc. no. JN572711.1), 
 <italic>HSP26</italic> (acc. no. AF097659.1)], antioxidant enzymes – 
 <italic>SOD</italic> (acc. no. AF092524.1), 
 <italic>POX</italic> (acc. no. AF005087.1) and starch biosynthesis pathway linked genes – ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (large subunit; acc. no. KC347594.1), soluble starch synthase gene (acc. no. KJ854903.1) for the expression analysis (Table S3). The samples were used in triplicates for the expression analysis. The expression was performed following the protocol as mentioned in Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We have used β-actin gene (acc. no. AB181991.1) for normalizing the C
 <sub>t</sub> value. Further, Pfaffl method [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used for calculating the relative fold expression of the genes.

<p>To analyze whether PirB protein induces apoptosis in hemocytes, primary shrimp hemocytes were treated with rPirB. Briefly, hemocytes collected from shrimp hemolymph were cultured at 28°C for 2 h, before being treated for 4 h at 28°C with 0.1 µM rPirB, PBS (negative control), or apoptosis inducer A (positive control) (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Next, cells were collected and stained with Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide apoptosis detection kit (Beyotime biotechnology, Shanghai, China) followed by flow cytometry analysis using an Accuri C6 plus flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, SanDiego, USA) based on 10,000 events recorded on the dot plot.</p>

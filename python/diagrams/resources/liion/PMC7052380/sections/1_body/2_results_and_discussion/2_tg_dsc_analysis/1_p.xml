<p>TG-DSC measurement data is used to estimate the graphene and carbon content in the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/carbon composites, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The pure LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> can be completely oxidized to Li
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> under air flow, and the total weight gain is about 5.07% in theory (Belharouak et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Bai et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). For LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/carbon composites, in the temperature range of 400–600°C, the graphene and carbon are oxidized to CO
 <sub>2</sub> gas, so the amounts of graphene and carbon in the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/carbon composites are about 1.40 and 10.70%, respectively.

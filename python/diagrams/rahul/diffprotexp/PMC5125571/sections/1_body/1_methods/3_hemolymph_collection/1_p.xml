<p>Prior to hemolymph collection, the snail shell was cleaned with 70% ethyl alcohol and snails were then soaked for 20 min in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and 200 units/ml of penicillin to eliminate potential microorganism contamination. Hemolymph samples were collected by stimulation of the head-foot region of the snail as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Briefly, the head-foot was punctured with a needle resulting in the retraction of the head-foot into the shell and subsequent leakage of hemolymph. The hemolymph was collected using a micropipette and transferred to a new tube on ice to avoid hemocyte aggregation. The hemolymph samples from 100 snails of each replicate and time point were pooled, centrifuged at 3,500 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C to pellet hemocytes, and the resulting plasma (supernatant) was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and supplemented with EDTA-Free SigmaFAST Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Sigma) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Pellet containing the hemocytes was washed twice with cold PBS, centrifuged at 3,500 
 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min at 4°C. Plasma and hemocytes were kept at -80°C until processed. Whole soft bodies of all snails were subsequently examined for infection by PCR [

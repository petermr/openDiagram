<p>The present work has reported the effect of process parameters of laser surface hardening of AISI 4130 steel. The metallurgical analyses showed that the hardened zone was a mixture of martensitic and ferritic phases with retained austenite. Moreover, a finite element model was utilized to simulate the temperature distribution in the heat treatment direction and to calculate the heat-treated zone. The FEM simulation was satisfactory.</p>

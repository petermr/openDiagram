<p>The addition of ι-carrageenan (which possesses two sulfate groups per galactan unit) to poly (vinyl alcohol) leads to the formation of entirely miscible blends, which were used to obtain hydrogels by cryogelation (applying five alternate freezing and thawing cycles). Poly (vinyl alcohol) and carrageenan are entirely compatible in the amorphous domains, and to a limited extent, in the crystalline domains, forming mixed crystallite associations with lower diameters than in the case of the pure polymers. These traits, alongside the reasonably high gel contents, are responsible for the hydrogels’ excellent stability in aqueous environments with pH values between 3 and 7.3.</p>

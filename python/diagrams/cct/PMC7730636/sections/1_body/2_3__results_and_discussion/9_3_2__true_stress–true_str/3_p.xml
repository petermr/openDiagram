<p>Based on Equation (14), a dependence was created (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f011">Figure 11</xref>a), from which the parameter 
 <italic>n</italic> was determined as the average of the reciprocal values of linear fittings (
 <italic>n =</italic> 3.564). The activation energy value 
 <italic>Q</italic> is determined based on the graphical dependence shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f011">Figure 11</xref>b. The average value of the activation energy for the material AISI 4340 was calculated 
 <italic>Q =</italic> 314 kJ/mol. This value is lower compared to [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], where the value 
 <italic>Q</italic> = 427 kJ/mol was obtained, where the values of flow stresses were not corrected by the effect of friction during compression. On the contrary, a lower value of activation energy, 
 <italic>Q</italic> = 281.28 kJ/mol, was obtained by the authors [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], where, however, this value was determined by expression for determining the activation energy as a function of chemical composition developed by [
 <xref rid="B45-materials-13-05585" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This calculation was created for general use for low-alloy steels and therefore does not provide as accurate results as the values of the activation energy obtained from the measured flow stresses.

<p>Two strategies are routinely employed in current proteomics-based approaches for biomarker discovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The first characterizes differential protein expression patterns by comparing serum/plasma from animal models or patients with samples from normal controls. The second compares diseased tissues/cells with their normal counterparts. Despite the unique advantages of the first strategy, the extremely complexity of blood presents a significant challenge for the detection of useful potential biomarkers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Disease-specific proteins can be characterized relatively more easily by the second strategy. However, most of these proteins remain within the cell and do not enter the bloodstream, which makes them unavailable for measurement via routine blood assays in a clinical setting.

<p id="Par5">Ideally, the heat treatment process is monitored, so that temperature at a certain heating stage or the time dependent temperature of each workpiece is logged, stored, and transferable for quality control and simulations. Often however, this is not the case. On top of that, if the heat treatment process also involves moving workpieces or induction coils, they may obscure line of sight for ad hoc pyrometer measurements and make instrumentation of samples impossible.</p>

   <bold>Increased SLEV replication in ABR
    <sup>−/-</sup> mouse brains leads to increased cytokine production
   </bold>. WT and ABR
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice were inoculated intracranially with 10
   <sup>2</sup> PFU of SLEV and euthanized on day 3 p.i. Brain samples were processed and assessed for viral load, by RT-qPCR (a), and for the expression of IL-1β, CCL5, CXCL1 and IFNγ, by ELISA (b-f). Results are expressed as relative number of SLEV genome copies per brain sample (A), or as picograms per 100 mg of brain homogenate (b-e). Data are representative of two independent experiments (n = 4–8). *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 relative to the infected WT group. Mock – uninfected mice inoculated with saline

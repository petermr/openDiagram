 <p> Germination percentages of T. aestivum, R. sativus, S. lycopersicum and T. foenum-graecum seedlings. (○) seeds treated with SoEO, (♦) seeds untreated with SoEO. The values in the graphs represent the mean of twenty fives replications ± standard error. Comparison of treated and untreated seeds by SoEO yielded a significant interaction (p &lt; 0.01) between tested species and conditions (with or without SoEO). </p>)

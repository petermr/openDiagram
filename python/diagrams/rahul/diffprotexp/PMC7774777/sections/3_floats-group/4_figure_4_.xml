  <p>Raloxifene delays disease progression in female G93 SOD1 mice. (A) Grip strength/body weight measurements recoded from female G93A mice treated with either 10 mg of raloxifene (n = 10) slow-release pellet, or placebo (n = 7) control. Days indicate days since implantation. Data are shown as mean + standard error of the mean. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. (B) Kaplan–Meyer curve indicating the time at which each mouse in panel A lost more than 25% of initial grip strength. Days indicate days since implantation. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. (C) Grip strength/ body weight measurements recoded from female NTG mice treated with either 10 mg of raloxifene (n = 7) or placebo (n = 8). (D) Kaplan–Meyer curve indicating the time at which each mouse in panel C lost more than 25% of initial grip strength. (E) Grip strength/ body weight measurements recoded from male G93A SOD1 mice treated with either 15 mg raloxifene (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11). (F) Kaplan–Meyer curve indicating the time at which each mouse in panel E lost more than 25% of initial grip strength. (G) Grip strength/body weight measurements recoded from male NTG mice treated with either 15 mg raloxifene (n = 12) or placebo (n = 8). (D) Kaplan–Meyer curve indicating the time at which each mouse in panel G lost more than 25% of initial grip strength.

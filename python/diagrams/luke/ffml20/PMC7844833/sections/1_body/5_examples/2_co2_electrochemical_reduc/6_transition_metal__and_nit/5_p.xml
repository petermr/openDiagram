 </sup> In particular, in the case of Co-based TMNC catalysts, Wang et al. demonstrated that the Co–N coordination number can be controlled by changing the pyrolysis temperature, where the decomposition of Co–N bonds in Co molecular precursors at elevated temperatures resulted in reduced Co–N coordination numbers and enhanced CO selectivity. The Co–N coordination number can be increased back to 4 under treatment in a NH
 <sub>3</sub> atmosphere, resulting also in a suppressed CO selectivity.

 </sup> Similar relation between the synthesis temperature, EXAFS M-N coordination numbers, and CO selectivity in Cu-based TMNCs was reported by Zheng et al.

 </sup> Koshy et al., however, interpreted the increase of the CO selectivity in Ni-based TMNCs with increasing pyrolysis temperature by the encapsulation of Ni clusters with graphite. These clusters that may coexist with Ni–N
 <sub>4</sub> structural motifs in the materials, catalyze the competing HER reaction; thus, the restriction of electrolyte access to them improves the overall selectivity of the catalyst toward CO production.

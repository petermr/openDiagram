0: Gels (six in total) were stained using Pierce Silver Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
1: The stained gels were scanned using an image scanner (UMAX, Dallas, TX, USA) at 600 dpi.
2: All detected spots were automatically matched by gel-to-gel comparison using the PDquest software version 8.0 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
3: Areas of all detected spots were normalized.
4: Those protein spots with reproducible and statistically significant changes in abundance were considered to be differentially expressed.
5: Only those spots with quantitative changes >1.5-fold in abundance,  p value< 0.05, were considered for subsequent analyses.

<p>Furthermore, in order to obtain wet interfacial contact of SCE with cathode and anode, tiny liquid electrolyte or ionic liquid (less than 5 µL) was often dropped onto the interface between electrode and solid electrolyte, which can completely reduce the interfacial impedance and achieve high‐efficient ion‐transport at interface. Ma et al.
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">116</xref> developed a novel cellulose acetate/PEG/LATP (CPL) and constructed viscoelastic and nonflammable interface by adding 2.5 µL ionic liquids to both sides of CPL, which successfully solves the contact issue of CPL with both cathode and anode, sluggish kinetic process, and lithium dendrite growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1507-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>g). The similar strategy is put forward to prepare a novel SCEs consisting of PEO, LLZTO, and slight ionic liquid ([BMIM]TF

 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0117" ref-type="ref">117</xref> The ionic liquid can wet the interface of SCEs with both cathode and anode and thus decreases the interface impedance while maintaining the SCEs as solid‐state membranes. The well wetted membrane electrolyte shows a conductivity of 2.2 × 10

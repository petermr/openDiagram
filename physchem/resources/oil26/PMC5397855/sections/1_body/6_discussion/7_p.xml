<p>The repellency test indicated that garlic essential oil and diallyl disulfide has a greater effect on 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> behavior than diallyl sulfide had little effect. Odor produced from volatile compounds was repulsive to larvae and adults of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> and was observed during early hours to finished bioassay. Monosulfides, disulfides, and trisulfide breakdown products of the thiosulfinates are volatile compounds and toxic to insect herbivores

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. These compounds are garlic majority compounds and toxic to pests of stored products such as 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> and 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Garlic essential oil has high percentage of diallyl disulfide as main volatile compound and repellent properties to 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> and 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Our results suggest that garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl sulfide have high activities of behavioral deterrence against 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic>, as evaluated by the behavioral responses of larvae and adults to different odor sources and the number of insects repelled, indicating their potential to the pest control in stored products.

0: Three adult male cats (B, S and G) were trained to perform a left forelimb reach-retrieve task.
1: The target was a Perspex tube (diameter 3 cm) placed at eye level at a comfortable reaching height and distance (approximately 20 cm) in front of the animal 30.
2: Reaches were cued by an opaque vertical covering on the Perspex tube which was operated manually by the researchers when the cat was attending to the door and had the reaching limb resting on the ground.
3: The time taken between the door opening and the paw lift-off was considered the reaction time.
4: The reach duration was also recorded as the time between the paw lift-off and entry into the tube, detected by infra-red beams.
5: Reaches were always positively rewarded with a fish morsel within the Perspex tube and no negative training or food restriction was used.
6: Video recordings of the behaviour were made using webcams running at 30 fps, synchronised with the neural data acquisition using the open source software Bonsai 31.
7: These videos were assessed offline to classify reaches (see below).

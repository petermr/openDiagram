<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To examine habituation, we modeled use of the enrichment over the eight-week study period using data aggregated by night rather than individual observations. For these GLMM, we used time in the study (two-week period from beginning of study; four periods in total) as a categorical variable, because the change in enrichment use from week to week did not follow a consistent, linear pattern. We used four two-week periods so that each aardvark had received all the enrichment once in each of the two habitats as an additional control for the impact of habitat on enrichment use. For fixed factors in these models, we used categorical time in the study, enrichment goal or specific enrichment item and the interaction of enrichment and time. We used the same random slope terms previously described and a variance components covariance structure. </p>

<p>A possible mechanism to explain the current findings is to assume that the system attains a quasi-equilibrium between two metastable phases during cooling. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> depicts the schematic binary phase diagram for the present alloy system. The green solid lines indicate the equilibrium phase diagram. Next to the complex mixture of equilibrium phases (e.g.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> Be
 <sub>2</sub>Zr and Cu
 <sub>10</sub>Zr
 <sub>7</sub>) at Cu-Co-Be-rich compositions, only β-Ti and the liquid phase have to be considered. As observed for most glass-forming Zr/Ti-based alloys

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, the present system is a eutectic one. Besides the equilibrium lines, the red dotted lines belonging to a metastable phase diagram are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>. The left two red dashed lines describe the temperatures at which nucleation of β-Ti or the other crystalline phases (Be
 <sub>2</sub>Zr and Cu
 <sub>10</sub>Zr
 <sub>7</sub>) sets in. The degree of undercooling for a given composition is then determined by the temperature difference between the equilibrium liquidus line and the metastable liquidus line. For higher cooling rates, the degree of undercooling will increase and thus the red dashed liquidus lines will shift to lower temperatures. The red dotted line at high Ti concentrations reflects the solubility of Cu, Co and Be in β-Ti during fast cooling. Quenching of metallic melts generally results in supersaturation by solute trapping at the early stages of crystallization

<p>RSV has previously been found to inhibit breast cancer cells by hindering the proliferation of breast cancer cells through its cell cycle and inducing apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Moreover, RSV possesses abrogate stemness properties and can reduce the expression of self-renewal signaling molecules in stem-like breast cancer cells (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, its anti-cancer mechanism on TNBC has not been clarified. In this study, 
 <italic>via</italic> CCK8 experiments, the survival rates of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A were observed to gradually decrease following treatment with different concentrations of RSV, indicating that RSV can inhibit the survival of TNBC cells. By comparing the survival rates of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A treated by different concentrations of RSV, 50 Î¼M was identified to be the optimal concentration of RSV, and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with this concentration were extracted for RNA sequencing.

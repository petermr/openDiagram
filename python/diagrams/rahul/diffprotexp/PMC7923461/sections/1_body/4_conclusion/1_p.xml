<p id="Par56">In conclusion, this is the first report to prove that TUBA1C is a new marker of LUAD. This work further proved that TUBA1C played a pivotal role in the cell cycle and immune microenvironment of LUAD. By further understanding its range of functions, we can make TUBA1C an effective biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of LUAD.</p>

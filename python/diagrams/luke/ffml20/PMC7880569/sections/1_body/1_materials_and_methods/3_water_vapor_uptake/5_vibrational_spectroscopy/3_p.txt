0: Centrifuged wet pastes of birnessite were deposited on a diamond window of an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell (Golden Gate, single-bounce).
1: They were dried with a heat gun to 110 C, then to a hot stream of dry N 2(g), and then covered with a lid enabling the passage of a flow of 250 mL/min N 2(g) over the sample set to 25 C. FTIR spectra were collected during the drying period to monitor the loss of water until the intensities of the OH stretching and bending bands became constant.
2: Accordingly, exposure of our sample to 0.4% RH, our driest N 2(g) gas at 25  1 C, revealed residual levels of intercalated water ( Figure S6).
3: See the  Supplementary Section for additional experiments providing information on the conditions necessary for fully removing these most recalcitrant water molecules from birnessite ( Figure S7).

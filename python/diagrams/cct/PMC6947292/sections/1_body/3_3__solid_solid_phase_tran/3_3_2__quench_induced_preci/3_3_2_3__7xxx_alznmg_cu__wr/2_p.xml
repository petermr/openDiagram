<p>The in situ cooling DSC experiments shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f049">Figure 49</xref> cover four orders of magnitude and thereby an extreme dynamic DSC. The slowest cooling at 0.0003 K/s requires a cooling duration of &gt;17 days, while the fastest cooling 3 K/s is completed within 2.5 min. Furthermore, DFSC was performed for this alloy, extending the investigated scanning rate range to some hundreds of K/s. Thus, the fastest cooling was achieved in times of less than 1 s.

 </sup>. These studies noted shift in metabolic fingerprinting related to protein metabolism from baseline to immediately after cardiac surgery. When comparing non-survivors to survivors, Davidson et al. found differences in nicotinamide and aspartate metabolism to be associated with poor outcomes. Interestingly, tight glycemic control did not alter the metabolic and inflammatory profile in these patients

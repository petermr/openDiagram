<p id="Par19">Through gene expression, our evaluation of patient condition drafted a dynamic map over time. Coincidentally, most samples obtained from critical patients during hospital admission belonged to Cluster 1. The expression classification of three survivors (P085, P086 and P087) changed from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2 during longitudinal analysis, which may be a crucial factor contributing to their survival (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of temporal changes during Cluster 1-to-2 transition provided three major insights, including acute inflammation response, protein catabolism (especially autophagy and mitophagy), and ferroptosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). Immunological response was one of the most important pathways, while autophagy genes were up-regulated in Cluster 1-to-2 transition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). Although critical COVID-19 patients who suffer from multiple organ dysfunction may exhibit dysregulation of many pathways, our research showed that activation of autophagy likely plays a central role in the prognosis of critical COVID-19 patients. Thus, effective therapies targeting the autophagy pathway may be promising therapeutic methods for COVID-19 patients [

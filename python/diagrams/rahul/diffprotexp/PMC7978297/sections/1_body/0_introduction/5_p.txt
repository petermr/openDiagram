0: The current study set out to characterize the molecular mechanism of the toxic effects of DEHP exposure on PF assembly, at a daily dose of 40 g/kg body weight DEHP through oral administration to pregnant mice at 16.5 dpc.
1: Subsequently, the DEHP-treated ovaries at PD0 (PD0-DEHP) and PD3 (PD3-DEHP) were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using a 10 Genomics platform.
2: At a single-cell level, the toxicity of DEHP exposure to PF assembly was further investigated, and compared to previously reported normal murine developmental ovarian datasets at PD0 and PD3  49.

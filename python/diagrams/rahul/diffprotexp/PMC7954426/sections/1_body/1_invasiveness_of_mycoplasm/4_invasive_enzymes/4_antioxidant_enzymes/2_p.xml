<p>Ohr is also a type of anti-oxidative stress molecule identified in mycoplasmas in recent years, which belongs to the OsmC superfamily, and has been involved in resistance to oxidative stress damage. Ohr molecules exist in various mycoplasmas, such as 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> (MPN668), 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> (MG_454), and 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> (MGA1142) [
 <xref rid="cit0150" ref-type="bibr">150–153</xref>]. MPN668, MGA1142, and MG_454 are novel Ohr proteins with hydroperoxidase activity on both inorganic and organic hydroperoxides, but MGA1142 preferentially degrades linear organic peroxide. MGA1142 transcription is upregulated under ethanol and downregulated under osmotic stress conditions, whereas MG_454 is strongly induced by osmotic shock and heat shock [

 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> MG_427 is an OsmC-like protein that is endowed with hydroperoxide reductase activity, but its transcription is downregulated under osmotic shock and ethanol conditions [
 <xref rid="cit0152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]; therefore, its physiological function requires further study.

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par20">In summary, the genetic analyses defined a 1921-kb region defined in the AM panel (23.106 to 25.027 Mbp), extended proximally to 25.236 Mbp by the proximal end of the MAGIC peak region. This combined interval of 2129&#160;kb contains 108 predicted genes in the ToxB-insensitive variety &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; (Supplementary Table 5). Within the interval, the most significant SNPs from the AM panel and the MAGIC population were all located within gene model TraesCS2B01G048500, a glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase located at 24.092 Mbp. Additional SNPs identified in the AM panel were contained within the interval: hit 6 (GENE-1343_556) originates from TraesCS2B01G048700 which encodes an arginase while hit 12 (Kukri_c63748_1453) is predicted to encode a cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1. The wheat gene controlling sensitivity to the <italic>Ptr</italic> effector ToxA encodes a protein kinase NBS-LRR protein (Faris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>). A gene model predicted to encode an NBS-LRR protein is located within the 2129-kb &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; region identified here (TraesCS2B01G050500). However, TraesCS2B01G050500 does not show high sequence similarity to <italic>Tsn1</italic>. Additionally, gene model TraesCS2B01G051200 annotated as an <italic>MLO-</italic>like gene, was located towards the distal end of the MAGIC QTL peak. Several additional disease resistance pathway genes were located just outside the <italic>Tsc2</italic> interval, including an <italic>NBS-LRR</italic> gene from which hits 9 and 13 originated (TraesCS2B01G045700), and surrounded by a wider cluster of seven additional NBS-LRR genes.</p>

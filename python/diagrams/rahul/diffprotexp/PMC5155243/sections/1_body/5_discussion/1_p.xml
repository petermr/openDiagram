<p>DU is employed extensively in civil and military activities. The kidney is the target organ of DU intoxication. Investigation of the mechanism underlying DU intoxication and the search for effective preventive measures deserve considerable attention worldwide. Previous studies

The proteomics approach applied in this study identified a total 13 differentially expressed proteins based on a greater than 2-fold difference in expression and a Mascot search score higher than 64. These proteins included ezrin, ACY-3, ETHE1, transthyretin, ATP synthase-coupling factor 6, phosphotriesterase–related protein, λ-crystallin homolog, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, propionyl-CoA carboxylase α chain, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sarcosine dehydrogenase, N(G), N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1, and SOD. The functions of these proteins are mainly related to sugar and fatty acid metabolism, electron transport in the respiratory chain, and the anti-oxidative defence system. These results provide new clues for exploration of MT protection from DU.

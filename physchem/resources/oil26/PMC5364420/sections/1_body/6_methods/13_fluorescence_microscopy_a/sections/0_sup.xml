<sup>8</sup>&#8201;CFU/mL were harvested by centrifugation at 6000&#8201;&#215;&#8201;g for 5&#8201;min and stained for 15&#8201;min with the equal volume of 1&#8201;mg/mL PI in the dark at room temperature. Ten microliters of the stained bacterial suspensions were dropped onto glass slides and covered with coverslips, and images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMi8).

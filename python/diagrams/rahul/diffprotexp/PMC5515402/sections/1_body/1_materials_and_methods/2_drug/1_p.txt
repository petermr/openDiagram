0: A 2D-DIGE experiment was performed using four independent biological replicates per treatment (Control: n = 4; AAS: n = 4).
1: Before AAS exposure, cells were grown in steroid-free serum (Hyclone Waltham, MA) during the log-phase growth (7080% confluency).
2: Thereafter, four (4) samples were treated with a supraphysiological dose of the AAS, 17-methyltestosterone (17-meT: 1 M; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 48 h as previously described [ 27].
3: Control samples were treated with vehicle (30% cyclodextrin in 0.9% saline; Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
4: 17-meT was chosen as the presence of the C17 methyl group reduces its aromatization to 17-estradiol [ 28], and inhibits aromatization [ 29, 30].
5: As the normal level of testosterone in male serum is 1 X 10 8 M (0.01 M) [ 31, 32], the regimen used in our experiment (1 M for 48 h) [ 27] reflects a chronic supraphysiological dose.
6: Cell viability after AAS exposure was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay as previously described with some modifications [ 33].

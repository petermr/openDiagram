0: After the miRNA reads were quality checked, clean reads were used to calculate the abundance of miRNAs which were recorded as TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million).
1: We first divided the read counts by the length of each gene in kilobases (RPK).
2: Next, we counted up all the RPK values in a sample and divided this number by 1,000,000.
3: The DEGseq R language package in conjunction with a perl script were used to compare sample expression differences and the logarithm of relative changes in log base 2 taken; after comparing with the  p-value by fisher test, an FDR adjustment was performed.

<p id="p0030">Fluoxetineâ€™s well-established safety profile and its inhibition of IL6 signal transduction suggests that this drug may be advantageous when used early in COVID-19 infection to prevent or reduce the cytokine storm. Evidence supporting this hypothesis can be found across multiple animal models of disease whereby fluoxetine not only reduced IL6 signaling cascades but also prevented end organ damage

In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis model of hyperinflammatory illness, pretreatment with fluoxetine outperformed pretreatment with corticosteroids and resulted in diminished end organ damage that included decreased incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension, decreased pulmonary arterial muscularization, and decreased extracellular matrix remodeling

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Fluoxetine has also demonstrated inhibition of NF-kappaB with corresponding decreases in inflammatory cytokines like IL6 in models of septic shock and allergic asthma, as well as in patients with depression

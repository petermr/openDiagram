0: Since D1R- and D2R-MSNs, as with many other of the 5001000 types of neurons and glia, exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression [ 12, 13], it is essential to develop complementary approaches to enable quantitative MS/proteomic analyses of specific neuronal cell types and their organelles and sub-cellular compartments.
1: These approaches will further our understanding of changes in protein expression or localization, as well as of differential post-translational protein modifications by obviating dilution effects from analyzing multiple cell types together and by improving signal to noise ratios for proteins in the targeted cell type [ 10, 11].
2: Isolation of specific neural cell types is challenging due to their nonuniformity, intermingling, and complex projections to different brain regions.
3: Two approaches that are being used to address this challenge are laser capture microdissection (LCM) [ 14], and fluorescence-activated cell (FACS) [ 15, 16, 17] and nuclear (FANS) [ 18, 19, 20] sorting in conjunction with transgenic and viral tools to isolate cell type- and organelle-specific proteomes.
4: A central feature of many of these methods is the use of transgenic mouse lines that express fluorescent proteins as affinity tags on specific proteins in specific neuronal cell types.
5: These include Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) lines that were designed to profile mRNA translation in defined cell types [ 21, 22] and that allow isolation of nuclei from specific cell types using FANS [ 18].
6: TRAP analyses revealed that dMSNs expressing the D1R have vastly different translational profiles than the iMSNs that express the D2R [ 21].
7: Moreover, FANS analyses demonstrated that cocaine induces a significantly different pattern of histone modification in these two populations of mouse MSNs [ 18].

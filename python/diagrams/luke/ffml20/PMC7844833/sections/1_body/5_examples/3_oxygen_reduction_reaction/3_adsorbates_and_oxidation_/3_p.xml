<p>At lower potentials (ca. 0 V vs RHE and more negative), the WL intensity decreases, corresponding to a more metallic state of Pt. Additionally, a widening and an increase in the WL skewness is observed, which are attributed to the adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface and the photoelectron transitions to the antibonding Pt–H orbitals.

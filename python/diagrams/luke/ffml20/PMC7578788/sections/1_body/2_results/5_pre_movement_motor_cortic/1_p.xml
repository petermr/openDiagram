<p id="Par34">Analyses of the motor cortical LFP signals in two of the three adult male cats revealed a similar adaptation related effect to that observed in the human data (i.e. decreased beta power in Early Adaptation), with an opposing effect in cat C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In all three animals, a bootstrapped (n = 1000) General Linear Model, including reaction time and reach duration as covariates, found a significant effect of adaptation epoch (cat A: F(4,590) = 24.162, p &lt; 0.0005. Cat B: F(4,528) = 11.380, p &lt; 0.0005. Cat C: F(4,443) = 6.577, p &lt; 0.0005). Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons confirmed that the baseline-Early adaptation change in all three animals was significant (cat A; p = 0.011, cat B; p = 0.006, cat C; p = 0.001), and the Early adaptation-Late adaptation changes were also significant for cats B and C (cat A; p = 0.749, cat B; p = 0.007, p = 0.001).

<p id="Par2">The modern age revolutionized the foundation of a new era of molecular polymers i.e. polymeric dendrimers. The nanostructured polymers are repetitively bifurcated morphological spherical molecules with distinguishing chemical elegance, pertaining to flexible, versatile and promising molecular representatives

 </sup>. The polymers are constructed via a repetitive successive process based primarily on two different approaches: the divergent

 </sup>. Former one deals with the addition of monomers to the core forming layers and the later one starts from the periphery to the core. Since the initial reports of dendrimers various systems have been reported and received widespread attention. In addition, due to structural and chemical diversity, they have produced several opportunities for modification. They have come up as an excellent platform for terminal attachment of multiple close-packed functionalities, as well as cavities around the focal core permit various opportunities

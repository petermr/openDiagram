<p id="Par16">The resulting distribution shows the temperature envelope, i.e. the maximum reached throughout the process, along the path shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>. While the surface temperature was dialled in to the assumed 1050 °C, it’s envelope was found to be too hight for the observed internal transformation depths. Assuming a linear scaling of the entire distribution, it was fitted to the measured depth of phase transitions and their associated temperatures minimizing the sum of squared residuals. This resulted in an estimated surface temperature of 985 °C (see Fig.

0: A total of six DNA samples (three individuals per group) were sent for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to the Beijing Genomic Institute (BGI, Beijing, China).
1: The library preparation was done according to the BGI standard directional WGBS pipeline.
2: Genome fragmentation into 100300 bp fragments was done by sonication.
3: Bisulfite treatment was done with the EZ DNA methylation Gold Kit (ZYMO, Mexico City, Mexico).
4: The WGBS consisted of a 150 bp paired-end sequencing with a genome coverage of 12 on a NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

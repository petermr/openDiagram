0: Although substantial advances have been achieved in dissecting the cellular mechanisms of intestinal regeneration, a similar analysis of the molecular basis is lagging.
1: Initial methods to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during intestinal regeneration consisted of differential screening (DS) and differential display (DD) to study specific genes that could be upregulated during regeneration 20  22.
2: Further studies with a broader approach targeted expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cDNA libraries of regenerating intestines and the preparation of microarrays to reveal DEGs.
3: In the last decade, these technologies have been used to uncover regeneration-associated genes in the transcriptomes of two other sea cucumbers,  Apostichopus japonicus23 and  Eupentacta fraudatrix24.
4: This has led to the identification of several DEGs linked with intestinal regeneration.

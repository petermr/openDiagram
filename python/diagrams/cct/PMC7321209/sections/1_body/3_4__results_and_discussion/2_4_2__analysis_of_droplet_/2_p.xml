<p>The coupled process development of increasing droplet size and reduced short circuit frequency was caused by increasing resistance heating of the free wire length with increasing CTWD. Due to high temperatures, the extended wire softened. This effect enhanced the formation of droplets with larger material volume at the end of the wire. At the same time, the pinch effect was reduced, which was induced by the Lorentz force of the magnetic field. The reason for this is the lower welding current that affects the Lorentz force squared.

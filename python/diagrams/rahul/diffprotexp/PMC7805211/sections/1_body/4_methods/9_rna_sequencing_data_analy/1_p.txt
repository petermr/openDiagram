0: Paired-end, raw neurofibroma and plexiform neurofibroma RNA-seq data were downloaded from syn4939902.
1: Sequencing lanes were merged, followed by alignment with STAR (v2.7.0f) to b37 (downloaded from the GATK resource bundle https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/bundle), using the Gencode v19 annotations).
2: Alignment was performed using default parameters with the following modifications: -twopassMode Basic, -outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate, and -quantMode GeneCounts.
3: Reverse-stranded gene counts were read into R (v3.6.1) using edgeR (v3.27.14), excluding sample 2-025 due to sample quality.
4: Gene counts were restricted to known, protein coding genes and lincRNA.
5: Samples were further filtered to genes that had greater than 1 count per million (CPM) in at least 3 samples.
6: Libraries were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values method.
7: Dimensionality reduction was performed using the prcomp function (v3.6.1) on the filtered log2 CPM and plotted using ggplot2 (v3.2.1).

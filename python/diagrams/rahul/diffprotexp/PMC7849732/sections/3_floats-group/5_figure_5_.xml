  <p>Comparison of the medial vs lateral OD ratio of GluN2 subunit isoforms between males and female rats. A, B) Representative confocal images showing GluN2B immunofluorescence in a male (a) and female rat (b), Scale bar: 200 μm, as well as higher magnification insets of the SDH for both male (top left) and female (top right), Scale bar: 50 μm. GluN2B signal is preferentially localized to the medial portion of the SDH in males (a) but not females (b). (c–e) Quantitative statistical analysis of the mean medial vs lateral OD ratio for GluN2A (c), GluN2B (d) and GluN2D (e) in males versus females. The medial/lateral ratio for GluN2B was significantly greater in males compared to females (d), while the medial/lateral ratio was not significantly different between males and females and near values of 1 for both GluN2A (c) and GluN2D (e). *p &lt; 0.05</p>

0: Overlap of AS exons with extracellular regions and transmembrane domains were assessed using two approaches.
1: (1) Annotation of protein in Uniprot for extracellular protein expression; (2) Analysis by TMHMM (Transmembrane hidden markov model,  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) for extracellular location of amino acid residues within a transmembrane protein.

0: Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1 is a motile aerobic bacterium belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria class, which was first isolated from seawater and sediment samples collected in Milazzo Harbor, Sicily, Italy, supplemented with the  n-alkane, tetradecane ( n-C 14) ( Yakimov et al., 2004).
1: The strain is a typical example of marine obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB) which have a highly specialized substrate specificity toward hydrocarbons ( Yakimov et al., 2007).
2: Like many other OHCB, such as  Alcanivorax borkumensis and  Oleispira antarctica,  T. oleivorans grows almost exclusively on aliphatic hydrocarbons ( Yakimov et al., 1998,  2002).
3: OHCB are present in non-polluted marine environments at low numbers, but following oil spills, they typically bloom and become dominant members of the microbial community ( Kasai et al., 2002a, b;  Cappello et al., 2007;  McKew et al., 2007a;  Teramoto et al., 2009;  Vila et al., 2010).

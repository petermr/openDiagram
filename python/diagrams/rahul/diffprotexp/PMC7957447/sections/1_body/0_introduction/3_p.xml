<p id="Par8">In this study, we acquired longitudinal transcriptomic, lipidomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from COVID-19 patients. Based on these multi-omics data, we identified patients' specific conditions in ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients, and significant variations were further identified during hospitalization. Core pathways related to changes in disease condition in those patients that survived were also investigated.</p>

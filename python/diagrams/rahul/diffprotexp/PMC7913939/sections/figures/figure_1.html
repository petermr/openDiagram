 <caption> ( A– D). Differential mRNA expression levels of monocarboxylate transporters MCT1, MCT2, MCT4 and Na +/K + ATP-ase α2 subunit in the cortex of WT and Prnp −/− mice. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in MCT1 and Na +/K + ATP-ase α2 subunit expression in the cortex tissue of Prnp −/− as compared to a control group. Sample size of WT group: n = 5; Prnp −/− group: n = 6. Displayed are means ± SEM. A p-value &lt; 0.01 is considered as very significant (**), &lt;0.05 as significant (*) and ≥0.05 as not significant (ns). </caption>

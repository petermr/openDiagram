<p>Another functional cluster on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246695.g003">Fig 3</xref> is related to the classical complement pathway and represented by C1QA and C1QB genes, with significantly lower expression in the affected lung tissue with lesions, suggesting either suppressed production of C1q complement component in lesions or increased production of classical complement components in lung tissue areas without lesions. Neutrophil activation terms stand alone on the map and have no predicted connections with the two functional clusters, mentioned above.

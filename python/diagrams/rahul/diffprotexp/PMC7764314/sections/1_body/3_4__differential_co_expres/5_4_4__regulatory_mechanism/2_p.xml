<p>Indeed, the most explored of these layers is the regulatory activity of miRNAs on mRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNA–lncRNA crosstalk. In fact, it has been shown that RNA molecules sharing miRNA response elements (MREs) can communicate with each other by competing for common miRNAs (competing endogenous RNAs–ceRNAs-) [

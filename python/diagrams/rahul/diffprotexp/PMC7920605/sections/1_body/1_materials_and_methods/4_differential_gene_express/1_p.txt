0: The quality visualization of RNA-seq reads was accomplished by FastQC (version.
1: 0.11.3).
2: 18 Trimming was performed by fastp for known Illumina TruSeq adapter sequences, poor reads, and ribosomal RNA reads.
3: 19 The trimmed reads were then mapped to the human reference genome (hg38) using Hisat2.
4: 20, 21 And p-value< 0.05 and an absolute value of a fold change >2 were used as criteria for screening differentially expressed genes.

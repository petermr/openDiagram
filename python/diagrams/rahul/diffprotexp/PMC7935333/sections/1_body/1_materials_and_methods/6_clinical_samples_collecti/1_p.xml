<p>Twenty TNBC and 20 non-TNBC clinical samples were collected from patients who were primarily diagnosed with breast cancer between 2013 and 2019 at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University. All clinical samples were diagnosed by senior pathologists, and the proportions of tumor cells were over 85%. The specimens were immediately transferred into the gas phase of liquid nitrogen after removal, and subsequently stored at −80°C until further processing. All the patients who were enrolled in the present study had signed informed consent.</p>

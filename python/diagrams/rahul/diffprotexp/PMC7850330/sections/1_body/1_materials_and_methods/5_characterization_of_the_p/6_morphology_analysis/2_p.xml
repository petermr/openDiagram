<p>The morphology of the selected nanoemulsion (F3) was investigated through transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). The selected nanoemulsion was suitably diluted with deionized water and dripped on a copper mesh. For enhancing the image quality, 2% w/v phosphotungstic acid solution was added as a negative stained standard (Mallick et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The morphology was also further confirmed via scanning electron microscope. The samples were positioned on polycarbonate substrate while the excess water was removed by drying first at ambient temperature and then by carbon dioxide. Samples were coated with gold and examined under a scanning electron microscope (KYKY EM3200, China) running at an accelerating voltage of 20
 <bold> </bold>kV.

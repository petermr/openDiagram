0: A LiFePO 4/graphene composite was successfully prepared as cathode material through one-step microwave heating.
1: The graphene oxide, which has excellent microwave-absorbing properties, can react with microwaves quickly and be restored into high-quality graphene directly without any reducing agent or atmosphere.
2: The introduction of graphene does not impact the structure of LiFePO 4, and LiFePO 4 nanoparticles are packed into micron graphene sheets.
3: The graphene network, which has a high degree of graphitization, can provide a high-speed channel for the rapid transfer of electrons and thus increase the electronic conductivity of materials.
4: Meanwhile, the nanoparticles can improve the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions.
5: Moreover, because the nanoparticles are surrounded by the graphene sheets, the micron structure guards the stability of the material.
6: The electrochemical analyses reveal that the LiFePO 4/graphene composites have excellent high-rate performance and cycling life.
7: The outstanding electrochemical performance, as well as the fast and efficient method, make this technology commercially viable.

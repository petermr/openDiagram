<p>First, we further clarified the samples used for IHC in two new supplementary files. We note that since we attempted to use similar tissue sections for consistency, there was a limit on the number of analyses that could be done on individual samples. Further, we used some new litters/embryos for the experiments in the revision. Thus, we provide a simple summary in Supplementary file 21 including sample numbers (N) used for neuroanatomical IHC validation at E17.5, where numbers represent samples analyzed for at least one of the individual listed markers or co-stains. Details of specific use of individual samples is reported in Supplementary file 22.</p>

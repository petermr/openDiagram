 <p>Janis Timoshenko is the leader of the “Operando Hard X-ray spectroscopy” group at the Department of Interface Science of the Fritz-Haber Institute of the Max-Planck Society in Berlin, Germany. He received his PhD in solid state physics in 2015 from the University of Latvia, where he worked under the supervision of Prof. Alexei Kuzmin on the development of advanced approaches to EXAFS data analysis. He then went for postdoctoral positions at the Physics Department of Yeshiva University and the Department of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering of Stony Brook University, New York, USA, where he worked on the 
  <italic>in situ</italic> investigation of nanomaterials using synchrotron radiation under the lead of Prof. Anatoly Frenkel. In 2018, he joined the Department of Interface Science at the Fritz-Haber Institute under the direction of Prof. Beatriz Roldan Cuenya. His primary research interests are synchrotron-based investigations of catalyst transformations under working conditions, as well as the development of simulation-based and machine learning-based approaches for XAS data interpretation.

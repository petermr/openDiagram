  <p>Proposed model of AS6 effects in normal mammary epithelial cells vs MCF7 cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) In our study, it is shown that AS6 over 2 μM is toxic to both HUMEC and MCF7 cells to induce apoptotic cell death. By contrast, AS6 has cytotoxicity selectively to MCF7 cells, but not in HUMEC, at milder concentrations below 1 μM. Pinkish hexamers, AS6; rounded cells, apoptotic cells; upward arrow, upregulation; downward arrow; downregulation. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Proposed mode of action of AS6 (AS
   <sub>4</sub>O
   <sub>6</sub>). AS6 at milder concentrations might effectively target cancer cells to apoptotic cell death without much affecting normal cells. AS6 impairs the synthesis of key DNA repair enzymes for homologous recombination, which leads to genome instability. A potent CDKs/cyclins inhibitor p21 is activated to arrest the cell cycle while cell stress responses are provoked to facilitate the cell decision to apoptosis.

<p id="Par15">HTR-8/SVneo cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were then treated with medium alone (control) or DCVC (10 or 20 μM) in quintuplicate for 6 or 12 h. CyQUANT
 <sup>®</sup> Cell Proliferation Assay (Invitrogen) was used to quantify cell proliferation. The stain specifically binds to cellular DNA, and the fluorescence is proportional to the number of cells. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, dye binding solution was prepared by diluting CyQUANT
 <sup>®</sup> reagent in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). After exposure to DCVC, the growth medium was removed and CyQUANT
 <sup>®</sup> dye binding solution was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, fluorescence was measured (excitation: 485 nm; emission 530 nm) using a SpectraMax M2e Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).

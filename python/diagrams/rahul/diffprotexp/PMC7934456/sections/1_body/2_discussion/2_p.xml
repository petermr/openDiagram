<p id="Par31">The 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS restorer gene 
 <italic>Rfp</italic> encodes a PPR protein that usually recognizes and binds to RNA sequences in organelles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In a previous study of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS, the materials of sterile, maintainer, and restorer lines were compared with northern blotting, and the results showed that the original 
 <italic>atp6/orf224</italic> was transcribed into 1.1 kb, 2.2 kb, and 1.9 kb transcripts relative to the sterile and restorer lines, respectively. However, in the reintroduction line materials, two transcripts of 2.2 kb and 1.9 kb were significantly reduced, whereas two new transcripts of 1.4 kb and 1.3 kb appeared simultaneously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, we presumed that 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS’s restoration gene participated in the editing of 
 <italic>atp6/orf224</italic> mRNA. The transcript of 
 <italic>atp6/orf224</italic> translates the 
 <italic>orf224</italic> protein, and 
 <italic>orf224</italic> has been found to exert a toxic effect on 
 <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic>

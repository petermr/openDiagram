 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of AE and AO in animal model of NAFLD induced by CDD. CDD causes less production of very LDL-C which results in TAG accumulation in liver tissue and provides a suitable model for the assessment of drugs in NAFLD.[
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, both AE and AO showed positive effects toward the reduction of weight gain compared with vehicle-treated group. The effect was in a dose-dependent manner so that 200 mg/kg/day of AE and 0.5 ml/kg/day of AO were the most effective treatments. All treatment groups represented reduced serum levels of TC, LDL-C, and TAG and increased HDL-C level. As one of the treatment approaches for NAFLD are antihyperlipidemic agents, it could be concluded that AE and AO can protect fat accumulation in liver tissue through modulation of lipid profile. Administration of anise fruit to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus decreased fasting blood glucose, serum cholesterol, and TAG. Protein oxidation in serum and LPO in erythrocytes and plasma was also decreased. A significant rise in serum β-carotene, Vitamin A, and Vitamin C levels was also reported.[

<p>Cluster generation and sequencing primer hybridization were completed on cBot of the Illumina GA IIx Sequencer according to the processes indicated in the cBot User Guide. After preparing sequencing reagents according to the Genome Analyzer IIx User Guide, the Illumina Single Read Flow Cell V4 mounted on a cluster was tested (GA IIx, Illumina). Single-read 1 × 50 nt multiplex was used to perform single-read. Sequencing processes and real-time data analysis were controlled by Illumina’s Data Collection Software.</p>

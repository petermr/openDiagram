0: A total of 10 perfusates were collected, from 5 model rats and 5 normal control rats (Additional file  1: Table S1).
1: The perfusate proteins were extracted via acetone precipitation [ 3].
2: The protein extracts were then subjected to quantitation by the Bradford method [ 28].
3: Equal amounts of protein derived from five individual rats in the same group (model or control) were mixed together, resulting in two pooled perfusate samples: A model perfusate mixture and a control perfusate mixture.

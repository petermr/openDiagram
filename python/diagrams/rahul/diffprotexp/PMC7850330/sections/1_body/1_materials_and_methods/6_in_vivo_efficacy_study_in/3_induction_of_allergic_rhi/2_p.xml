<p>Allergic rhinitis rabbit models were developed according to a modified reported protocol (Sagit et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The rabbits were sensitized via intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 1
 <bold> </bold>ml freshly prepared ovalbumin every other day over 7
 <bold> </bold>days followed by intranasal administration of 1
 <bold> </bold>ml physiological saline (PS) having 0.3
 <bold> </bold>mg ovalbumin and 30
 <bold> </bold>mg Al(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> for 14
 <bold> </bold>days (Sagit et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Senturk et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Treatment was initiated after the 21
 <bold> </bold>days of the induction and for 14
 <bold> </bold>days. The studied formulations were administered as 70
 <bold> </bold>μl dose “holding 17
 <bold> </bold>μg of the loratadine and 7
 <bold> </bold>μg of sulpiride” in every nostril by means of a micropipette with a low-density polyethylene tubing, having an internal diameter of 0.1
 <bold> </bold>mm at the administration site.

0: Enzymatic pre-digestion was used to extract protein from each specimen ( n = 35 POAG and  n = 18 post-mortem samples).
1: Briefly, TM specimens were treated with dispaseII (2 g/mL in HBSS without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+) for 15 min at 37 C, diluted 1:1 (v/v) with 2 Lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF and 1 mM PMSF; pH 7.5), homogenized with a Polytron (25 s/0 C at 21500 rev./min; Ultra Turrax T25 basic; IkaWerke, Staufen, Germany) and briefly sonicated to shear DNA/RNA (VibraCell, Sonics, Newtown, CT, USA).
2: Tissue lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein amount/quality was analyzed using the Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (A1000; Celbio, Milan, Italy).
3: Protein amounts were detected with the A280-Nanodrop option by means of common internal standards, after blank options against water and extraction buffer.
4: Data (g/L) were used to normalize protein extracts before loading in the specific assay.

<p id="par0105">The protocol of Loreto and Velikova [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used for the estimation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the collected samples. Leaf samples (0.1 gm) were crushed in liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> and further homogenized in 1 mL of 1% Trichloroacetic acid. Further, reaction mixture was prepared by adding 0.75 mL of supernatant, 0.75 mL of phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0) and 1.5 mL of potassium iodide (KI) and the absorbance was taken at 390 nm. The extinction coefficient of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (26.6 mM
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> cm
 <sup>-1</sup>) was used for the calculation.

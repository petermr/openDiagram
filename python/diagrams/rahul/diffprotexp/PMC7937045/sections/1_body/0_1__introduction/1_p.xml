<p>The incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer are higher than those of other cancers [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15% [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lung cancer is divided into small cell carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell carcinoma (NSCLC). SCLC accounts for 10%-15% of lung cancers and is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The median survival time of patients with advanced lung cancer is only 10 months [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer have significantly improved, the current treatment methods are still not satisfactory. Improved early diagnosis and targeted treatment of lung cancer are required in clinical practices to improve patient outcomes.

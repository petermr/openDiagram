<p>� Nitrogenase activity was measured as acetylene reduction assay (ARA) of the cell samples in culture tubes containing 2mL BG 11 or BG110 medium capped with subha seals. The cell samples used for ARA were NDVs+NDHs in BG110, NDHs in BG110, and NVs in BG11. Acetylene at 10% of gas phase was injected followed by incubation under fluorescent light for 4 h. 50 µL gas phase was measured with GC-2010 Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with a DB-WAX capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm, 0.25 μm), carrier gas nitrogen 20 mL. min–1, column temperature 100ºC, injector temperature 130ºC, detector temperature 230ºC). Nitrogenase activity was expressed as nmol.2mL culture.（4h）–1. The direct output of GC is as follows: </p>

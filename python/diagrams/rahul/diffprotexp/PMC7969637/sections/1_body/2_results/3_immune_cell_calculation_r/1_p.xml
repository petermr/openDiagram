<p>Since GO and KEGG results showed the close correlation to immune cells, we next analyzed the immune cell composition in the samples to study the immunity in different groups of samples. Using the CIBERSORT algorithm, we explored the differences in immune infiltration among 22 immune cell subgroups for the 130 samples in GSE26440. We found that the relative proportions of 16 immune cells in 22 types of immune cells were significantly different between the two groups (

Meanwhile, the proportion of neutrophils in the pediatric sepsis group was significantly higher than the normal group (

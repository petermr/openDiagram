<p>Proteins of interest among the 13 identified differentially expressed proteins were selected for quantitative protein detection. The levels of ACY-3 and ETHE1 in the kidney tissues of MT−/− and MT+/+ mice both decreased after DU injection, and the reduction in MT−/− mice was even more significant (

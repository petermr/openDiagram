<p>Our simulations also revealed (i) the coordination number of interlayer K
 <sup>+</sup>, (ii) hydrogen bond populations, and (iii) the diffusion coefficients (
 <italic>D</italic>) of K
 <sup>+</sup> and water in birnessite (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>). In particular, the 1 W state displayed a local maximum in the number of K
 <sup>+</sup>–oxygen interactions (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>a), with ∼10 O within 0.35 nm, ∼5 of which are O-sites from the basal face and ∼5 from water oxygen. It is a hydration state with the maximum number of donating hydrogen bonds (2 per O) to birnessite basal oxygen groups (observed at 3562 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>b) and the least number of water–water interactions (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>b). This latter observation thus implies that the hydrogen-bonded water populations seen by vibrational spectroscopy must arise from condensed water between the particles, not from the interlayer region. Finally, our simulations also show that the 1 W state is also the one with the lowest diffusion coefficients for both K
 <sup>+</sup> and water and even the lowest of all simulated hydration states (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>c). For comparison, the diffusion coefficient of liquid water (
 <italic>D</italic> = 2.68 × 10
 <sup>–9</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>
 </sup> is four orders of magnitude larger than that of the 1 W state. These findings consequently underscore the singular attributes of water molecules intercalated in the interlayer region of birnessite.

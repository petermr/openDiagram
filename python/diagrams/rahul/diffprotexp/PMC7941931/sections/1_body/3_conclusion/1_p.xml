<p id="Par48">The present work is the first attempt to integrate miRNA and mRNA expression data to identify key regulatory miRNA-mRNA pairs in developing Tartary buckwheat seed. A total of 230 miRNAs, including 101 known and 129 novel miRNAs, were first identified in Tartary buckwheat. Among these miRNAs, 76 showed significant differential expression during Tartary buckwheat seed development, and 1543 of their target genes were identified. Additionally, 25 miRNAs corresponding to 56 target genes were identified as key candidate miRNA-mRNA pairs for Tartary buckwheat seed development. The integrated analyses of miRNAs and target mRNAs in this study not only provide the first new insights into miRNA-mediated regulation in Tartary buckwheat seed development, but also provide a basis for further research into the functions of these candidate miRNAs and their targets in Tartary buckwheat seed development and for Tartary buckwheat seed improvement.</p>

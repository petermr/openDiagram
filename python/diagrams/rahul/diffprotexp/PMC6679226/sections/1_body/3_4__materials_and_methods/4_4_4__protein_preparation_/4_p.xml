<p>TMT data acquisition utilized an MS3 approach for data collection. Survey scans were performed in the Orbitrap utilizing a resolution of 120,000, and data-dependent MS2 scans were performed in the linear ion trap using a collision induced dissociation of 25%. Reporter ions were fragmented using high energy collision dissociation of 65% and detected in the Orbitrap using a resolution of 50,000. This was repeated for a total of three technical replicates.</p>

0: Recent efforts combining genetic disruption tools and phenotypic analysis in human and rodent malaria parasites have revealed that 78% of  Plasmodium-encoded membrane transport proteins (MTPs) are either essential or necessary for normal grow and development [ 46], thus confirming their therapeutic potential [ 7].
1: Among the annotated 144 MTPs,  P. falciparum encodes 13 P-type ATPases [ 7], most of them refractory to gene deletion [ 8].
2: P-type ATPases are a large family of primary transporters that utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump cations (subfamilies P1, P2 and P3)[ 9], lipids (subfamily P4)[ 10], polyamines (subfamily P5B)[ 11], or even to discolase single transmembrane domains (P5A subfamily)[ 12].
3: In  Plasmodium, P-type ATPases maintain ion homeostasis during its intracellular life-cycle [ 13].
4: The  P. falciparum Na +/H + P-type ATPase (PfATP4) has been identified as the target of the antimalarial family of drugs spiroindolones [ 14].
5: The  P. falciparum homologue of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump (PfATP6) was initially proposed as an artemisinin target [ 15], although studies using recombinant PfATP6 did not support this [ 16].
6: Recently, gene-targeting approaches have also uncovered the important role for parasites progression of the P4 subfamily, also known as lipid flippases [ 46].
7: In eukaryotes, P4-ATPases maintain the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in membranes by translocating phospholipids from the extracellular (or luminal) leaflet to the cytoplasmic leaflet [ 10], key in important physiological functions as vesicle budding and protein trafficking [ 17].
8: Moreover, new roles of these transporters have emerged in recent years as membrane lipids are also implicated in cell-signalling events.
9: In plants, the transport of lysophospholipids mediated by a P4-ATPase is involved in root development and size of stomatal apertures [ 18].
10: Also, the virulence of some pathogens and drug disponibility have been correlated with the expression and activity of P4-ATPases [ 19].
11: The genome of  P. falciparum contains four putative P4-ATPases: PfATP2, PfATP7, PfATP8 and PfATP11 [ 7], well conserved in  Plasmodium species with the exception of PfATP11 [ 8].
12: In addition,  P. falciparum encodes two P4-ATPase-like proteins only present in the Apicomplexa phylum: GC and GC, consisting of a N-terminal P4-ATPase-like domain connected to a C-terminal guanylate cyclase domain.
13: While there is some discrepancy with regard the vital role of ATP7 and ATP8 [ 4, 5], all the studies agree that the activites of PfATP2 and its ortholog in the mouse malaria parasite  P. berguei are completely irreplaceable during the blood stages.
14: Moreover, in a recent study [ 20], gene duplication of the gene encoding PfATP2 was associated with drug-resistant phenotypes against two drugs antimalarial compounds.
15: This eventually situates PfATP2 either, as the target of these two antimalarial compounds or responsible of reducing the local concentration of these drugs at the target site.

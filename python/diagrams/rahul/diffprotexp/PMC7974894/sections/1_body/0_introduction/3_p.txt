0: In the present study, we downloaded the RNA-seq and clinical datasets from TCGA and GEO.
1: By utilizing differential expression analysis and WGCNA, we constructed the link between the expression and tongue cancer patients' clinical features.
2: GO and KEGG analyses were carried out to reveal the underlying functional mechanisms in metabolic processes of RBPs in tongue cancer.
3: Moreover, by unveiling a number of tongue cancer prognosis-related hub RBPs, our results may shed new light on understanding RBPs-directed network underlying tongue cancer progression.
4: These hub RBPs may provide potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.

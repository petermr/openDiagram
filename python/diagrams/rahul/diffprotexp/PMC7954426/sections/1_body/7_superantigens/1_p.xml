<p>Superantigens (SAgs) are potent immune-regulatory proteins produced by bacteria, viruses, and 
 <italic>M. arthritidis</italic>. The SAg, which binds to the outside of MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells, is recognized by T cells bearing specific Vβ-chain segments of the T cell receptor (TCR); this interaction does not involve MHC restriction. Thus, SAg can induce a large proportion of peripheral T cells to produce a large panel of cytokines, which has clear implications for pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="cit0283" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>]. Currently, only 
 <italic>M. arthritidis</italic> has been found to produce SAg. This SAg, MAM, is a haplotype-restricted polyclonal soluble T-cell mitogen and is a small basic, acid-labile protein with a molecular weight ranging from 15 to 30 kDa [
 <xref rid="cit0284" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>]. In contrast to conventional SAgs, MAM exhibits special characteristics: (I) it preferentially presents T cells through H-2E, H-2A, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ [
 <xref rid="cit0285" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]; (II) the Jb fragment as well as the CDR3 region of the TCR affect the T cell reactivity to MAM [
 <xref rid="cit0286" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]; (III) MAM not only binds to TCR Vβ but also interacts with TCR Vα [
 <xref rid="cit0287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>]; (IV) formation of a unique MAM/HLA-DR1/hemagglutinin (HA) complex is a prerequisite for T cell activation [
 <xref rid="cit0288" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]; (V) TLR2 and TLR4 play vital roles in MAM-induced immune responses [
 <xref rid="cit0289" ref-type="bibr">289–291</xref>]; and (VI) MAM is the only SAg with potential DNase activity [
 <xref rid="cit0292" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>].

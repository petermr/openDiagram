<p id="Par6">The method described in this article deals with such a case, where there was virtually no temperature data available. This was due to the induction facility being highly automated (and therefore enclosed), but not instrumented. While material data could be gained from treated and untreated workpieces, there was no information available on the heat treatment curve the bearing underwent during the process, and recording one was infeasible. The only data point was an estimate of 1050 °C, attained through glimpsing into the induction oven from the intake conveyor and seeing a bright yellow shine through the rotating heating assembly. Needless to say that one temperature value of such questionable origin could hardly be used to verify the rather complex multiphysics simulation that would have to be implemented further in the future.</p>

<p id="Par16">To individually test the various electrodes prepared, two-electrode electrochemical coin cells are assembled with a lithium metal counter and a reference electrode. Celgard-3501 polymer or Kodoshi paper is used as separator and soaked with a 1-M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> EC:DEC (3:7) electrolyte. For a complete battery, the LFP, PTCDA, graphite, and LTO self-standing films are assembled together with a Celgard or Kodoshi paper separator. A bare electrode is also tested using a stainless steel spacer as a working electrode. In order to verify the electrochemical inertness of cellulose fibers, a handmade paper electrode is tested versus lithium.

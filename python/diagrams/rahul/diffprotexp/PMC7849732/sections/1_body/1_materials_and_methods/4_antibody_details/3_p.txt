0: To label the GluN2D subunit we used a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit (Alomone Labs, #AGC-020).
1: It recognizes the N-terminus sequence CRTQNRTHRGESLHR corresponding to the amino-acid residues 345359 of the rat GluN2D.
2: This GluN2D antibody has been successfully employed in both immunohistochemistry and cytochemistry experiments [ 37, 38].

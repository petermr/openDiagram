<p>Finally, hASIC3 has 3 splice variants; thus, greater understanding of how each variant functions and any differential tissue expression are required to determine what, if any, differential roles these variants have. One potential way to investigate this would be to investigate different pain models (both acute and chronic) in transgenic mice expressing the different human splice variants to determine what impact they may have on neuronal excitability and pain.</p>

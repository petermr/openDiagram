<p>In any case, the sample must be packed properly, for instance using high-purity aluminium pans. If this aspect is disregarded, an incorrect measurement might result (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f008">Figure 8</xref>). The reason for this is that the colour of the sample surface, which influences the heat exchange by radiation between sample and furnace, needs to be kept constant [
 <xref rid="B121-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. A purge with inert gas is also required to prevent oxidation and keep heat transfer conditions constant. Nitrogen gas is therefore preferable to helium, as nitrogen purging results in the best baseline stability of the DSC instrument. Helium may be suitable for increasing the achievable cooling rates [

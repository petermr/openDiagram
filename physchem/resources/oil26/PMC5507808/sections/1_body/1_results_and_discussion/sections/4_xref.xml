Fermented fish flours produced were also rich in minerals such as sodium (1.36&#160;&#177;&#160;0.09&#8211;1.46&#160;&#177;&#160;0.07%), potassium (0.48&#160;&#177;&#160;0.07&#8211;0.69&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03%), calcium (1.88&#160;&#177;&#160;0.09&#8211;2.04&#160;&#177;&#160;0.06%) magnesium (0.18&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02&#8211;0.24&#160;&#177;&#160;0.05%) and iron (0.31&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08&#8211;0.43&#160;&#177;&#160;0.07&#160;mg/kg). Statistical analyzes revealed that there is no significant difference (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) between samples analyzed. Results obtained during the evaluation of the microbiological characteristics of the different group of fermented fish flour (Table&#160;

  <p>Typical 2-DE protein profile of (A) MSC, (B) AC, and (C) cMSC. 100 Î¼g of protein cell lysate were conducted on 24 cm IPG strip (pH 3-10) and 12.5% SDS-PAGE. 2-DE gels were visualized 
   <italic>via</italic> silver staining. The differentially expressed proteins studied are depicted on the gels. Gels were stained with silver nitrate and image analysis was performed using Nonlinear Progenesis SameSpot software.

0: This work describes a new strategy to achieve both safe and energy-dense battery (SEB) cells, as schematically sketched in  Fig.
1: 1, where the cell resistance is plotted against the inverse of temperature.
2: First, a passivated cell is judiciously designed and built by using highly stable materials and by creating exceptionally stable EEIs, as characterized by higher charge-transfer resistance ( Rct) and higher direct-current resistance (DCR).
3: This is illustrated in  Fig.
4: 1 by the line from point a (the conventional Li-ion cell design) to point b (the SEB cell design).
5: It follows that these resistive SEB cells are inherently stable and safe, as demonstrated by nail penetration, short circuiting, and high-temperature storage.
6: Second, in order for SEB cells to deliver high power during operation, they are heated instantaneously before operation, say from room temperature to 60C, so as to recover acceptable operational DCR and ultimately battery power, going from point b (at room temperature) to point c (at an elevated temperature such as 60C) in  Fig.
7: 1.
8: This power on demand through rapid thermal stimulation is opposed to standby power in the present-day LIB cells, where the high-power EEIs need to be ever present.
9: Rapid cell heating at a speed of 1 to 5C/s has been made possible by a self-heating structure discovered by Wang  et al.
10: ( 1), in which a micrometer-thick nickel foil is inserted in a stack of anode-separator-cathode assemblies for uniform and internal heating.
11: Thus, heating from room temperature to 60C for battery operation conveniently takes only 10 to 20 s.

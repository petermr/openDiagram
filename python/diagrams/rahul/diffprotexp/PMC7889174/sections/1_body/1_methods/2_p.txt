0: Selection of genes for analysis.
1: Inclusive sets of NE and NE-associated (collectively NEA) proteins were selected for investigation.
2: Given issues concerning with purity of subcellular fractions, we sought to minimize likely contaminants within NE proteome databases and no selection based on function was made.
3: First Seventy-five relatively high-confidence rat liver NEA protein-encoding genes were selected from a much larger cohort of potential NEA proteins identified previously [ 41, 42].
4: These were not limited to nuclear envelope transmembrane (NET) proteins and both inner and outer nuclear envelope proteins were included; importantly many have been identified at the NE of mammalian cells in subsequent studies and we excluded proteins subsequently demonstrated to have no NE-association [ 4345].
5: Second, eighty-nine  Trypanosoma brucei NE protein-coding genes were selected based on previous studies [ 46, 47].
6: In this case, proteins containing at least one predicted transmembrane domain were included.
7: TMHMM version 2.0 c transmembrane domain predictions from TriTrypDB were used for this purpose (accessed April 2020) [ 48, 49].
8: We chose this selection criterion to maximize the likelihood that the included proteins were indeed associated stably with the NE and not a peripheral interactor.

0: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of movement in the aged populations worldwide.
1: PD is characterized pathologically by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which results in a reduction of dopamine, a vital neurotransmitter affecting movement and balance.
2: Whilst the exact cause of PD is generally unknown, the development and progression of the disease is considered to be associated with environmental and genetic factors ( 1).
3: In total, ~15% of patients have a family history of PD, and 5-10% of cases are caused by pathogenic mutations in single genes with monogenic Mendelian inheritance ( 2).
4: Mutations in numerous genes, including  SNCA, PARK2 (coding for parkin),  DJ-1, PINK1, LRRK2 and  VPS35, are directly linked to PD, whereas variants in other genes, such as  GBA, have been shown to be strong risk factors for PD ( 3).
5: Although extensive research has focused on pathogenic gene mutations or variants, it is not fully understood how those genetic changes cause PD or influence the risk of developing this disorder in the elderly population ( 4, 5).

<p id="Par34">Human brain tissue was obtained from the Neurological Tissue Bank, Biobanc-HospitalClinic-IDIBAPS and as generous gift from Professor I Ferrer Abizanda, Bellvitge Hospital Universitari, Institut Català de la Salut, Barcelona, Spain and used under local regional ethical approval (Law 14/2007 on Biomedical Research). Frozen samples of SNpc, Hippocampus and Temporal Cortex from idiopathic PD patients (n = 5), idiopathic AD patients (n = 5), VD patients (n = 5) and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 6) were used. All patients had been diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the Neurological Tissue Bank. The neuropathological assessments of disease cases were performed and Braak neuropathological staging found AD patients to be at Braak stages 3–4 and PD patients to be at Braak stages 4–5–6. None of the patients were believed to have alternative diagnoses, degeneration of related systems, drug induced Parkinsonism, or any other serious medical illness. Enrolment was also contingent on the absence of a diagnosis for another neurodegenerative disease. The control subjects have not been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative or pre-neurodegenerative disease condition. The gender, age at death, and clinical diagnosis of the study cohort are summarized in Table

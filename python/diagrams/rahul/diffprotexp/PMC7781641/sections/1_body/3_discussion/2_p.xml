<p>Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 belongs to the family of T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels, which are expressed in small- and medium-diameter primary afferent neurons [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], regulate neuronal excitability, and have a well-characterized role in neuropathic pain [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several groups have successfully demonstrated that blocking or attenuating all T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels or, in particular, the Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.2 subtype are effective strategies for mitigating behavioral signs of neuropathic pain in animal models [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14â€“18</xref>]. In addition, the pan-T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel blocker ethosuximide has been tested in clinical trials for neuropathic pain [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, this particular trial was halted due to adverse events experienced by patients, suggesting that more specific Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3 blockers may be required for neuropathic pain.

<p>MicroRNA (miRNA), a diverse group of small noncoding RNAs, has emerged as a focal research object for its critical role in post-transcriptional regulation. MiRNA-34b-5p (miR-34b-5p) has been found to function in a wide range of biological activities such as the angiogenesis of thyroid carcinoma cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and recurrent seizure-induced astrocyte apoptosis [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, studies have reported that miR-34b-5p is associated with sepsis-induced organ injury. For instance, down-regulation of miR-34b-5p suppressed lung inflammation and apoptosis in sepsis-induced acute lung injury [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, what role miR-34b-5p plays in septic AKI is barely known.

<p>Larvae, pupae, and adults of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> applied with LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> concentrations of garlic essential oil 
 <italic>vs</italic> toxic compounds showed lethal effects at different time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, LT
 <sub>50</sub> values from topical application assays showed that diallyl sulfide took longer to kill insects than the diallyl disulfide and garlic essential oil. At a high LC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration, diallyl sulfide took longer to kill the larvae (t = 1.29, P &lt; 0.001), pupae (t = 4.23, P &lt; 0.001), and adults (t = 2.16, P &lt; 0.001) with LT
 <sub>50</sub> values of 45.9 ± 0.52 h, 40.1 ± 0.38 h, and 54.2 ± 0.85 h, respectively. Diallyl disulfide took less time to kill the larvae (t = 3.24, P &lt; 0.001), pupae (t = 4.16, P &lt; 0.001), and adults (t = 2.12, P &lt; 0.001) with LT
 <sub>50</sub> values of 40.7 ± 0.14 h, 43.9 ± 0.52 h, and 49.7 ± 0.91 h, respectively. At a high LC
 <sub>90</sub> concentration, diallyl sulfide took longer to kill the larvae (t = 4.45, P &lt; 0.001), pupae (t = 4.51, P &lt; 0.001), and adults (t = 3.96, P &lt; 0.001) with LT
 <sub>50</sub> values of 36.8 ± 0.85 h, 33.3 ± 0.43 h, and 40.3 ± 0.27 h, respectively. Diallyl disulfide took less time to kill the larvae (t = 4.31, P &lt; 0.001), pupae (t = 4.31, P &lt; 0.001), and adults (t = 4.08, P &lt; 0.001) with LT
 <sub>50</sub> values of 20.3 ± 0.45 h, 21.4 ± 0.16 h, and 27.7 ± 0.75 h, respectively.

<p>The SHCCT diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows that the hardness of FGHAZ was around 363~393 HV (0.2) and around 354~384 HV (0.2) of CGHAZ. Both at the peak temperature of 1320 °C and 850 °C, the continuous cooling transformed product was martensite. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f004">Figure 4</xref> also reveals that at the same t
 <sub>8/5</sub> range of 5~60 s, each average hardness value of FGHAZ was larger than that of CGHAZ by around 10 HV. The harder martensite in FGHAZ was attributed to the higher transformation rate, as well as fine grain.

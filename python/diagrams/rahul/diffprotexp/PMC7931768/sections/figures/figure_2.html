 <caption> Summary scores for interferon-associated and CLE-associated gene clusters differentiate HVs from CLE-A and CLE-A versus CLE-U groups. Gene expression in CLE-affected skin, CLE-unaffected skin and HVs for (A) the interferon-dominant gene cluster (cluster 3) and (B) the CLE-associated gene cluster (cluster 1). Each coloured symbol represents a single participant. CLE-A, cutaneous lupus erythematosus-affected skin; CLE-U, cutaneous lupus erythematosus-unaffected skin; HV-U, healthy volunteer-unaffected skin. </caption>

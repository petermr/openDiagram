<p id="Par29">The WFVS method returned an FVS with 528 vertices, which is approximately 14% larger than the size of the MFVS. The selected WFVS has a better average weight than both the MFVS and WMFVS. This result is consistent with our purpose for WFVSs, which focuses on the total weight rather than the size of the FVS.</p>

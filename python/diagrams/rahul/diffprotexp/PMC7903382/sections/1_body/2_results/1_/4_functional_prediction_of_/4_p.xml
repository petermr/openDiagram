<p>Gene co-expression networks were presented to identify interactions between lncRNAs and their co-expression genes (
 <xref rid="f5-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The co-expressed network showed that 10 highly-dysregulated lncRNAs were highly co-expressed with 277 target genes, of which 10 were positively correlated (colored with yellow) and 267 were negatively correlated (colored with blue). ENSRNOT00000080713 was at the core of the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network and had a co-expression relationship with many mRNAs.

<p>For the preparation of single cells, the ovarian tissues (4-6 ovaries per sample) were cut into pieces within the digestive solution, which comprised 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone, Beijing, China) and collagenase (2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, C5138). Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into centrifuge tubes and placed in a 37 ℃ incubator for 6-8 min, and then agitated with a pipette once every 3 min to produce single cells. After the termination of digestion with serum, the mixture was then filtered using 40 μm cell strainers (BD Falcon, 352340, CA, USA), and flushes were performed three times with PBS containing 0.04% BSA. Finally, cell viability and counts were assessed to meet the requirements of sequencing.</p>

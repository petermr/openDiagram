<p>The expression profiling of these 97 genes that fragment the Golgi showed two main Golgi fragmentation subsets within the Golgi genes. The first GF-subset of genes (56 genes) demonstrated upregulation in Cluster 3. The second GF-subset (15 genes) demonstrated upregulation in Cluster 4. The remaining genes (26 genes) showed either a stable low expression or unclear expression pattern across all clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01399-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). This could suggest that cells in Cluster 4 exhibit a high likelihood of Golgi fragmentation whereas cells in Cluster 3 exhibit a high likelihood of Golgi condensation. DEGs between clusters 3 and 4 were extracted by a two-class unpaired response test using SAMseq (FDR &lt; 0.05 and fold change &gt; 1). Five genes (

During the dissemination of breast cancer cells, they exhibit a loss of epithelial characteristics, which routinely is accompanied by upregulation of mesenchymal genes. This process is known as epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several studies highlighted a strong association between the expression of EMT genes in circulating breast cancer cells and cancer progression, invasion and metastasis [

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. To investigate this association, we profiled the expression of 20 genes (

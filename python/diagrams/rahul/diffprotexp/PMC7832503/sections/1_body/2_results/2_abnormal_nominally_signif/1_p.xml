<p>To determine whether common SNVs were independently associated with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease, a genome wide association study was carried out using a logistics regression model. 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> displayed the Manhattan and quantile–quantile plots of this analysis. Although no genome-wide significant associations were identified from the common SNVs analysis, we tried to seek some potential risk SNVs. Using a less stringent level (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1×10
 <sup>−4</sup>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], there are 164 SNVs nominally significant associated with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 risk (Table S1). Among them, an intron variant rs4634725 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.16 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) was the most significant SNV locating on a protein coding gene, that is polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 3 (
 <italic>PTBP3</italic>). Additionally, another 26 nominally significant associated SNVs locating on 
 <italic>PTBP3</italic> gene were also identified, and they have a strong linkage relationship, as shown in Fig. S1.

<p id="Par16">In conclusion, based on our analysis of this data. We identified linRNAs that may cause differences in the growth of skeletal muscles of Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs, and discovered a number of novel linRNAs. In addition, we speculate that multiple DELs may participate in the IGF-1-Akt-mTOR pathway by regulating their potential target genes, ultimately affect muscle protein synthesis and the size of muscle fiber. Our findings provide valuable references and new ideas for lincRNA research.</p>

<p>RBPs are not only involved in all steps of RNA biogenesis, but also exhibit highly dynamic interactions with coding or non-coding RNAs to facilitate a variety of biological functions including cancer

For the prognosis-related hub RBPs identified in this work, several reports have shown the tumor-related functions directed by hub RBPs and their interacted non-coding RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD)

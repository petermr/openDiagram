<p id="Par16">Pathways associated with intestinal regeneration were classified according to upregulated and downregulated genes for each day. Only resulting pathways with 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 were depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Enriched pathways for upregulated genes in day 1 and 3 were mostly associated with protein processing and transcriptional activity, being the pathway involved in proteasome activity the most enriched. Downregulated genes correlated mainly with various types of metabolic activity. Furthermore, enzymatic activity associated with peroxisomes were found to be enriched for both days. Intriguingly, phagosome activity was shown in pathways of upregulated genes for day 1, as well as the downregulated genes of the same day (see supplementary Tables

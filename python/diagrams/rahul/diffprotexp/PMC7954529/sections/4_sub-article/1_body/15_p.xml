<p>PAS usage is a ratio of the reads mapping to one PAS over the number or reads mapping to any PAS assigned to the same gene. We calculated the usage values on an inclusive set of PAS then filtered to PAS reaching 5% in either species. We decided to identify and quantify sites this way to account for species and genomic region-specific noise. As a result of this choice, the overall usage for every gene may not add up to exactly 100%. This means that even though we identify (on average) the same number of PAS per gene in each species, the structure in this plot is not unexpected.</p>

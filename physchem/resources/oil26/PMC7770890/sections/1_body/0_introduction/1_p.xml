direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host)
of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
important for combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> It has become well accepted that SARS-CoV-2 was likely to originate
naturally from bats soon after its outbreak, built on the fact that
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with the bat
coronavirus (CoV) RaTG13 isolated from <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) and that natural insertions were identified
at the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike (S) protein of RmYN02-CoV
isolated from <italic>Rhinolophus malayanus</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> However, it remains unknown how the related CoV was transmitted
from bats to humans.</p>

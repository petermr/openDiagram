<p id="Par19">The genes expressed differentially in response to high salt concentrations in halophyte 
 <italic>U. setulosa</italic> were found to be associated with various biological processes i.e. photosynthesis, MAP kinases, response to oxidative stress, osmotic stress, cellular response to oxidative stress, cellular response to stress, positive regulation of response to salt stress, stress-activated protein kinase signalling cascade, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, trehalose metabolism in response to stress, priming of cellular response to stress, negative regulation of response to salt stress, response to cation stress and stress granule assembly.

<p>The LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites were synthesized via the following steps. FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>·7H
 <sub>2</sub>O and H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> were dissolved in a mixed solution of de-ionized water and ethylene glycol, and GO suspension was added to the solution. Next, a mixture of LiOH·H
 <sub>2</sub>O aqueous solution and GO suspension was added into the mixed solution under constant stirring. The molar ratio of Li:Fe:P is 3:1:1. After stirring for 3 h, the solution was evaporated at 80°C for 12 h. Meanwhile, a separate sample was prepared with the GO suspension replaced by sucrose as the source of carbon, and the previous steps were repeated. Finally, the precursors obtained were pressed into pellets, and then the pellets were placed inside a quartz crucible with a cover to prevent air oxidation. The quartz crucible was put in the middle of the domestic microwave oven, and the precursors were radiated by microwave for 10 min with a maximum power of 1,500 W and a frequency of 2.45 GHz. After microwave irradiation, LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/graphene and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>/C composites were obtained, respectively.

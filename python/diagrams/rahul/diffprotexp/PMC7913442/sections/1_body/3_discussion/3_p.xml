<p id="Par43">Importantly, ~ 40% of the 717 DEGs had a FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> binding site at their promoters: 313 were identified using the TGFβ treated-HGrC1 ChIP-seq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] (annotated ChIP1) and 291 using the SVOG3e ChIP-Seq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (ChIP2). This suggests that the variations in gene expression in our system were directly related to difference in FOXL2 binding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). We considered to be important the comparison with FOXL2 ChIPseq analysis from Weis-Banke et al. (ChIP1) since it was validated with the hybrid DNA–binding sites in RNA extracted from 4 aGCT patients and, therefore, can be easily referred to as the best 
 <italic>bona fide</italic> enrichment for FOXL2 for the aGCT investigation in the current literature.

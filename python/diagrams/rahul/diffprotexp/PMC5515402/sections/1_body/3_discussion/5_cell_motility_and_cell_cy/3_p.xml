<p>CFL1, a regulatory protein of mitosis and cell migration processes (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.uniprot.com</ext-link>), was found overexpressed after 17Î±-meT exposure. This protein acts through depolymerization of actin filaments by regulating the cytoskeleton dynamics and cell morphology [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Several reports indicate that steroids mediate the CFL1 phosphorylation pathway, inducing actin filament elongation [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Specifically, estrogen stimulates LIM kinase (LIMK)-dependent phosphorylation of CFL1, which promotes filopodial extensions and spine synapse growth. Increments in LIMK activity and CFL1 phosphorylation also correlate with cell proliferation [

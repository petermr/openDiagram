<p id="Par44">In this study, we used RNA-seq analysis to evaluate the effects of AS6 on genome-wide gene expression in human mammary epithelial cells for the first time to our knowledge. The effects of AS6 were compared in primary normal cells (HUMEC) and representative malignant cancer cells (MCF7 cells). This work contributes to the field of AS6 chemotherapy by elucidating the medicinal effects of a chemical molecule through whole transcriptome analysis to better understand its molecular mechanisms and physiological impacts and by comparing the differential effects of this chemical in normal and cancerous mammary cells. Gene expression analyses provide essential information on the immediate and long-term effects of compounds on cells, which are the basic units of all life. We found that AS6 has distinctive gene expression profiles and cytotoxicity in these cancerous and normal breast epithelial cells at concentrations where AS6 differentially targets malignant cells, findings which are important to consider in developing a treatment for breast cancer based on AS6.</p>

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The GC analysis of AcEO was performed on an Agilent 5973&#160;N GC-MS coupled to an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with an injector at 250&#160;&#176;C (Splitless mode) and equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column coated with 5% phenyl-methyl siloxane (30&#160;m length&#8201;&#215;&#8201;0.25&#160;mm internal diameter&#8201;&#215;&#8201;0.25&#160;&#956;m of film thickness, Agilent 19091S-433). The column pressure was set to 51.6&#8201;&#215;&#8201;103&#160;Pa. The oven temperature was held at 40&#160;&#176;C for 2&#160;min, and then programmed to 250&#160;&#176;C at a rate of 8&#160;&#176;C/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1&#160;ml/min. Diluted sample in diethyl ether was manually injected.</p>

<p>Here, we investigate differences in protein expression between congenital and acquired cholesteatomas using proteomic analysis (for protein mass screening) and immunohistochemistry. Our data suggest that protein expression patterns in congenital cholesteatomas are quite different from those in acquired cholesteatomas and skin. The results of our study may provide clues that allow for a better understanding of congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis.</p>

0: According to different switching sites, APA events can be classified into four general types: tandem 3 UTR APA and alternative terminal exon APA, which involve cleavage in 3 UTRs; intronic APA, which is less frequent; and internal exon APA, which is the least frequent type [ 13].
1: The tandem 3 UTR APA is the most frequent APA form.
2: Association of tandem APA with various biological effects has previously been demonstrated, including cancer transformation, embryonic development, immune responses, neuronal activity [ 12,  14], as well as antiviral innate immune response [ 15,  16].
3: Thus, we analyzed the differential use of tandem APA sites located within the 3 UTR in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV GDS01.

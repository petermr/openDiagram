<italic>E. coli</italic> SHuffle strain. The SHuffle strain harbouring the ToxB expression construct was grown in Terrific Broth medium and induced with &#946;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 100&#160;&#181;M for the expression of ToxB. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 5&#160;ml binding buffer (20&#160;mM sodium phosphate, 40&#160;mM imidazole, 500&#160;mM NaCl, pH 7.4) for the purpose of downstream his-tag purification. Cells were then lysed using sonication of 10-s pulses with 10-s intervals for 1&#160;min (Sonoplus HD 3100, Bandelin, Germany). The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the ToxB protein was purified from the cell extract using HisPur Ni-NTA purification spin columns (Thermo Scientific) by gravity flow according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Purified protein was dialysed in 20&#160;mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, quantified via the bicinchoninic acid assay (Smith et al.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For the cytotoxicity assay, cells (1 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>/mL) were incubated in complete medium without or with 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, or 1 &#181;g/mL of sample solution for 24 h in the presence of 100 &#181;M tert-butyl hydroperoxide (<italic>t</italic>-BOOH). The stock solution of HEO in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were conveniently diluted with phosphate saline buffer to maintain the concentration of the DMSO below 0.1% in the reaction mixture. Parallel controls were performed without <italic>t</italic>-BOOH and in the presence of the final concentrations of HEO. After incubation, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Briefly, an aliquot of the cell suspension was diluted 1:1 (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) with 0.4% trypan blue and the cells were counted using a haemocytometer. Results were expressed as the percentage of viable or dead cells (ratio of unstained or stained cells to the total number of cells, respectively). Cytotoxicity was also measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from damaged cells into culture medium and expressed as a percentage of total cellular activity. LDH activity in the medium was determined using a commercially available kit from BioSystems S.A (Barcelona, Spain) and expressed as a function of the total amount of the enzyme present in the <italic>t</italic>-BOOH-no treated cells obtained after total cell lysis by sonication. At the concentration tested, HEO does not show any interference with the LDH assay.</p>

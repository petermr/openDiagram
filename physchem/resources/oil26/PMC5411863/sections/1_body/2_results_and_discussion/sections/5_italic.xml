These variations can be explained by the differences of mainly part of plant utilized, genotype, the plant ecotype, geographic origins or adaptive process to some particular and local ecological conditions (Chalchat et al., 1995; Djarri et al., 2008; Faidi et al., 2014). The origin of changes should be sought mainly in the differences in the nature of soil on the one hand and solar radiation on the other. Both factors involve the activation or inactivation of certain enzymatic groups, leading to the predominance of a particular biosynthetic pathway (Arruda et al., 2012).

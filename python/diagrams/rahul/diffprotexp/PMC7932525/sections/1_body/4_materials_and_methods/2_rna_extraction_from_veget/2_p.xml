<p>RNA was extracted from NDVs and NVs as described by Golden et al [

 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. To ensure that only vegetative cells were broken down, the concentration of lysozyme was low and enzymolysis time was short. The precipitate was resuspended in 1 mL lysozyme solution (1 mg/mL lysozyme in TE buffer) at 30°C for 5 min, shaking each tube for 15 s at 1-min intervals. Next, 5 mL of guanidine isothiocyanate cell lysis solution (mixed solution in the EASYspin Plus Bacteria RNA kit, Aidlab, Beijing, China) was added to terminate the reaction as quickly as possible. This solution was centrifuged to remove the precipitate, and the supernatants were used for RNA isolation according to the instructions of the EASYspin Plus Bacteria RNA kit (Aidlab). The sediment obtained after this treatment contained vegetative cells and heterocysts (

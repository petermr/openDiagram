<p>An important factor to consider in XAS measurements in fluorescence mode is the self-absorption effect. For thick and concentrated samples, the energy-dependent attenuation of the incident and emitted X-ray photons results in distortions of the spectral features. Therefore, measurements in fluorescence mode are reliable only for thin or for dilute samples. While certain strategies are available to partially correct for the self-absorption effect in the collected data,

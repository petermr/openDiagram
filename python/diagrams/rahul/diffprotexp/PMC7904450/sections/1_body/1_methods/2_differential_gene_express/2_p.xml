 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> summarizes our methodological workflow. We collected transcriptomic data from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). LINCS is a program initiated by the National Institute of Health (NIH) to create a comprehensive repository of molecular interactions and responses to internal and external stressors. The LINCS project uses the L1000 assay which measures the expression of 978 “hub” genes which represent ~82% of the information present in the transcriptome. The iLINCS Portal (

We used the iLINCS application programing interface (API) to download differential gene expression signatures. We acquired all available signatures for fluoxetine (33), paroxetine (65), bupropion (29), or dexamethasone (309) treated cell lines. In total, 436 signatures were obtained for all 4 drug treatments, with data generated in 45 different cell lines, at different timepoints (6–24 h) and different doses (0.01uM - 80uM) (

To create high-confidence gene signatures, differential gene expression data were filtered such that only those genes with a log-fold change (LFC) ≥ 0.85 or ≤ −0.85 in drug-treated versus corresponding control cell lines were included in downstream gene signature analyses. This LFC threshold was found to effectively reduce excess noise from low-difference genes and reduce signatures to their most significant components

The resulting signatures were searched against the iLINCS Consensus Gene Knockdown (CGS) database to generate similarity indices between (a) the drug treatment signatures within a given cell line and (b) individual inflammatory gene knockdown signatures for 27 inflammatory genes with a potential role in fluoxetine’s anti-inflammatory mechanism of action (i.e. drug treatment gene signatures were compared to gene knockdown signatures generated only in the same cell line).

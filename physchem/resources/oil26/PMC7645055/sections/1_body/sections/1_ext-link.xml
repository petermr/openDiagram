He remarks that hibernation (i.e., hypometabolic states lasting days or weeks), which occurs in mammals from all three subclasses but only in a single bird species, is not as seasonal as commonly thought and is strictly limited to winter in relatively few species. The expression of short bouts of daily torpor (i.e., hypometabolic states lasting a few hours) varies depending on environmental conditions and predation pressure. For this reason, the seasonal expression of torpor is not as clear-cut as commonly assumed and differs between true hibernators and daily heterotherms. Torpor is often associated with cold and seasonal habitats, but it is also common in the tropics and elsewhere at low latitudes.

 <caption> Body temperature of study aardvarks at Tswalu between July 2012 and September 2015. (A) 5-min body temperature records of two representative study aardvarks at Tswalu ( A06 and A08). (B) Overview over the 24-h body temperature profile of all study aardvarks. Grey lines represent mean 24-h body temperature of different individuals, with the individuals from panel (B) in the same colours as in panel (A). The upper red and lower blue lines display the absolute maximum and absolute minimum body temperature, respectively, of all study aardvarks within each 24-h period to indicate the total range of body temperatures reached in aardvarks. Black arrows indicate when study aardvarks died. </caption>

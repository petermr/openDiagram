<p id="par0040">Many studies on thyroid pathology used immunohistochemistry and gene-based analysis to shed light on the molecular mechanisms while only limited proteomic studies investigate thyroid pathology. Most of these studies used two dimensional gel electrophoresis and provided valuable but limited information regarding the proteome profiles of thyroid tumors

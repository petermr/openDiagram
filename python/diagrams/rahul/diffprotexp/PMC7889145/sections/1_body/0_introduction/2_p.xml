<p>Few tools have proven as powerful as the 
 <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase for the investigation of gene function in mouse models. Both spatial and temporal genetic manipulations can be performed using cell-type-specific promoters to drive the expression of 
 <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase in combination with 
 <italic>Cre</italic> recognition (loxP) sites in a gene, or genes, of interest [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several adipocyte-targeted 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mouse models have been created to facilitate the study of adipose tissue biology, function, and regulation. The 
 <italic>Fabp4</italic> (also called aP2[
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>],) promoter-driven 
 <italic>Cre</italic> mouse model was initially widely used to generate adipocyte targeted knockout mouse models but suffered from gene deletion in cells other than adipocytes, sometimes with dramatic effects [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Further attempts to create a more adipocyte-specific 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mouse model used the adiponectin (
 <italic>Adipoq</italic>) gene promoter to drive 
 <italic>Cre</italic> expression. Two groups created 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> mouse models, with one using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the other using a 5.4-kb promoter fragment to drive 
 <italic>Cre</italic> expression. These models demonstrated greatly improved selectivity for adipocytes and the model using the BAC transgene has gained wide use, with higher levels of observed recombination in adipocytes compared to the 5.4-kb promoter fragment driven 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> model [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and public availability through the Jackson Laboratory mouse repository (Stock #028020).

<p>(1d) In addition to measuring cortical thickness and counting SOX9+ and PH3+ cells, birth-dating can help support the under-proliferation/precocious neurogenesis hypothesis to test whether neural progenitor cells are exiting the cell cycle and differentiating early, migrating out of the VZ early, or both. Alternatively, an analysis of cell cycle kinetics would be useful; delayed mitosis and extended cell cycle time could contribute to the reduction in early-born cell types.</p>

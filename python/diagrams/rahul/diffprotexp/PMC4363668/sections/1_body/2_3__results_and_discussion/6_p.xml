<p>Our current study also demonstrated that several cytoskeleton proteins including vimentin, actin, cofilin-1, and thymosin beta-10 were differentially regulated. Actin was observed to be upregulated at 1 to 24 hpi. Studies demonstrate some viruses interact directly with the cytoskeletal transport machinery for intracellular transport. Study demonstrates cofilin-1 plays a central role in maintaining actin cytoskeletal dynamics by severing F-actin and allowing for reorganization and formation of new filaments [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, cofilin-1 was found to be downregulated at 1 hpi and upregulated at 8 hpi and 24 hpi. The upregulation of cofilin-1 in HBMEC at 24 hpi is accord with the previous findings on RD cells infected with EV71 MS/7423/87 strain [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We also demonstrated EV71 could lead to the apoptotic of HBMEC [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, we speculated the different expression of cofilin-1 in EV71-infected HBMEC might be involved in apoptotic cell death caused by EV71 infection: further studies focusing on the functional properties of cofilin-1 and predictive value for EV71 infection may permit identification of biomarkers for EV71 infection and development of new therapeutic methods. Vimentin is the major IF protein in mesenchymal cells, which mainly assigned functions in maintaining the structural and mechanical integrity of cells and also participates in a number of critical cellular processes such as adhesion, migration and cell signalling. Vimentin was observed to be downregulated at 1 to 24 hpi. This may be due to decreased expression of vimentin is associated with inhibiting the proliferation of HBMEC. Vimentin is mainly located in the cytoplasm, but cell surface-expressed vimentin has been reported as EV71 receptor in human astrocyte cell [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It was also found that vimentin expression was downregulated by western analysis at 1 hpi, 16 hpi, and 24 hpi. Vimentin and other cytoskeletal filaments have been shown to play important roles in virus entry and/or infection for many viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1, Japanese encephalitis virus, vaccinia virus, adenovirus type 2, herpes simplex virus type 1, hepatitis C virus [

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The studies present here are the basis to understand the interaction between viruses and the cell cytoskeleton; however, further specific experiments will define the exact mechanism of cytoskeleton in EV71-infected HBMEC (

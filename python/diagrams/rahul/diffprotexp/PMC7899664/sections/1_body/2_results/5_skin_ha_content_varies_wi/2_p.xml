<p>In ventral skin, HA levels are largely consistent over time in both male and female mice. After weaning, however, HA levels in murine dorsal skin overall tends to increase in both male and female mice groups. In accordance with that overall finding, the dorsal skin of male mice showed a fairly consistent accumulation of HA over the time period followed, though this increase was not statistically significant from week to week. In contrast, levels of HA in the dorsal skin of female mice appeared closely temporally related to the known pattern of hair cycling in mice, with spikes in HA content at both 6 and 15 weeks (anogen phase) and apparent downregulation at 8 and 24 weeks (catogen phase). Estimation of correlation revealed low to moderate correlation between overall HA levels in both dorsal and ventral skin of combined sexes with age (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.364 and 
 <italic>p</italic>=.0043). Correlation between HA in dorsal and age, and HA in ventral skin and age in combined sexes revealed similar low to moderate correlation (Dorsal skin: Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.397 and 
 <italic>p</italic>=.0296; Ventral skin: Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.497 and 
 <italic>p</italic>=.0051). When correlation between HA levels in skin and age were calculated separately for each sex, the analysis showed no significant positive correlation in female mice (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.131 and 
 <italic>p</italic>=.488), but showed a moderate to medium correlation in male mice (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.618 and 
 <italic>p</italic>=.0003).

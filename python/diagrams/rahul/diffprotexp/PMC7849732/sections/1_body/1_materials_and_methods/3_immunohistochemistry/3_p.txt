0: The next day, spinal cord sections were rinsed in PBS (3 times x 5 min) and incubated in secondary antibodies, diluted in the blocking solution, for 2 h. The mixture of secondary antibodies used was the following: goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor647 (1:1000; Invitrogen, A21235) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) H + L (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).
1: After washes in PBS, a tyramide signal amplification (TSA) reaction was performed using the signal amplification fluorescent kit conjugated with the fluorophore cyanine 3 (cy3) (TSA plus cyanine 3 system, Perkin Elmer, Inc., NEL744001KT).
2: A dilution factor of 1:50 in the TSA amplification buffer was used.
3: The amplification time was 2.5 min (GluN2A) or 7.5 min (GluN2B and GluN2D).
4: The resultant enzymatic reaction allows for cy3 to be deposited and thus, the optimal detection and visualization of labeled NMDAR subunits [ 30, 31].
5: A Hoechst 33258 Staining Dye Solution (1:1000; Abcam, ab228550) was also used to stain for nuclei (data not shown).
6: Slides were then cover-slipped in Fluoromount TM Aqueous Mounting Medium (Sigma, F4680-25ML) prior to imaging.

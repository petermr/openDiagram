<p>Finally, specific comparisons allow for the investigation of regulatory differences between tumours classified according to various parameters: survival time [

In the same vein, the differential co-expression module multivariate analysis method MultiDCox has been applied to breast cancer, revealing gene sets associated with mutant p53, ER status and grade [

<p id="Par34">The proteins corresponding to the 32 differential protein spots were subjected to GO analysis. Only 26 of the 32 differentially expressed proteins were annotated through data analysis. The main biological processes involving these differentially expressed proteins are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a; specifically, 65.38% (17 proteins) were cellular components or involved in biogenesis, 61.53% (16 proteins) were involved in the positive regulation of biological processes, 50% (13 proteins) were associated with cell death, and 42.3% (11 proteins) were involved in programmed cell death. These findings indicate that the differences in the apoptotic process may be the cause of the differences in the host cells infected by different subtypes of influenza viruses. The cellular components are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, with 65.38% (17 proteins) belonging to the organelle component. The molecular functions of the differentially expressed proteins are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c; 84.61% (22 proteins) were involved in binding, including protein binding, DNA binding and other molecular binding functions. These findings indicate that the binding proteins have an important role in host infection with different subtypes of influenza viruses.

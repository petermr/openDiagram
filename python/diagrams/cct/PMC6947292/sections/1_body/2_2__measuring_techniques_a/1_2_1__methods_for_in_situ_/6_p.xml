 <xref rid="B100-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. However, since the recording of single data points takes at least a few minutes (and up to some hours if the spectra are to be decomposed), this technique would be very slow for in situ cooling experiments [
 <xref rid="B101-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This is probably one reason why no in situ cooling experiments have been published, to the knowledge of the authors.

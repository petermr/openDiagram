  <p>miRNAs and their target genes located in the known seed size/weight associated QTLs. (a) Heatmap showing expression of miRNAs located within the known seed size/weight associated QTLs and exhibit differential expression between S3 and/or S5 stages of chickpea cultivars. (b) Enriched biological process GO terms among the targets of QTLs located miRNAs shown in (a). (c) The network of miRNAs (red triangles) given in (a) and their targets (green ovals) are shown. (d) Heatmap showing expression profile of the target genes of the QTL located miRNAs along with their annotation. The color scales shown in (a) and (d) represent Z‚Äêscore determined based on the normalized expression values of miRNAs and target genes, respectively</p>

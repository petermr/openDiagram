 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4(s)</sub> with ferric chloride, ammonium hydroxide, and ammonium acetate. The solid product required calcination at 450 Â°C to obtain Co doped ferrite. Finally, this product served as a catalyst for destroying methylene blue, which is a major contaminant in the textile industry effluent. Yang et al. obtained by precipitation a high performance NMC active material (239 mAh/g), but showing a low stability under cycling (81.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles) [

<p id="Par50">In order to confirm the validity of the RNA-Seq based transcript abundance of genes, a qRT-PCR analysis of five DEGs was performed; 
 <italic>Ma10_g08300</italic> (membrane transport proteins), 
 <italic>Ma03_g32580</italic> (TCP family transcription factor), 
 <italic>Ma07_g22600</italic> (probable mannan synthase 11 isoform X1), 
 <italic>Ma06_g04390</italic> (gibberellin-regulated protein 6), and 
 <italic>Ma08_g05160</italic> (cellulose synthase-like protein). The 
 <italic>Actin</italic> and 
 <italic>Histone</italic> genes were used as internal controls. The qRT-PCR profiles of the five selected genes matched with the RNA-seq based results, which validates the useability of the Illumina sequencing results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

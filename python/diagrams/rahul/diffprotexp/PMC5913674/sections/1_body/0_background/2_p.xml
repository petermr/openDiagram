 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>G. lamblia, G. intestinalis</italic>) is a parasitic protist responsible for between 200 and 300 million cases of diarrheal disease (giardiasis) annually [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This microaerophile exhibits fermentative glycolysis coupled to an antioxidant system that maintains an electron-rich (i.e., highly reduced) intracellular environment. Chemotherapeutic treatments for giardiasis are limited but remain the primary treatment option, targeting the trophozoite, which is the infective life stage that attaches to the gastro-epithelial lining of the proximal small intestine [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nitroheterocyclics, in particular Mtz, remain the predominant class against these parasites. However, the efficacy of frontline Mtz treatment ranges from 73 to 100% in

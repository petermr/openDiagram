0: To further demonstrate the role of SMAD3 as a molecular partner of FOXL2 C134W in aGCT progression on a genome-wide level, we carried out RNA-seq analysis in HGrC1 overexpressing FOXL2 C134W together with SMAD3, compared to FOXL2 WT/SMAD3 as a control.
1: We further explored the FOXL2 antagonistic tumor-suppressive transcription factor FOXO1 [ 35] to study its influence on the SMAD3/FOXL2 C134W induced alterations.
2: FOXO factors are considered as tumor suppressors for their parts in the initiation of apoptotic process and in the cell cycle arrest [ 40].
3: We report that FOXL2 C134W over-expression was associated with altered signaling pathways previously recognized by transcriptomic studies from GC in situ [ 13,  37], and additionally identified novel candidate FOXL2 C134W targets.
4: Furthermore, we observed that FOXO1 strongly mitigated the overall FOXL2 C134W action with important implications for both aGCT onset and future therapeutic development.

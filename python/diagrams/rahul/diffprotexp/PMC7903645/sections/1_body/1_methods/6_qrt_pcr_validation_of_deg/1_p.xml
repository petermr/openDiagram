<p id="Par38">Total RNA was extracted from the frozen blood samples using a PAXgene Blood RNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality was verified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA quantity was determined using a NanoDrop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Genes were selected based on higher statistical significance, greater absolute fold-changes, and clinical significance and were tested by qRT-PCR to confirm the results of RNA-Seq analysis. DEFA3 (defensin alpha 3), JUN (jun proto-oncogene), ELANE (neutrophil elastase), and CD177 (CD177 molecule) were selected for validation experiments between the CI and control groups, whereas CEACAM8 (CEA cell adhesion molecule 8), CRISP3 (cysteine-rich secretory protein 3), DEFA3, and RNASE3 (ribonuclease A family member 3) were selected to confirm the differential expression between the CI-preterm and CI-term groups. Four micrograms of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with a Maxime RT PreMix Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seoul, South Korea). PCRs were performed using 2× Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN) in the Rotor-Gene Q (QIAGEN). Primer sequences are shown in Supplemental Table

0: Total fresh protein extracts were isolated from HCAECs using enhanced radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche).
1: Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo) was used for protein quantification.
2: Equal protein samples (30100 g) were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels.
3: The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-E-selectin (1:500 dilutions, CST, Danvers, USA), mouse anti-GAPDH (1:1,000 dilutions, OriGene, Beijing, China).
4: Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilutions, Proteintech, Wuhan, China) were used to detect primary antibody binding.

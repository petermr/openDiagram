0: The interactions between miR-3653-3p and circ_0003865 or the 3 UTR region of the GAS1 gene were verified using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: Briefly, the circ_0003865 sequences and its mutant version, as well as the GAS1 3 UTR sequences and its mutant version, were amplified by RT-PCR and were ligated into PmirGLO plasmids.
2: The plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using the Lipofectamine TM 2000 transfection kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions, along with miR-3653-3p mimics or a negative control.
3: Subsequently, the cells were lysed using the Passive Lysis Buffer and analyzed using the GloMax-20/20 luminometer (#E5311; Promega).
4: At least three biological replicates were conducted for comparison of luciferase activities between groups.

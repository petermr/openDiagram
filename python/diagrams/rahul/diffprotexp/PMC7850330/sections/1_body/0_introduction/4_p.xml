<p>Sulpiride, an antipsychotic drug, is a selective dopamine receptor antagonist. It has high affinity to D2 and D4 receptors.

Based on this finding, it can be speculated that the drug can have a beneficial effect in the management of allergic rhinitis inflammatory manifestations. Sulpiride experiences a limited oral bioavailability not more than 27% due to its poor water solubility (Zidan et al.,

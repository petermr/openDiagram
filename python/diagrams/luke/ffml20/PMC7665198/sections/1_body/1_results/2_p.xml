<p id="Par5">To elucidate the role of water molecules on accelerated damage-repair cycles in hydrophobic copolymers, we considered inter- and intrachain interactions of CH, CH
 <sub>2</sub>, and CH
 <sub>3</sub> groups along the copolymer backbone and side chains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). If water molecules alter van der Waals (vdW) hydrophobic interactions, of primary interest are through-space CH
 <sub>3b</sub>–CH
 <sub>2b</sub> and CH
 <sub>3m</sub>–CH

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), air-cut/air-healed (Fig 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d), and air-cut/water-healed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) copolymers. The intensities of CH

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, curve a) and CH
 <sub>3b</sub>–CH
 <sub>2b</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, curve b) resonances initially increase, and as self-healing progresses, they diminish at different rates; the CH
 <sub>3m</sub>–CH
 <sub>b</sub> (curve a) resonance decreases faster, but at the initial stages of self-healing increases to level off after 120 min; the CH
 <sub>3b</sub>–CH
 <sub>2b</sub> (curve b) resonance continually decreases to level off upon self-healing. The initial increase of both resonances is attributed to shorter through-space distances of the backbone and side groups likely resulting from the compression of neighboring copolymer chains during mechanical damage, which are gradually restored to their original state. These results are further supported by a series of NOESY and COSY 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR experiments (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), indicating that the presence of water forces chains into closer proximity after mechanical damage, thereby decreasing the time necessary for repair, but longer H
 <sub>2</sub>O exposure times diminish interchain side- group interactions, likely due to H-bonding in the proximity of hydrophilic esters of MMA and nBA side-group acceptors of polar water molecules. The values for undamaged copolymers do not change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, curve c), and the intensities of a′, a″, b′, and b″ resonances for all NMR experiments are shown in Supplementary Table

<p>Here, we used a combined approach of single-cell sequencing together with bulk sequencing of both 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ookinete stages to address variance of expression in this stage. We find that single-cell sequencing is a powerful tool to address transcriptional variance in ookinetes, a stage where the common consensus is that little to no transcriptional variance occurs. Previous studies indicated that the ookinete transcriptome is somewhat “hard-wired” and made up of a mixture of derepressed maternally inherited transcripts together with new transcripts that are controlled by the ookinete-specific transcription factor AP2-O (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>). Although the vast majority of transcriptional variation observed resulted from developmental differences in individual parasites, we developed a framework that allowed us to identify a small number of genes that do display variable expression patterns that are responsive to the host condition.

<p>The multilinear profile of the Weberâ€“Morris plot that did not pass through the origin of the coordinate system indicates more than one diffusion step. The rapidly increasing first curve (k

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-08230-f011">Figure 11</xref>c suggests that intra-particle diffusion mainly controls the uptake of DOX on the modified MWCNTs, but what is more, is also affected by the boundary layer diffusion process [

  <p>Functional annotation of significant DMRs reveals differential methylation at alternative 
   <italic>MAP2K3</italic> exons leading to coordinated MKK3 expression. 
   <bold>a</bold> KEGG pathway analysis of CNF and PNF methylation profiles confirms that multiple pathways are regulated epigenetically including growth factor, inflammatory, pain signaling and oxytocin pathways. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> Differential methylation was observed in upstream regulatory sites in 
   <italic>MAP2K3</italic> that control alternative leading exon expression. 
   <bold>d</bold> Western blot analysis of MKK3 protein (actin loading control). Beta-values for tumor-type DMRs (DMR1/DMR2) shown below. 
   <bold>e</bold> DMR1 beta-values correlate strongly with MKK3/Actin ratio expression values (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; = − 0.846)

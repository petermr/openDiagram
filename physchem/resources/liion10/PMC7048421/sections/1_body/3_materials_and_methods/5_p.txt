0: Cycle aging tests of the pouch cells were performed using a Land instrument battery testing system (Model CT2001B, Land Instruments).
1: A forced-air oven was used to control different ambient temperatures.
2: For each aging cycle, the cell was charged to 4.2 V at a constant current of 2.8 A (1C-rate) and then charged at a constant voltage of 4.2 V until the current decreased to 0.14 A (C/20).
3: After resting for 5 min, the cell was discharged to 2.8 V at a constant current of 2.8 A (1C-rate) followed by a final rest period of 5 min.
4: When the aging cycle number reached a specific value (e.g., 403, 1006 cycles), the cell was cycled at a charge and discharge rate of C/3 to determine the capacity (designated as C/3 capacity) of the cell.
5: For impedance tests at different temperatures, the cells were fully charged and then discharged at a rate of C/3 to 90% SOC.
6: Impedance testing was performed with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 50 kHz to 0.005 Hz.
7: For DCR test, the cells were fully charged and then discharged to 50% SOC at C/3-rate.
8: A discharge rate of 5C and a charge rate of 3.75C were used to determine the value of DCR Discharge and DCR Charge.

<p>Using the KEGG database, we constructed a differentially expressed mRNA interaction network aiming at studying the molecule interaction in the TC-EC model. Cytoscape software v3.7.2. was used to construct and visualize the network. In the network, the degree of a gene was defined as the number of directly linked genes within a network, which could assess the relative significance of a gene within the network. Meanwhile, the character of a gene was also described by betweenness centrality, which was an indicator of a geneâ€™s centrality in a network. Betweenness centrality was equal to the number of shortest paths from all of the vertices to all of the others that passed through that gene (

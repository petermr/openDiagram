<p>Mean change in IFN gene expression between CLE and HV was sevenfold (p=0.016) in whole blood RNA and ninefold (p=0.002) in skin tape-derived RNA (

These data indicate that in patients presenting with active CLE skin lesions, skin tape-derived RNA may be as sensitive—perhaps even more sensitive—than blood RNA for the assessment of IFN gene signature expression.

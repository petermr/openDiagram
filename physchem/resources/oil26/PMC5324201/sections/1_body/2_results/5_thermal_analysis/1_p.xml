<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The thermal analysis data are shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>. The thermal decomposition of the root powder comes through three common stages. In the first stage, broad and shallow endothermic DTA curve observed at 81.7&#160;&#176;C. In the second stage of decomposition is occurred on the DTA curve at 328.3&#160;&#176;C. A mass loss with a rate of 0.151&#160;mg/min (at 75.9&#160;&#176;C) by heating the sample up to 0.373&#160;mg/min (at 257&#160;&#176;C) is mentioned by the DTG curve. The highest mass loss was indicated in the second stage at 92.7% of TG at 275.7&#160;&#176;C and 1.167&#160;mg/min at 328.3&#160;&#176;C of DTG curve. At this stage, pyrolysis was obtained when the temperature increased from 250 to 380&#160;&#176;C. Lignin decomposition was occurring in the range of 380&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C. The residual carbonaceous material in the previous steps was burnt at from 275 to 550&#160;&#176;C presenting an endothermic TG curve. The charred residue was produced by the destruction of low molecular compounds in the third and final stage of decomposition and yielded an ash residue. Finally, no mass loss was detected when the temperature increased from 550&#160;&#176;C to 800&#160;&#176;C. Representative thermo-gravimetric spectrum of the root is shown in additional file (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S6).<table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Results of TG and DTG (mass loss and temperature) of <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. root powder</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Events</th><th colspan="2">TG</th><th colspan="2">DTG</th></tr><tr><th>Mass loss (%)</th><th>T<sub>onset</sub>-T<sub>offset</sub> (<sup>O</sup>C)</th><th>Mass loss (mg/min)</th><th>T<sub>onset</sub>-T<sub>offset</sub> (<sup>O</sup>C)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First step</td><td char="." align="char">92.7</td><td>T<sub>room</sub>-275</td><td>0.151</td><td>T<sub>room</sub>-75.9</td></tr><tr><td>Second step</td><td char="." align="char">53.3</td><td>276&#8211;327</td><td>0.373</td><td>76&#8211;257</td></tr><tr><td>Third step</td><td char="." align="char">29.6</td><td>328&#8211;358</td><td>1.167</td><td>258&#8211;328</td></tr><tr><td>% Residue</td><td char="." align="char">25.9</td><td>359&#8211;550</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was used to discover potential interacting proteins for specific protein markers discovered using MS. The databases used include IntAct, Molecular INTeraction database (MINT), Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP), UniProt, BHF-UCL, MatrixDB, and (Interologous Interaction Database (I2D-IMEx). All interacting proteins were filtered to show only mouse proteins in the interactome.

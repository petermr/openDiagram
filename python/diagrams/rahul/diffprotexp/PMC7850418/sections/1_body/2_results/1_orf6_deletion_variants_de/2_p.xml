<p>Of these 229 samples, 6 sequences were shown to carry a 34-nt deletion (at position 27267–27300), henceforth denoted as D34, and 1 sequence a 26-nt deletion (at position 27267–27292), denoted as D26 (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These deletions are both frameshifting deletions in the ORF6, starting at the same 27267 position after a stretch of 3 T at 27264–27266 (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Because of the frameshifting, the D34 variant generates a premature stop codon (at position 27308, Wuhan-Hu-1 numbering), resulting in a presumed truncated 24 amino acid protein, instead of 61 in the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1 and all other sequences described yet). The D26 variant yields a 28 amino acid protein with its premature stop codon at position 27312 (Wuhan-Hu-1 numbering) (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(C)). These deletions have not yet been described on the CoV-GLUE resource, which lists all genomic variants in SARS-CoV-2 sequences available on the GISAID database (Supplementary Figure 1). Of note, D26 is annotated at different positions in CoV-GLUE to maximize amino acid alignment (27265–27290).

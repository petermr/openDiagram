<p>Pigmentation changes in this model are not mutually exclusive with the suppression of cell growth, which supports the idea of multiple signaling pathways and molecular networks operating differentially to generate a reduction in cell proliferation with differentially hyper or hypopigmentation phenotypes. Perhaps the latter, as a consequence of the phenotype associated with senescence due to 5-Brd-2′-dU exposure, evidence widely reported in other models where 5-Brd-2′-dU generates hypopigmentation [

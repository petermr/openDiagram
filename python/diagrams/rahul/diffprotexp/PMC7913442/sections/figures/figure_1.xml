  <p>Transcriptome analysis of the human granulosa HGrC1 cell line under different transfection conditions. 
   <bold>a</bold> Schematic summary of study design. FOXL2
   <sup>WT</sup>/FOXL2
   <sup>C134W</sup> were in pCS2 + expression plasmid constructs; FOXO1
   <sup>3A</sup> in pCDNA3 expression construct to minimize promoter competition. 
   <bold>b</bold> Principal component 1 and 2 from all samples of the study, color-coded as indicated in the legend. Principal components were calculated on vst-normalized expression values from the top 500 most variable genes across samples. (SMAD3 was co-transfected with the other protein constructs per Methods but is omitted in the legend for brevity). 
   <bold>c</bold> Venn diagram showing the number of differential genes (DESeq, q &lt; 0.05) identified in 3 pairs of conditions: FOXL2
   <sup>WT</sup> vs Vectors, FOXL2
   <sup>C134W</sup> vs Vectors and FOXL2
   <sup>C134W</sup> vs FOXL2
   <sup>WT</sup>. 
   <bold>d</bold> Heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the 717 DEGs between FOXL2
   <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
   <sup>WT</sup> in all 5 conditions. Expression values are z-score normalized across samples (columns)

<p>In our RNA seq analysis, we found that the expression of stress regulators 
 <italic>spxA</italic> and 
 <italic>sigB</italic>, including SigB-specific genes, were downregulated. YjbH is involved in the proteolysis of Spx, a stress regulator required for oxidative stress tolerance [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the absence of YjbH, Spx is accumulated, which represses its own expression [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The other stress regulator, SigB, is known to regulate a wide range of genes including many virulence factors [
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Despite its ability to regulate virulence-related genes, the in vivo role of SigB in pathogenicity is disease model specific. For instance, 
 <italic>sigB</italic> gene-deficient mutant was found to be less virulent in mouse models of arthritis [
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and intraperitoneal infection [
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; whereas mouse model of the abscess and hematogenous pyelonephritis [
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and a rat model of osteomyelitis [
 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] found no role of SigB in virulence of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>. Similarly, the absence of SigB causes reduced pigmentation irrespective of the presence of YjbH or Spx, and the absence of Spx was required for the enhanced proteolytic activity of 
 <italic>sigB-yjbH</italic> double gene disruptant [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, regulatory cross talks might exist between the stress regulators such as Spx, SigB, and YjbH, a detailed elucidation of which is further required.

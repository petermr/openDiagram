<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Prior studies found that the &#8216;master&#8217; tumor suppressor <italic>TP53</italic> duplicated multiple times in elephants (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abegglen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Sulak et al., 2016</xref>), motivating us to further study duplication of genes involved in <italic>TP53</italic>-related pathways in Proboscidea. We traced the evolution of genes in the TP53 pathway that appeared in one or more Reactome pathway enrichments for genes duplicated recently in the African Elephant, which has the most complete genome among Proboscideans and for which several RNA-Seq data sets are available. We found that the initial duplication of TP53 in Tethytheria, where body size expanded, was preceded by the duplication of <italic>GTF2F1</italic> and <italic>STK11</italic> in Paenungulata and was coincident with the duplication of <italic>BRD7</italic>. These three genes are involved in regulating the transcription of <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Liang and Mills, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Launonen, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Drost et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Burrows et al., 2010</xref>), and their duplication prior to that of <italic>TP53</italic> may have facilitated re-functionalization of <italic>TP53</italic> retroduplicates. Interestingly, <italic>STK11</italic> is also tumor suppressor that mediates tumor suppression via p21-induced senescence (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Launonen, 2005</xref>). The other genes that are duplicated in the pathway are downstream of <italic>TP53</italic>; these genes duplicated either coincident with <italic>TP53</italic>, as in the case of <italic>SIAH1</italic>, or subsequently in Proboscidea, Elephantidae, or extant elephants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These genes are expressed in RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that they are functional.</p>

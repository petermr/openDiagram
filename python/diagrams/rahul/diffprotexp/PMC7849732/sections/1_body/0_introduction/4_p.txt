0: Based on available studies in male rodents, three of the four GluN2 isoforms are expressed in the dorsal horn  GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D [ 9].
1: Both transcript [ 14] and protein [ 15] levels for GluN2C have been found to be either negligible or undetected in the dorsal horn, including recent findings using single-cell sequencing approaches [ 16].
2: Despite molecular and functional evidence for GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D expression in the dorsal horn [ 1724], there are considerable discrepancies on the relative localization of these subunits across dorsal horn laminae as well as their contributions to responses at dorsal horn synapses.
3: Reconciling results between these individual studies is often challenging given different types of functional measures (e.g.
4: spontaneous and evoked synaptic responses versus agonist-evoked responses), a lack of investigation into contributions from all possible GluN2 subunit types, and variations between the subpopulations of dorsal horn neurons under study.
5: An unbiased approach is therefore urgently needed to compare the relative expression and localization of GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D across the dorsal horn in both sexes.
6: Given the emerging roles for specific NMDARs, such as GluN2B, in pathological spinal pain processing [ 25, 26], this information will provide a foundational understanding on baseline expression of NMDAR subunits for future studies into how their dysregulation may drive chronic pain.

0: Tissues were stored in 4% PFA overnight and subsequently suspended in increasing concentrations of sucrose in phosphate buffer saline.
1: Tissue blocks were made by embedding them in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (OCT) and sectioned using a microtome.
2: The sections were fixed in acetone and suspended in PBS.
3: Antigen retrieval was done by incubating the tissues in citrate buffer at 97 C for 20 s. After blocking of non specific binding sites using 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), overnight incubation with primary antibody was carried out.
4: For single immunofluorescence staining with ALDH1A2 antibody overnight incubation (1:100 dilutions) was done.
5: For double and triple immunofluorescence staining, all the primary antibodies in 1:100 dilutions, anti GFAP (goat, Abcam, UK), anti Vimentin (mouse, Abcam, UK), anti ALDH1A2, and anti CYR61 were added simultaneously and incubated overnight.

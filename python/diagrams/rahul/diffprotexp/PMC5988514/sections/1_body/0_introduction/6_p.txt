0: Many studies on thyroid pathology used immunohistochemistry and gene-based analysis to shed light on the molecular mechanisms while only limited proteomic studies investigate thyroid pathology.
1: Most of these studies used two dimensional gel electrophoresis and provided valuable but limited information regarding the proteome profiles of thyroid tumors  [8],  [9],  [10].
2: Recently, Martinez-Aguilar et al.
3: used advanced mass spectrometry technologies and demonstrated that actin cytoskeleton dynamics, differentiation markers and cell contact molecules were highly changed in PTC  [11].

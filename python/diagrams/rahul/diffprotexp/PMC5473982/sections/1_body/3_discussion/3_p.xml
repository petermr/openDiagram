<p>Heterophils specifically expressed granular proteins MPO, LYZ, LYG2, RSFR, LECT2, CATHL1, CATHL2, CTSL1, CTSG, OTFB, SERPINB1 and MMP9, and endoplasmic reticulum proteins SSR1, PDIA4, PDIA6, PPIB, BiP, HSP90B1 and CANX. The latter group of proteins is activated when lumenal conditions in endoplasmic reticulum are altered or chaperone capacity is overwhelmed by unfolded or misfolded proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Induction of an unfolded protein response leads to neutrophil degranulation in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and based on our results, a similar response can be predicted also in chicken heterophils.

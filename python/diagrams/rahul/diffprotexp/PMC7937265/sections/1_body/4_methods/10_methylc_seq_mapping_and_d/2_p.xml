<p id="Par57">Methylation levels were determined by “weighted methylation”, which is the number of methylated cytosines divided by the total number of cytosines for a given region, weighting the data by sequence coverage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This was performed for both CpG and non-CpG methylation. We used a LMM with adult ID as the random effect to determine if mCG or mCH levels differed between treatments within genomic features. We categorized genomic features using Ensembl (version 3.2.4), including 2 Kb upstream of the TSS (i.e., potential promoter) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], gene body (exons and introns), and 2 Kb downstream of the transcription termination site (TTS).

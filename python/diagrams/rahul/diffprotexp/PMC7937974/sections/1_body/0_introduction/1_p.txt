0: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that was first described by Tomisaku ( 1).
1: The coronary arteries are the most affected vessels ( 2), now the leading cause of acquired heart disease in developed countries ( 3).
2: The incidence of coronary artery lesion (CAL) varies from regions and races ( 4) [19% in the UK ( 5), 3.2% in the USA ( 6), 3.5% in Canada ( 7), 15.9% in Shanghai ( 8), and 9.7% in Japan ( 9)].
3: Although the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to be effective in decreasing the incidence of CAL formation in the acute phase ( 10), the pathophysiological mechanism of CAL formation remains unknown.
4: Orenstein et al.
5: ( 11) demonstrated three interrelated processes of CAL formation in autopsy specimens from patients who died of KD with cardiovascular events.
6: The studies showed that the infiltration of neutrophils in the vascular wall was stimulated by the damage of endothelial cells at an early stage, resulting in a dysfunction of vascular barrier functions ( 11,  12).
7: The infiltration of inflammatory cells depends on adhesion molecules and selectin family, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and E-selectin, etc.
8: ( 13).

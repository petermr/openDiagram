0: The analysis of the essential oil was performed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 II GC, equipped with a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25  m) and a HP 5972 mass selective detector for the separation.
1: The mass selective detector was operated in electron-impact ionization (EI) mode with a mass scan range from  m/ z 30 to 550 at 70 eV.
2: Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3: The initial temperature at 50 C, held for 1 min, ramped at 5 C/min to 280 C and held for 1 min.
4: Injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 230 and 300 C, respectively.
5: The oven temperature was programmed as in the GC-FID analysis.
6: A sample of 1  L of 1% essential oil was injected manually using a 1:10 split ratio.
7: Most components were identified by comparing their GC retention indices which were determined in relation to a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C8-C24) under the same operating conditions, NIST mass spectral search program (version 2.0, National Institute of Standards and Technology), and mass spectra with publish data.
8: Component relative percentages were calculated based on GC peak areas without using correction factors.

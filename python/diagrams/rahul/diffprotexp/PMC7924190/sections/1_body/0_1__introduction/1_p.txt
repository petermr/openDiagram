0: Endogenous electric fields (EFs) and wound currents are generated spontaneously in many tissues following injury and are present at the wound site during the process of wound healing [ 1].
1: Dynamic changes in wound-generated electric currents demonstrate that electrical signaling is an active response to injury [ 2].
2: Many types of cells respond to weak direct current (DC) EFs with a galvanotropic response (polarized shifting of cellular orientation in an EF), which is followed by a galvanotaxic response (migration of a cell in an EF) [ 3].
3: Different cell types from the same tissue can respond differently to the same electrical signal.
4: Peculiar differences in Ca 2+, Na +, and K + channels, surface charges, and specific membrane resistance may contribute to the inherent directional movement of cells during applied EFs [ 4].
5: In the cornea, injury-induced corneal wound currents directly correlate with the wound healing rate.
6: In physiological conditions, the human cornea shows small outward currents (0.07 A/cm2), which simultaneously increase up to 5-fold upon wounding (0.41 A/cm2) for approximately 6 h [ 5].
7: The human corneal epithelium contains an active Na +/K +-ATPase transport system, with an inward flow of sodium ions and active outward transport of Cl  ions across the stroma and epithelium, establishing a trans-epithelial potential difference.
8: Wounding disrupts this potential difference and consequently leads to the flow of Na + and K + into the wound from the surrounding tissue, generating a laterally orientated physiological EF that can direct orientation and migration of corneal epithelial cells and enhance the epithelial wound healing rate by controlling the division axis in epithelial cells [ 6, 7].

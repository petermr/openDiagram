<p>Although the aardvarks did not experience a wide range of nightly behavioral diversity, there were a few notable findings. Warthog scented towels and cricket containers were found to produce the highest behavioral diversity and perfumed Boomer balls
 <sup>®</sup> the lowest. Behavioral diversity, which is calculated to include the breadth of behaviors displayed as well as their frequency, is thought to be an indicator of welfare, with higher levels of behavioral diversity equating to positive welfare [

The variation in behavioral diversity seen here may indicate that some enrichment items, but not stated goals of enrichment, had a stronger impact on the aardvarks’ welfare or were more functionally meaningful than others. However, our findings also highlight some of the potential drawbacks of behavioral diversity as a welfare indicator that Cronin and Ross [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have previously reported. Enrichment use and behavioral diversity were not independent of each other, as investigating enrichment was a behavior recorded. In addition, the calculation of behavioral diversity in this study relied on broad behavior categories, which were necessitated by the difficulty in discerning detailed behaviors using our video system, but could have diminished the behavioral diversity results. Finally, providing enrichment to promote a specific goal behavior may have caused an increase in one specific behavior instead of increasing the variety of behaviors. This could have caused lower behavioral diversity results, and if that was the case, lower behavioral diversity may not be indicative of an individual’s welfare. Given these limitations of behavioral diversity as a welfare indicator, the reason for a decrease in behavioral diversity over the course of the study is unclear.

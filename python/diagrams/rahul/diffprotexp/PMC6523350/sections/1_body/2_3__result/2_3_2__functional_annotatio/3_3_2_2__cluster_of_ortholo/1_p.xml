<p>Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins is a database for the orthologous classification of proteins. We compared the identified differential proteins with the COG database to predict the possible functions of these proteins and then performed functional classification statistics on them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00130-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The top-5 most expressed COG class were: R, O, J, G and C. The number of expressed proteins in each class were 452, 341, 235, 234 and 214, respectively. The function inferred to each class was: general functional predictions (16.91%); protein conversion, translational modification, chaperone (12.76%); participation in translation, ribosome structure and biogenesis (8.8%); carbohydrate transport and metabolism (8.7%); and energy generation and conversion (8%). The result revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in post-translational modifications, and carbohydrates and ribosomal transport. They also participated to some extent in energy production and amino acid transport.

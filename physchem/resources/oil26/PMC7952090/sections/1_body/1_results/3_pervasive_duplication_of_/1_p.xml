<p>Our hypothesis was that genes which duplicated coincident with the evolution of increased body mass (IBM) and reduced intrinsic cancer risk (RICR) would be uniquely enriched in tumor suppressor pathways compared to genes that duplicated in other lineages. Therefore, we identified duplicated genes in each Afrotherian lineage (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and tested if they were enriched in Reactome pathways related to cancer biology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, 
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No pathways related to cancer biology were enriched in either the Pseudoungulata (67.36-fold IBM, 13.37-log
 <sub>2</sub> RICR), but few genes were inferred to be duplicated in this lineage reducing power to detect enriched pathways. Consistent with our hypothesis, 18.18% of the pathways that were enriched in the Paenungulate stem-lineage (1.45-fold IBM, 1.17-log
 <sub>2</sub> RICR), 63% of the pathways that were enriched in the Tethytherian stem-lineage (11.82-fold IBM, 7.84-log
 <sub>2</sub> RICR), and 38.81% of the pathways that were enriched in the Proboscidean stem-lineage (1.06-fold IBM, 3.14-log
 <sub>2</sub> RICR) were related to tumor suppression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, 
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, 21.28% and 38.00% of the pathways that were enriched in manatee (1.11-fold IBM, 0.89-log
 <sub>2</sub> RICR) and aardvark (67.36-fold IBM, 1.49-log
 <sub>2</sub> RICR), respectively, were related to tumor suppression. In contrast, only 2.86% of the pathways that were enriched in hyrax (1.6-fold IBM, 1.49-log
 <sub>2</sub> RICR) were related to tumor suppression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, 
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, lineages without major increases in body size or lifespan, or decreases in intrinsic cancer risk, were also enriched for tumor suppressor pathways. For example, 13.85%, 37.04%, and 22.00% of the pathways that were enriched in the stem-lineages of Afroinsectivoa and Afrosoricida, and in 
 <italic>E. telfairi</italic>, respectively, were related to cancer biology (

<p>First dimension was carried out with an Ettan IPGphor apparatus (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). Samples were loaded on 24 cm long Immobiline DryStrips gels with non-linear immobilized pH gradient 3–10 by overnight rehydration. Each gel contained the internal standard and one of the samples (analytical gels, after saturation labeling) or pooled material in the case of the preparative gel strip. Isoelectric focusing was carried out at a constant temperature of 20°C with a total of 78.5 kVh. Before the second dimension, separation strips were incubated with an equilibration solution (50 mM Tris-HCL pH = 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01 bromophenol blue containing 100 mM DTT) for 15 min. Then, the strips were loaded on the top of pre-cast 12% polyacrylamide gels and fixed with 0.5% agarose. The second dimension was carried out with an Ettan DALTtwelve Electrophoresis System (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) at 20°C. Current was held constant to 12 mA per gel for an overnight period. On the next day, current was increased to 20 mA per gel until bromophenol blue mark the end of the gel. For visualization of protein spots, signals were collected at excitation wavelength for Cy3 and Cy5 labeled sample at 540 and 635 nm, respectively, using Ettan DIGE Imager (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). Gels were scanned at 100 μm resolution and analyzed using DeCyder 2-D 6.5 software (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). Using a 2 mm diameter tip, spots selected for protein identification after DeCyder statistical analysis (P&lt;0.05) were picked from the preparative gel by automatic Ettan Spot Picker (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA).</p>

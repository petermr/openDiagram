   <bold>(B)</bold> Boxplots illustrating the correlation between genome amplification and mRNA level of CPSF1. Boxplots comparing the mRNA expression of CPSF1 in tumor (T) and non-tumor (N) tissue samples in the

   <bold>(D)</bold> ROESSLER LIVER, and 
   <bold>(E)</bold> ROESSLER LIVER2 datasets (GSE14520). 
   <bold>(F)</bold> CPSF1 mRNA levels were validated in 24 paired HCC samples using Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) samples. 18S RNA was used to normalize the relative fold changes. Statistical data were assessed using Student

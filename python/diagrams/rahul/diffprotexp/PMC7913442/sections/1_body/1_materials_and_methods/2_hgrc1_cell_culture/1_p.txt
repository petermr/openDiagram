0: HGrC1 cells were kindly provided by Drs.
1: T. Nakamura and A. Iwase, and their properties and derivation described earlier [ 43].
2: Notably, these cells bear two normal alleles of the FOXL2 gene [ 34].
3: Cells were cultured in a standard incubator at 37 C in DMEM-F12 medium (catalog #12,400024, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) complemented with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and 10% FBS (#F6178, Sigma-Aldrich).
4: HGrC1 cells at passage 14 were used for all the experiments in this study.
5: HGrC1 cells seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates (1  10 6 cells/well).
6: Medium was replaced after 24 h with serum-free DMEM-F12 (complemented with antibiotics), and transfection was performed using the above described plasmids for 4 h with Lipofectamine 3000 reagents (catalog #L3000008, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturers procedures.
7: After 4 h, the medium was replaced with new serum free DMEM-F12 and transfected cells were cultured at 37 C for 24 h.

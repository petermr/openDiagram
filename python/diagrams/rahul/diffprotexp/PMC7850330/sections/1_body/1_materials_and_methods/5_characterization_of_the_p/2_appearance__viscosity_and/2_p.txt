0: The prepared nanoemulsions were visually examined by inspecting the transparency on light reflections.
1: Their pH was determined using a pH meter (model 361, Systronics).
2: Viscosity of the prepared nanoemulsions were investigated using a Brook Field Viscometer (LVF 69726) with a UL-adapter.
3: All the investigations were accomplished in triplicate at 25 C.

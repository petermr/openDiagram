0: Using this framework, we investigate variable patterns of gene expression in  Plasmodium berghei ookinetes across two vector species as well as within and between individual mosquito midguts ( Table 1).
1: We identify genes that are differentially expressed across these environments as well as a subset of genes that are highly variably expressed independent of developmental time and the vector host.
2: We then revisit bulk RNA-seq data from individual vector midguts from mated or virgin  Anopheles coluzzii infected with  P. falciparum ( Dahalan et al., 2019) and identify variable genes that may be responding to vector host physiological factors.
3: We find that ookinetes display subtle differences in gene expression not only based on the vector species, mating status or antibiotic treatment, but also within one mosquito individual.
4: Our findings suggest that a fine balance between adaptive gene expression and intrinsic variant gene expression act together to ensure successful gut colonization.

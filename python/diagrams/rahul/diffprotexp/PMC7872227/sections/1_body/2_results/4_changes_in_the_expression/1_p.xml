<p>Comparison of the ammonium and urea groups revealed that the DEGs of the two groups showed significant enrichment in the oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway in the KEGG analyses (

 <italic>pasteurii</italic>, the difference between the two groups with different nitrogen sources mainly lied in whether the urease expressed by the bacteria was required to catalyze urea hydrolysis,

 <italic>e</italic>., whether there was a urea catabolic reaction. The physiological differences caused by the urease hydrolysis reaction in

 <italic>pasteurii</italic> was obvious when comparing the differences between these two groups, revealing the physiological significance of urease hydrolysis reaction for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>. The results indicated that the metabolic pathway of oxidative phosphorylation was significantly enriched in the KEGG analysis. As for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic>, since the oxidative phosphorylation was a coupling reaction between ADP and inorganic phosphate for the synthesis of ATP, the energy released during the substance oxidations in the cytoplasm of

 <italic>pasteurii</italic> was transferred through the electron transfer chain to it, and about 95% of the ATP in the organism came from this way [

0: In this study, we first found that LINC00466 could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells.
1: Using bioinformatic analyses, we found that LINC00466 may affects glioma cells through miR-137/PPP1R14B axis.
2: Based on this, we aimed to investigate the expression, functional role, TMZ resistance and underlying mechanism of LINC00466 in glioma.
3: Our results suggest LINC00466 can affect cell viability and TMZ resistance of glioma cells by regulating miR-137/PPP1R14B axis.

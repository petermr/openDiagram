<p>Global DNA methylation was analysed using the Imprint® Methylated DNA Quantification kit (MDQ1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, 100 ng genomic DNA was bound to the ELISA plate, after which the methylated DNA fraction was detected using a 5-methylcytosine monoclonal antibody and the absorbance was measured on a SpectraMax i3 plate reader (Molecular Devices®) at 450 nm. The percent global DNA methylation was calculated relative to the methylated DNA control, which was included in the kit. All samples were analysed in duplicate.

   <bold>N-terminal 1–40aa in Fiber 2 responsed for the interaction with KPNA3/4</bold>. LMH cells were transfected with full-length 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic>, truncated 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic> (1–40 aa deletion), truncated 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic> (61–114 aa deletion) and pcDNA3.1, respectively. (a) Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with mAb 3C2 against Fiber-2, the pellets were examined with western blot by polyclonal antibodies against KPNA3 and KPNA4. (b) Sequence alignment analysis for N-terminus of 1–40aa in Fiber-2 from different FAdV-4 isolates. All experiments were performed for three times with comparable results

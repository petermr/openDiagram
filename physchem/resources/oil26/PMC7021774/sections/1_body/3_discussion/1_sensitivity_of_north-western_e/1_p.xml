<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par24">Despite the cloning of <italic>ToxB</italic> over 17&#160;years ago (Martinez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>), relatively few screens for ToxB sensitivity in wheat have been published. Surveys of Canadian wheat varieties found sensitivity to be present in around 30% of wheat varieties (Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>: 24 of 100 cultivars. Lamari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005a</xref>: 30 of 86 cultivars), while in a recent screen of 122 Australian varieties just 4% were ToxB sensitive (See et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). Here, screening an AM panel of 480 varieties found ToxB sensitivity to be uncommon in the European germplasm screened, with just 7% possessing a sensitivity score&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1. It appears that ToxB sensitivity was introduced via the variety &#8216;Thatcher&#8217;, released in the USA in 1931. &#8216;Thatcher&#8217; was used 41 times as a parent in the pedigree, and was a parent of the second oldest sensitive variety in the AM panel, &#8216;Aronde&#8217; (France, 1962). &#8216;Thatcher&#8217; has been previously identified as the possible source of ToxB sensitivity in Canadian wheat (Lamari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005a</xref>; Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>), highlighting its prominent role in wheat pedigrees across the world.</p>

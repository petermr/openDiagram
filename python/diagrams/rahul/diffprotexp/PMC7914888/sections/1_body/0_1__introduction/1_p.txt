0: Many transcripts show hundreds of genes change in expression in melanoma progression.
1: These changes involve genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, such as mutations, gene silencing of tumor suppressors through DNA methylation in promoter regions, oncogene activation, chromatin remodeling, and regulation mediated by non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) through their regulation of genes involved in different cellular processes such as proliferation, death, cycle control, senescence, angiogenesis, differentiation, and even metastasis [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
2: miRNA can have hundreds of mRNAs as molecular targets.
3: One mRNA can target several miRNAs, and the researchers will identify variations in the expression of thousands of genes that may result from changes in some miRNAs expression patterns [ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

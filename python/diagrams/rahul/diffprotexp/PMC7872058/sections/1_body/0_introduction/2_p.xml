<p>IPA usually starts in the lungs via the inhalation of airborne conidia. There, innate immunity is mediated by neutrophils, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages, which are the first line of defense against 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and responsible for local inflammatory responses against this pathogen [

 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The recognition of 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> by macrophages is performed by pattern recognition receptors, which include C-type lectin and toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize specific fungal components [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6â€“8</xref>]. Over the last decade, an additional family of evolutionary conserved innate immune receptors has been identified: the triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among them, TREM1 is the best-characterized member of the TREM family of receptors. TREM1, belonging to the Ig superfamily, is a cell-surface activating receptor with a single extracellular V-type Ig-like domain, a transmembrane region containing charged lysine residues, and a short cytoplasmic tail lacking signaling motifs. Receptor domains of TREM1 include both activating and inhibitory isoforms whose ligands are unknown [

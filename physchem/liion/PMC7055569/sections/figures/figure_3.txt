0: Figure 3 a) A rechargeable roomtemperature sodium superoxide (NaO_2) battery.
1: b) Different possible pathways for energy storage in nonaqueous NaO_2 and LiO_2 battery.
2: In both metalO_2 battery formed discharge intermediate (O_2^) reacts with Li^+ ion and Na^+ ion.
3: In both cases, metal superoxide is formed but in case of Li, LiO_2 is unstable and further reacts to form Li_2O_2 whereas, NaO_2 is thermodynamically more stable.
4: Other possible reactions are shown in gray color.

<p>In recent years, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses have been widely used in cancer-related research. Among them, transcriptomics includes analysis of all RNA from tissue or cells, revealing the molecular mechanisms of specific biological processes and disease by studying gene transcription and function. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules greater than 200 nucleotides in length that exert their functions through interactions with other components, such as protein, RNA, and DNA (

However, the mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles in tumor–endothelium interaction are still unknown. In order to identify the aberrantly expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in endothelial cells adhered by prostate tumor cells PC-3M, we screened expression profiles in the tumor–endothelium adhesion model with the Human Gene 2.0 ST GeneChip
 <sup>®</sup> array. Based on these data, we conducted an integrated bioinformatics analysis to clarify the molecule mechanism during this tumor–endothelium interaction.

 <italic>M. bovis</italic> P27 is an immunogenic Fn-binding protein that mediates invasion and infection. Anti-P27 antiserum only partially inhibits attachment [
 <xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], indicating that P27 exert synergistic effect with other adhesins. 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> also express Eno and its function is the same as Eno in 
 <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Similar 
 <italic>Eno</italic> gene was also found in the genome of 
 <italic>M. bovirhinis</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some multifunctional enzymes including methylenetetrahydrofolate-tRNA-(uracil-5-)-methyltransferase (TrmFO), NADH oxidase (NOX), and FBA also found in 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic>. Among these, TrmFO and FBA are involved in cytadhesion to EBL cells [
 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71–74</xref>]. NOX functions as a membrane-associated adhesin by interacting with amyloid precursor-like protein 2 on EBL cells [
 <xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Recently, 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> Mbov_0503 has been observed to bind tight junctions and cross the epithelial barrier [
 <xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]; hence, it may be a potential virulence factor for colonization. Other adhesions of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> (P26, Vsps, and VpmaX) also participate in the adhesion and pathogenesis of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77–79</xref>].

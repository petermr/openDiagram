<p id="Par31">In summary, diverse TF activity indicates the abundant network of mechanisms taking place during intestinal regeneration. Various TF were found to be directly or indirectly involved with regenerative processes. Furthermore, functional analysis regarding transcripts coexpressed with TFs showed processes associated with a structuration of the cell, as well as cell communication mechanisms during the early regenerative stage. Although their primary role is rather aimed at developmental purposes in most cases, there are previously studied TF such as MYC whose DE can be proposed as landmarks of regeneration.</p>

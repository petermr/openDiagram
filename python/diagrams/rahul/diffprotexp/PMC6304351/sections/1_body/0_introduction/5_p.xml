<p>In this study, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) shotgun proteomics, a powerful tool to simultaneously identify and quantity the differential expression of large sets of proteins. We examined the reorganization of the proteome to identify proteins significantly upregulated whilst growing on either medium- or long-chain alkanes. This has given a unique insight into proteins involved in the transport and degradation of hydrocarbons, for this globally important marine OHCB.</p>

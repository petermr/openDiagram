 <attrib>(A) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 
  <italic>Cebpa</italic> and 
  <italic>Cebpb</italic> gene during corresponding timepoints based on mRNA fold induction level and represented in log2 scaled form (n = 3; **P-Value&lt;0.05; ***P-Value&lt;0.01; N. S = not significant). (B) and (C) represent gene network associate’s models (from BioGRID) of 
  <italic>Cebpa</italic> (upper panel in both B and C) and 
  <italic>Cebpb</italic> (lower panel in both B and C) at MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min, respectively. Blue nodes are genes not represented in based on designated DEGs cut-off of P-adj&lt;0.05; whereas colour nodes are genes identified based on cut-off. Varied colour intensities of nodes are based on log fold changes in each MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min (legend displayed under each panel condition).

To identify potential therapeutic targets of metformin in bladder cancer, we screened differential proteins with metformin treatment in T24 cells by high-throughput protein chip. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Clusterin was screened as a target of metformin in bladder cancer. The direct binding of metformin with Clusterin was further confirmed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Meanwhile, results from Western blot and RT-PCR showed that treatment with metformin resulted in significant Clusterin downregulation in UMUC3 and J82 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a, b</xref>). Clusterin is a conserved glycoprotein which plays key roles in cellular stress response and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> As evidenced by its key roles in cancer, Clusterin served as a therapeutic target for fighting tumor growth.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> High-throughput protein chip was used to screen differential proteins with metformin treatment in T24 cells for 48&#x02009;h.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>, UMUC3 cells were characterized by significantly highest Clusterin expression while J82 cells were lowest. Interestingly, metformin inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b&#x02013;e</xref>) greater in higher Clusterin UMUC3 cells compared with lower Clusterin J82 cells.</p><p id="Par4">To determine the direct role of Clusterin in bladder cancer cells growth, we used siRNAs and lentivirus to modulate Clusterin levels in UMUC3 and J82 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3a</xref>). Knockdown of Clusterin dramatically suppressed cell viability, migration, colony formation, and induced apoptosis compared with control cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3b&#x02013;d</xref>). We next examined the effect of metformin with Clusterin-silencing conditions. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> showed that in Clusterin knockdown UMUC3 cells, low concentration of metformin (0&#x02013;8&#x02009;mM) inhibited proliferation stronger than in parental cells, indicating that both knocking down Clusterin and metformin treatment inhibited cellular proliferation in a synergetic fashion. However, when the concentrations of metformin (8&#x02013;64&#x02009;mM) were high, metformin itself reduced the expression of Clusterin, making the loss of Clusterin in these cells almost completely. Thus, the inhibitory effect of metformin in Clusterin knockdown cells is inversely lower than in parental cells, suggesting that anticancer effect of metfornin relies on Clusterin expression. Therefore, in lower Clusterin J82 cells, knocking down of Clusterin did not induce any significant decrease in the inhibitory effect of metformin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Metformin also significantly inhibited basal migration, colony formation, and induced apoptosis in control cells. However, these effects of metformin in Clusterin knockdown cells were significantly reduced (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3b&#x02013;d</xref>). We also successfully induced Clusterin overexpression in UMUC3 and J82 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3e</xref>). Bladder cancer cells with stable Clusterin overexpression led to increased cellular proliferation, colony formation and migration (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3f&#x02013;h</xref>). Meanwhile, cells with stable Clusterin overexpression were characterized by higher metformin induced inhibition of proliferation, colony formation as well as migration compared with control cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3f&#x02013;h</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that bladder cancer cells characterized by higher Clusterin are more sensitive to metformin induced inhibition of growth.</p><p id="Par5">Previously, we found that metformin reduced FASN expression in bladder cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, FASN and SREBP-1c were significantly higher in bladder cancer cell lines and tissues (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4a, b</xref>). Therefore, we systematically investigated the function of metformin in bladder cancer lipogenesis. Lipid-droplet staining showed that metformin, dramatically decreased the number, size, and staining intensity of lipid bodies both in UMUC3 and J82 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4c</xref>). Meanwhile, SREBP-1c and its downstream effectors were significant decreased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4d</xref>). We also conducted lipid metabolite analysis with metformin treatment via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). As shown in (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>), the contents of long-chain and short-chain fatty acids were significantly decreased in comparison to that of the controls. Since Clusterin participates in lipid transport and metabolism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> we speculated that whether Clusterin plays roles in metformin caused lipogenesis inhibition. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>, the depleted levels of fatty acids correlated with the striking reduction in Clusterin expression. Meanwhile, knocking down Clusterin decreased cellular neutral lipid levels and both protein and mRNA expressions of SREBP-1c and its downstream effectors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j, k</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4e, f</xref>), suggesting that silencing Clusterin restrained the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c and inhibited lipogenesis. Furthermore, double immunofluorescence staining showed Clusterin was distributed in the cytoplasm while SREBP-1c located in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4g</xref>). Knockdown Clusterin significantly reduced SREBP-1c in both nucleus and cytosol (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4h</xref>). However, CO-IP showed no binding between Clusterin and SREBP-1c in cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4i</xref>). Taken together, these results confirmed that metformin reduced formation of neutral lipid which is mediated by Clusterin.</p><p id="Par6">To investigate the role of Clusterin in tumorigenesis, subcutaneous tumors bearing stable knockdown Clusterin (UMUC3-shCLU) and parental UMUC3 cells (UMUC3-shCtrl) were implanted, respectively. The tumors derived from UMUC3-shCLU cells resulted in a remarkably slower growth rate (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5a</xref>), smaller tumor size, and weight (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5b</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that Clusterin, FASN, and SREBP-1c protein levels were decreased in UMUC3-shCLU cell developed tumor tissue (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5c</xref>). These results suggest that Clusterin depletion can effectively suppress bladder tumor xenografts in vivo.</p><p id="Par7">Given the potent inhibitory effects of metformin in bladder cancer cell growth, we evaluated its antitumor activity in vivo using nude mice bearing UMUC3-luc orthotopic models (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6a</xref>). Intravesical metformin substantially decelerated tumor growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1m</xref>) and significantly reduced the weight of bladders (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6b, c</xref>). Furthermore, metformin treated mice showed reduced lipogenesis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6d</xref>). H&#x00026;E and Ki67 staining demonstrated that metformin effectively inhibited tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6d</xref>). Meanwhile, we found that metformin decreased Clusterin, SREBP-1c, and FASN levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6d</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated that metformin blocked bladder cancer growth and inhibited lipogenesis-associated proteins in orthotopic models which were established by high expressed Clusterin UMUC3 cell line.</p><p id="Par8">To explore the correlation between Clusterin and bladder cancer progression, we first examined its expressions in bladder tumor patient specimens. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarray showed that Clusterin protein level was significantly higher in bladder cancer compared with normal bladder (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0003) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1n (a, b)</xref>). In particular, it expressed higher in muscle invasive bladder cancer compared with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1n (a)</xref>), consistent with the results of TCGA database and clinical samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1o</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Immunohistochemistry analyses showed that Clusterin level was positively correlated with tumor stage and differentiation grade (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1n (c, d)</xref>). These results implied that Clusterin expression positively correlates with bladder cancer progression and may serve as a biomarker for treating with metformin in a personalized medicine fashion.</p><p id="Par9">In summary, our study proved that Clusterin is a target of metformin and the susceptibility to Clusterin-depended growth inhibitory effects of metformin in bladder cancer. Moreover, metformin targets Clusterin and inactivates SREBP-1c and its downstream target FASN, leading to blockage of de novo fatty acid synthesis to inhibit growth of bladder cancer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1p</xref>). These results uncovered an important role for Clusterin-regulated lipogenesis in maintaining bladder tumor growth and survival. This study provides a novel potential approach for individualized treatment with metformin in cancer patients with differential expression of Clusterin.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec1"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="41392_2021_493_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Clusterin-Supplementary materials</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>These authors contributed equally: Jun Deng, Mei Peng</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41392-021-00493-8.</p></sec><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Dr. Jun Zhou of Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital for her generous assistance on pathological assessments of all specimens.

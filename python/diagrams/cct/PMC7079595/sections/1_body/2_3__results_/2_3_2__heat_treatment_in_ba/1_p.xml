<p>The first selected heat treatment was isothermal holding in the bainite region, variant A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). During this treatment, the formation of carbide-free bainite should enrich austenite in carbon, rejected from bainitic plates. The presence of high Al content prevents the formation of carbides in bainite, which further causes an increase of the carbon content in the austenite.

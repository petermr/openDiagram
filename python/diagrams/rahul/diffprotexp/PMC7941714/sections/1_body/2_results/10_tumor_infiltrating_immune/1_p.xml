<p id="Par50">A cohort of 568 CRC patients was divided into high and low expression groups based on lncRNA expression. The results of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed that plasma B cells (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and CD4+ memory resting T cells (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were greater in patients with low MIR4435-2HG expression, while follicular helper T cells (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.037) and neutrophils (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were greater in patients with high MIR4435-2HG expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>a). The high ELFN1-AS1 expression group had significantly higher numbers of plasma B cells (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.039), CD4+ memory-activated T cells (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006), gamma delta T cells (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), monocytes (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.047), and resting myeloid dendritic cells (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.031). The low ELFN1-AS1 expression group had higher numbers of CD8+ T cells (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and neutrophils (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>b). Correlation analysis was performed to determine the co-expression patterns among 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cell types (Supplementary Figure S

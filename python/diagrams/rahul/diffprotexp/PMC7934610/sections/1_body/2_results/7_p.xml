<p>In summary, GO functional clustering and KEGG pathway analysis showed that various DEGs related to immune response were significantly more highly expressed in the CE-R group than in the CE-NR group. Firstly, we found that some genes related to lectin receptors, including 
 <italic>CLEC9A</italic>, 
 <italic>CLEC10A</italic>, and 
 <italic>CLEC4G</italic> were significantly more highly expressed in the CE-R group than in the CE-NR group. Secondly, we found that a large number of DEGs related to NK cell activation (
 <italic>KLRC2</italic>, 
 <italic>IRAK1</italic>, 
 <italic>FCRL6</italic>, and 
 <italic>NKG7</italic>), mast cell activation (
 <italic>MCP1</italic> and 
 <italic>IRCP1</italic>), and T cells were significantly more highly expressed in the CE-R group than in the CE-NR group. Additionally, genes related to chemokines (
 <italic>CXCL12</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL14</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL4</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL5</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL11</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL25</italic>, and 
 <italic>CCL28</italic>), compensatory inflammation repair mechanisms (
 <italic>CYP17A1</italic>, 
 <italic>CYP1A1</italic>, 
 <italic>CYP2C19</italic>, and 
 <italic>CYP3A24</italic>), and tumor necrosis factor (
 <italic>TNFRSF13B</italic>, 
 <italic>TNFRSF17</italic>, 
 <italic>TNFRSF1A</italic>, 
 <italic>TNFRSF4</italic>, 
 <italic>TNFSF10</italic>, 
 <italic>TNFSF13</italic>, 
 <italic>TNFSF15</italic>, 
 <italic>TNFSF18</italic>) were more highly expressed in the CE-resistant group than in the CE-non-resistant sheep (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In addition, some genes related to MHC were also significantly more highly expressed in the CE-R group than in the CE-NR group, including

 <italic>LOC101109747</italic>, 
 <italic>LOC101120148</italic>, 
 <italic>LOC101109080</italic>, 
 <italic>LOC101105609</italic> and

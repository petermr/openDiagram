<p>VYR assays were conducted as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] with minor modifications. Viruses were first replicated in the presence of different concentrations of BLF. Supernatant was harvested 2 dpi from each concentration of test compound and the viral yield was determined by plaque reduction assay. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from best-fit dose response curves with variable slope in Prism 8.

<p>In our study the greatest number [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] of significantly differentially expressed genes between lung tissue with lesion and lung tissue without lesion occurred in the placebo group. This suggested that all treatment combinations reduced differential gene expression between these two tissue types. The placebo group (Group 3) was unique in significant expression of pathways related to stress-associated regulation of nucleic acids. One of the genes responsible for this function is DNAJB1. Its expression was significantly increased in lung tissue with lesion. It codes for DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B1. This protein is upregulated under stress factors such as high temperature and some chemicals, such as arsenite and azetidine carboxylic acid [

<p> TPC of the samples showed a significant (p&lt; 0.05) slow decrease during the storage until the 60
 <sup>th</sup> day (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This decrease was caused by oxidation and hydrolytic activities which occur because of the effects of temperature, oxygen and enzymes during storage.

 </sup> On the 90
 <sup>th</sup> day TPC increased significantly (p&lt; 0.05) in all samples, which may come from the breakdown of the complex phenolic compounds in the oils to simple phenols. These simple phenolic compounds give a more intense colour with the Folin Ciocalteu reagent.

0: The Multi-Analyte ELISArray Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) were used to estimate the level of IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF- , and GM-CSF in the supernatant of astrocytes incubated for 24 h with HR and SGR essential oils (25, 50, and 100  g/mL) and LPS (1  g/mL), only LPS (1  g/mL), or only 25, 50, and 100  g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils, according to protocol of the manufacturer.
1: The cells incubated in the culture medium for 24 h were used as a control.
2: The results were expressed as mean absorbance/OD (450 nm) value and were performed in triplicate.

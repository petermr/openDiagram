<p id="Par14">Here, proteogenomic analysis was performed using the transcriptomic and proteomic data obtained from the oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> used by a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. nORFs were detected in both life cycle stages. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that these nORFs may be of functional importance with interesting properties and are, therefore, worth further experimental investigation.

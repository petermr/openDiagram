<p>Our use of PCA was for initial insights into overall variance across all samples, as is common in RNA-seq studies. This dimensionality reduction approach is useful for detecting technical irregularities (quality control) and for visualizing major components of variation across samples. In this analysis, PC1 and PC2 captured variation associated with developmental age, with some further stratification between MIA and saline samples. We now include these PCA plots as Figure 1B, as requested. We later took advantage of the utility of PC1 and PC2 for capturing developmental age to build an age-predictive model to statistically test the observation that MIA samples at E14.5 and E17.5 exhibit differences in predicted age, as reported in the Results and presented in Figure 4. PCA itself was not used to determine or test differential expression.</p>

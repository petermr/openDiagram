<p>Our analysis of individual proteins using the test statistic given in Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">4</xref> produces Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> (a-c). The pie charts represent the proportions of top fifty differentially connected proteins for each of the “target pathways” in the three cancers. This provides a global visual representation of the relative importance of the “target pathways” in all three cancers. For all the three cancers, PI3K and RAS signaling pathways show significant contributions in terms of differential network connectivity.

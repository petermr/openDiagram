0: Functional annotation analysis was performed for up-regulated and down-regulated differentially expressed proteins using STRING (version 10.0) ( http://string-db.org/).
1: The associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms (i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cell component) were annotated based on the database.
2: Additionally, to further investigate the signaling pathways of the identified proteins, proteinprotein interactions analyzed by available experimental evidence, and statistical enrichment tests were carried out for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations.

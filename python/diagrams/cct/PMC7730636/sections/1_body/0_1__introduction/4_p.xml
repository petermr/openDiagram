<p>The CCT diagram gives information about the hardening response of steels and the nature of austenite transformation at varying degrees of cooling. This diagram has great practical importance to some heat treatment process such as austempering and isothermal annealing. The chemical composition of the investigated steels plays the most important role in the given process and influences the formation of the final microstructure. Likewise, the cooling rate of the sample is a very important factor in this process, examined by Lin et al. [

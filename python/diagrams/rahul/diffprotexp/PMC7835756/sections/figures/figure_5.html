 <caption> Correlation of differential methylation and differential gene expression in transgenic tobacco associated with the H 2O 2 response. ( A) Number of DMCs associated with DEGs. ( B) DMCs profiles of the up/down-regulated genes in different sequence contexts and gene regions. Scale color represents methylation level difference (blue = hypomethylation; yellow = hypermethylation). ( C) DmCs profiles of up/down-regulated genes involved in H 2O 2 response in tobacco. ( D) Gene expression profiles (L8/L1) of the genes with DmCs. Scale color represents log2 fold-change expression (red = upregulation, green = downregulation). </caption>

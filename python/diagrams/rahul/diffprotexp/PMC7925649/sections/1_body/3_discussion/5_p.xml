<p id="Par33">Our study found similarly distinct metabolic fingerprinting involving protein and fatty acid metabolism. Patients who developed LCOS showed statistically significant down-regulated pathways involving TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways. Fatty acid metabolism under aerobic condition utilizes acylcarnitine pathways, wherein they enter the electron transport chain to produce ATP. In hypoxemic conditions, fatty acid metabolism is altered energy production and accumulation of metabolites which can be directly toxic

 </sup>. In our study there was down-regulation of CYC1 which controlled both protein metabolism and mitochondrial protein import. Down-regulation of UQCRC1, which is related to respiratory electron transport chain and ATP synthesis, along COX8A which is involved in electron transport chain play an important role in oxidative phosphorylation

 </sup>. Altered myocardial function, which is primarily dependent on fatty acid metabolism, play an important role in contributing to normal cardiac output

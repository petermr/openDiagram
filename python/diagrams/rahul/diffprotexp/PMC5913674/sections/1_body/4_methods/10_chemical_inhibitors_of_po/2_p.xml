<p>TSA exposure courses were optimized at 1, 2, and 4μM TSA for 8 hours after 48 hours growth prior to exposure and then exposed to 2 μM for 18 hours after 72 hours growth prior to exposure. For both exposure courses, trophozoites were grown without the addition of Mtz in MtzR lines, and only adherent trophozoites were used in exposure time courses. Prior to TSA exposure, nonadhered trophozoites were discarded along with the old media; fresh media added containing either TSA in DMSO or DMSO only (control) was added. Adherence was monitored throughout exposure time courses, with detachment indicating decreasing viability. Trophozoites from exposure experiments had protein extracted and analyzed using anti-KAc as detailed previously, with 10μg of protein run on the gels.</p>

<p>Similarly, seven IRF7 isoforms were identified, and splicing patterns of the coding and noncoding transcripts are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f009">Figure 9</xref>. Of these, five were novel AS forms and two were extant in the NCBI database (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f009">Figure 9</xref>A). Out of the seven isoforms identified, four DIUs were as abundant as the wild-type IRF7 mRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f009">Figure 9</xref>B). PB.6624.20 and PB123733 isoforms encode COOH terminal truncations of IRF7 and lack the NH2 terminal IRF DNA-binding domain.

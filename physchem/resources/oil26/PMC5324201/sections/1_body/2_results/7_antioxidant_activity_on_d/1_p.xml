<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the essential oil and synthetic standard ASA and BHT are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">11</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the essential oil was found to be 6.13 ± 0.03 mg/mL with the highest inhibition of 93.43 mg/mL. However, this value is much weaker than those of standard BHT and ASA.

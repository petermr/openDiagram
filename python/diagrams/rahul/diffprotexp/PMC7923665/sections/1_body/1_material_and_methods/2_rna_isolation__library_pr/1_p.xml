<p id="Par18">RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Sigma Aldrich, Cat No: 93289) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, for up to 1 g of tissue, 500 μl of TRI reagent was added and triturated using mortar and pestle. Later, the triturate was centrifuged at 12000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the supernatant was collected in a new tube. The chloroform was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was vigorously shaken for 15 s and was allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 min. Centrifugation was again done at 12000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. An equal amount of isopropanol was added to the solution and incubated at − 20 °C for 2–4 h for RNA precipitation. Later, centrifugation was done at 12000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted. Subsequently, washing of RNA was carried out in 70% ethanol and the RNA pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 1/10 Tris EDTA buffer. The RNA concentration and quality were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. A260/A280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1 was taken to denote the quality of isolated RNA. Further, electrophoresis was carried out in formaldehyde-denatured gel and the quality of the isolated RNA was confirmed. The RNA sequencing libraries were then prepared from the isolated total RNA using Illumina True Seq mRNA standard library preparation kit; the quality of the libraries was verified using agilent tap station, and cluster generation and sequencing using NextSeq 500 were proceeded.

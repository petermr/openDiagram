 <italic>Ex situ</italic> EXAFS studies of as-prepared ligand-free CuAu NPs prepared via inverse micelle encapsulation indicated that Cu is oxidized in the as-prepared NPs, while the gold atoms are nearly completely coordinated by other gold atoms, without any significant Au–Cu interactions.

 </sup> Some evidence of Au–Cu interaction in Cu–Au alloys can be gained from the changes in the shape of the Au L
 <sub>3</sub>- and Cu K-edges XANES. Because of the charge transfer from Au to Cu in the alloy, the absorption intensity increases in the alloy at the Au L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge, and decreases at the Cu K-edge with respect to that in the corresponding bulk monometallic foils.

<p id="Par51">In this experiment, GO and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to determine the potential biological functions of TUBA1C. We observed a significant difference in the enrichment of GO and KEGG pathways, which were used to analyze samples that showed a high expression of TUBA1C (FDR &lt; 0.050, P &lt; 0.050). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> presents 10 KEGG and GO pathways that were associated with a high expression of TUBA1C. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a, the 10 KEGG pathways that were positively correlated to the high expression of TUBA1C were as follows: cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, basal transcription factors, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, glycolysis gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, GO analysis also revealed the following ten positively correlated categories: cell cycle G2/M phase transition, cellular response to oxygen levels, chromosome segregation, interleukin 1 mediated signaling pathway, multi-organism localization, condensed chromosome, ubiquitin like protein conjugating enzyme activity, microtubule cytoskeleton organization involved in mitosis, sister chromatid segregation, and mitotic spindle organization. These results indicate that the pathways of cell cycle, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis are involved in the carcinogenesis of LUAD, which is strongly related to TUBA1C expression.

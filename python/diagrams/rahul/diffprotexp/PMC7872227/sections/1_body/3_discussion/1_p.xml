<p>Overall, the expression of those functional proteins utilizing nitrogen in the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pasteurii</italic> genome was significantly enhanced in the absence of ammonium or urea. It was found that the transcription and translation of the entire gene expression pathway were severely affected. The metabolism and synthesis of amino acids, polypeptides and proteins were also significantly affected. The above-mentioned genes were all down-regulated when the nitrogen source was sufficient, indicating that the bacterial cells did not need so many genes to be activated to perform these functions when the nitrogen source was sufficient. Expressions of these genes and the proteins that maintained the basic life activities of the bacteria would be enhanced only if lacking the corresponding nutrient sources, and the accessing activities to the likely nutrient source would be strengthened finally.

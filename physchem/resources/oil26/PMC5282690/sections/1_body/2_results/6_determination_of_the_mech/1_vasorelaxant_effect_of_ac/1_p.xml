<p>AcEO (0.1–100 μg/ml) abolished the contraction induced by phenylephrine on intact thoracic aorta, and induced 95.97% ± 2.03 of vasorelaxation. The vasorelaxant effect induced by AcEO on denuded aorta (102.07% ± 3.01; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), also, the pretreatment with calmidazolium (97.07% ± 3.29; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), blocker of calcium-calmodulin binding to NO synthase, did not affect the vasorelaxation induced by AcEO. However, the vasorelaxation provoked by AcEO on aorta precontracted with phenylephrine has been partially inhibited, when preincubated with the muscarinic receptor inhibitor, atropine (85.69% ± 6.56;

<p>A previous study by our group showed that DU exposure could activate the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This study showed that pretreatment with exogenous ETHE1 protein could significantly relieve the DU-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a and b</xref>) and reduce cell apoptosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). The ultrastructures appeared to be normal under TEM pretreatment with ETHE1 (100â€‰ng/ml) alone, and swollen mitochondria and nuclear chromatin concentration and edge accumulation were seen after DU exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Large numbers of apoptotic cells were also observed after DU exposure. However, pretreatment with exogenous ETHE1 protein, apoptotic cells and the severity of mitochondria damage were significantly lower. Therefore, ETHE1 might be involved in DU-induced cell apoptosis.

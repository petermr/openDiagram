<p>Meanwhile, the results of GO analysis showed that 2980 enriched GO terms in the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories, particularly in response to interferon-alpha, I-kappa B/NF-kappa B complex and CXCR chemokine receptor binding, and more. Similarly, KEGG analysis found that 191 pathways were enriched, particularly the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, rheumatoid arthritis and cell apoptosis, and more. The top 30 enriched GO terms and pathways are shown in

<p id="Par76">Difficulties involved in the elucidation of the molecular control of reproduction in 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> range from the usual complexities of all reproductive systems (the molecular intricacy of the routes involved, the high temporal variation rate, the involvement of cell-specific expression patterns, among others) to those derived from the particular nature of apomictic species, like the evolutionary and physical characteristics of the ACL and the involvement of poorly characterized polyploid heterozygous genomes. Despite all these drawbacks, during the last years, an unprecedented research effort led to detailed characterization of the operational molecular routes for both 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> reproductive modes, through the establishment of publicly available solid reference transcriptomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and replicate sRNA libraries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Here, we are deepening the characterization of the molecular transcriptional landscape operational in sexual and apomictic plants, by providing a chronological, high yield, orientation-sensitive transcript database covering all reproductive stages from premeiosis to anthesis. We hope that this contribution will serve as a basis to promote future research on the functional mechanisms controlling agamospermy in plants and as a valuable resource for those plant breeders who are focused on the introduction of apomixis technology into their cultivar improvement programs.

<p id="Par7">Like many other Apicomplexan parasites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is specialized to infect two separate hosts—the human host, and the female mosquitoes of approximately 40 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species that can transmit the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The developmental cycle starts with malaria-infected female 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito taking a blood meal, through which the sporozoites of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are transmitted from the mosquito’s salivary gland to the human host (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The sporozoites then travel to the liver and infect liver cells, allowing them to replicate and mature into schizonts. They then rupture and release merozoites, which infect red blood cells and is the stage that causes clinical manifestation of malaria. Some of the blood-stage parasites mature into sexual precursor cells, known as gametocytes, which are ingested by the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito during a blood meal. The gametocytes are activated by environmental stimuli inside mosquito midgut and differentiate into gametes and fuse to form a zygote [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The zygotes further develop into oocysts, within which sporogony takes place and produces sporozoites to invade mosquito’s salivary gland, ready for next round of infection via a mosquito bite.

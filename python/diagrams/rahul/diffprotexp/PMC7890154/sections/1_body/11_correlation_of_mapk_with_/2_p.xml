<p id="par0235">The findings in present investigation were analyzed for understanding the correlation between the expression of 
 <italic>MAPK</italic> and other physiochemical traits linked with tolerance, carbon flux and grain-quality of wheat under HS (Fig. S2). SOD and HSP17 is considered as potential markers for analyzing the oxidative stress tolerance level of wheat. We observed positive correlation (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.66, 0.76) between the expression of 
 <italic>MAPK</italic> and activity of SOD at different stages of growth in HD3086 under HS. We established similar correlation in susceptible wheat 
 <italic>cv</italic>. BT-Schomburgk at different growth stages. Similarly, positive correlation (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.58 and 0.50) was observed between the expression of 
 <italic>MAPK</italic> and 
 <italic>HSP17</italic> under HS. In case of BT-Schomburgk, the correlation coefficient between expression of 
 <italic>MAPK</italic> and 
 <italic>HSP17</italic> was 0.77 (during pollination) and 0.72 (during grain-filling) in response to HS. Similarly, photosynthetic rate represents the pace of carbon assimilation in plants. MAPK and photosynthetic rate (P
 <sub>n</sub>) showed negative correlation in both the 
 <italic>cvs</italic>. under HS. Grain quality is mainly represented in terms of size and integrity of starch and amylolytic activity determines the integrity of the starch in the grains. We observed positive correlation (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.73 and 0.82) between MAPK and amylolytic activity in developing grains of HD3086 and BT-Schomburgk in response to HS (Fig. S1). To conclude, MAPK has positive correlation with stress-associated genes (like SOD, CAT, and HSP17), amylolytic activity, and negative correlation with photosynthetic rate (P
 <sub>n</sub>) in wheat under terminal heat stress.

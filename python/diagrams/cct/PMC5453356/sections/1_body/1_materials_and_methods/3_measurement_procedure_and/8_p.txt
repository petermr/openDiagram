0: Due to the fact that the cooling rate must fall below these values at the end of the cooling step, precipitation might start already during cooling.
1: Additionally, the change in scanning rate between cooling and soaking leads to a heat flow overshoot, which is an instrumental measurement artefact (the large peak in the blue curve in  Figure 4B).
2: This artefact might lead to errors in the interpretation of the DSC curves and, therefore, must be excluded from the evaluation.
3: As the overshoot peak might overlap the reaction onset, a critical dead time ( tdead), which cannot be analyzed, exists.
4: An appropriate way of defining a reliable starting point, which determines the time limits for signal evaluation (cut of overshot artefacts), is schematically shown in  Figure 4.

<p id="Par29">In these simulations we applied a pulling force to the N-terminus of the nascent chain. In contrast, a transient pushing force may be experienced on the C-terminus of the nascent peptide as the A-site tRNA moves from the classical (A/A) to hybrid (P/A) to translocated (P/P) state. Once the tRNA has translocated to the P-site there should be little to no pushing force present (as the C-terminus is no longer moving), and the nascent chain can relax under the new conditions. Thus, provided quasi-equilibrium conditions are achieved under these conditions, and in the simulation conditions, the two situations should yield similar results. While the SMD simulations are clearly out-of-equilibrium, the robustness of our conclusions to varying the pulling speed suggests our results are independent of the irreversible pulling force.</p>

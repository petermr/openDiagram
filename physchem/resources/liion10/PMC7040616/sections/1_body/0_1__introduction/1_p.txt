0: Currently, lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), computers, smart grids, wearable devices, etc.
1: [ 1].
2: Traditional lithium-ion batteries have organic liquid electrolytes which easily burn and explode under abusive conditions.
3: In addition, with the development of modern society, lithium-ion batteries have gradually moved toward high specific energy.
4: Researchers have studied cathode materials, such as LiCoO 2, LiMn 2O 4, LiFePO 4, LiNi 0.6Co 0.2Mn 0.2O 2, LiNi 0.8Co 0.1Mn 0.1O 2, LiNi 0.8Co 0.15Al 0.05O 2, and xLi 2MnO 3(1  x)LiMO 2, to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
5: The energy density can be improved by increasing the charging voltage, which will lead to serious side reactions and safety issues.
6: In order to solve the safety problem of lithium-ion batteries, researchers have turned their attention to all-solid-state lithium batteries, which use inorganic electrolytes.
7: The non-flammability, long cycling life and wide electrochemical window of all-solid-state lithium batteries are considered to provide the high safety and high energy density of the next-generation energy storage systems [ 9, 10].

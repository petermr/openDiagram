<p>To explore the effect of TSA on protein acetylation in trophozoites, TSA exposures were performed and protein lysate immunoblotted. Trophozoites exposed to TSA remained both viable and adhered until 18 hours. Trophozoites were detached but viable at 24 hours but were completely nonviable by 36 hours (data not shown). Exposure of trophozoites to TSA at 1μM, 2μM, and 4μM for 8 hours demonstrated hyperacetylation of histone variants (17 and 11 kDa) in parent, wild-type lines, but not MtzR lines (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, panel B), wild-type MtzS parent lines showed trends toward increased acetylation, as expected with the inhibition of deacetylases. However, MtzR isolates showed decreases in overall KAc, which was also observed across multiple concentrations of TSA at 8 hours (

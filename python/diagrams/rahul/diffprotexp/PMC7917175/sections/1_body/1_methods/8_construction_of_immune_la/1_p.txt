0: The graph learning-based dimensionality reduction analysis was performed to visualize the distribution of immune subtypes across individual patients using the reduce Dimension function of Monocle package with a Gaussian distribution.
1: The maximum number of components was set to 4, and the discriminative dimensionality reduction with trees was used.
2: Finally, the immune landscape was visualized with the function plot cell trajectory with color-coded immune subtypes.

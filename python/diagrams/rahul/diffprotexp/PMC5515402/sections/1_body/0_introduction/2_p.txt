0: To date, few studies have investigated the effect of AAS in GnRH neurons.
1: In this regard, electrophysiological studies have shown that AAS modulate the activity of these cells [ 4, 5].
2: For example, the AAS 17-methyltestosterone (17-meT; 7.5 mg/kg), increased presynaptic GABA A receptor (GABA AR) currents of mPOA steroid-sensitive neurons, resulting in inhibition of GnRH cells [ 4].
3: Similarly, female mice exposed to 17 -meT (7.5 mg/kg), displayed a diestrous-like pattern activity in GnRH neurons through the suppression of presynaptic kisspeptin excitatory inputs from the anteroventral periventricular nucleus [ 5].
4: Although these studies demonstrated neuroendocrine modulation by AAS, there is still a lack of a complete protein profile on GnRH neurosecretory cells after AAS exposure, which has the potential to reveal specific alterations in regulatory processes of the reproductive axis.
5: In this study, we characterized the proteomic profile of GnRH neurons after exposure to supraphysiological levels of 17 -meT.

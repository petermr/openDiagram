<p>S100A13 is a member of the calcium-binding S100 protein family. Ridinger 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated IHC expression of S100A13 in normal thyroid tissue and cell-lines, whereas Cao 
 <italic>et al</italic>. suggested this protein to promote proliferation in thyroid cancer cell-line [

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We identified a significant over-expression of S100A13 in cPTCs by LC-MS/MS, ELISA, partially in WB experiments, but IHC showed very similar expression patterns in cPTCs and benign lesions with only a slight increase and borderline significance. Furthermore, over-expression of S100A13 in cPTC samples indicates an association of this protein with cPTC, which is in agreement with results from other publications demonstrating up-regulation of S100 family members in primary PTC or its metastases to lymph nodes [

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To further evaluate our findings, we performed ROC curve analyses and determined that the concentration &gt;230 pg/ml was the optimal cut-off for S100A13 in cyst fluid for discrimination of cPTC from benign thyroid cysts by ELISA. However, the analyses of ROC curve data revealed poor diagnostic utility of S100A13 by ELISA for diagnosis of cPTC. It is worth to mention that S100A13 has not been investigated neither in studies of thyroid cyst fluid nor in classical PTC proteome, therefore further evaluation in other cohorts may eventually justify the role of S100A13 in distinction between cPTCs and benign thyroid cystic lesions.

<p>The kinetics of the B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes were evaluated over a varying range of current densities between 0.2 and 3.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and B-SFO@C features the attractive bulk rate capability in standard electrode formulations. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f005">Figure 5</xref>c, the average discharge capacities of B-SFO@C at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> amount to 958, 890, and 774 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Thus, roughly 5.60~4.53 Li
 <sup>+</sup>/TM (TM means transition metal) can be reversibly intercalated to deliver energy, while B-SFO@C sustains a capacity of 3.71 Li
 <sup>+</sup>/TM, despite a gain in rate by a factor of eight. At 3.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which means a rate enhancement by 16 folds, it still remains probable to swap 2.70 Li
 <sup>+</sup>/TM and access 462 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>. For the sake of checking the rate behaviour in more rigorous environments, immediately after being assessed at 3.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the current density reverts to 0.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, at which the test was cycled over 50 runs. In such circumstances, 4.46 Li
 <sup>+</sup>/TM (around 762 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) can get reversibly inserted, with a 4.82 Li
 <sup>+</sup>/TM exchanged for a reactivated/settled capacity of 825 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 40 consecutive cycles. The rate behavior in the binary metal-in-carbon configuration exceeds a variety of anode materials and even keeps abreast with some lithium solid electrolytes. The high rate capability inherently correlates with the excellent mobility/transport of lithium ions in the composite under diverse current densities. In this sense, the rate outcomes suggest that the speedy lithium ion motion can be achieved to the large lithium contents (up to 2.7 Li
 <sup>+</sup>/TM). Supposing the further optimization of this binary metal-inserted carbon structure, its intrinsic scope for the high-rate multi-redox chemistry will escalate up to a much greater level of Li
 <sup>+</sup>/TM. The finding that the micrometer-sized monolith of the binary metal-intercalated carbon composite (B-SFO@C) shows extraordinary rate behavior and could be cycled under the very elevated rates unravels the superior structural resilience, particularly given its good electrolyte infiltration and the short Li
 <sup>+</sup>/electron diffusion length. By contrast, the exceptional lithium storage properties cannot be detected for the other two composites with different chemical compositions and structural motifs. B-SO@C attains an average capacity of 663, 580, 474, 338 and 190 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, convincingly uncovering that the iron component takes an essential part in enhancing the discharge capacities. The B-SFO electrode confers an average capacity of 588, 282 and 138 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> under 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and is even hardly discharged to store Li ions at 1.6 and 3.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which reveals a very poor rate ability. The rather similar capacity at the low current density and the increasing gulf at high current density between these electrodes justifiably unveil the primary role which the carbon skeleton plays in improving the lithium diffusion. That is to say, regardless of a single or binary metal system, the carbon matrix is in high demand for attaining the elevated capacity retention, though a small discharge capacity occurs to B-SO@C. The vivid performance comparison above univocally denotes the indispensable implications that both the carbon framework and iron phase have upon tuning the lithium ion storage process. Put another way, the intercalation of binary metals inside a carbonaceous bulk matrix can result in a good integration of the innate functions of the respective entities in the nanoscale, in a manner which produces the novel composite materials for optimizing the insertion of lithium ions at broad rate loading.

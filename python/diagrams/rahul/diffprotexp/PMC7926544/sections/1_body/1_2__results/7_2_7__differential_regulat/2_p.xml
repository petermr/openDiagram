<p>To further corroborate the notion that STCH and Hsp70 differentially regulate the co-transporter biogenesis, we next compared the effects of STCH and Hsp70 on the expression of A508T and Y998X, two previously reported Bartter syndrome type 1 mutations [

 <xref rid="B49-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-02207" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Importantly, when compared to its action on WT NKCC2, STCH co-expression had a more profound effect on A508T and Y998X mutants suggesting that STCH is involved in the ERAD of NKCC2 disease causing mutants. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f007">Figure 7</xref>C, STCH and Hsp70 had opposite effects on WT NKCC2 but also on A508T and Y998X. Most importantly, similar to WT NKCC2, Hsp70 co-expression seemed to improve also the maturation efficiency of A508T and Y998X as judged by the ratio of the mature form vs. the immature form of the co-transporter (

 <bold>lower right panel</bold>), which is per se, a clear and additional indication that STCH and Hsp70 have differential effects on the co-transporter expression and maturation.

 <caption> E-selectin was involved in Kawasaki disease (KD) endothelia–monocyte interactions. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were treated with specific E-selectin siRNA (100 nM) or negative control siRNA (100 nM) for 72 h, followed by medium containing 15% sera from KD-CAL– ( n = 6) and KD-CAL+ ( n = 6) subjects for 4 h. Changed the medium to Hank's balanced salt solution with HEPES buffer (HHBS) and incubated with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM)-labeled THP-1 cells for 1 h, then the suspended cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). (A) The effects of siRNA (pooled from three KD subjects). (B) Representative images used quantification of THP-1 cells (green, BCECF-AM) attached to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). (C) Quantitative analysis of adherent THP-1 cells lysate fluorescence at 490-nm excitation and 530-nm emission. All samples were normalized to HCAECs with CAL serum treatment. The bar graphs are mean ± SEM. ** P &lt; 0.01 compared with the indicated group. </caption>

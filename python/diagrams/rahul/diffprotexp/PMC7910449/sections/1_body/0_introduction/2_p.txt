0: Previous studies demonstrate that circular RNA played a certain role in autophagy.
1: At present, no systematic and in-depth study exists on the function and potential mechanisms of circular RNA in autophagy.
2: Therefore, Torin 1-induced autophagy and sequencing were used in this study to explore the expression pattern of circular RNA in autophagy in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells.
3: The study also investigated the function and potential mechanism of circular RNA in autophagy.

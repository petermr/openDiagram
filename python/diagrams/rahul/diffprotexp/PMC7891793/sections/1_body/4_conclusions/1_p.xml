<p>The highlight of our conclusions from this work is the demonstration that Ibuprofen, when used alone, negatively affected the antiviral responses which led to higher virus loads, but when used in dual therapy it enhanced the specific antiviral effect of FPI. Transcriptome analysis has shown the ability of dual therapy with FPI and Ibuprofen to reduce the effect of damaging overexpression of prostanoids and oxidative stress. We found that lung tissue with grossly apparent lesions (LL) from BRSV infected calves showed the most significant differential gene expression compared with lung tissue not showing gross lesions (LN). The most obvious difference between these two types of tissue was oxidative stress and cell damage.</p>

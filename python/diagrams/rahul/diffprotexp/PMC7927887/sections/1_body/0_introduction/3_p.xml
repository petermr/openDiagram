 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations causing alternative splicing are common in hematological malignancies, especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where they are mutated at a rate of 5-18% and 30%, respectively.

 </sup> Mutation in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> has also been shown to result in alternative splicing in uveal melanoma and breast cancer.

 </sup> In MM, 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> is a driver gene and is mutated in 1.7% of patients. Hotspot mutations in 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> at codons K700 and K666 result in a change-of-function, altering the preference for a cryptic 3’ splice site selection over the canonical 3’ splice site.

 </sup> The potential downstream effects include the production of transcripts that are either translated to abnormal proteins or undergo nonsense-mediated decay resulting in downregulation of the canonical transcript. In this work, we investigate the spectrum of mutations in SF3B1, their downstream impact, and the greater role alternative splicing plays in the pathogenesis of MM.

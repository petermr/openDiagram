<p id="p0130">In this study, 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> treated with RGE (1 mg/mL) extended the life span significantly compared to the wild type (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Further results demonstrated that the effects of life span extension of RGE on 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> might be attributed to elevation of SOD levels, reduction in lipid peroxidation of MDA content, and a range of differently expressed proteins. Proteomic analysis detected 23 differentially expressed proteins in the RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> versus wild type: 16 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated. These proteins were found to involved in multiple biological processes and signaling pathways, such as hippo and oxidative phosphorylation signaling. Taken together, the results provided a scientific basis for the further exploitation of mechanisms of longer life span and/or antiaging altered by RGE in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.

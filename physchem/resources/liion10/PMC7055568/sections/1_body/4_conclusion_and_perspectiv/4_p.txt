0: At present, some typical lithium metal batteries, LiS battery, and LiO 2/air battery have applied to the SCEs as electrolyte.
1: The SCEs with prominent characteristics, including high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, wet interfacial contact, and satisfying thermal and electrochemical stability present preferable performances in various lithium battery systems.
2: However, the most of the SCEs were applied in lowvoltage LiFPO 4 cathode and only few were used with highvoltage cathode such as LiNi xCo yMn 1xyO 2 due to the low electrochemical stability of polymer host.
3: It is significant to develop the highvoltageresistant polymer matrix or improve the electrochemical window of polymer electrolyte using ICEs to broaden the SCE application in allsolidstate battery.
4: The specific capacity of S cathode in allsolidstate LiS battery using SCEs is still quite lower and its rate and cycling performance is poor due to the larger interfacial resistance between S cathode and SCEs and severe volume expansion.
5: Integrated S cathode/SCEs architectures with lower interfacial resistance and highly stable structure should be further developed in the future research.
6: The charge/discharge reaction of LiO 2 or Liair systems using SCEs would occur at solidgas interface, which would greatly reduce the reaction kinetics due to the larger interface resistance.
7: Some catalysts for allsolidstate LiO 2 or Liair system with SCEs should be developed to promote the charge/discharge reaction kinetics and improve its rate and cycling performance.

<p>Bacteria were grown overnight in TSB medium at 37°C with shaking. Two microliters of the overnight cultures were spotted on TSB agar plates alone or supplemented with 3.3% skim milk to determine pigment production and proteolysis, respectively, and incubated at 37°C overnight. Pigment production was assessed visually by the color of the colony formed on TSB agar plates after overnight incubation. The proteolytic activity was determined by the appearance of a clear zone surrounding the bacterial colonies.</p>

 <italic>In silico</italic> analysis was performed to identify potential transcription factors that bind the regions spanning the six 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> CpG sites investigated in this study. The 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> gene sequence containing the CpG island of interest was obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (

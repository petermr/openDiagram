<p>While for the determination of the particle size in metallic NPs, information from the first coordination shell is, in principle, sufficient, the CNs extracted from further coordination shells can increase the confidence in the structure model. For example, Varnell et al. used CNs for the first four coordination shells, extracted from EXAFS data fitting, to determine the sizes of bcc-type Fe NPs formed in Fe-porphyrin-type catalyst during ORR,

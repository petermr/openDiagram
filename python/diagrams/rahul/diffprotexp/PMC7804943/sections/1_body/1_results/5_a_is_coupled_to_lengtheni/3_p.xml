<p id="Par19">To assess whether 3′ UTRs with APA changes could potentially be involved in coupled changes in mRNA localization in neurons, we determined the overlap between the genes from the top-weighted APA events of each latent factor with a previously reported set of transcripts from 2,550 genes found to be preferentially localized to the dendrites and/or axons of mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons

<p>Non-coding RNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of different cancers, including glioma. Non-coding RNAs are almost involved in the proliferation, differentiation and metastasis of tumor cells. In addition, non-coding RNAs are constantly being discovered as biomarkers, and these discovered non-coding RNAs may serve as targets for tumor therapy.
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the study of the occurrence and prognosis of glioma, the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been recently considered to be associated with the occurrence and development of glioma.

 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As for the correlation between lncRNAs and cancer, numerous studies have confirmed that lncRNAs play a crucial role in complex biological processes of glioma cells. LncRNAs can participate in gene regulation through various mechanisms, including competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms. Besides, lncRNAs possess miRNA Responsible Elements (MRE), the binding sites with miRNAs by which they can potentially sponge miRNAs that lead to miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs.

 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Meng et al found that lncRNA SNHG5 acted as a ceRNA in glioma to regulate ZEB2 by competitively binding to miR-205-5p, thereby affecting biological function of glioma.
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Liu et al proved that lncRNA H19 could promote glioma angiogenesis through miR-138/HIF-1Î±/VEGF axis.
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The discovery of these lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA signaling axes helps to the prognosis and diagnosis of glioma. However, studies concerning the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA signaling axis remain scarce.

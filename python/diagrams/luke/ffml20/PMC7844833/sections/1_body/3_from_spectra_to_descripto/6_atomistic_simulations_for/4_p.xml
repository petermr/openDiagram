<p>Despite this limitation and the large computational times (several CPU days) required to process each spectrum, RMC remains a powerful tool for the interpretation of EXAFS spectra in a broad range of materials, by providing the possibility to fit the spectra for materials with non-Gaussian shapes of bond-length distributions,

The extraction of interatomic distances and other structure parameters of interest can then be done by performing statistical analysis of atomic coordinates in the final structure model. Unlike in conventional EXAFS data fitting, a key feature of the RMC method is that the obtained structural parameters are physically meaningful. The geometric constraints imposed by the fact that all fitting variables correspond to actual coordinates of atoms in a specific 3D structure model explain why in many cases RMC is able to provide an unambiguous structure model, despite the fact that the total number of fitting variables is much larger than that in the conventional fitting.

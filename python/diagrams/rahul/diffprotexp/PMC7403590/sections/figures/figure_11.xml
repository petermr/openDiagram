  <p>Microtubule Assembly in VD. Microtubule dynamics markers were determined in 
   <italic>post-mortem</italic> human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of VD patients and controls. The levels of acetylated α-tubulin, acetylated tau, phosphor-tau and tau were determined in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) SNpc; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Hippocampus and (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Densitometric analysis of the levels of acetylated α-tubulin, acetylated tau, phosphor-tau, tau and phosphor-tau/tau. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin ato confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5–6, *p &lt; 0.05, versus SNpc control subjects and 
   <sup>##</sup>p &lt; 0.01, versus hippocampus control subjects; 
   <sup>&amp;&amp;</sup>p &lt; 0.01, versus cortex control subjects). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information.

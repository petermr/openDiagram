<p id="Par55">Total RNA was isolated from three different developmental stages of Tartary buckwheat seeds by using the EASYspin Plus Plant RNA Kit (Aidlab, Beijing, China) and digested by DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) to remove the genomic DNA. Then, 2 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using the miRcute miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The qRT-PCR was performed on a CFX96 Real-time System (BIO-RAD, USA) using the miRcute Plus miRNA qPCR Kit (SYBR Green) (Tiangen, Beijing, China). Three independent biological replicates were used, and the 
 <italic>FtU6</italic> was used as the reference gene. The relative expression level of each miRNA was calculated by using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method. All primers used in this experiment are listed in Additional file

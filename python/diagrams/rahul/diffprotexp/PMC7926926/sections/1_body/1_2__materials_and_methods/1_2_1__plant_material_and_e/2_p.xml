<p>The research was conducted in a greenhouse with a sand culture and parameters (light intensity of 600–800 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup>, relative humidity of 55%, photoperiod of 16 h, 25 °C, and 18 °C in the dark) were kept constant during the growth period. For sand culture, quartz-sand purchased from Kasper Building Materials Company (Potter, WI, USA) was used. Thoroughly rinsed quartz-sand was sterilized and then filled into nutrition bowls. Selected seedlings with consistent growth were transplanted into pots. Al stress treatment was applied to the selected seedlings after normal growth for two weeks [

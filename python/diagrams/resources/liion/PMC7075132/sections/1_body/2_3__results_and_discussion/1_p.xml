<p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to substantiate the structural attribute of the samples. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, the B-SFO@C and B-SFO samples exhibit the analogous XRD patterns. The diffraction peaks could be assigned to both the tetragonal SnO
 <sub>2</sub> (JCPDS card No. 41-1445) and the rhombohedral Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (JCPDS card No. 33-0664), manifesting that the successful generation of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. In addition, the diffraction peaks indexed to Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> vanish in B-SO@C, evidencing that the Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> phase has been eliminated after etching using the oxalic acid solution. The surface electronic structure and chemical element valance state of B-SFO@C was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) corroborates existence of C, Sn, Fe, and O. Two predominant strong peaks are monitored at 487.4 and 495.9 eV, corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 for Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> in the Sn 3d core emission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f002">Figure 2</xref>c), respectively, which indicates the presence of Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> in B-SFO@C [
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Meanwhile, the XPS spectrum of Fe 2p (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f002">Figure 2</xref>d) can be deconvoluted into two envelopes at 711.3 eV and 716.3 eV. These two bands should be assigned to the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and Fe
 <sup>4+</sup> 3p
 <sub>3/2</sub>, respectively, which implies the coexistence of Sn
 <sup>4+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> in B-SFO@C [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The C 1s signal (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S1</xref>) can be fitted into three peaks, responsible for the C–C/C=C (284.6 eV), C–O (286.0 eV) and C=O (288.6 eV) [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Noteworthily, the weight fractions of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> calculated from XPS are considerably lower than those computed from the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Table S1</xref>, elucidating that most of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles are located inside carbon matrix to yield a metal oxide nanoparticle-intercalated carbon structure. Such preferential in-carbon-lattice enrichment can also be validated by TEM images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d). Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out to further quantify the carbon content in B-SFO@C (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S2</xref>) and the final carbon content is approximately 32%. In other words, the overall metal or/and metal oxide percentage is as high as 68%, suggesting a high metal loading density. Raman spectrum of B-SFO@C (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-10-00249">Figure S3</xref>) illuminates that the intensity ratio between D-band and G-band (I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub>) is as high as 0.98, indicating that the carbon in B-SFO@C is amorphous [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The relatively low graphitization can ensue from the low pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C.

<p>The P2-type Na-Fe-Mn-O
 <sub>2</sub> material was synthesized via simple solid-state reaction by using the acetate precursors of the sodium (Na(OOCCH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%, heysham, England), iron (Fe(OOCCH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O (Alfa Aesar, 98%, heysham, England), and manganese (Mn(OOCCH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O (Alfa Aesar, 99%, heysham, England) were used as-purchased. The mixtures are well milled by RETSCH-PM-100 GmbH Planetary type ball miller at 240 rpm for 3 h; the fine mixture was calcined at 950 °C at a heat rate of 5 °C/min in Ar for 14 h; and, finally, the obtained powder placed in a glove box.

<p>More direct evidence for hydride formation can be obtained from Pd L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge XANES data, where an additional feature appears upon hydride formation due to the Pd–H antibonding states and the corresponding change in the d-density of electron states.

 </sup> Interestingly, the intensity of the Pd L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge white line changes in a nonmonotonic way, decreasing at potentials between −0.1 and −0.2 V, and increasing again at potentials between −0.2 V and −0.7 V (

  <xref rid="fig28" ref-type="fig">28</xref>
 </xref>d). This was attributed to different reaction regimes and, hence, different reaction intermediates adsorbed on the NP surface.

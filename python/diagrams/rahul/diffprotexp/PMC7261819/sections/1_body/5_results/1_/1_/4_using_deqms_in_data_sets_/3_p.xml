<p>We then summarized the number of significant DEPs between all 18 cell lines and among them how many were quantified with 1–2 PSMs. DEqMS identified the highest number of DEPs in 82 of 153 comparisons, and Limma identified the highest number in 67 comparisons (

The major difference between the two methods was that Limma detected a higher proportion of DEPs quantified by 1–2 PSMs than DEqMS in all comparisons but one (

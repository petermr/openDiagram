<p>The results are interesting because they show how, taking into account the proteins within the context of the network of interactions linking them, is superior to the conventional one-gene-at-a- time approaches. However, I think this fact, which is one of the main contributions of the paper, is not sufficiently reflected in the manuscript. It would be nice if they can include a table or any type of comparative where they can prove that they can find richer results analysing these proteins within the pathways than analysing them alone.</p>

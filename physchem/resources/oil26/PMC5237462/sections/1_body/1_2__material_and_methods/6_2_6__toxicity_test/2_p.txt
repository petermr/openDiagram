0: The solution was prepared to contain 62.5 mg of essential oil, 28 mL of synthetic sea salt solution, and 2 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to facilitate its solubilization.
1: Subsequently, at the end of the period in the dark, they were selected and divided into 7 groups of 10 subjects in each test tube.
2: Each group has added a solution of the rate (3125, 2500, 1250, 625, 250, 25, and 2.5  L).
3: The volume of 5 mL with synthetic sea salt solution was reached, to yield final solutions with the following concentrations of 1250, 1000, 500, 250, 100, 10, and 1  g/mL.
4: Thereby, the groups were designated according to their respective concentration and all tests were performed in triplicate.
5: At the end, the number of nonsurvivors were counted, to determine LC 50 through probit analysis of the SPSS software.

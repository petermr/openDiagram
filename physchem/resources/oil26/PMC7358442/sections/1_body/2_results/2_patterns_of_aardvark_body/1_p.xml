<p>Body temperatures of study aardvarks ranged from 24.7 to 38.8°C (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). The greatest amplitude of 24-h body temperature rhythm was 11.7°C, recorded in aardvark 
 <italic>A11</italic> on 30 July 2013, when its body temperature ranged from 26.1 to 37.8°C within eight hours. The recordings at five-minute intervals of body temperature of two representative aardvarks (
 <italic>A06</italic> and 
 <italic>A08</italic>) throughout the study period are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. Periods of higher than usual variability in the amplitude of 24-h body temperature rhythm were evident in late summer 2012–2013 (notably March) and in winter 2013 (notably July to September). Similar patterns were observed in the mean, minimum, and maximum 24-h body temperatures of all study aardvarks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), with periods of the highest variability coinciding with aardvark deaths (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, black arrows). Body temperature patterns of those aardvarks that survived the summer drought and the subsequent 2013 winter recovered to stable values with low variability of mean 24-h body temperature during the spring months, and most aardvarks maintained that state from October 2013 onward until the end of the study in September 2015. An exception was one aardvark that displayed pronounced variability in body temperature during the dry summer in February 2015, and again in winter 2015, before it died in late July 2015.

 <caption> Differential expression of LE genes in LNCaP CRPCs compared to androgen-sensitive LNCaP tumors. LNCaP cells were used to produce xenografts in intact NOD/SCID or castrated animals (CRPC). The expression of the indicated genes was determined by real-time PCR in LNCaP intact tumors ( n = 6) and LNCaP CRPCs ( n = 5). * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001 in comparison to LNCaP EV tumors. Statistical analyses were performed using Student t-test (2-tails). </caption>

 <caption> Chromatin architecture analysis reveals distinct structural and site-specific methylation events. a Genome-wide chromatin compartment calling (X-chromosome excluded) comparing CNFs to PNFs. b DMR analysis of overlapping promoter and enhancer space between CNFs and PNFs. Top 100 significant DMR sites shown. c Chromatin compartment concordance is depicted as the fraction of CNF and PNF compartment overlap at 100Â kb resolution. d Chromosome 17 was the most differentially methylated chromosome. Chromosome-specific analysis of promoter and enhancer space shown. Red bar indicates position of the NF1 gene. e Chromatin structural analysis demonstrating the distribution of DMR calls in topographic CpG categories (i.e., shelves, shores, islands, promoters and enhancers) </caption>

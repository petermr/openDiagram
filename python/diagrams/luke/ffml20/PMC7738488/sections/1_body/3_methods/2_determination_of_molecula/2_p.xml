 </sup>. Equations used for the electrostatic interactions is Coulomb's law, and the equations used for the van der Waal's component is the 6–12 Lennard–Jones potential. Both type of interactions contributes to the adhesion of particles. For the ease of clarity 1.0G PAMAM generation was chosen here, as simulations of all generations are beyond the scope of this paper.

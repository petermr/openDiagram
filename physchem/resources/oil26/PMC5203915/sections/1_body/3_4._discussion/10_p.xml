<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is known as an inductor of inflammation in various cells, including astrocytes [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. LPS is recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of astrocytes and the LPS treatment of astrocytes resulting in activation of transcription factor (NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) which lead to the release of such inflammatory mediators as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic>) or the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Oxidative stress and inflammation are connected with many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other nervous pathogeneses [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many studies have previously reported LPS induction of various inflammatory mediators in astrocytes [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

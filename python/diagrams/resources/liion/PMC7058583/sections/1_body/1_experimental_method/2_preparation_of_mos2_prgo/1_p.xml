<p>MoS
 <sub>2</sub>@rGO was synthesized through one step hydrothermal method. Forty milligrams of rGO and 6.9 mg of PEO (Mw = 100,000) were dissolved in 60 ml of deionized water and homogenized by stirring for 12 h. After the addition of 200 mg of Sodium Molybdate Dihydrate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>MoO
 <sub>4</sub>•2H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and 500 mg of Sulfourea (NH
 <sub>2</sub>CSNH
 <sub>2</sub>), the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h and poured into 100 ml reactor to reacted at 210°C for 24 h. Naturally cooling to room temperature, the obtained products were washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times. The MoS
 <sub>2</sub>/rGO nanocomposites were harvested after drying in vacuum at 60°C for 48 h.

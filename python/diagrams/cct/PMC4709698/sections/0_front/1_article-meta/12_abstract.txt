0: The microstructural evolution of cast Ti/Zr-based bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) containing -Ti still remains ambiguous.
1: This is why to date the strategies and alloys suitable for producing such BMGCs with precisely controllable volume fractions and crystallite sizes are still rather limited.
2: In this work, a Ti-based BMGC containing -Ti was developed in the Ti-Zr-Cu-Co-Be system.
3: The glassy matrix of this BMGC possesses an exceptional glass-forming ability and as a consequence, the volume fractions as well as the composition of the -Ti dendrites remain constant over a wide range of cooling rates.
4: This finding can be explained in terms of a two-phase quasi-equilibrium between the supercooled liquid and -Ti, which the system attains on cooling.
5: The two-phase quasi-equilibrium allows predicting the crystalline and glassy volume fractions by means of the lever rule and we succeeded in reproducing these values by slight variations in the alloy composition at a fixed cooling rate.
6: The two-phase quasi-equilibrium could be of critical importance for understanding and designing the microstructures of BMGCs containing the -phase.
7: Its implications on the nucleation and growth of the crystalline phase are elaborated.

<p>A large dynamic range (of time or heating/cooling rates) allows us to comprehensively analyse the kinetic development of single reactions. Any relevant solid-solid phase transition is related to diffusion, and as described above, diffusion is dependent on logarithmic time scales, implying the need for a large dynamic range. However, this need for a large dynamic range can be considered from two perspectives: (i) the specific physical and alloy requirements and (ii) metrological aspects.</p>

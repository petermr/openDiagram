<p>The high significant reduction of the allergic rhinitis symptoms that was observed after treatment with the co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride nanoemulsion revealed a promising effect that was superior to that of the corresponding emulsion formulation. In response to actuation by extraneous particles, macrophages discharge TNF-α, a motivator of the inherent immune response. In a paracrine way, TNF-α instigates adjoining cells to generate interleukin-8 (to provoke phagocyte staffing) (Yao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and E-selectin (to support adhesion of phagocytes to the adjacent endothelium) (Hermosilla et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Autocrine activity by TN-Fα encourages further TNF-α production and initiate macrophages to produce and release IL-1. In a paracrine way, IL-1 provokes the localized formation of Interleukin-6 and the expression of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The overall products of protein produced by TNFα and IL-1 acting together to facilitate the inherent immune response and induce the adaptive immune response (Cottam et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Ott et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). TGF-β has a responsibility in numerous processes involving regeneration of epithelial cells, inflammation and healing of tissue. TGF-β plays an essential role in the initial immune response as it acts as a chemoattractant and activator of inflammatory cells. It also fosters downregulation of inflammation across impediment of actuated cells and stimulation of apoptosis exerting anti-inflammatory effects (Otto &amp; Wenzel, 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).

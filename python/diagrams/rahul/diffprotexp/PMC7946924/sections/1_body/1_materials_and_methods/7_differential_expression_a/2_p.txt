0: Size factor was calculated by dividing each column by the geometric means of the rows.
1: The median of these ratios was used as the size factor for this column.
2: For comparison, log 2 fold of 1 was used as cut-off miRNA, > 1 were considered as up-regulated (UP), miRNAs <  1 were considered as down-regulated (DOWN) and those between 1 and  1 were considered as NEUTRAL.
3: Heat maps were generated for top 40 miRNA DGEs (top 20 UP and top 20 DOWN according to Log 2 fold change) among all 12 samples (Fig.
4: 4a).
5: Scale with colour code has been given for SR-159 and SR-157 samples (Fig.
6: 4b).

<sub>2</sub> for 48 h. After 48 h, the liquid was gently aspirated from each well. In a tube, 10 mL feeding medium was mixed with 2 mL of MTT stock solution (and was protected from light). Into each well, 100 &#181;L of the MTT solution was added and the pre-read absorbance was immediately measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm (using a Molecular Devices Spectra Max Plus 384 microplate reader). Formazan crystals were formed over the course of 4 h at 37 &#176;C and 5% CO

0: Several reports showed the use of proteomic analysis for investigation of the human dental pulp and most studies analyzed in vitro or ex vivo cultured cells.
1: Very few studies analyzed human dental pulp itself [ 8, 10, 11].
2: Paakkonen et al.
3: [ 10] identified 96 proteins in pulp from healthy and carious human teeth, and Eckhardt et al.
4: [ 8] detected 342 pulp proteins, including 37 proteins not previously discovered in human dentin or plasma.
5: Jagr et al.
6: [ 11] compared pulp proteins of sound tooth obtained from caries-resistant versus caries-susceptible individuals and showed that the levels of 16 proteins were significantly different in the caries-resistant group, compared to the susceptible individuals.

A volume of 1&#160;ml of chloroform solution of &#946;-carotene (0.1&#160;mg/ml) was added to a round flask containing 20&#160;mg of acid linoleic and 200&#160;mg of Tween 40. Chloroform was completely removed at 40&#160;&#176;C under vacuum, and 50&#160;ml of distilled water was slowly added and vigorously shaken. Three doses of AcEO and the reference standard Ascorbic acid (0.1; 1 and 2&#160;mg/ml) were dissolved in methanol. Aliquots (200&#160;&#956;l) of AcEO and ascorbic acid were added to 5&#160;ml of &#946;-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion. A control preparation was obtained by adding 200&#160;&#956;l of methanol to 5&#160;ml of &#946;-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion. Absorbance of the preparations was measured at 490&#160;nm before and after 2&#160;h of incubation in a water bath at 50&#160;&#176;C. All trials were performed in triplicate. Antioxidative activity (AA %) in percentages was calculated using the following formula:

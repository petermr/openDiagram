0: After treatment, the proliferation of BMSCs was detected with the CCK-8 kit (#C0037, Beyotime Biotech, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturers instructions.
1: Briefly, BMSCs were digested by trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 4  10 3 cells pre well.
2: After 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was added to detect the proliferation of BMSCs via Elx800 (BioTek, Winooski, Vermont, USA) at 450 nm spectrophotometric.

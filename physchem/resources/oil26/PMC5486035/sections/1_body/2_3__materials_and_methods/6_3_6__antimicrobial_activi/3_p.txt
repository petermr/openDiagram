0: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of HEO were determined by the broth microdilution method, according to CLSI (2009).
1: MBCs were determined by seeding 20 mL from all clear MIC wells onto MuellerHinton agar (MHA, Oxoid) plates.
2: The MBC was defined as the lowest extract concentration which killed 99.9% of the final inocula after 24 h incubation at 37 C.

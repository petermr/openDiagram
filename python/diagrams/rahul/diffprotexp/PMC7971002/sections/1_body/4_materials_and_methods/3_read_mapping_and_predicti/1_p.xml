Finally, in order to identify known lncRNAs, BLASTN tool was used to align lncRNA candidates to ALDB (a domestic animal extended non-coding RNA database), a database with a focus on domestic animal lncRNAs with the following settings, identity = 100%, mismatch = 0, E value &lt; 1e−10 and gap_opening = 0

0: The schematic formation process of the materials is illustrated in  Figure 1.
1: A typical procedure to synthesize the B-SFO@C sample is as follows: 0.2 M SnCl 4 aqueous solution containing 0.1 g mL 1 of citric acid and 0.2 M K 4[Fe(CN) 6] aqueous solution containing 0.1 g mL 1 of citric acid was simply mixed with a volume ratio of 3:1 at room temperature and a clear gel was obtained after a few minutes.
2: Then, the as-prepared gel was freeze-dried overnight.
3: Subsequently, the obtained xerogels were firstly pyrolyzed at 400 C in air for 2 h, and then carbonized at 600 C in N 2 for 2 h. The resulting product was washed with the distilled water and ethanol to remove the impurities and dried at 100 C in air.
4: The final products were designated as B-SFO@C. B-SFO was prepared by the similar procedure except for replacing N 2 with air.
5: B-SO@C was prepared by removing the Fe 2O 3 in B-SFO@C by etching with a 0.5 M oxalic acid solution.
6: Simply, the selective leaching was achieved by dispersion of the B-SFO@C products into a 0.5 M oxalic acid aqueous solution by ultrasonication for 30 min and then the robust agitation overnight.
7: The pure carbon framework was derived by following procedures.
8: The B-SFO@C is dispersed into 2 M NaOH aqueous solution by ultrasonication for 30 min.
9: After that, the above suspension was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180 C for 24 h to remove the SnO 2.
10: Subsequently, the obtained products were dispersed into 0.5 M oxalic acid aqueous solution by ultrasonication for 30 min and then stirred over night to remove Fe 2O 3.
11: The resulting products was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with DI water and ethanol, and then dried in an oven at 100 C to get the carbon matrix.

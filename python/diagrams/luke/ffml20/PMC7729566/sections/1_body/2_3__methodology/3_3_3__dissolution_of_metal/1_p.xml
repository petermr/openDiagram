<p>The solubilities of different transition metal and rare earth oxides (NiO, CoO, Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) in the [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl + CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH (73.0 wt.% IL, 27.0 wt.% CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH) system were experimentally determined through the addition of an excess of metal oxide to 2.0 g the mixture for 24 h at 323 K and 500 rpm. The leachate was subsequently isolated by centrifugation and appropriately diluted using deionized water prior to metal concentration analysis by UVâ€“vis and TXRF.

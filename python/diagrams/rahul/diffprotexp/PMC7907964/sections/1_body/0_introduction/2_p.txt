0: Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that serves a critical role in targeting proteins for degradation.
1: It is also involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria via autophagy and proteasomal mechanisms.
2: Parkin is encoded by the  PARK2 ( PRKN) gene, which is located on chromosome 6q25.2-q27, and spans >500 kb.
3: It contains 12 exons, which translate to a protein of 465 amino acids ( 6).
4: PARK2 variants appear to be responsible for PD pathogenesis, which was first reported in Japanese families in 1998( 6).
5: According to the Human Gene Mutation Database, >300 pathogenic mutations have been identified in the  PARK2 gene ( hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/gene.php?gene=PRKN; accessed July 2020), most of which are gross deletions, followed by missense mutations, gross insertions, small deletions, splicing defects and small insertions.
6: Although the mechanism by which loss of parkin function results in dopaminergic cell death in PD is unclear, it is considered to involve the disruption of mitochondrial quality control ( 7).

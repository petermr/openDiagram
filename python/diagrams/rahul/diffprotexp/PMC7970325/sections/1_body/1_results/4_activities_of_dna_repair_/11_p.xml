<p id="p0110">We then assessed clustering of thyroid tumors according to the PAL values of fifteen DNA repair pathways found to be significantly differential in the previous comparisons (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We observed a trend with either PC-, or FC and FA-enriched clusters (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Unlike the other cancer types, the PC samples had mostly positive PAL values for the DNA repair pathways, which suggested their overall stronger activation. However, there were also two pathways related to passing through G2 phase of the cell cycle, that were downregulated in most of the thyroid cancer specimens including PC:

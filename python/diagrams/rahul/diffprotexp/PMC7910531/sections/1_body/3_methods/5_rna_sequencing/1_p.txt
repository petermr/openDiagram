0: We performed a gene expression analysis on samples from 113 patients (Supplementary Data  7).
1: We purified poly-A tailed RNA (mRNA) from total RNA using Illuminas TruSeq RNA Sample Prep v2 kits.
2: We then fragmented the mRNA using metal ion-catalysed hydrolysis and synthesised a random-primed cDNA library.
3: The resulting double-strand cDNA was used as the input to a standard Illumina library prep, whereby ends were repaired to produce blunt ends by a combination of fill-in reactions and exonuclease activity.
4: We performed A-tailing to allow samples to be pooled, by adding an A' base to the blunt ends and ligation to Illumina Paired-end Sequencing adaptors containing unique index sequences.
5: Due to better performance, the 10-cycle PCR amplification of libraries was carried out using KAPA Hifi Polymerase.
6: A post-PCR Agilent Bioanalyzer was used to quantify samples, followed by sample pooling and size-selection of pools using the LabChip XT Caliper.
7: The multiplexed libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 for cohort 1 and HiSeq 4000 for cohorts 24 (75 bp paired-ends).
8: Sequenced data underwent initial analysis and quality control (QC) on reads as standard.
9: The sequencing depth was similar across samples, with 90% of samples passing final QC (see below) having 87.2129.2 million reads.

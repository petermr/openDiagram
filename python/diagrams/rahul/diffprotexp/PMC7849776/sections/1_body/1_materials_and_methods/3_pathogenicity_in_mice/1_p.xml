<p>Mice experiments were performed with approval from Teikyo University Animal Ethics Committee (18–024). Bacterial strains were cultured overnight in TSB with or without antibiotics. Erythromycin (5 µg/ml) alone or with chloramphenicol (12.5 µg/ml) was added to the medium for transposon mutants or gene complemented strains, respectively. The overnight cultures were 100-fold diluted with TSB and continued incubation for 16 h at 37°C with shaking. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and suspended in PBS to adjust the turbidity (A
 <sub>600</sub>) to 0.7 for microbial load and 4.0 for survival assay. The prepared suspensions (200 µl) of the strains were injected into the tail-vein of mice (ICR, female, eight weeks old, Charles River Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan). The CFU of the injected suspensions was counted. For measuring the microbial load, kidney and heart of the infected mice were isolated after 24 h of injection, suspended in PBS, homogenized, and CFU was counted.

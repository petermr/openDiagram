<p>As a result, the essential features of the data can often be captured in a model of much smaller dimensionality than the original dataset. In the case of the Q3 HMW dataset, the first three principal components account for ~84% of the variability in the data. A scatter plot (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B) of the scores for principal components 1 and 2 clearly shows the segregation of the dataset into EAE and control samples. Analysis of other fractions shows a similar behavior. For example, the scatter plot of scores for principal components 1 and 2 obtained from a Principal Component Analysis of fraction Q6 with a LMW acquisition protocol (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) also shows a clear segregation of EAE and control samples. Hierarchical clustering analysis can help identify interesting correlations among peaks. For example, the lowest node in the dendrogram for fraction Q6 LMW consists of five highly correlated peaks at 3006, 3040, 3266, 4020, and 4272 Da suggesting a strong relationship between the peaks. Three of them are differentially expressed with p values of 0.03. Without further analysis, the basis of this correlation cannot be determined, but strongly correlated peaks in this mass range could reflect proteolytic fragments of the same protein, the expression of a set of related proteins in response to a stimulus, or post-translationally modified species.

<p id="Par53">Raw reads were processed to generate clean reads by removing the low-quality reads, reads containing poly-N or poly-A sequences, reads lacking the 3′ adaptor sequence, reads with length &lt; 18 nt or &gt; 30 nt, and adapter sequences. The clean reads were then mapped against the Tartary buckwheat genome (

The miRNA expression abundances were calculated and normalized by transcript per million (TPM), and differential expression analysis was carried out by the DEGSeq R package with FDR (false discovery rate) value &lt; 0.05 and |log2(fold change)| &gt; 1 as the threshold for significant difference. The potential target genes of miRNA were predicted by using TargetFinder software [

<p>Transcriptome diversity and their connections with critical biological processes have been investigated in multiple cancer types, among which non-coding RNAs took a large part (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kahles et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hua et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are &gt;200 nt RNA molecules with limited protein-coding capability, which have been once considered as transcriptional noises (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>). Studies have shown that lncRNAs exert their biological functions through various ways, including miRNA sponges (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Marchese et al., 2017</xref>), decoys to bind proteins (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2016</xref>), scaffolds or guides to regulate protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Engreitz et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). LncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in human cancers (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Niknafs et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Li S. et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Li Z. et al., 2018</xref>), including prostate cancer (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hua et al., 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In particular, down-regulation of UCA1 (urothelial carcinoma associated 1) inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cells by modulating MYO6 through sponging miR-143 (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is among the key factors impacting the treatment response, especially immunotherapy (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fridman et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mouw et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Thorsson et al., 2018</xref>). The infiltrated abundance of cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes within tumor microenvironment has shown prognostic and clinical implications in multiple cancer types (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fridman et al., 2017</xref>). A variety of immunogenomic features have been shown to contribute to influencing TIME, including tumor mutation burden and DNA damage repair defects (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bryant et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vitkin et al., 2019</xref>). Among genitourinary malignancies, prostate cancer shows unique TIME profiles with different features of infiltrated immune cell populations and immunogenomic features (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dallos and Drake, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vitkin et al., 2019</xref>). Through integrated analysis of lncRNA and immune features across 33 different cancer types, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li Y. et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated that lncRNAs were closely interacted with immune-related pathways and infiltrated immune cells in cancer. However, the landscape of aberrant lncRNAs and their interactions with immune features in prostate cancer have not been characterized.

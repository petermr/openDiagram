<p>While our results from the gerbil and elephant-shrew M/LWS reveal a possible link between molecular adaptations and ecological shifts, their daylight color vision is also mediated by SWS1, and possibly by RH1 pigment under mesopic conditions (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). To gain a more complete picture of visual phenotypes in these taxa, we also expressed these two pigments in vitro. We found that both of the SWS1 pigments are ultraviolet sensitive (Î»
 <sub>max</sub> 360 and 359 nm, respectively) and that RH1 has near-identical sensitivities (502 and 503 nm) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, neither SWS1 nor RH1 shows clear changes since the ancestral state (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We thus conclude that parallel transitions in color vision range of these two highly divergent mammals have been driven by functionally convergent changes in their M/LWS opsins, and may reflect ecological or temporal convergence on similar photic niches.

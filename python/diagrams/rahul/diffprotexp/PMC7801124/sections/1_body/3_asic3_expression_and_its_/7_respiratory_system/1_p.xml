<p>In rats, 58% of DRG neurones projecting to pleural and pulmonary tissues displayed ASIC3-like currents [
 <xref rid="cit0121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] and rASIC3-like currents have also been reported in vagal pulmonary sensory neurones [
 <xref rid="cit0122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], thus, sensory neurones are well equipped to respond to tissue acidification associated with respiratory disease via ASIC3. In cystic fibrosis (CF), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR) is faulty which leads to airway dysfunction leading to viscous mucous and reoccurring lung infections, and a contributory factor in this dysregulation includes a drop in pH [
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Human lung tissues show co-expression of CFTR and ASIC3, with ASIC3 levels upregulated in CF lung sections associated with the increased inflammation compared to non-CF tissue; additionally, hASIC3 was found to be co-expressed with CFTR in the following human epithelial cell lines, airway submucosal (Calu-3), bronchial (16HBE14o), colonic (T84) and pancreatic (CFPAC) cells, all from parts of the body that have been shown to develop acidic changes in CF patients [

<p>The slowest cooling rate at which a certain precipitation reaction is completely suppressed during cooling is defined as the UCCR. These values are provided in the lower left-hand corner of the diagrams. In cases where (in situ) DSC measurements were not possible up to cooling rates above the UCCR, the latter is estimated based on the hardness results.</p>

<p>Even though most studies on the hydrometallurgical processing of LIBs were performed on feed material that contained only LIBs, several research groups developed processes for treating streams of mixed spent batteries. Kulchaya et al. considered a blend of alkaline, Li-ion, Li primary, and Ni-based secondary batteries as feed material, but achieved low recovery [

<p>Many organic compounds can serve as leaching agents. Organic acids generally offer good selectivity but are usually more expensive than inorganic acids. A summary of organic acid processes found in the literature is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Tables S9 and S10</xref> in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Supplementary Materials</xref>. Golmohammadzadeh et al. provided an exhaustive list of organic leaching agents and a detailed analysis of mechanisms controlling leaching reactions [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Based on the comparison of organic and inorganic leaching agents provided in this publication, we perceived the selectivity of several organic acids, their biodegradability, and weaker material corrosion as the most important advantages of organic acid leaching.

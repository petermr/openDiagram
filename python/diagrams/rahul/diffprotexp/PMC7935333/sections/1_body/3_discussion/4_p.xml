 <italic>FYN</italic> encodes a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the control of cell growth, and it has been recognized as an oncogene in various tumor diseases, including melanoma, glioblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, prostate and breast cancers.
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26â€“28</xref> Interestingly, according to the survival and expression analysis performed in our study, we observed that FYN was down-regulated in TNBC comparing with non-TNBC, while the expression of 
 <italic>FYN</italic> was not associated with TNBC prognosis. Further study is still required to validate the bio-functions of the hub genes in vitro and in vivo.

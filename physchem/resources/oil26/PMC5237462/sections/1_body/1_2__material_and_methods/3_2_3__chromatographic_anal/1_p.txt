0: The essential oil analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar).
1: We used Shimadzu equipment, GCMS Shimadzu QP 5000, and employed a capillary column of fused silica OPTIMA 50.25  m, 30 m in length, and 0.25 mm internal diameter and nitrogen as a carrier gas.
2: The gas chromatograph operating conditions were as follows: internal column pressure of 67.5 kPa, split ratio 1 : 20, the gas flow in column 1.2 mL/min.
3: (210C), injector temperature 260C, and the temperature detector or the interface (GC-MS) of 280C.
4: The initial column temperature was 50C followed by an increase of 6C/min.
5: up to 260C and maintained constant for 30 min.
6: The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform readings in a range 29400 Da, 0.5 s intervals with ionization energy of 70 eV.

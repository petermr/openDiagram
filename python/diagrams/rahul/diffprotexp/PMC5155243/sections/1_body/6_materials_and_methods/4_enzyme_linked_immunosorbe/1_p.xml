<p>Another 20 mice (only MT+/+) were administrated with DU at a dose of 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. The fourth day post DU injection, kidney tissues were lysed, and the total protein content was determined. The level of ETHE1 in the kidney tissue was measured by ELISA kit (CUSABIO, Wuhan, Hubei, China). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a microplate reader. The concentration of ETHE1 was measured by calculation from a standard curve. The limit of detection for ETHE1 was 7.8 pg/ml.</p>

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Respirometry bioassays were conducted 3&#8201;h after the beetles were exposed or not exposed to garlic essential oil and their constituents, as previously detailed. The doses used corresponded to the recorded LC<sub>50</sub> of each toxic compound and control consisted of insect treated with distilled water. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) (&#956;L of CO<sub>2</sub> h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>/insect) production was measured with a respirometer of the type CO<sub>2</sub> Analyzer TR<sub>3</sub>C (Sable System International, Las Vegas, USA), using methodology adapted from previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Respirometers (25&#8201;mL) were used, each one holding 3 adults of <italic>T. molitor</italic> with mixed sex and connected to a closed system. CO<sub>2</sub> production was measured after the insects were acclimated in the chambers for a period of 12&#8201;h at a temperature of 27&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#8201;&#176;C. To quantify the CO<sub>2</sub> produced inside each chamber, compressed oxygen gas (99.99% pure) was passed through the chamber at a flow of 100&#8201;mL&#8201;min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for a period of 2&#8201;min. This airflow forces all produced CO<sub>2</sub> molecules to pass through an infrared reader coupled to the system, which makes a continuous measurement of the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by the insects and held inside each chamber. After CO<sub>2</sub> measurement, the insects were removed from the chambers and then weighed using an analytical balance (Sartorius BP 210D, G&#246;ttingen, Germany). Respiration rate values were not normalized by body mass because this method masks the individual effects of the variables<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Six replicates were used for each treatment.</p>

<p id="p0105">The PXRD analysis was performed to measure the crystallinity of the powders. Diffractograms were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, AL, USA). Powders were irradiated with monochromatized CuK
 <italic>α</italic> radiation (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.54 Å) and were inspected at a tube voltage of 40 kV and a tube current of 40 mA at a scan speed of 0.1 s/step in a 2
 <italic>θ</italic> angle range of 3°–40°.

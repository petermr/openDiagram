<p>The relationships between hub genes and prognosis were analyzed in TCGA-HNSC and were validated using the GSE41613 external data set (n = 97) and two randomly generated subsets of TCGA-HNSC (n = 250 and n = 249). Another two external data sets (GSE30784 (n = 212) and GSE37991 (n = 80)) were used to validate the expression of hub genes (CCR4, CCR8, and P2RY14) between normal and tumor tissues. To validate the gender differences, we then divided TCGA-HNSC data set into two sub-data sets by gender (male = 366, female = 133).</p>

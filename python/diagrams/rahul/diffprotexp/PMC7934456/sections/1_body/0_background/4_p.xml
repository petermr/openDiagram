<p id="Par16">RNA is a genetic macromolecule that plays numerous roles in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. RNA has three types, which have different locations and functions within the cell during an organism’s lifecycle Messenger RNA (mRNA), Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA). RNA is a significant element of ribozymes and riboproteins. The microdissection technique for isolating specific materials is required for gene expression profiling and has become a popular research area. Unlike single-celled organisms, higher plants have evolved into too complex organisms; they are categorized based on the essential functions performed by well-maintained organs and tissues. Current researchers ignore this point that plants have different cell types; therefore, their experimental results have not been in-depth or informative. Analysis of overall transcription levels with a high spatial resolution is mandatory to describe specific tissues’ status entirely. Therefore, differences in gene transcription at the single-cell level that occur in specialized plant cells are crucial for analyzing the mechanism of plant trait occurrence, and these differences have also sparked widespread interest among scientists [

Laser capture microdissection, laser microdissection, and pressure ejection are suitable sampling techniques for collecting homogeneous cells to analyze plant metabolites. Tapetum cells were excised by microdissection, and RNA was extracted and amplified to perform single-cell transcriptome sequencing. In the present study, we applied a multi-omics joint analysis to discover candidate genes that interact with the sterility gene

<p>Environmental pollution is evident worldwide and is obviously threatening human health, including increasing the risk of cancer. Among various pollutants, ubiquitous plastics are annually utilized in staggeringly large volumes; this has raised a public health concern. Phthalates are widely used as a plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride resin (PVC) in the production of plastics

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, they can easily migrate and penetrate human and animal bodies through various routes, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure

Thus, an investigation into the reproductive toxicity of phthalates is deemed necessary to heighten awareness of the need for protection against detrimental phthalates, and to propose potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for toxicity mitigation.

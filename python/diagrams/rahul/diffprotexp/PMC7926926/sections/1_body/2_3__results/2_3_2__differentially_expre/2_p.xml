<p>Under Al-stress condition, the comparison of LB-04 vs. CK-04 groups (combined effects of Al stress and 
 <italic>S. luteus</italic> inoculation on masson pine seedlings) showed 96 DEPs with 50 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated proteins in LB-04 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-11-00177-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) for these DEPs revealed that the proteins were associated with response to an organic substance, response to abiotic stimulus, and unfolded protein binding.

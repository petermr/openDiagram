 <caption> Visualization of chemical reaction spaces as graphs with molecules as nodes and reactions as edges. a Full network of bond dissociation reactions for carbon-, oxygen-, hydrogen-containing molecules with up to four heavy atoms. b Reduced reaction network of the initial steps of natural gas combustion. Nodes are colored according to the number of incident edges/reactions (their degree) from low (white) to high (dark green). </caption>

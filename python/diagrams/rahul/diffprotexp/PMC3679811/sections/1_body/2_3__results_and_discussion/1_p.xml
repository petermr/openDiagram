<p>Peritoneal dialysis is one of the therapeutic options for ESRD patients. The treatment involves introduction of a high glucose concentration of fluid to the patient peritoneum, which causes waste products in the blood to diffuse across the peritoneal membrane. DM is one of the major diseases treated by PD, in which the high glucose concentration may accelerate damage to the peritoneal membrane by increasing the permeability and decreasing the ultrafiltration efficiency. It will cause peritoneal membrane dysfunction and the patient may have fluid overload-related complications or eventually require hemodialysis. Long-term high blood glucose level will result in multiple organs damage due to either microangiopathy or macroangiopathy. Diabetes is the most common etiology of new uremic patients receiving dialysis therapy. Meanwhile, chronic glomerulonephritis is also one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease. It presented with long-term proteinuria and/or hematuria and slowly decreasing renal function, predominantly involving kidneys. Comparison of proteomic differentiation in peritoneal dialysis fluid from DM and CGN patients provides opportunity to noninvasively searching evidence or predicting biomarkers of glucotoxicity-related damage of peritoneum. It is impossible to obtain “healthy” control peritoneal dialysate. Thus, we utilized the peritoneal dialysate from CGN patients as control samples and compared them with the DM peritoneal dialysate. In this study, we described the observation of significant differential expression of several proteins in DM peritoneal dialysate.</p>

Results were expressed as the percentage of viable or dead cells (ratio of unstained or stained cells to the total number of cells, respectively). Cytotoxicity was also measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from damaged cells into culture medium and expressed as a percentage of total cellular activity. LDH activity in the medium was determined using a commercially available kit from BioSystems S.A (Barcelona, Spain) and expressed as a function of the total amount of the enzyme present in the

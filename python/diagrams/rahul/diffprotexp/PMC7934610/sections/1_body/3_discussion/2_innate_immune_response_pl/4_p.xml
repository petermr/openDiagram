<p>In addition to the antigen recognition system, innate immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], mast cells [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and macrophages [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] can also be activated and produce immune response when host tissues are infected by parasites. Reports have shown that if the expression levels of genes related to the activation and receptor recognition of these cells are upregulated, this may promote phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], killing of parasites [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] of hosts, and result in stronger resistance to parasites.

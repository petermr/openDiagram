0: Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are used to characterize the structural, vibrational, and dynamical properties of water in aqueous magnesium chloride (MgCl  2) solutions, and to develop a methodology to compute the hydration number (  h) of aqueous electrolytes from water reorientation dynamics.
1: The application of this protocol gives   h values of MgCl  2 solutions in excellent agreement with experimental hydration numbers obtained using GHztoTHz dielectric relaxation spectroscopy.

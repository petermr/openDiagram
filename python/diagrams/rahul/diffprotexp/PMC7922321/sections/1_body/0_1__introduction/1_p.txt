0: ETS proteins are present in metazoan lineages [ 1] and play a role in diverse biological processes.
1: Intriguingly, ETS proteins also exhibit extensive overlaps in their tissue expression profiles, with many members of this superfamily having ubiquitous expression [ 2].
2: Not surprisingly, members of this family also tend to exhibit overlapping and sometimes redundant DNA binding, as analyzed by genome-wide occupancy and other assays [ 3].

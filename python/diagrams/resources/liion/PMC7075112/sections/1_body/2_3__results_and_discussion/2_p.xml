<p>In order to evaluate the specific surface area and porosity of the HPC, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions curves were measured and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, the curve displays a typical type-IV adsorption-desorption isotherm with a type-H4 hysteresis loop [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], demonstrating the existence of both micropores and mesopores. A relatively high specific surface area of ~1714.83 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup> and a big pore volume (~1.13 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>) are obtained based on the BET test. These data are much greater than those of other biomass carbon material [

 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00346-f002">Figure 2</xref>d that the pore sizes of the HPC mainly distribute between 2 and 5 nm, presenting obvious mesoporous characteristics. These mesopores, as second-class pores, together with the first-class pores (macropores, ~70 nm), form a hierarchically porous structure. The large specific surface area makes the electrolyte–electrode interface large enough to accumulate rich charges and ions [

 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, the hierarchically porous structure can provide a fast channel for the migration of Li ions and electrons and provides enough space for the volume expansion/contraction during cycling to obtain a stable Li storage [

<p>The TG for each of the four groups were pooled together (n = 3) for protein extraction and homogenized using a pestle and 500 µL of 1x RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat# 89,900). Samples were put on a rocking shaker for 2 h and then centrifuged, and the supernatant removed to a new tube. Sample was assayed for total protein. (Bradford, ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were then prepared for electrophoresis by mixing with 2x sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 100°C for denaturation.</p>

0: The main output of the simulation is the force,  F, as a function of time and the position,  z, of the compound, from which we can readily calculate the work,  Wneq, required to pull the compound through the bilayer over a distance  Lz = d z, where  Lz is the width of the bilayer in the  z direction.
1: Wneq can be mathematically expressed as  Wneq =  F d z.
2: The average forcetime and forceposition profiles obtained from five individual trajectories for the 26 studied compounds are shown in Figure S2 in the  Supporting Information in the case of the GROMOS54a7 force-field and the DOPC membrane model.

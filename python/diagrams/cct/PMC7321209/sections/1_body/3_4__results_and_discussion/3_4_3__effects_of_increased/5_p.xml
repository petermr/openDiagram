<p>The side effect of adapted layer geometries was significant for the use of increased CTWD during WAAM. The change of the weld bead geometry at constant welding voltage, constant welding speed and constant wire feed has to be taken into account for path planning strategies. Especially if the value of the contact tube to work piece distance is set dynamically in the WAAM process to adapt the layer height or width.</p>

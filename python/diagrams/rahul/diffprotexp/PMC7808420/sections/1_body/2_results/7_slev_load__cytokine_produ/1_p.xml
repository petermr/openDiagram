<p>We moved on to the investigation of the slight resistance to SLEV infection presented by IFNγ-/- mice when compared to WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>). WT mice in the C57BL/6 background were inoculated with SLEV and euthanized on day 7 p.i. for sample collection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8</xref>). Plaque assays performed with mouse brain homogenates indicated that SLEV titers were similar between WT (C57BL/6) and IFNγ-/- brains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8a</xref>). Assessment of IFNγ levels indicated that this cytokine is expressed in high levels in WT mice brains on day 7 p.i. while no expression was detected in SLEV-infected IFNγ-/- mice, as expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8b</xref>). Levels of proinflammatory cytokines CCL5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8c</xref>), CXCL1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8d</xref>) and IL-1β (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8e</xref>) were elevated in both WT and IFNγ-/- mice on day 7 p.i. but to levels undistinguishable between WT (C57BL/6) and IFNγ-/- tissues. Brain samples from mock-infected mice were negative for SLEV presence and had undetectable to basal levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

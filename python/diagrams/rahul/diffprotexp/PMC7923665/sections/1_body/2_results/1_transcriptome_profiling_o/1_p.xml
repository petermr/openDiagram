<p id="Par29">To identify the aberrant molecular signatures in the cerebral AVM nidus structures, we employed in-depth RNA sequencing with RNA isolated from cerebral AVM nidus. The quality of the RNA was verified by formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A), and RNA was subjected to fragmentation and library preparation (Supplementary figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B–1C) and proceeded to sequencing. The qualities of RNA sequencing reads were very good in both controls and test samples, and 97.54% of sequencing reads for AVM nidus tissues and 91% reads in control tissues were mapped to the human reference human genome. After stringent comparisons, we identified 888 genes were upregulated and 203 genes were downregulated in cerebral AVM nidus tissues compared to control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). The top 100 differentially expressed genes were subjected for hierarchical cluster analysis using multiple experiments viewer (MeV v4.9.0), and the results are provided as a heat map representation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The gene products were further grouped into those linked to biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components (Supplementary figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>A–2B). The differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed to identify the aberrantly expressed genes, and based on enrichment analysis, DGE were classified into 41 functional pathway-related genes (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

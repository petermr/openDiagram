<p>Based on the advantages such as high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical windows, good interfacial contact, and effective lithium dendrite suppression, the SCEs are highly desired for application in all‐solid‐state lithium batteries. In this section, we mainly discuss the applications of SCEs in typical lithium metal batteries, Li‐S battery, and Li‐O

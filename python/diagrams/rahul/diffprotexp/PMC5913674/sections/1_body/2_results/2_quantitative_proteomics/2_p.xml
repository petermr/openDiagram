<p>To quantify protein abundance between drug-resistant (MtzR) and drug-susceptible (MtzS) isolates, 9 ratios were calculated with each MtzR replicate over all 3 MtzS replicates, and the geometric mean was calculated as a measure of fold change. Reporter ion intensity for each protein was calculated using the pooled control as a common denominator for each TMT channel for normalization and was analyzed statistically via a 1-sample 
 <italic>t</italic> test between treatments. Differential expression was contingent on proteins meeting both fold change and 
 <italic>P</italic> value cutoffs, as previously described for isobaric label quantitation [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, panel A. Principal component analysis (PCA) of each of the 3 10plexes indicated good separation between MtzS parent isolates and their isogenic MtzR lines (

Clustering of MtzR lines in the PCA indicated that all 3 MtzR lines were more variable between replicates than MtzS isogenic parents. Nonetheless, analysis of 
 <italic>P</italic> value distribution revealed an inverse exponential distribution (

<p>To analyze the differential expression of various proteins in hTCEpi cells following electric stimulation, cells were treated with AC EFs for 24 h as described above. Later, the cells were collected, washed and frozen cell pellets were sent to Sciomics GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany) for further analysis using scioDiscover protein arrays. For each condition, the array was performed in triplicate. Briefly, proteins were extracted, quantified, and labeled with fluorescent dyes. All six samples were analyzed in a dual-color approach using a reference-based design on scioCD antibody microarrays (Sciomics) targeting 1300 proteins. Each antibody is represented in eight replicates on the array. The arrays were blocked with scioBlock (Sciomics) on a Hybstation 4800 instrument (Tecan, Grödig, Austria). The resulting data were analyzed using the linear models for the microarray data (LIMMA) package of R-Bioconductor after uploading the median signal intensities for differential protein expression. For normalization, a specialized invariant Lowess method was applied, and for analysis of the samples, a one-factorial linear model was fitted with LIMMA, resulting in a two-sided 
 <italic>t</italic>-test or F-test based on moderated statistics. All presented 
 <italic>p</italic> values were adjusted for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate according to Benjamini and Hochberg. Proteins were defined as differential for |logFC| &gt; 0.2 and an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt; 0.05. Differences in protein abundance between different samples or sample groups are presented as log-fold changes (logFC) calculated for the basis of 2. In a study comparing samples versus control, a logFC = 1 means that the sample group had on average a 2
 <sup>1</sup> = 2-fold higher signal as the control group; logFC = −1 stands for 2
 <sup>−1</sup> = 1/2 of the signal in the sample as compared to the control group.

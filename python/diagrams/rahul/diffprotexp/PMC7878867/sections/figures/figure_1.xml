  <p>Effects of transgenerational water stress on chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance measured on the flag leaf every 5 days from flowering to 40 DPA (days post anthesis) in two durum wheat genotypes. Means ± SE for n = 8 are shown for chlorophyll content and means ± SE for n = 4 are shown for stomatal conductance. Different letters (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold>) denote statistically significant differences at the 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 level among treatment groups within a time-point. Capped lines show the l.s.d. values at 
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 for comparison among treatment groups at each time-point. The treatment groups are: AtCC (DBA Artemis control group parents, progeny treated with control), AtCW (DBA Artemis control group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress), AtWC (DBA Artemis water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with control), AtWW (DBA Artemis water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress); AuCC (DBA Aurora control group parents, progeny treated with control), AuCW (DBA Aurora control group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress), AuWC (DBA Aurora water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with control), AuWW (DBA Aurora water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress).

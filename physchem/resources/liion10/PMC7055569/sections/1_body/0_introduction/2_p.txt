0: Globally, energy and environmental issues are rife and prominent.
1: 1 Currently, the world is dealing with two great tasks: forthcoming reduction of hydrocarbon fuel resources aggravated by an increasing demand for energy due to the population and economic growths.
2: [qv: 1c,2] In efforts to address those problems, the penetration of solar conversion technologies is the crucial target; which is today limited by the absence of a cheap battery technology.
3: In that context, rechargeable batteries have been extensively studied for more efficient and environmentally benign energystorage systems.
4: 3 Among all myriad rechargeable battery systems, lithiumion batteries (LIBs) are considered the most promising technology for energy storage applications and also as a key system to build lowcarbon, sustainable electricity platform.
5: LIBs have huge applications in all portable electronic gadgets, electric and hybrid electric vehicles and gridscale energy storage systems.
6: 4 But its largescale production for grid application is uncertain since there is a controversial debate about lithium availability and cost because battery industry requires almost 50% of the available resources of lithium.
7: 5f Additionally, limited Liion conductivity in aprotic electrolytes and poor safety may also cause problems for its largescale utilization.
8: Those drawbacks motivate researchers to find new energy storage technologies alternative to LIBs among which rechargeable metalair batteries emerge as a new promising class of electrical storage ( Figure1).

0: The Caki-1 (overexpression of XIAP) and XIAP-shRNA-pENTR/U6 (XIAP-knockdown) renal cell lines were harvested.
1: The two cell lines were cultured with 10% FBS McCoy's 5A medium (cat no.
2: SH30200.01; Hyclone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA), and the cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin (cat no.
3: REK3011; OXOID; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).
4: Each of the cell lines was divided into 8 T-75 cell culture bottles, each with 15 ml cell suspension.
5: Caki-1 cells and XIAP-shRNA cells were treated with 60 g/ml etoposide for 0.5, 3 and 12 h at 37C.
6: The control group was set at 0 h. Samples were ground in liquid nitrogen.

<p>All aerobic nitrogen fixation occurs in heterocysts in a semiregular pattern, and nitrogen fixed in heterocysts is transported to vegetative cells in the filament; vegetative cells supply carbon and reductants to heterocysts [

 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The heterocyst is the site of dinitrogen fixation and provides oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase with a low-oxygen environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In general, heterocysts lack photosystem II activity and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, and they cannot photoreduce CO
 <sub>2</sub> via the reductive pentose phosphate pathway to provide carbon skeletons for assimilation of fixed nitrogen [

 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The heterocyst develops a special glycolipid layer that serves as a gas diffusion barrier, and the heterocyst glycolipid layer can be modified in response to the external O2 concentration [

However, other studies suggested that heterocysts are not the only cells capable of nitrogen fixation in heterocystous cyanobacteria and that vegetative cells can fix molecular nitrogen using another nitrogenase encoded by a homologous gene cluster named as nif2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mutants of heterocystous cyanobacteria (

 <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, studies are needed to evaluate the nitrogen fixation ability of vegetative cells and photosynthetic ability of heterocysts in cyanobacteria.

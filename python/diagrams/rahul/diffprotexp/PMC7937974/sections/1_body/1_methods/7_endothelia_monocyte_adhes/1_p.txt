0: The HCAECs were seeded into 12-well plates, cultured to 100% fusion.
1: THP-1 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37C labeled with 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM).
2: The fluorescently labeled THP-1 (1  10 5/well) cells were added into HCAECs, then incubated at 37C for 1 h. Suspended THP-1 cells were removed with Hank's balanced salt solution with HEPES buffer (HHBS), cell lysis buffer was added, and scraped.
3: The images were collected under a fluorescence microscope.
4: The fluorescence intensity was measured at microplate reader excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 530 nm, respectively.

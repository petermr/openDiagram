<p>It is worth emphasizing that in the considered systems the tendency to form molecular aggregates between drugs molecules can be treated as a competitive effect that weakens the effectiveness of the adsorption process. What is more, in an aqueous environment, the solvent effects (hydrophobic hydration and solvation) are known to obstruct adsorption. Therefore, it can be assumed that the adsorption on the hydrophobic, unmodified carbon nanotube will be less efficient than obtained in the presented simulation.</p>

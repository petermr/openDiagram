<p>The result indicates that under a low austenitizing temperature of 950 Â°C, the inclusions did not have much influence on microstructure transformation. On the one hand, austenite grain size was small, and the grain boundary area increased, which promoted grain boundary reaction products such as GBF and bainite [

On the other hand, at lower austenitizing temperatures, the formation of the MDZ around inclusions was not sufficient, which would reduce the ability to induce AF nucleation. Higher austenitizing temperatures would promote wider MDZ development and AF formation [

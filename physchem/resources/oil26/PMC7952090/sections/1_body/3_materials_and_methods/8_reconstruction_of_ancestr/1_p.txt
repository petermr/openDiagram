0: We encoded the copy number of each gene for each species as a discrete trait ranging from 0 (one gene copy) to 31 (for 32+ gene copies) and used IQ-TREE to select the best-fitting model of character evolution ( Minh et al., 2020;  Hoang et al., 2018;  Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017;  Wang et al., 2018;  Schrempf et al., 2019), which was inferred to be a Jukes-Cantor type model for morphological data (MK) with equal character state frequencies (FQ) and rate heterogeneity across sites approximated by including a class of invariable sites (I) plus a discrete Gamma model with four rate categories (G4).
1: Next we inferred gene duplication and loss events with the empirical Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) method implemented in IQ-TREE ( Minh et al., 2020;  Hoang et al., 2018;  Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017;  Wang et al., 2018;  Schrempf et al., 2019), the best fitting model of character evolution (MK+FQ+GR+I) ( Soubrier et al., 2012;  Yang et al., 1995), and the unrooted species tree for Atlantogenata.
2: We considered ancestral state reconstructions to be reliable if they had Bayesian Posterior Probability (BPP)  0.80; less reliable reconstructions were excluded from pathway analyses.
3: We note that there may be 'ghost' duplication events, that is genes that duplicated in, for example, the Tethytherian stem-lineage that are maintained in the Stellars sea cow genome and lost in the manatee genome.
4: These genes will be reconstructed as a Proboscidean-specific duplication events because we cannot determine copy number in extinct species that lack genomes.

0: A stock solution was prepared with essential oil, presolubilized in Tween 80, and dissolved in 93 mL of water to obtain a concentration of 1500 ppm.
1: From this solution, a dilution series was prepared to obtain the concentrations of solutions 500, 400, 300, 200, and 130 ppm.
2: For each replicate of a treatment, 10 larvae were used, pipetted into a beaker containing 100 mL of distilled water.
3: Then, the larvae were removed from the beaker into the test container, thus minimizing the time between the preparation of the first and last sample.
4: The safety of the solvent was observed in the concentration used, with the same present also in control of the replicas.
5: During the experiment, the average water temperature was 25C.
6: After 24 and 48 hours, dead larvae were counted, being considered as all those unable to reach the surface.
7: The data obtained from the mortality (%)  concentration (ppm) were analyzed by SPSS in probit graph to determine the lethal concentration that causes 50% mortality of the population (LC 50).

<p>Larval protein extractions were carried out according to our previously described method 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method. BSA was used as standard and the absorption was measured at 595 nm (Beckman, spectrophotometer DU800). The extracted protein (380 µg from each sample with 3 replicates) were resuspended in lysis buffer (LB) [8M urea, 2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mM Tris-base, 30 mM DTT, 2% Bio-lyte pH 3–10] and then mixed with rehydration buffer [8M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.001% bromophenol blue, 45 mM DTT, 0.2% Bio-lyte pH 3–10]. The mixture was loaded onto a 17 cm IPG strip (immobilized pH gradient, pH 3–10, linear, Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed at 18°C according to manufacturer's instructions (Protean IEF Cell, Bio-Rad). Before sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the IPG strips were first equilibrated for 15 minutes in equilibration buffer 1 [6M urea, 0.375M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% DTT] followed by equilibration in buffer 2 [6M urea, 0.375M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2.5% iodoacetoamide] for another 15 minutes. Then, the strips were transferred onto 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel (1.00 mm). Second dimension electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, was performed on a Protean II Xi Cell (Bio-Rad) at 25 mA/gel for 6 hours.

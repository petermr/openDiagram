<p>Brains were removed immediately from killed mice, weighed (around 300 mg) and immersed in ice cold mitochondria isolating buffer (MIB) (0.25 M sucrose, 0.5 mM potassium EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4). All glassware and equipment was kept cold (4°C). The brain tissue was homogenized in 4.0 mL of 12% percoll in MIB, with a Dounce homogenizer with 30 strokes. The homogenate (~3.5 mL) was then layered onto a previously poured 3.5 mL 26% percoll which itself had been poured over 3.5 mL of 40% percoll. The sample was centrifuged at 30,000 g for 1 minutes at 4°C. The top layer containing myelin and other cellular debris was carefully removed using a Pasteur pipette and discarded. The second layer containing the mitochondria was carefully removed and diluted 1:4 in cold MIB and centrifuge at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended with 1 mL MIB and centrifuged once more at 15,000 g for 10 minutes. The pellet was then vortexed in mitochondria lysis buffer for 1 minute and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant protein concentration was determined and the samples were stored at -80°C until further analysis.</p>

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par21">&#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;, for which the wheat reference genome is available, is insensitive to ToxB. Based on this, as well as the existing evidence in the published literature and the identification of a single ToxB sensitivity locus via analysis of the association mapping panel undertaken here, Chinese Spring would be expected to contain a non-functional allele/deleted gene at the <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus. Of the few additional hexaploid wheat varieties for which a genome sequence is currently available, only one has previously been shown to be ToxB sensitive: &#8216;W9784&#8217; (Friesen and Faris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). This is a synthetic hexaploid wheat, derived by the hybridisation of the tetraploid wheat species <italic>Triticum durum</italic> Desf. with the diploid wheat progenitor <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic>. Although the contig length of the &#8216;W9784&#8217; de novo genome assembly (Chapman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>) represents just 55% (7.88&#160;Gb) of the 14.27&#160;Gb &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; RefSeq v1.0 assembly (IWGSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>), we nevertheless attempted to exploit this resource to investigate possible gene content in the <italic>Tsc2</italic> region. We first aligned the &#8216;W9784&#8217; assembly to the &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; genome, and then extracted primary alignments to a highly conservative physical interval across the &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; <italic>Tsc2</italic> region (2B: 14,040,000&#8211;30,500,000&#160;bp), spanning GWAS hit 15 (BS00085748_51, proximal) through to hit 23 (BS00022572_51, distal). This region comfortably includes the 2129-kb interval as defined from the combined AM and MAGIC analyses. The &#8216;W9784&#8217; scaffolds were stitched together to form a single &#8216;super-contig&#8217; (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) consisting of 705 scaffolds with a mean scaffold size of 5.6&#160;Kb. The un-gapped assembled super-contig was 3.47&#160;Mb representing 64.3% of the &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; region (5.39&#160;Mb). We then undertook gene annotation of the &#8216;W9784&#8217; super-contig (see Supplementary Text 1), resulting in the identification of 379 gene models (Supplementary Table 6). After excluding gene models annotated as transposable elements, 23 potential candidate genes were identified in the remaining 347 models, including four within the GWAS interval encompassing hits 1&#8211;8, 10 and 12 (from SNPs Kukri_c148_1512 to Kukri_c63748_1453; &#8216;W9784&#8217; gene models jg131, jg166 and jg172) (Supplementary Table 6). Three of these candidates were annotated as LRR receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinases. Gene jg131 is collinear with &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; gene model TraesCS2B01G047800, while jg166 is absent in the collinear region of &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;, and jg172 appears to be present (99% average CDS nucleotide identity), but not annotated as a gene in &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217;. In addition, a WRKY transcription factor (jg224), collinear with &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; gene TraesCS2B01G050500 annotated as a TIR-NBS-LRR domain disease resistance protein, was identified. Of these, jg166, jg172 and jg224 were located within the interval defined by the peak of the MAGIC QTL (from SNPs Kukri_c148_1512 to Kukri_c63748_1453). Using a cut-off of 80% CDS sequence similarity, 51 genes in the &#8216;W9784&#8217; assembly were found to be absent from the <italic>Tsc2</italic> region in &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; (Supplementary Table 6). Details of all &#8216;W9784&#8217; genes and candidate genes are summarised in Supplementary Table 6. As the contig size of the &#8216;W9784&#8217; assembly is very low, with an N50 of 6.7&#160;kb, we did not undertake further characterisation of its genic content. Nevertheless, this information provides a starting point with which to undertake future studies.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Circos plot illustrating key genomic and genic features of the &#8216;Synthetic W7984&#8217; &#8216;super-contig&#8217; (705 assembly scaffolds, totalling 3.47&#160;Mb) spanning the wider <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus, based on the &#8216;Chinese Spring&#8217; region 2B: 14,040,000&#8211;30,500,000&#160;bp.

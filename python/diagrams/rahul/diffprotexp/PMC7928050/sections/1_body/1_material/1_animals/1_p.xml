<p>We used a total of 22 female C57BL/6 N mice, with an average age of all animals of 11.7 (±1.4) weeks, mean weight was 21.8 (±1.4)g. SWAT specimen of 4 animals were used before transplantation for RNA analysis. All remaining animals (N = 18) had an autologous fat transplantation into a dorsal skinfold chamber as described previously[
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Mean fat transplant weight was 0.01 (±0.01)g. Randomized 9 animals were euthanized via cervical dislocation 7 days after transplantation and tissue samples were used for RNA analysis. The remaining 9 animals were euthanized 15 days after transplantation, and transplanted adipose tissue was collected for RNA-analysis.

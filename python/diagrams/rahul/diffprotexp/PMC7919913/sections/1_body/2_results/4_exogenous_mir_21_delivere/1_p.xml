<p>To determine the role of exogenous miR-21 in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, miR-21 inhibitor was pre-transfected into recipient cardiomyocytes. Next, MVs were collected from the conditioned medium and incubated with the pre-transfected recipient cells for 48â€‰h. Compared with the cells transfected with NC RNA, cells incubated with MVs isolated from conditioned medium underwent hypertrophy, while cells pre-transfected with miR-21 inhibitor were resistant to MV-induced increase of cell size (

Transfection of miRNA21 inhibitor reduced miR-21 levels by more than 70% compare with cells transtected with a negative control (

<sup>&#8722;4</sup> M), was mixed with 37.5 &#956;L of sample solution (range 2.4&#8211;0.300 mg/mL), and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s at room temperature (RT). The decrease in absorption at 517 nm, against blank, was measured after 20 min using an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601, Kyoto, Japan). The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated by the following equation:

Foraging enrichment was used the most during PM observations (55.31 &#177; 7.08% of time) compared to exploring enrichment (4.58 &#177; 1.02% of time). During MID observations, use of enrichment was similar between the two enrichment goals (foraging: 1.56 &#177; 0.57% of time; exploring: 1.56 &#177; 0.06% of time), but during AM observations, exploring (1.65 &#177; 0.63% of time) was used more than the foraging (0.55 &#177; 0.29% of time) enrichment. Rates of enrichment use followed a similar pattern. Time spent using and event counts for using the individual items also varied significantly among the three time periods (F

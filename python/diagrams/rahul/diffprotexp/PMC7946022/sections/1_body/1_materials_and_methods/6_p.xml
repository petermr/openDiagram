 <bold>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of explanted catheters for evaluation of 
  <italic>in vivo</italic>-grown biofilms
 </bold>. In order to visualize the biofilms formed within the lumen of the catheters, representative fragments from each group were processed for SEM analysis. Explanted catheters were rinsed with PBS then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Catheters were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS for 1 hr, washed with buffer, dehydrated in a series of graded ethyl alcohol, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 3 times in 100% for 10 mins each. Specimens were critical-point dried in CO
 <sub>2</sub>, mounted on SEM pin mounts, and sputter coated with platinum-palladium (EMS 150 T ES). SEM images were acquired using a Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR), and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software.

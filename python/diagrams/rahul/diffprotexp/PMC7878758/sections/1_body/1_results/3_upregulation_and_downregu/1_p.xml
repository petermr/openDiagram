<p id="Par12">Based on the combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis it was observed that 29, 36 and 20% of genes/proteins were found to be upregulated by more than one log-fold for the initiation of regeneration mechanism in gecko. Similarly, 39, 24 and 53% of genes/proteins were found to be downregulated for the regeneration mechanism. Crucial genes/proteins such as Haemoglobin subunit-β (HBB)

 </sup>, AnnexinA2 (ANXA2), CTSB, OGN, ANXA2, ADH1, mTORC1, ACTN1 and RARRES1 were found to be upregulated and associated with pain and inflammation, DNA repair, ubiquitination, proteasomal activities and cellular morphology at 1-dpa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Subsequent downregulation of these genes/proteins were observed on 2-dpa indicating the downregulation of inflammation and PTMs. Whereas cellular and other skeletal &amp; muscle development process were found to be upregulated on 2-dpa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e) through the upregulation of ACTN3, CCL5, PLA2, TRIM63, ELF3, UCP3 and BIN1. Similarly, on 5-dpa all the genes/proteins involved in inflammation and various PTMs were found to be downregulated which were found upregulated at 1 and 2-dpa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e).

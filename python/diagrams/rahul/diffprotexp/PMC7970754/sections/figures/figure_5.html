 <caption> Comprehensive regulatory network for resveratrol in treating MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) (a) POLD1 expression in BRCA samples of TCGA database. (b) POLD1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells samples after resveratrol treatment. (B) Protein expression of POLD1 after treatment with different concentrations of resveratrol (* P=0.043, ** P=0.004, *** P&lt;0.001). (C) Combined prediction model of resveratrol and POLD1 domain. (D) POLD1-differential apoptotic pathway gene-apoptotic pathway correlation pathway map. (E) Comprehensive regulatory network diagram. Red represents POLD1, yellow represents genes that interact with POLD1, blue represents genes that are affected by other resveratrol treatments for TNBC, and green represents pathways. </caption>

0: As mentioned above, several differential expression analyses have been performed between purple and non-purple carrot roots allowing the identification of the main structural genes and TFs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in whole roots and/or phloem tissues 16,  21,  23  26.
1: However, the identification and functional prediction of lncRNA in carrot or putatively involved in carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation has not yet been reported.
2: In the present study, we combined a high throughput stranded RNA-Seq based approach with a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline, to annotate lncRNAs and analyze the expression profiles of lncNATs putatively associated to the carrot root anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation.
3: In addition, we individually analyzed the gene expression patterns in phloem and xylem root of purple and orange  D. carota genotypes.
4: Our findings point to a role of antisense transcription in the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation in the carrot root at a tissue-specific level.

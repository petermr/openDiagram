The hydro-distillation experiment was carried out thrice to obtain enough oil for bioactivity assays and the extracted essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, dispensed into tinted vials and stored at 4&#160;&#176;C. The yield of the essential oil was determined in <italic>w</italic>/w% (per gram) of the extracted plant sample.</p>

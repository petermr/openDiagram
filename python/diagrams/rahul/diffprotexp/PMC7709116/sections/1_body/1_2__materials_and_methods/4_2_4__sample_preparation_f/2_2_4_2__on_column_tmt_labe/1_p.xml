<p>Stage tips were packed with two punches of C18 mesh (Empore) by using the blunt end of a 16-gauge needle as described [
 <xref rid="B25-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and were then conditioned with 50 μL methanol (MeOH), followed by 50 μL 50% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA, and finally, the tips were equilibrated three times with 75 μL 0.1% TFA. The nuclei digest was loaded onto the C18 resin by spinning at 3500× 
 <italic>g</italic>. Thereafter, 100 μL freshly prepared HEPES, pH 8, with 2 μL of TMT reagent (from stock) was passed over the C18 resin at 350× 
 <italic>g</italic> until the entire solution had passed through. After TMT labeling, the C18 resin was washed twice with 75 μL 0.1% TFA and peptides were eluted with 50 μL 50% ACN/0.1% TFA followed by a second elution with 50% ACN/20 mM ammonium formate (NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>2</sub>), pH 10. After using 5% of the elution volume to determine labeling efficiency, the samples were mixed prior to fractionation and analysis.

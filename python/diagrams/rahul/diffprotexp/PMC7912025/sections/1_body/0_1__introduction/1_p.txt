0: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for seasonal outbreaks of respiratory tract infections worldwide.
1: This enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus of the human  Orthopneumovirus genus of the Pneuomoviridae family is the most common cause of pediatric hospitalization in children less than 5 years of age [ 1].
2: After inoculation into the nasopharynx, RSV fuses with ciliated epithelial cells and replicates to high levels, spreading throughout the airways to the conductive and lower-airway cells involved in gas exchange.
3: Here, productive infection in small-airway epithelial cells induces the rapid secretion of cytokines [ 2], interferons [ 3], exosomes [ 4], and damage-associated patterns [ 5] that mediate mucus production and leukocytic inflammation.
4: The findings that the initial clinical manifestations of hypoxia are correlated with epithelial-derived cytokines [ 6, 7] detected in the airway fluids of naturally infected children and experimentally challenged adults [ 7, 8, 9] indicate that the innate immune response (IIR) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of disease.

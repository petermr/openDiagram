0: An RNA pull-down assay was conducted to validate the interaction between circ_0003865 and miR-3653-3p using the biotin-LNA-3865 probe (5-TGGATCTGAATCTGTGTAACT-3) synthesized by the GENEray company (Shanghai, China) as previously described [ 26].
1: Briefly, cultured 293T cells overexpressing circ_0003865 were lysed and incubated with the abovementioned probes for 2 h and pulled down with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (#08014; Sigma Aldrich).
2: After washing three times with PBS, the eluates were analyzed by quantitative PCR method to detect both circ_0003865 and miR-3653-3p.
3: At least three biological replicates were conducted.

 <caption> Expression of CK-19 in cPTC, benign cystic lesions and references. (A) Western blot analyses of CK-19 with depleted cyst fluids of cPTCs and benign lesions from the LC-MS/MS screening samples. Depleted cyst fluids of a parathyroid adenoma (PHPT), anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and total protein extract from A549 cells are shown as reference. Representative transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane stained with 0.1% Ponceau S solution used as loading control is shown below. ( B) Immunohistochemistry showing CK-19 expression in cPTC tissue tumor cells but not in surrounding normal thyroid cells (cPTCâ€”normal) or multinodular goiter (Benign). </caption>

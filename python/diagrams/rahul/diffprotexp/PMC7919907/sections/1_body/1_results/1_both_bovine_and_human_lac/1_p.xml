<p>The antiviral activity of bovine and human lactoferrins was first tested in cytopathogenic effect (CPE) assay in cell culture against multiple HCoVs, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43. Bovine lactoferrin (BLF) exhibited potent antiviral activity against all three HCoVs tested, with 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values ranging from 11.2 to 37.9 µg/ml (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(A,E))</xref>. Human lactoferrin (HLF) also showed potent antiviral activity against all three HCoVs tested, however, it was about 3–8 folds less potent than BLF with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 35.7 to 117.9 µg/ml (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(B,E))</xref>. Both BLF and HLF were not cytotoxic to the cells at the concentration ranges tested (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(A–D)</xref>, blue lines). Significantly, BLF also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 571.5 ± 72.8 µg/ml in the immunofluorescence imaging assay (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(A,E))</xref>. Given the higher inhibitory potency of BLF versus HLF, BLF was chosen for the following experiments. To confirm the antiviral activity of BLF, a secondary viral yield reduction (VYR) assay was performed to determine the effect of BLF treatment on infectious virus production. As measured in plaque assay, BLF dose-dependently inhibited infectious virion production of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 in cell culture at 2 days post infection (dpi), with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 9.6 to 45.9 µg/ml (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(C,E))</xref>. Next, to test the inhibitory effect of BLF on viral replication over time, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 were amplified with and without BLF in MRC-5, Vero E6, and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, respectively, and the viral titers in the cell culture supernatants were quantified at different time points post-viral infection by plaque assay (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(D))</xref>. It was found that BLF decreased the viral titers of all three viruses by more than 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> units at all time points, and it significantly inhibited the viral replication of HCoV-NL63, as there was no obvious viral titer increase up to 120 h post infection (hpi) (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(D)</xref>, middle panel). Taken together, both BLF and HLF had potent antiviral activity against multiple common HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2, indicating LF is a promising antiviral drug candidate.

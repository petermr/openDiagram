<p>Among 6 genes that were differentially expressed and unique for only group 6, in which animals were treated with both ibuprofen and FPI, starting on day 3 after the infection, we have found two genes directly responsible for immune functions. One of them was CD180. It is a radioprotective 105 kDa (RP105) protein, which is an unconventional member of the TLR family expressed on the cell surface. As reviewed [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], unlike typical TLR, RP105 does not have an intracellular Toll-IL-1R signaling domain and is expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes. However, this protein has the opposite role in B cells versus myeloid cells. In B cells RP105 promotes activation and also works as an anti-apoptotic factor, preventing radiation- and steroid-induced apoptosis. In contrast, in myeloid cells RP105 is associated with suppression of an inflammatory cytokine response to LPS. It is also known that certain molecular patterns, like mycobacterial lipoprotein, activate macrophages through RP105. These dual roles of RP105 may be explained by different coreceptors of RP105 in different cells, such as CD19 that is expressed only on B cells. In myeloid cells only TLR2 and TLR4 are coreceptors of RP150. As for the role of this molecule in viral infections, up-regulated expression of RP150 in B cells of patients with influenza was previously reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0246695.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our study expression of RP150 was lower in lesional than non-lesional lung. The role of BRSV in the expression of this protein and the potential effect of the therapeutics remain to be discovered. One possible explanation pertains to the relatively late stage of infection (day 10) when samples were taken and thus RP105 expression may be a result of an anti-inflammatory (pro-resolving) environment within lesion areas.

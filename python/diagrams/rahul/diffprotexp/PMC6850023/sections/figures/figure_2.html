 <caption> Normalized spectral counts (means ± SE; n = 3) of differentially expressed linear alkane oxidation proteins during growth on a linear alkane ( n‐C 14/C14) a non‐hydrocarbon control (Pyruvate/PYR) and a branched alkane (Pristane/PRI) in A. borkumensis SK2 T; treatments not sharing a letter ( a or b) differ at P &lt; 0.05 (Tukey's HSD). Two different alkane oxidation systems were detected. A. 1. Cytochrome P450 introduces oxygen into the alkane at the terminal carbon converting it into a primary alcohol. 2. AlkJ2 further oxidizes the primary alcohol generated into an aldehyde. 3. Ferredoxin reductase oxidizes NADH to NAD + shuttling electrons (e −) to the P450 through a ferredoxin. B. 4/5. Monooxygenases introduce oxygen into the alkane at the terminal carbon converting it into a primary alcohol. 6. AlkJ2 further oxidizes the primary alcohol generated into an aldehyde. 7. Aldehyde dehydrogenase converts the aldehyde into a fatty acid, which enters β‐oxidation. 8. Aldehyde reductase also converts the aldehyde into a fatty acid, which enters β‐oxidation. 9. Rubredoxin reductase oxidizes NADH to NAD + shuttling electrons (e −) to the monooxygenase through a rubredoxin. </caption>

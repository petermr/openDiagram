<p id="p0160">V-type ATPase (VATA), an up-regulated protein in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D.Â melanogaster</italic>, is categorized as a rotary ATP synthase/ATPase complex 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. ATP synthase is a key enzyme of mitochondrial energy conversion, and inhibition of ATP synthase may cause energy deprivation and increased reactive oxygen species production. A high reactive oxygen species content induces cellular necrosis and/or apoptosis 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Because the oxidative phosphorylation pathway is induced (via both VATA and ND75 up-regulation) by RGE treatment, this may provide the energy for the antiaging process and life span extension.

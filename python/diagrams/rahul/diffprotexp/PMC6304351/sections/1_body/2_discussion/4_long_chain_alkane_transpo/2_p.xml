<p>TOL_0244 encodes a TonB-dependent receptor. These receptors are specialized, ligand specific, and use active transport to move compounds against a concentration gradient through the proton-motive force generated through physical interaction with TonB-ExbB-ExbD, an inner membrane complex (

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Postle and Kadner, 2003</xref>). TonB dependent receptor homologs have been detected and implicated in the uptake of alkanes in other OHCB such as OmpS in 
 <italic>Alcanivorax dieselolei</italic> B-5 (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Shao, 2014</xref>). The outer membrane protein OmpS (B5T_01485) shares a 40.3% similarity with TOL_0244 and shares conserved domains with a TonB-dependent receptor protein responsible for ferric citrate transport in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EGD69624). OmpS was found to not only detect the presence and utilize alkanes but also trigger the expression of an alkane chemotaxis response. Active transport proteins involved in the uptake of alkanes are not fully understood and only the TonB active transport system had been previously described to be involved.

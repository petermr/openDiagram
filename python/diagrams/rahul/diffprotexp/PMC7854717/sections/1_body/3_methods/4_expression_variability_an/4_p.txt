0: Higher positive  REC values indicate genes whose expression level is strongly controlled by the cellular homeostatic mechanisms to limit their fluctuations within narrow intervals, critical for the cell survival, phenotypic expression or/and integration in the multicellular structure of the myocardium.
1: By contrast, lower negative  RECs are associated with less controlled genes that be used as cell adaptors to the slight fluctuations of the environmental conditions, as seen in the biological replicas.
2: Similarly, high  PRECs are associated with critically important pathways to preserve the phenotype against slight fluctuations of the environment and low  PRECs with adapting pathways.

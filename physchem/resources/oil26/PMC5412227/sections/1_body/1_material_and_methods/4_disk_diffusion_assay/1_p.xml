<p>The protocols used in this study were conducted according to the guidelines of CLSI, formerly known as NCCLS (Wayne 2007) with slight modifications. In summary, each sterile Petri dish with a diameter of 9 cm was prepared with 20 ml of Mueller-Hinton medium. Then, 100 μL of a bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was spread on the plates. After 5 min, a sterile filter paper disc (6 mm) containing 20 μL of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil was placed on the surface of the plate. In order to accelerate essential oil diffusion into the agar, the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by incubation at 37 °C, for 24 to 48 h. The diameters of the inhibition zones (mm) were measured, including the diameter of the disks. Gentamycin (30 μg/disk) and vancomycin (30 μg/disk) served as positive controls for Gram-positive and Gram-negative, respectively. All tests were performed in triplicate.

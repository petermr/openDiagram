<p id="Par12">To assess critical patients with different clinical outcomes and better identify the key turnover in their in-hospital period, we used 113 transcriptomic profiles to perform principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis. PCA roughly divided patient samples into three categories that were highly correlated with disease severity and clinical outcome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The distribution of the three clusters showed that each cluster mainly corresponded to one group of the patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). However, Cluster 2 contained approximately 30% of non-survivor samples suggesting that the longitudinal samples of critical survivors had a different gene expression pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). We further displayed the clustering results in longitudinal order and found that most initial time-points of critical patients were classified into Cluster 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Interestingly, after the first Cluster 1 time-points (P085, P086 and P087), in-hospital time-points of three critical survivors transformed from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2, while overall cluster transition was much lower among critical non-survivors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). These results indicate that phase transition in critical survivors, but not in non-survivors, may be an important reason for the different outcomes.

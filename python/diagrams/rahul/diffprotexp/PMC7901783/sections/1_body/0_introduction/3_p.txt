0: The RNAi mechanism induces gene silencing by targeting genes in a sequence-specific manner through chromatin modification, messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translation inhibition [ 18].
1: The RNAi mechanism is necessary to the host since it controls endogenous expression and translation and counteracts exogenous particles such as transposons and viruses [ 19,  20].
2: The mechanism of action in RNAi involves processing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into 2124 nucleotides by Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes [ 21].
3: Argonaute (AGO) family proteins cleave dsRNA into two single-stranded RNAs (guide and passenger RNAs), stabilize association of guide RNA onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and direct the RISC toward the target sequence, which ultimately leads to transcriptional or posttranscriptional gene silencing [ 22].
4: Furthermore, gene silencing can be reinforced by incorporation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) enzyme activity through generation of secondary dsRNA that can result in systemic gene silencing [ 21,  23].
5: During viral infection in plants, recruitment of AGO1-5 and RDR1,6 plays an important role in viral gene silencing [ 24 26].

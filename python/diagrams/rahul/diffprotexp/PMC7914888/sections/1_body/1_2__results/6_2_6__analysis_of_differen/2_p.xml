<p>The Cdk4 mRNA showed a decrease concerning the control cells only for L-Tyr with rER of 0.79 ± 0.1 (1.25 X) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f005">Figure 5</xref>d). As is known, the sustained activation of the binding of the CCDN1 protein to the CDK4 protein kinase allows the early transition from G1 to S in the cell cycle, increasing the phosphorylation of the Rb retinoblastoma protein and releasing the E2F family of transcriptional regulators [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In both cases, the decrease in 
 <italic>Ccnd1</italic> was consistent with the increase in the number of cells arrested in G0/G1 observed in cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>e). Although in 
 <italic>Cdk4</italic> it only presented a statistically significant reduction for exposure to L-Tyr, in both cases, the decrease in these mRNAs coincides with the increase in miR-129-5p and 30d-5p (

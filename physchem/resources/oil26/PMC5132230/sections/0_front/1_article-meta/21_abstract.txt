2: Essential oils have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activity.
3: This study evaluated the chemical composition of the   A.   suaveolens essential oil, and its cytotoxic, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity on   Artemia salina Leach.
4: The plant species was collected in Fazendinha district in the city of Macapa-AP.
5: The essential oil obtained from the process was performed by hydrodistillation and identification of components by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer.
6: The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the kidnapping method of 2,2- diphenyl -1-picrilhidrazil radical, while the cytotoxic activity was assessed using saline A. and the microbiological activity was carried out by microdilution method with   Escherichia coli,   Salmonella sp.
7: and   Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
8: In a chromatographic analysis, the major constituents found in the essential oil of   A.   suaveolens were (E) --farnesene (37.615%), Linalool (33.375%), -Santalene (3.255%) and linalyl acetate (3.222%).
9: The results showed that the   Escherichia coli and   Salmonella sp.
10: bacteria were more susceptible to MIC 50 mg.mL  -1 when compared with the   Staphylococcus aureus bacterium MIC 100 mg.mL  -1.
11: With respect to MBC concentration of 100 mg.mL  -1 it was sufficient to inhibit the growth of   E.   coli.
12: The essential oil did not show antioxidant activity, however, has a high cytotoxic activity against the   A.   salina, LC  50 8.90 g.mL  -1.

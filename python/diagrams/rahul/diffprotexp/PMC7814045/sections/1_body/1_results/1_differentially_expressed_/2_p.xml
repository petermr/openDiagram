 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> we reported all the enriched GOs related to ribosome organization per time point. The figure shows enrichment by upregulated genes exclusively at 45 min. This occurs for GOs related to rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). GOs related to cytosolic ribosome and translation are enriched by downregulated genes since 120 min (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). They are accompanied by GO terms related to ribosome biogenesis, rRNA processing, and translation at 200 min (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

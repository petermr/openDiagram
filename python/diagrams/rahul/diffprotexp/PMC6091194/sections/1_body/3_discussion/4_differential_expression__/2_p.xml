<p id="Par62">We also identified plasmalemma proteins, such as carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) and solute carrier family 2 facilitated glucose transporter member 1 (Slc2a1). These proteins are exclusively expressed on P30 and contribute to auditory function. Carbonic anhydrases are thought to regulate potassium homeostasis and the endocochlear potential in the mammalian cochlea. Previous evidence, using in situ hybridization, showed that CA2 expression within mature mouse inner ear overlapped with Na-K-ATPase in type II and IV otic fibrocytes, suggesting functional relationships [

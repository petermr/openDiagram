<p>The antifungal activity of MPE was estimated using cell viability assay with fluconazole as the standards. The MIC and MFC values of MPE are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. MPE at a concentration of 500 µg/mL inhibited mycelial growth; whereas at 1000 µg/mL (MFC), it induced fungicidal activity.

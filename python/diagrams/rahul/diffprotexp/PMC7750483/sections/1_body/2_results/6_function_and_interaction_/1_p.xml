<p>We analyzed the 54 differential proteins (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) that were enriched in the ErbB and PI3K–Akt signaling pathways by GO terms biological process enriched 
 <italic>via</italic> DAVID. The result demonstrated that these proteins were mainly involved in the regulation of protein binding, cytosol, and signal transduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). To further understand the interaction between these differential proteins and m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators, we mapped protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. The results showed that 
 <italic>ALYREF</italic> and 
 <italic>RPS6</italic> were important connections between differential proteins and m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators (

<p id="Par4">In the direction towards the contemplation of molecular dynamics inclusive of molecular interaction at the molecular level, the molecular modeling emerged as a potential means. The algorithmic methodology provides better and broader molecular perception, making molecule designing effective and simpler. The hyperbranched dendritic polymer encompassing repetitious structure can be competently taken advantage of in designing novel porters for both therapeutic and diagnostic agents. The studies discussing the optimization of its properties in various solvents, interaction with drugs, nucleic acids, proteins and lipid membranes have been studied. The pondered researches have brought characteristic features such as dendrimer size and surface to light, that can be altered to augment the performance of anti-TB

<p>For this study, we explored the success of enrichment for a group of captive aardvarks using a hypothetical and goal-driven framework. We argue that enrichment should be developed with the aim of promoting specific goal behaviors appropriate to the species and individual in question, and that evaluating whether these goals are achieved is the only way to determine if an event is genuinely enriching an individual’s life. Difficulties can arise when a species’ active period does not coincide with the workday of animal care staff; however, an animal’s welfare state fluctuates over time, so it is essential to assess events that could impact their welfare across the 24 h in a day, 7 days a week [

The data collected outside of the normal workday can cultivate an understanding of how to provide better welfare in a captive environment and may be particularly critical for nocturnal species. This study is a first step in collecting more information on an understudied nocturnal mammal and the enrichment that can impact their night-to-night welfare.

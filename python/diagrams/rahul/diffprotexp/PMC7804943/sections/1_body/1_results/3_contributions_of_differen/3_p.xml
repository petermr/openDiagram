<p id="Par13">In the AS (exonic sequence events) layer, we identified genes encoding exons with differential splicing between CA1 and CA3, as measured by the change in Percent Spliced In (∆PSI) values. As validation, the loadings assigned to the AS events were consistent with detected ∆PSI differences between CA1 and CA3 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c, d</xref>). The genes representing the top loaded events are enriched in GO terms associated with synaptic vesicles, plasma membranes, and the cell surface (Fig.

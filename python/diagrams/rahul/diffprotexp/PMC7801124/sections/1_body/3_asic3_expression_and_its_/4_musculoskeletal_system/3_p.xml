<p>Unlike RA, OA is not an autoimmune condition, but rather involves biomechanical changes in the joint and low-grade inflammation with pain being a key symptom [

In rats, using the mono-iodoacetate induced OA model, outside the site of injection there was an increase of both ASIC3 expression in knee joint afferents and weight-bearing pain, effects that plateaued after 3Â days, and upon co-administration with the ASIC3-specific blocker APETx2 both changes were diminished [

<p>At the proteomic level, many photosynthesis-related proteins are differentially expressed in response to both osmotic stress and cold (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-14-04912">Table 1</xref>). All of them show a significant decreased amount, among them, PS I and PS II subunit proteins and ferredoxin reductases. Moreover, the decrease in abundance of PSII oxygen-evolving complex was identified in Désirée, and the decrease in abundance of the Oxygen-evolving enhancer protein in

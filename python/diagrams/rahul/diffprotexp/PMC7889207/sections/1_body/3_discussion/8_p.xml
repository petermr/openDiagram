<p>In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that CD exposure led to dynamic changes in DNA methylation and expression of the fatty acid transporter, 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic>, in VAT. We propose that increased expression of 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> by CD in VAT reflects a greater capacity to flux fatty acids across the plasma membrane, leading to adipocyte hypertrophy and insulin resistance (

The identification of depot-specific molecular signatures relating to fatty acid uptake may aid in unravelling the putatively adverse metabolic profiles of VAT that contribute to obesity-induced metabolic imbalance and may aid in identifying potential therapies for metabolic diseases.

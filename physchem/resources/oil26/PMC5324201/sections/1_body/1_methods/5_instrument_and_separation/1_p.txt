0: Fatty acid methyl esters were analysed and identified by using Shimadzu 2025 Gas Chromatograph with a Flame Ionization Detector and GC Work Station Software.
1: A fused capillary column ATTM-1 (30 m  0.25 mm I.d.
2: and 0.1 m film thickness) was used for separation.
3: Helium was used as carrier gas, at a flow rate of 2 mL/min.
4: Injection and detector temperature was 250 C. The oven temperature was programmed at 120 C 270 C by raising the temperature at 7 C/min.
5: Split ratio was 80.
6: The fatty acid compounds were identified by comparison of relative retention times and peak positions of the standard fatty acid chromatogram.
7: Atherogenic Index (AI) and Thrombogenic Index (TI) were calculated according to Ulbricht and Southgate [ 15] which AI is C 12:0 + (4  C 14:0) + C 16:0/PUFA + MUFA and TI is C 14:0 + C 16:0 + C 18:0/0.5  MUFA + 0.5  PUFA.

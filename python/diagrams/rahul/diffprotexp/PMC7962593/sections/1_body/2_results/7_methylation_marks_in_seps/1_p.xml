<p>To identify the sepsis key genes whose methylation may be modified in the disease, we first analyzed differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between sepsis samples and controls in GSE138074 (adult) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8A</xref>). DMPs with delta beta values in the opposite direction to the expression value of common DEGs were filtered and identified as methylation marks. A total of 1313 methylation marks were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8B</xref>). These included MAPK14, FGR, and CD247. The methylation levels of MAPK14 (cg18213931) and FGR (cg16922167) were lower in sepsis than control, and that of CD247 (cg21161394) was higher in sepsis (

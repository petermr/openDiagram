<p>MS and MS/MS data searches were performed using the Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (PD; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) based upon the workflow with a spectrum selector and reporterion quantifier. The proteins were identified and quantified using the Mascot search engine (version 2.3.0; Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA, USA). To minimize false positive results, a strict cutoff for protein identification was applied with an Unused Prot Score â‰¥1.3, which corresponds to a confidence limit of 95%, and two peptides with 95% confidence were considered for protein quantification.</p>

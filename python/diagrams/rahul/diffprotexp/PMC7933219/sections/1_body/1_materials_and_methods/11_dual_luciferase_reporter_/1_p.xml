<p>For the luciferase assays, the wild-type and mutant PRKAA2 3’UTR and the miR-124-3p were amplified by PCR. Luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3-PRKAA2-3’UTR-WT, pGL3-PRKAA2-3’UTR-MUT, and pcDNA3.1(-)-miR124-3p were prepared. The primer sequences for the amplification of PRKAA2 3’UTR were as follows: PRKAA2 3’UTR forward: GATCGCCGTGTAATTCTAGAGTGTTGTAAACTC TGAATGTG, PRKAA2 3’UTR reverse: CCGGCCGC CCCGACTCTAGATTAGAGTTCACAGTTCTACAACAAC; The 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After 24 h culture, the plasmids were transfected into 293T cells with the indicated pGL3 firefly luciferase vector and pGL3 Renilla luciferase vector. After 48 h, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, United States) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Data were normalized to the Renilla luminescence and presented relative to miRNA-124-3p-NC transfected group.

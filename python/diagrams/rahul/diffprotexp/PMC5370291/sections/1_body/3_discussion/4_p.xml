<p>α-actinins are ubiquitously expressed cytoskeleton proteins that interact with various adaptor proteins such as vinculin 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and integrins 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, and then link actin filaments to focal adhesions 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Among four α-actinins in mammalian cells, α-actinin-4 is primarily involved in cell motility and cancer invasion 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Comparing to α-actinin-4, α-actinin-1 shows some different biological functions contributing to tumor development and progression 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Our analysis revealed that TNFα treatment significantly increased α-actinin-1 and other cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin, actin and actin-related protein 3, indicating that TNFα altered cytoskeletal protein network which may contribute to promoted cell survival.

 <caption> Optical images of air-cut/air-healed and air cut/water-healed p(MMA/nBA) copolymers as a function of time and the corresponding tensile analysis. Self-healing of 50/50 p(MMA/nBA) copolymers damaged in air and healed in ambient (A1–D1) and aqueous (A2–D2) environments. Tensile analysis of undamaged/damaged cycle (A3) and air/water-healed copolymer films at 30 (B3), 90 (C3), and 150 (D3) min. </caption>

<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative damage especially in a fast growing organism which demand high oxygen levels 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Corona2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Peroxiredoxin 2540 and thioredoxin peroxidase 1 function as peroxide metabolizers 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Chae1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It has been reported that expression of antioxidant genes generally increases in the younger queens 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Corona3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and high demand for oxygen during embryonic development leads to increased level of ROS and thus increasing oxidative damage

 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Sies1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Also, it has been documented that antioxidants play important defensive roles in the development of the honeybee embryo 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and hypophrigeal gland 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> as well as in facilitating long-term storage of sperm in the spermathecal fluid 
 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Baer1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The over-expression of peroxiredoxin 2540 and thioredoxin peroxidase 1 at 72 hours in worker larvae and thioredoxin peroxidase 1 and glutathione S transferase S1 at 120 hours in queen larvae suggest a key role of the antioxidant system in both developing larvae by changing oxidation products into harmless chemicals

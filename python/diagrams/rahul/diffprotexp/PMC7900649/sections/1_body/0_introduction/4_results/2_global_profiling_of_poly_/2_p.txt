0: To study whether the global pattern of alternative polyadenylation is affected during PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, we profiled poly(A) sites in infected and mock-infected cells.
1: A total of 403 million raw reads were generated by Illumina Hiseq 2500 sequencing.
2: After mapping to the porcine genome and conducting internal priming filtering, about 188 million reads were obtained for further poly(A) sites analysis.
3: Among the filtered reads, only 71% of reads were annotated 3 UTR (mapped to 3 UTR and ucsc database), and 7% were located within 1 kb downstream of genes 3 UTR.
4: The remaining reads were located in the coding regions (4%), and intergenic regions (18%) (Fig.
5: 2a).
6: After clustering the filtered reads, only 23% of poly(A) sites were mapped to annotated 3 UTR (Fig.
7: 2b).
8: Based on our dataset, 22% and 6% of poly(A) sites were located in intron and CDS regions, respectively (Fig.
9: 2b).
10: Moreover, 40% and 9% of poly(A) sites were located in intergenic regions and within 1 kb downstream of the beginning of annotated 3 UTR (Fig.
11: 2b).

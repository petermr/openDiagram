<p>A total of 10 perfusates were collected, from 5 model rats and 5 normal control rats (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). The perfusate proteins were extracted via acetone precipitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The protein extracts were then subjected to quantitation by the Bradford method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Equal amounts of protein derived from five individual rats in the same group (model or control) were mixed together, resulting in two pooled perfusate samples: A model perfusate mixture and a control perfusate mixture.

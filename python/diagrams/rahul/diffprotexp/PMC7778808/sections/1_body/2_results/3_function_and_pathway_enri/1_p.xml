<p id="Par31">The R language was used to perform functional enrichment analysis on 88 DEGs, and the results were shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a. DEGs are mainly involved in the composition of ribosomes and respiratory chains in the cytoplasm. The biological process involves nuclear transcription mRNA metabolism, translation initiation, and endoplasmic reticulum protein localization. The molecular function mainly focus on ribosome composition, cytochrome C oxidase activity, and oxidoreductase activity. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs are mainly involved ribosomes, oxidative phosphorylation, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, myocardial contraction and other processes (Fig.

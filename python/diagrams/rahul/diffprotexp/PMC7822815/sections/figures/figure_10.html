 <caption> RUNX1/RUNX1T1 controls alternative splicing of PTK2B transcripts in t(8;21)-positive leukemia cells. a Splicing graphs, representative Cufflinks assembled transcripts and in silico translated proteins of PTK2B gene. This panel is based on Kasumi-1 total RNA-Seq data. Exons and exon-exon junctions are designated by the letters E and J, respectively, and numbered. Differentially used junction J26 is highlighted in purple. For each transcript, Cuffdiff based log 2 fold changes in expression and respective q-values are indicated in parentheses. a denotes amino acids. b Strip charts demonstrating normalized expression of exon-exon junctions J24 to J27 in Kasumi-1 cells. Genomic location of junctions is shown in a. Horizontal lines are arithmetic means. P-value was calculated with two-sided Student’s t test. c and d qPCR-based validation of the differential splicing of PTK2B transcripts under two siRNA treatment conditions. Binding positions of primers and structure of the expected amplicons are shown in c. Bars in d represent mean of two independent qPCR experiments. e Pearson correlation heatmap demonstrating relationship between expression of the SRSF7, RBFOX2, or PTK2 genes and splicing events in the PTK2B gene. This map is based on TCGA-LAML dataset ( n = 173). f RBFOX2 and SRSF7 proteins bind PTK2B gene. This genome browser snapshot is based on ENCODE eCLIP data. g Effect of the siRNA-mediated knockdown of RBFOX2 and SRSF7 expression on splicing of the PTK2B gene in Kasumi-1 cells. Bars represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments. </caption>

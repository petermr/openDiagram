<p>In rechargeable metal–air batteries, a perfect air electrode should have several essential features: i) a highly porous structure (material should be mesoporous, pore size varies from 2 to 50 nm) to promote the diffusion of air and electrolyte. But microporous materials with pore sizes up to 2 nm would block the diffusion of molecular oxygen; thus not able to access the catalytically active sites;

Nonetheless, the design and fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalyst constitute a challenging research area.

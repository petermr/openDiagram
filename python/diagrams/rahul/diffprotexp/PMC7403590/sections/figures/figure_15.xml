  <p>Synaptic markers in VD. Pre-synaptic, pos-synaptic and mitochondrial proteins were determined in 
   <italic>post-mortem</italic> human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of VD patients and controls. The levels of synaptophysin, PSD95 and HSP60 were determined in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) SNpc; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Hippocampus and (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Densitometric analysis of the levels of GRP78 and ATF4. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5, *p &lt; 0.05 and **p &lt; 0.01, versus SNpc control subjects; 
   <sup>&amp;</sup>p &lt; 0.05, versus cortex control subjects). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information.

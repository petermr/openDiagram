<p>Beyond simple differential co-expression, some data integration methods have been proposed to determine altered regulatory mechanisms explaining the differential interactions. Among these, miRNA-based modulation of co-expression has been the most extensively studied, with very little effort devoted to DNA sequence variations, methylome or phosphoproteome. Given the strong impact on molecular mechanismsâ€™ identification and interpretation that transcriptome-based modulator inference has allowed, efforts in this direction would be beneficial.</p>

<p>Thus, association of proteins with the NE seems to be complex to predict merely by bioinformatic tools, as their localization is influenced not only by structure but also by interacting partners and differential expression in different cell types (see below) and the orthologs of mammalian NEA proteins detected here will require experimental validation of NE association in other organisms.</p>

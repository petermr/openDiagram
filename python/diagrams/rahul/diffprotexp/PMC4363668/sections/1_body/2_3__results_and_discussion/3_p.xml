<p>Heat shock proteins are the products of several distinct gene families that are required for cell survival during stress and are named according to the approximate relative molecular mass of their encoded proteins such as HSP27; heat shock proteins belong to molecular chaperones and which are reported to be crucial for virus propagation. HSP27 (spots 2) were observed to be downregulated at 1 hpi and 16 hpi, but upregulated at 24 hpi in the host cells infected with EV71. In order to correlate the protein expression level, we examine HSP27 protein by western blot analysis (

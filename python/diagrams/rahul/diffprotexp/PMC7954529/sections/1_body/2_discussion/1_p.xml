<p>Comparative primate functional genomic studies have contributed to our understanding of the gene regulatory processes that underlie genotype-phenotype relationships. A common goal of these studies is to understand the general properties and level of conservation of specific regulatory phenotypes, such as gene expression or DNA methylation levels. Multiple data types collected from the same cell lines or tissues can then be analyzed together to generate hypotheses about how gene regulatory processes contribute to inter-species differences in morphology, physiology, cognitive phenotypes, disease susceptibility, and other traits (

Moreover, unlike functional genomic studies within humans, comparative studies require only modest sample sizes to identify regulatory effects. This is because genetic variation between species is greater than genetic variation within species. Thus, regulatory differences that distinguish humans from other primates tend to have larger effect sizes than regulatory differences that distinguish between individual humans (

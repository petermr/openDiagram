<p>As illustrated above, BLF was shown to block viral attachment to the host cells and this inhibitory effect was neutralized by pre-mixing with heparin, therefore, it is expected that the cellular antiviral activity of BLF will decrease in the presence of heparin. To this end, the antiviral potency of BLF against HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were determined in the absence or presence of different concentrations of heparin (

 <sub>50</sub> values of a few hundred micromoles against all three HCoVs tested (

To avoid the interference of antiviral activity from heparin, four concentrations of heparin (1, 3, 10 and 30 µg/ml), which are far below its minimum inhibitory concentration, were chosen to determine the effect of heparin on the antiviral potency of BLF in the CPE assay. Heparin decreased the antiviral activity of BLF against all three HCoVs tested in a dose-dependent manner (

 <sub>50</sub> values of BLF increased from 2 to &gt;100-folds in the presence of heparin (

<p id="Par6">Although the two subpopulations have been reported to differ in their morphological features, mitotic activity and steroidogenesis, the molecular mechanism behind these differences remain unclear. In the present study, Gp cells and Gd cells proximal and distal to the GD were isolated from chicken F5 and F1 preovulatory follicles and subjected to transcriptome analyses. Results from our study, for the first time, provided global gene expression profiles of the two sub-populations of GC. This study will not only help to address their morphological and functional differences, but also provide valuable clues on how oocytes (or the GD) and pituitary hormones coordinate the morphological and functional diversity observed in GC, a phenomenon which has also been observed in mammalian preovulatory follicles.</p>

<p>The analysis of the role of 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations in silent corticotroph tumors has not been reported previously. The mutations are less frequent in this group of patients than in the case of Cushingâ€™s disease. We identified the mutations in 20% of patients, while the mutation rate was 10% in the other study by Castellnoum, which included 20 SCAs [
 <xref rid="B9-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. No SCA with mutation was found in a study that included 11 such patients [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Because only four mutated SCAs were included in the analysis, the results may only be treated as preliminary. The only clinical parameter that we found significantly different in SCA patients with and without mutation was 24 h UFC, which was significantly higher in 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut patients; however, it was still within the reference range.

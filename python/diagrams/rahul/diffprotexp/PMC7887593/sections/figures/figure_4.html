 <caption> Presence of low‐level serum inflammation and antigluten immunity at baseline in "responder" patients. A) Comparison of clinical biochemistry and cytokines measured at baseline before challenge for “responders” and “non‐responders” (Mann‐Whitney U test). B) Frequency of gluten specific CD4+ T‐cells per million CD4+ T‐cells from gut biopsies collected at baseline (left, P2, P5, P7, P11, P12, P13, and P14) [ 3 ] and gluten‐specific gut homing effector memory T‐cells per million CD4+ T‐cells in blood at baseline. [ 6 ] (Mann‐Whitney U test). C) Duration of gluten‐free diet before gluten challenge. D) Correlation between mature enterocyte protein expression (from total tissue data) (top row) or Vh:Cd ratio (bottom row) with gluten‐specific CD4+ T‐cell frequencies at baseline in gut (left) and blood (middle) for patients P2, P5, P7, P11, P12, P13, and P14, and blood (right) for all patients (Pearson correlation). </caption>

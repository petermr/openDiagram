0: Frozen brain samples obtained from the frontal cortex (FCx) and hippocampus (hip) of three non-pathology (age: 80.33  3.78 years; Braak: 2.66  1.15; PMI: 37.33  22.50 h) and six AD patients (age: 79.57  6.70 years; Braak: 6; PMI: 26.57  13.40 h) were lysed with RIPA buffer and sonicated at 100% during 10 s before use for the western blotting analyses.
1: The controls for BIN1 isoforms 1 (Iso1) and 9 (Iso9) were obtained using HEK cells transiently transfected with 1 g/ml DNA solution containing plasmids encoding for BIN1 isoforms mixed with the transfection reagent FuGENE HD (Promega) at the ratio 1:3.
2: Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer 48 h after transfection and frozen for further analyses.

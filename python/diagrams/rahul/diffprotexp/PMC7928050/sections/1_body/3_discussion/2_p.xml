<p>As changes in the gene expression are the first detectable changes when answering external demands, we decided to compare gene expression in non-transplanted subcutaneous tissue to gene expression profiles 7 and 15Â days after transplantation using microarray analysis. So far, no study has examined the effect of transplantation on the genetic expression profile of the transplanted adipose tissue. Lindegren et al. analysed changes of gene expression of irradiated breast tissue after lipofilling treatment[

 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, Zuk and co-workers highlighted the multicellular composition of the adipose tissue [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, in our opinion, it is most interesting to analyse the effect of transplantation on the complete grafted tissue as a whole. Moreover, analysing the complete fat tissue avoids a collagenase isolation procedure which has been shown to provoke itself marked alterations in gene expression[

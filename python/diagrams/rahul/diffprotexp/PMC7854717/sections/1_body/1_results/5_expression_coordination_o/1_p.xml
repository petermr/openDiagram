 </sup>. Pearson correlation coefficients between the expression levels of 
 <italic>Ank2</italic> and those of its potential binding partners were computed for each chamber. The analysis aimed to validate the partners whose transcripts abundances oscillate in phase with that of 
 <italic>Ank2</italic> among biological replicas.

<p>Tylosin is a frequently used drug for the treatment of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> infection. Upon treatment with this antimicrobial agent, 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> is inevitably exposed to a sub-inhibitory level of the agent. Therefore, we studied its effect in sub-inhibitory concentrations on 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm formation. Tylosin can inhibit 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm formation at sub-inhibitory concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the inhibition of biofilm formation varied among the antimicrobial agents. Numerous reports have showed biofilm formation in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents (Dunne, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Carsenti-Etesse et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Rupp and Hamer, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Rachid et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Our results are in agreement with these previous findings. Our results showed a better activity of tylosin against 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm formation. However, further studies should be conducted to confirm and clarify the relationship between the relative adherence-inhibiting properties of tylosin and their mechanisms. These results may provide information regarding the clinical use of antimicrobial agents against biofilm-forming bacteria.

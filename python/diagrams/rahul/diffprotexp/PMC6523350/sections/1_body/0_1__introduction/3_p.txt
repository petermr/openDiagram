0: In this experiment, an iTRAQ proteomic approach was used to investigate the differential proteinic expression in natural Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice at the proteome and metabolome levels.
1: The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways were used to analyze the differential protein profiles and signalling pathways related to rice biology.
2: The functional annotation and characterization of these proteins will provide the basic information and be helpful to scrutinize Se responsive mechanisms.
3: The signal pathways identified by the bioinformatic analysis and their verification will provide a basis for further research on the anti-oxidation and anti-ageing mechanisms of Se-enriched rice.

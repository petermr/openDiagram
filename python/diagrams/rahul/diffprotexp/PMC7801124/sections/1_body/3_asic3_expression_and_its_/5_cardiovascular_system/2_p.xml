<p>At the heart of the cardiovascular system is the requirement of sensing PO
 <sub>2</sub> and PCO
 <sub>2</sub> in order to regulate breathing and heart rate and a key part of this system are the carotid bodies. ASIC3 is the highest expressed ASIC isoform in carotid body glomus cells, and is considered to be a key mediator of the carotid body response to extracellular acidosis [

 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence that ASIC3 is also involved in control of blood pressure, as well as regulating breathing rate. For example, ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice have a lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, coupled with a slightly, but not statistically significant, higher heart rate, as a potential compensatory role, compared to WT mice [

The link between ASIC3 and blood pressure regulation is further supported by the human genetic polymorphism rs2288646-A found in Taiwanese individuals, which is associated with a higher frequency of higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, allele frequency being 9.7% amongst those with hypertension [

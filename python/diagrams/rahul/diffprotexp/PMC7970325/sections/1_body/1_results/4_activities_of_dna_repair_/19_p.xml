<p id="p0150">In some cases, the transcriptional activity of genes can be unrelated to the corresponding protein levels due to specific translation regulation mechanisms. To investigate whether transcriptional changes reflect DNA repair effector protein concentrations in cancer tissues we used published datasets to assess correlation of expression at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels for four DNA repair effector genes: 
 <italic>ATM, BRCA1, H2AFX</italic>, and 
 <italic>TP53</italic> in different cancers. We found that transcription and protein concentration were statistically significantly positively correlated in most of the cases, which can support adequacy of the transcriptome-based approach to DNA repair pathway analyzes (

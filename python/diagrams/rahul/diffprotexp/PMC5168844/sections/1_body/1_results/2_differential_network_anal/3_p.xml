<p>A graphical representation of the network structure of the proteins in PI3K signaling pathway for the two groups of patients in LUAD is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. From the figure, it can be seen that the protein MET has interesting connections with the proteins CASP9, FOXO3, YWHAE and MAPK1 in the “progression” group whereas no such interesting connections can be found in the “complete remission” group. Also, PRKCA is connected with FRAP1, MAPK1, BCL2L11 and NFKB1 in the “progression” group but no such connectivity can be seen in the “complete remission” group. The protein MAPK1 seems to be connected with MET, YWHAE, PRKCA, FRAP1 and TSC2 in the “progression” group whereas it is only connected with TSC2 in the “complete remission” group. Here, MET, PRKCA and MAPK1 show significant differences in the two networks. PRKCA is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers [

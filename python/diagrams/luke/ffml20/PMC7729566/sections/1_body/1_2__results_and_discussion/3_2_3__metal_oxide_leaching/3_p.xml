The UV-vis spectrum of Ni(II) in the mixture are inconsistent with that of Ni(II) in concentrated chloride solutions in which a systematic red-shift of the bands is observed as chloride progressively replaces H

ILs incorporating carboxylic acid moieties as well as mixtures containing carboxylic acids, such as ethylene glycol + maleic acid, were shown to efficiently solubilize rare earth oxides despite the latter’s stability (∆

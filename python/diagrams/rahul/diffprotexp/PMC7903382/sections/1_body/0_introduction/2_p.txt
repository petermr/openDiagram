0: Previous studies have reported that the spinal cord is closely associated with the occurrence and development of MIRI ( 9-11).
1: Following cardiac ischemia and reperfusion, chemical mediators such as dynorphin and suppresses substance P within the myocardium activate cardiac afferent fibres projecting from the dorsal root ganglion to the upper thoracic dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
2: This results in the release of inflammatory factors and neuropeptides within the spinal cord ( 12-15), which triggers abnormal changes in gene transcription and translation within the spinal cord ( 16-18).
3: Despite these recognized spinal responses, the genomic mechanisms that enable differences during these spinal processes of MIRI remain largely elusive.

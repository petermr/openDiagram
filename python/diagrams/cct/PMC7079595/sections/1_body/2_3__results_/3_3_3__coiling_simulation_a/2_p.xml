 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f006">Figure 6</xref> presents the dilatometric and microstructural results of the thermal simulations at 700 and 650 °C. During the isothermal step (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f006">Figure 6</xref>a), a very small increase in the relative change in length is observed. The increase was 0.014% and 0.008% at 700 and 650 °C, respectively. Such a small increase does not indicate that ferrite transformation occurred. This is support by the fact that, for both conditions, martensitic transformation detected on cooling to room temperature (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f006">Figure 6</xref>b) is identical and close to that in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, at ~325 °C. Consistently, the revealed microstructures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d), are martensitic and similar to those also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Note that no ferrite was identified in the obtained microstructures, meaning that the selected cooling rate from 1100 down to 700 °C and then to 650 °C sufficed to avoid such transformation.

 <caption> Effect of exogenous ETHE1 protein on the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell apoptosis after DU exposure. HEK293 cells were pretreated with or without ETHE1 (100 ng/ml) for 0.5 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of DU (500 μM) for 24 h. ( a) The cells were stained with JC-1 probe and visualized by confocal microscope. ( b) Mitochondrial depolarization was expressed as the ratio of green to red fluorescence. ( c) The ultrastructures were observed by transmission electron microscopy. (↑) swollen mitochondria; (→) nuclear chromatin concentration and edge accumulation. ( d) Apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry, followed by Annexin V-FITC (FL 1 channels) and PI (FL 2 channels) double staining. Results represent means ± SD of five separate experiments. * p &lt; 0.05, compared with DU-treated cells. </caption>

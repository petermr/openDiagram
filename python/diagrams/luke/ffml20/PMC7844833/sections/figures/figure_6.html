 <caption> (a) Quantification of the shift between the absorption edge for metallic Co and Co 3O 4 following the procedure described by Capehart et al. 135 The areas of the shaded regions are equal and correspond to 80% of the total area under the pre- and near-edge part of the metallic Co XANES spectrum, integrated until E = E z. The end of the near-edge region E z here is defined as a point where the Co foil spectrum crosses the spectrum of Co 3O 4. The difference between the energy values corresponding to the boundaries of the shaded regions ( E s for Co 3O 4 and E r for the Co foil) is used to characterize the absorption edge shift. The inset shows a nearly linear dependency of E sâ€“ E r on the Co oxidation state. (b) Estimation of the WL intensity at the Ir L 3-edge in IrO 2 following the method reported by Clancy et al. 136 An arctangent function corresponding to the absorption jump (red dashed line) is subtracted, and the remaining area under the white line peak (shaded region) is numerically integrated. Alternatively, the WL is fitted as a combination of an arctangent function and a Lorentizan function (red solid line). The inset compares WLs for IrO 2 and for metallic Ir. </caption>

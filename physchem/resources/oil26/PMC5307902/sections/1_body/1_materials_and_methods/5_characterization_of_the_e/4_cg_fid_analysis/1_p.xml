<p>The quantification studies were performed on a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph (model GC-2010 Plus, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column DB-1 dimethylpolysiloxane (30mx 0.25 mm, 0.25 micron), and a flame ionization detector was used to analyze the samples.[

 <sup>-1</sup> up to 92ºC for 3 minutes, followed by a heating rate of 10°C/min up to 120°C and a rate of 20°C/min up to 280°C. The injection volume was 1.0 μl. The calibration curve from a commercial sample of carvacrol [Sigma-Aldrich, Chicago, IL, USA] was obtained by recording the peak areas against the known injected amount contained in the same injected volume (1 ml). The analysis was performed in triplicate.

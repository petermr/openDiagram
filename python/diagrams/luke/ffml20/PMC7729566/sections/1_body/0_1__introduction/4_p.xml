<p>In this work, the phase diagram of the IL [P
 <sub>444414</sub>]Cl with acetic acid (CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH) is experimentally and computationally characterized and the mixture applied to the integrated leaching and separation of cobalt from other metals present in Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries. Cobalt is a critical metal of high economic importance with demand forecasted to grow due to its inclusion in energy storage technologies, making its recovery from secondary sources increasingly topical [

<p id="p0245">In this study we identified statistically differential features of DNA repair pathway activation between follicular and papillary thyroid cancers. Uncovering these differences may not only contribute to understanding of molecular mechanisms of thyroid tumors but also may help further developing new molecular-based therapeutic approaches for different types and subtypes of TCs. DNA repair has dual significance by simultaneously slowing down tumor evolution but also by protecting tumor cells from the treatment of replication targeting therapeutics. Thus, controlled inhibition of DNA repair activities can be considered personalized therapeutic option [

This may suggest that the molecular differences between thyroid tumor types are more significant than differences between radioiodine resistant and sensitive tumors.

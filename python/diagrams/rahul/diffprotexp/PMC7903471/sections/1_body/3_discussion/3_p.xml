<p>Bioinformatics methods were used to perform cis- and trans-target analyses to identify the target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs, as it is difficult to predict the function of lncRNA based solely on nucleotide sequences (

 <xref rid="b35-etm-0-0-09796" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Then, the target genes were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analyses to explore the regulation of lncRNAs according to target gene function.

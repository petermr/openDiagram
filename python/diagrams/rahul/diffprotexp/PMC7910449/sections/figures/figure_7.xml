  <title>CircRAB11FIP1 directly bound to DSC1 protein.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold> Silver staining of protein gels acquired through circRAB11FIP1 RNA knockdown. 
   <bold>B</bold> RNA knockdown was applied to identify circRAB11FIP1-specific binding protein gels. 
   <bold>C</bold> LV2, LV2-1, or LV2-2 was transfected into SKOV3 and A2780 cells. LV6-NC or LV6 was transfected into SKOV3 and A2780 cells. Later, the DSC1 protein level was detected through western blot analysis. 
   <bold>D</bold> catRAPID was used to predict possible binding sites between circRAB11FIP1 and DSC1 protein. 
   <bold>E</bold> DSC1 DNA fragments were cloned to the PCMV5 plasmid. PCMV5 vector, PCMV5-DSC1, PCMV5-Δ26-77, PCMV5-Δ139-190, or PCMV5-Δ176-227, PCMV5-Δ239-290 was transfected into SKOV3 cells. PCR was conducted to detect circRAB11FIP1 expression after 48 h. 
   <bold>F</bold> Co-IP and western blot assays showing the interaction between DSC1 and ATG101 in SKOV3 and A2780 cells stably transfected with LV6 or LV2-1, respectively. Error bar stands for standard error.

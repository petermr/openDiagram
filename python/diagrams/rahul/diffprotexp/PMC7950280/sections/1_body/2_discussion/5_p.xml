<p>Further scatterplot of the relationship between MM and GS confirmed that DEGs in the blue and turquoise modules were strongly interacting with the BDNF expression. Based on these DEGs, the global regulatory network was constructed to predict the intersection pathways of BDNF, which supported the potential roles of BDNF reduction in HD pathophysiology via MAPK, Ras and cAMP signaling pathways. Owing to the low expression of BDNF, the susceptibility of these presented pathways to defects might be obvious, resulting in the development of HD under a variety of pathogenic mechanisms [

 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The AUC analysis exhibited a good diagnostic performance of low BDNF in differentiation of HD cases from non-dementia controls, implying BDNF to be a potential biomarker of HD. It was consistent with previous animal experiment that low expression of BDNF was found in pre-symptomatic HD, and this pathological decline could be up-regulated through beneficial interventions, such as wheel operation and environmental enrichment [

Moreover, the analyses of Pearson correlation showed significant correlation of BDNF with signature genes, which suggested that alterations in BDNF expression led to changes in signature genes of each intersection pathway, thus providing computational statistical evidence that low BDNF expression related HD pathogenesis was mediated via cAMP, MAPK and Ras signaling pathways.

<p id="p0150">As shown previously in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode exhibits a superior rate toward the deposition of active Mn compound during the entire cycling test. This result indicates the continuous influence of cobalt components on facilitating the recovery of the Mn-based cathode. The authors once considered that the cobalt components could be only confined on the initial δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode. In other words, the newly deposited Mn compound (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B) on the surface might not contain cobalt components. Interestingly, however, after 10 and 100 cycles, identical cobalt signals were still observed both in bulk-sensitive EDX spectra (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15</xref>) and in surface-sensitive Co 2p XPS profiles (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D), although both signals were decreased as expected. This could be attributed to a dynamic movement of cobalt components, similar to the dissolution-deposition process of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode.

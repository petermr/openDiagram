<p>RSV is a non-flavonoid polyphenolic compound produced by plants when treated. It is a bioactive component in wine and grape juice and can be synthesized in grape leaves and grape skins (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Research has shown that RSV has functions in anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and cardiovascular protection (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Moreover, RSV has a significant inhibitory effect on a variety of tumor cells, such as liver cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and leukemia (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For TNBC cells such as MDA-MB-231, RSV can inhibit its metastasis by reversing TGF-β1-induced epithelial matrix transformation (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, due to the complex anti-tumor mechanism of RSV, researchers have yet to reach a consensus on its mechanism of action, hence, the anti-cancer mechanism of RSV on TNBC remains unclear. In addition, the DNA polymerase delta catalytic subunit gene (POLD1) is one of the subunits of polδ in DNA polymerases (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). High expression or point mutations may lead to DNA replication and cell cycle abnormality of common cells, which may then progress to cancer cells. POLD has been confirmed to be regulated by a variety of upstream factors, such as p53 and SIRT1 (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), which are the direct regulatory targets of RSV. However, no studies have discussed the regulation of POLD1 by RSV. Additionally, the role of POLD1 within RSV-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells is also unclear.

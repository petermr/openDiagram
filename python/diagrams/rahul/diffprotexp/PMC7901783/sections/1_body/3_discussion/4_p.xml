<p>In quinoa, expression of TSARL1 gene is correlated with saponin content [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study there was a concomitant decrease in expression of TSARL1 and the systemic spread of CMV in the bitter variety, but not in the two sweet/semi-sweet varieties. This negative correlation between virus spread and relative saponin content of quinoa seed is consistent with a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In that study, tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV)-infected plants had decreased terpenoid expression, and this led to higher fitness of 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, a whitefly vector of TYLCCNV. On the other hand, virus-free plants showed higher expression of terpenoids, which resulted in low level of insect infestation.

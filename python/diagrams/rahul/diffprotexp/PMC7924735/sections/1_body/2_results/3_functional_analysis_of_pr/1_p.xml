<p>To predict the functions of the proteins in cysticercus cultures whose sequence was identified, the annotation tool BlastKOALA, which uses the KEGG database to link biological functions, was used on 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> genome. In total, 39.8% of conserved sequences had some annotation. Fourteen proteins were involved in signal transduction, 14 were involved in cancer development, 14 were involved in transport and catabolism, and 6 were involved in infectious pathologies, linked with some KO pathway. On the other hand, 18 proteins were annotated with enzymatic function and 9 were involved in exosomes when the annotation tool KO Brite was used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009104.g006">Fig 6</xref>). With respect to differential protein spots, 27.4% of sequences were annotated. In total, 32 proteins were involved in infectious pathologies, 24 were involved in signal transduction, 18 were involved in the immune response, 18 were involved in cancer development, 13 were involved in biosynthesis and glycan metabolism, and 13 were involved in transport and catabolism, annotated with KO pathway. The analysis with the tool KO Brite showed 22 proteins involved in enzymatic functions, 8 proteins acting as chaperones and folding catalysts, 6 proteins involved in exosome production, and 7 involved in membrane traffic (

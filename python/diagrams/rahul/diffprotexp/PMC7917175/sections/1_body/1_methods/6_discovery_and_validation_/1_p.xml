<p id="Par40">The 19,972 immune-related genes were clustered on the basis of their expression profiles, and a consistency matrix was constructed to identify corresponding immune subtypes and gene modules. The partition around medoids algorithm using the “1-Pearson correlation” distance metric was applied, and 500 bootstraps were performed each involving 80% patients in the discovery cohort. Cluster sets varied from 2 to 10, and the optimal partition was defined by evaluating the consensus matrix and the consensus cumulative distribution function. The immune subtypes were then validated in an independent TCGA cohort with the same settings. The consistency of immune subtypes between the discovery and validation cohorts were quantified by calculating intra-group proportion and Pearson correlation in the centroids of gene module scores.</p>

<p>In contrast, the following proteins were regulated in a more favorable way during hyperinsulinemia compared to a treatment with metformin: coagulation factor III (F3, tissue factor (TF)), galectin-1 (LGALS1, LEG1), 5â€™-nucleotidase ecto (NT5E, 5NTD), and plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (PLAUR, UPAR). Overexpression of F3, a protein that initiates thrombin formation during hemostasis, effectively enhances angiogenesis as well as coagulation-associated metastasis [

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. NT5E is involved in cellular interaction with ECM proteins such as laminin and fibronectin and NT5E overexpression is known to support tumor proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and immune escape [
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The membrane-bound receptor PLAUR activates a cascade of extracellular proteinases with functions in tissue remodeling upon binding of its ligand, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UPA), and upregulation of PLAUR promotes survival, migration and metastasis of tumor cells

In the present study, the expression of all four discussed proteins was increased after metformin administration and decreased during hyperinsulinemia compared to untreated controls, with significant changes between both treatments. In these cases, metformin treatment is likely to suppress anti-proliferative effects and to favor tumor progression by the regulation of these proteins.

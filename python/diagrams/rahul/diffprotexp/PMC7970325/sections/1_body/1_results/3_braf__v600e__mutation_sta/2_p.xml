<p id="p0060">In PC patients, 
 <italic>BRAF</italic> (V600E) mutation status is an important diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and relapse [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We therefore screened all PC specimens for this mutation and identified 15 mutant and 27 wild-type cases (Supplementary file 1). Notably, neither PCA nor Euclidean distance-based hierarchical clustering identified any specific pattern associated with mutated or wild-type status 
 <italic>BRAF</italic> V600E in the tumor samples (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>). We found no differentially expressed genes with q &lt; 0.1 by Wilcoxon test for the groups of 
 <italic>BRAF</italic> (V600E) mutation positive and negative PCs.

<p>To investigate the effect of RSV infection on mRNA processing, we conducted short-read and SMRT RNA sequencing in a well-characterized model of telomerase-immortalized 
 <italic>Scgb1a1</italic>+ human small-airway epithelial cells (hSAECs). This model was selected because RSV replicates in the small airways in lung infection [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and these cells demonstrate replication-dependent pathogenic mucin- and T helper 2 lymphocyte-activating cytokines that mediate disease [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. hSAECs were infected with sucrose-cushion-purified RSV (Long, MOI = 1) for 0 or 24 h using 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4 independent biological replicates. Short-read sequencing and SMRT RNA sequencing were analyzed according to the data analysis pipeline in

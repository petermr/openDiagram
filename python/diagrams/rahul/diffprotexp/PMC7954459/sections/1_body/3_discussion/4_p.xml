<p>A few conserved master regulators of seed development and seed size/weight, namely 
 <italic>HAIKU1, SHB1, LEC, ABI3</italic> and 
 <italic>ABI5, KLUH/CYP78A5</italic> have been identified in plants, such as Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (Li &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Although several studies identified the roles of these regulators in seed size in plants, knowledge about the miRNA‐mediated regulation of these master regulators has remained elusive. This may be due to the non‐availability of high‐confidence large‐scale miRNA datasets from various stages of seed development in other plants. However, the possibility of the miRNA‐mediated regulation of these set of target genes specifically in chickpea can also not be ruled out. We identified homologs of 
 <italic>HAIKU1</italic> (
 <italic>Ca_11517), SHB1</italic> (
 <italic>Ca_12109</italic>), and 
 <italic>KLUH/CYP78A5 (Ca_18561)</italic> in chickpea, and these genes were found to be targeted by novel miRNAs Car‐novmiR61, Car‐novmiR1, and Car‐novmiR218, respectively. In addition, genes, such as 
 <italic>E2Fa/b</italic>, 
 <italic>GRAS,</italic> and 
 <italic>Kinases</italic> were suggested to be involved in seed size/weight determination in chickpea based on transcriptome analysis (Garg et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We found that these genes were targeted by Car‐miR172b, Car‐miR5770, and Car‐novmiR232, respectively. It would be interesting to study their exact role in the miRNA‐mediated regulation of seed development and/or seed weight/size determination.

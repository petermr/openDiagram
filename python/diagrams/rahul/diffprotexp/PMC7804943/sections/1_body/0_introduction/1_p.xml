These findings and the observation that metazoan species have comparable numbers of protein coding genes highlight the importance of the evolution of gene regulatory complexity as a determinant of neuronal diversity. Neurons are categorized into different subtypes depending on a multitude of related factors, including molecular composition, morphology, location, and physiology

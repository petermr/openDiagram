<p id="Par51">1 mm sized as homogeneous as possible pieces were isolated from the lateral walls of LA, RA, LV and RV, not close to the SA or AV node, or the bundle of His or origin of its branches in the interventricular septum. Total RNA was immediately extracted in separate vials with RNAEasy Minikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), following manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined before and after reverse transcription in the presence of Cy3/Cy5 dUTP with a WU-83060-00 Thermo Scientific NanoDrop ND-1000 and its quality with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, DE). 825 ng of differently (Cy3/Cy5) labeled biological replicas of the same chamber were hybridized 17 h at 65 °C with GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4 × 44 K v2. The chips were washed and scanned with an Agilent G2539A dual laser scanner at 5 μm resolution in 20-bit scan mode and primary analysis performed with (Agilent) Feature Extraction 11.6 software.</p>

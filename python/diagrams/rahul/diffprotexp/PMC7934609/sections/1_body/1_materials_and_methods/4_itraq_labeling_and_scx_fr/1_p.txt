0: Total protein (100 g, determined by Bradford protein assay) was extracted from each sample solution, and the protein then digested with Trypsin Gold (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37 C for 16 h. After trypsin digestion, peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation.
1: Peptides were reconstituted in 0.5M TEAB and processed according to the manufacturers protocol for 8-plex iTRAQ reagent (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification).
2: Briefly, one unit of iTRAQ reagent was thawed and reconstituted in 24 L isopropanol.
3: Samples were labeled with the iTRAQ tags as follow: oncosphere, adult and the protoscolex.
4: The peptides were labeled with the isobaric tags, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The labeled peptide mixtures were then pooled and dried by vacuum centrifugation.
5: SCX chromatography was performed with an LC-20AB HPLC Pump system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), according to the manufacturers instructions.

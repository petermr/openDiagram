<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par29">The local-scale impact of burrowing on species cover and composition may potentially also have impacts on other taxa, including pollinators and herbivores. For example, in the mesic site unpalatable invasive plant species, including <italic>Verbena bonariensis</italic> and <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic>, occurred significantly more frequently at burrow entrances. In addition, <italic>Eragrostis chloromelas</italic>, a climax grass with low palatability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>, occurred less frequently at burrows, while <italic>Pollichia campestris</italic> a pioneer species which is favoured by browsing animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> occurred more frequently at these same microsites in the mesic site. In the semi-arid savannah <italic>Schmidtia pappophoroides</italic> (a highly palatable perennial climax grass species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>) and <italic>Acanthosicyos naudinianus</italic> (an important source of moisture for mammalian herbivores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>) both occurred significantly less frequently in burrowed sites. Therefore, while not explicitly considered in this study, through impacts on vegetation, burrowing may possibly also have knock-on effects on other trophic levels, especially in ecosystems where burrowing animals occur at high densities and/or burrowed microsites differ most in abiotic conditions from unburrowed areas.</p>

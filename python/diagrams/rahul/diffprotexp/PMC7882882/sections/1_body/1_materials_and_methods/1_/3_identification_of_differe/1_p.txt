0: A differential gene expression analysis was performed within 1 year after the initial postoperative NFPA (n=6) and 5 years later (n=6), and a significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) was performed to identify the differentially expressed PCGs and lncRNAs (DEGLs) between the two groups ( 33).
1: The Biobase, multtest and siggenes packages were downloaded from Bioconductor ( http://www.bioconductor.org/).
2: Subsequently, the available data were analyzed using R ( www.r-project.org), and DEGLs with fold-changes of >2 and<-2, and P<0.05, were selected for further research.

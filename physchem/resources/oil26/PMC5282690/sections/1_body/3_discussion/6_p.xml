<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Another pathway of vasorelaxation endothelium-dependent has been studied; it&#8217;s about the COX product: PGI<sub>2</sub> which is recognized for its potential ability to relax vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] via activation of second messenger cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Hence, the possible role of PGI<sub>2</sub> seems to be ruled out, because the pretreatment of aorta with, indomethacin, the COX inhibitor, did not change the vasorelaxant effect induced by AcEO.</p>

<p>Going in line with the idea of a turnover from mature dying adipocytes to preadipocytes within transplanted tissue [
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47–49</xref>], some of the most downregulated genes found in this study such as Adiponectin, FASN, and Mup are genes typically expressed in adipocytes and not in preadipocytes[
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
 <sup>,4</sup> C1qtnf3, instead, which was found to be upregulated when comparing gene expression 7 and 15 days after transplantation, is expressed in 4 days old adipocytes[
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This strengths the theory, that there is a turn-over from dying mature adipocytes in the grafted tissue towards more extracellular matrix components and more preadipocytes[
 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The downregulation of genes involved in metabolism going aside an increase of inflammatory processes may be a hint for the death of the adipocytes. Interestingly gene pathways involved in fat cell differentiation were equally down- and upregulated when comparing gene ontology profile 7 to 15 days after transplantation. Further analysis of downstream pathways of these processes will clarify the fate and the activity of the transplanted adipose tissue.

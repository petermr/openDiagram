<p>Mass spectrometry data were searched for in rice transcriptome databases via Proteinpilot
 <sup>TM</sup> software (V4.5, Boston, MA, USA). A total spectrum of 3235 proteins with above 95% report confidence was identified. Out of these, 3161 proteins were quantified, which were further composed of 401 differential expressed proteins. Contingent significant differentially expressed protein analysis unveils a greater number of down-regulated (208) modified proteins in Se-enriched rice, and up-regulated (193) in non-Se-enriched rice. The molecular mass range of the protein was 8.2 kDa to 611.3 kDa, the isoelectric point range was 3.18 to 12.77, and the hydrophobicity range was âˆ’2.01 to 1.29, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00130-f001">Figure 1</xref>. When the data of hydrophobicity was &gt;0, the larger the value, the stronger the hydrophilicity. In comparison, when the data was &lt;0, it was found that the smaller the value, the stronger was the hydrophobic effect.

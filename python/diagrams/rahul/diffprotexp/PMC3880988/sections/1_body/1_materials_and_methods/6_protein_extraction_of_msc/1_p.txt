0: Alginate constructs were solubilized in 55mM sodium citrate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously  11.
1: The dissolved alginate beads were centrifuged at 300  g for 10 minutes.
2: The MSC and ACs were then lysed in 2-D Protein Extraction Buffer (GE Healthcare, USA) containing urea and NP-40 and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) for 1 hour using shaker at room temperature.
3: Cell lysate was centrifuged at 15000  g for 10 minutes at 4C.
4: Protein concentration was quantified using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockfold, IL USA).

<p id="Par33">Although we have analyzed numerous pathways and coordination of all gene pairs that can be formed, owing to the limited space, this report presents only the pathways and the individual genes and gene pairs considered by many authors among the most important for the heart physiology. However, the publically available expression data (GSE45339, GSE45348) and our “CORRELATION” software

 </sup> allows any interested researcher to determine the inter-correlation of any group of genes. Unfortunately, the huge volume of transcriptomic data and the lack of adequate resources at the time prevented us to validate the genomic results through functional analyses. Nonetheless, as detailed in the cited literature, most of our transcriptomic results are in agreement with functional observations of other authors.

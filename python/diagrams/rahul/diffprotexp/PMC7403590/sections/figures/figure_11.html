 <caption> Microtubule Assembly in VD. Microtubule dynamics markers were determined in post-mortem human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of VD patients and controls. The levels of acetylated α-tubulin, acetylated tau, phosphor-tau and tau were determined in: ( A) SNpc; ( B) Hippocampus and ( C) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. ( D) Densitometric analysis of the levels of acetylated α-tubulin, acetylated tau, phosphor-tau, tau and phosphor-tau/tau. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin ato confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5–6, *p &lt; 0.05, versus SNpc control subjects and ##p &lt; 0.01, versus hippocampus control subjects; &amp;&amp;p &lt; 0.01, versus cortex control subjects). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information. </caption>

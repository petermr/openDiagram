<p>The thermal performances of 2,7-CPI were studied by DMA, TMA, and TGA, which are also compared with those of a typical polyimide (Kapton) and our previous reported structural analogue 2,7-CPPI. The results are listed in 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The 2,7-CPI displayed the highest

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S9</xref>). The tensile strength and modulus of 2,7-CPI were 134 MPa and 5.7 GPa, respectively. The dimensional and thermal stability and mechanical properties of 2,7-CPI were comparable to those of 2,7-CPPI, but better than Kapton. The excellent thermal and mechanical performances of 2,7-CPI and 2,7-CPPI were mainly attributed to the aromatic rigid carbazole moieties in the PI main chains and the strong interchain cohesion. Also, the 2,7-CPI had good flexibility, which was indicated from the rolled film in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-12-02048">Figure S10</xref>. The excellent comprehensive performances of 2,7-CPI and 2,7-CPPI make them promising materials in the micro-electronics packaging industry.

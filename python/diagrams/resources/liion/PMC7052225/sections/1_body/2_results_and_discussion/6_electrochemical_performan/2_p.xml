<p id="Par40">Self-standing PTCDA cathodes with different active mass loadings are prepared according to the method described in Scheme 
 <xref rid="Sch2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. This organic molecule is partially soluble in water; hence, the preparation of cathode is considerably simple, and the PTCDA is securedly contained in the cellulose/VGCF substrate. The cyclic voltammetry and rate capability experiments for the PTCDA electrodes are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>. This organic molecule is known to be a semiconductor
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>, and its rate performance and stability are considerably poor because of its low electrical conductivity and high solubility in an electrolyte. In fact, the increase in the PTCDA mass in the self-standing film has also increased polarization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14a</xref>) although the intensity of the redox peak has slightly increased. This behavior is confirmed by the rate capability experiments shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14b</xref>. During the discharge of PTCDA electrodes, the voltage suddenly drops, as reported by recent articles on organic cathode materials

 </sup>. The initial drop from the OCP to a plateau at approximately 2.4 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> is caused by the transformation from the PTCDA to lithium enolate with the assimilation of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions. The specific capacity obtained, however, is approximately 137 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to only half of the theoretical capacity because only two lithium ions react with ketones

 </sup>. The insertion of the other two Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions occurs in the potential window range of 0.9–1.3 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. An intense discharge process, however, will damage the structure and therefore result in a strong irreversibility

 </sup>. When self-standing PTCDA electrodes are cycled at C rates that exceed 1 C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14b</xref>), the discharge capacities considerably decrease with the increase in active mass loading. The discharge capacities are therefore approximately 110, 60, and only 35 mAh.g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 5 C for PTCDA electrode films composed of 40, 50, and 60 mg of active materials, respectively. These electrochemical performances, however, are better than those generally reported for electrodes spread on aluminum current collectors with inferior active mass loadings

 </sup>. As an example, following the new fabrication method, an approximately 6-mg·cm
 <sup>−2</sup> PTCDA electrode is capable of delivering 120 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 1 C.

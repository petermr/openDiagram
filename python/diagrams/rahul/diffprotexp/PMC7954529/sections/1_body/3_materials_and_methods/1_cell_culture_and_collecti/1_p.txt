0: We grew six human and six chimpanzee Epstein-Barr virus-transformed LCLs in glutamine-depleted RPMI (RPMI 1640 1 from Corning [15040 CM]), completed with 20% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMax (Gibco [35050061]), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin.
1: We cultured all cells at 37C at 5% CO 2.
2: We passaged each cell line a minimum of three times, then maintained cells at 1  10 6 cells/mL in preparation for collection.
3: Cell line numbers and details can be found in  Supplementary file 4.
4: The human lines were derived from Yoruba individuals collected as part of the HapMap project and can be ordered through the Coriell Institute ( International HapMap Consortium, 2005).
5: The sample IDs and Research Resource Identifiers for the human cell lines are the following: NA18498: CVCL_P466, NA18499: CVCL_P457, NA18502: CVCL_P459, NA18504: CVCL_P460, NA18510: CVCL_P461, NA18523: CVCL_P468.
6: Chimpanzee LCLs were originally transformed from individuals from the New Iberia Research Center (University of Louisiana at Lafayette), Coriell IPBR repository and Arizona State University ( Khan et al., 2013).
7: The cell lines have previously been used for similar studies of primate gene regulation ( Cain et al., 2011;  Khan et al., 2013;  Wang et al., 2018b;  Zhou et al., 2014).
8: Cell lines have been authenticated with RNA-seq and have tested negative for mycoplasm.

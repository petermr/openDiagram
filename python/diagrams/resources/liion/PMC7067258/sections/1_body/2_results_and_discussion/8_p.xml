<p>The rate performance of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>, HHTP, and HAT-CN shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref> reveals that the high capacity of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> is retained even under rapid charge and discharge conditions. This result suggests that the intercolumnar channels in 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> enhance the efficient diffusion of lithium ions, thereby improving the rate performance. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was used to evaluate the diffusion rate of lithium ions in 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> (Fig. S19
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). The diffusion coefficient (

 <sup>–1</sup>, which is comparable to those of conventional metal oxides and/or highly porous materials such as exfoliated COFs.

 <sub>Li

 </sub> of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> was therefore attributed to the channels between the columnar structures, which act as diffusion paths for lithium ions. To investigate the CT resistance in the active material, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4f</xref> and S20,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref> the semicircles in the Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit fitting results demonstrate that the CT resistance of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> (96 Ω) is lower than those of HAT-CN (146 Ω) and HHTP (131 Ω), suggesting that the CT resistance was also improved by the formation of columnar structures.

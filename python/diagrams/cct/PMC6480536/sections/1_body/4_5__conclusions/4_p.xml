<p>(3) At a low austenitizing temperature, Mn diffusion is limited and the development of an MDZ around inclusions is not sufficient, which would reduce its nucleating ability. The diffusion capacity of Mn increased significantly with an increase in austenitizing temperature and holding time, which promotes the formation of MDZs to a larger degree and increases AF nucleation ability.</p>

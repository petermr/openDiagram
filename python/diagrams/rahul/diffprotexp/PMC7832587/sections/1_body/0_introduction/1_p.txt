0: Malaria is a global health problem affecting over 200 millions of people worldwide, and responsible in 2018 of nearly 4,05,000 deaths around the globe, mostly children[ 1].
1: Malaria is caused by parasites of the genus  Plasmodium, a pathogen with a complex life-cycle between the transmission vector, the mosquito  Anopheles, and a vertebrate host .
2: Five different  Plasmodium species infect humans,  P. falciparum being the most virulent one, accounting for 90% of the mortality caused by this disease.
3: Over the last 15 years, artemisinin-combined therapies (ACT) have permitted a substantial reduction of the mortality of this disease.
4: However,  P. falciparum strains resistant to current treatments, particularly to artemisinin, have already appeared in different regions of south Asia, representing a serious threat to eradicate malaria as no effective vaccine is yet available [ 2].
5: The fight against malaria thus requires a continuous supply of new drugs to supplement the existing therapeutic arsenal.
6: In fact, the combination of drugs acting on different targets and/or stages is the most efficient strategy to combat malaria as it minimizes the development of new drug-resistance mechanisms [ 3].

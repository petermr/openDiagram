<p>Altogether, these data indicate that type I IFN responses are associated with reduced SLEV replication in the mouse brain. The expression of ISGs in SLEV-infected mouse brains are dependent on type I IFNs responses that are impaired in the ABR-/- mouse. Expression of the ISG RIG-I in vitro led to a reduction in SLEV replication. </p>

<p>The 
 <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> genome contains two 
 <italic>fadAB</italic> operons, consisting of β‐oxidation multifunctional enzyme complexes with 3‐hydroxyacyl‐CoA dehydrogenase and ketoacyl‐CoA thiolase activities that were detected in our data set (Fig. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G and H). They exhibited different expression patterns depending on the substrate utilized (FadAB/ABO_1566/1567 was expressed on the branched pristane, and FadAB2/ABO_1652/1653 was expressed on the linear alkane). It has been widely reported that different FadAB isoforms have different substrate specificities and multiple FadAB operons exist within a microbes genome. For example, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> possess an anaerobic paralog of the canonical FadAB, YfcYX (Campbell 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). There are multiple sets of FadAB complexes described in the model strain 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> KT2440, which accounts for the huge metabolic versatility of this strain (Nelson 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Ouyang 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). More restricted substrate specificity was reported for 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> FadB, which needs the action of a trans‐acting enoyl‐CoA isomerase in order to completely degrade cis‐unsaturated fatty acids (Srivastava 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In the case of 
 <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> FadAB complexes, low efficiency or narrow substrate specificity range of the complexes accounted for lower growth rates exhibited by two of the three complexes during growth on oleic acid as the sole carbon source. (Menendez‐Bravo

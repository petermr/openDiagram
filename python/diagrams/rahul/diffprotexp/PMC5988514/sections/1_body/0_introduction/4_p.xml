<p id="par0030">FV-PTC is hardly characterized and hence diagnosed with FNAB. Thus, sometimes there is a necessity for a second surgical operation to remove the other thyroid lobe when no certain diagnosis is made for FV-PTC cases. Thereafter, the ongoing discussion in FV-PTC among experts resulted in the revision of the nomenclature for noninvasive FV-PTC 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The diagnosis of this type is challenging as it is solely based on the nuclei features due to its non-invasive characteristics 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This could result in subjective and controversial diagnosis in thyroid pathology. Recently, noninvasive FV-PTC is termed as “noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear features” (NIFTP) with very low adverse outcome

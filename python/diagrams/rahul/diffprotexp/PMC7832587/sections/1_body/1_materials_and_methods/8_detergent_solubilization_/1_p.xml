<p>P2 and P3 membrane fractions were solubilized with eleven different detergents at 2 mg/mL of total protein concentration in the membranes, and 10 mg/mL of detergent concentration in solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF and PIC). Solubilization was performed at 4°C or 20°C and at different incubation times. 1 h and 20°C were the conditions that showed the best results. After incubation, samples were ultracentrifugated for 1 h at 125,000 
 <italic>× g</italic> and 4°C, the pellet was resuspended in the same volume as the supernatant, and both, the pellet and the supernatant (detergent-solubilized sample) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot to analyze the solubilization efficiency of each experimental condition. Detergents used in the screen: n-decyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DM), n-undecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (UDM) and octaethylene glycol monododecyl Ether (C12E8) from Calbiochem; n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM), lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG), 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate hydrate (CHAPS), and n-dodecyl phosphocholine 12 (FosC12) from Anatrace; n-Octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (OG), n-Octyl-β-D-thioglucopyranoside (OTG) from Sigma-Aldrich; and Laurydimethylaminoxide (LDAO), and 5-cyclohexyl-1-pentyl-β-D-maltoside (CYMAL-5) from Fluka. Solubilization experiments were also performed in the presence of the cholesterol derivative, cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 5:1 (w/w) detergent to CHS ratio.

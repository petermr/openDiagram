<p>A recent study suggests that 
 <italic>HLA-DPA1</italic> and 
 <italic>-DRB3</italic> are under-expressed in whole blood of sepsis patients caused by 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, which distinguished melioidosis from sepsis caused by other organisms [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, we found 
 <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> was down-regulated in non-survivors in our discovery cohort. Our data also revealed that non-survivors had reduced expression of 
 <italic>HLA-DPB1, HLA-DOA, HLA-DOB</italic>, and 
 <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> representing MHC class II molecules, which are important for antigen presentation. Our results in melioidosis are similar to the results of other studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28â€“30</xref>] suggesting that non-surviving patients with severe sepsis from melioidosis or other infections exhibit decreased MHC class II expression and that can contribute to persistent failure of T cell activation [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We did not observe the changes of these MHC class I at transcriptional levels. However, Dunachie et al. showed the presence of MHC class I genes, 
 <italic>HLA-B46</italic>, and 
 <italic>HLA-C*01</italic> was associated with an increased mortality in an acute melioidosis cohort [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Here, we examine the potential biological rationale behind this recurrent epidemiological observation. By leveraging large-scale genome-wide transcriptional data of normal and malignant tissues from adults and children, we found evidence of increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes in the cancer state, particularly in respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract tissues, with decreased expression in pediatric <italic>vs</italic>. adult samples. Additionally, by interrogating the temporal effects of radiotherapy on human peripheral blood mononuclear and mucosal cells, we observed important treatment-related alterations in host innate immunity, specifically type I interferon responses. Overall, cancers enhance expression of critical viral entry genes, and innate viral defenses can be dysregulated transiently during radiation treatments. These factors may contribute to the observed increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry and severity of COVID-19 in cancer patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#PJT &#x02013; 153289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Fei-Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST107-2320-B-038-034-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Liang-Tzung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009812</institution-id><institution>Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Canada Research Chair in Translational Genomics</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004203</institution-id><institution>Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Peter and Shelagh Godsoe Chair in Radiation Medicine</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Princess Margaret Cancer Centre</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000226</institution-id><institution>Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Currently, cancer patients comprise a greater than expected proportion of all patients who have Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). Initial studies in Wuhan, China reported that approximately 1 in 14 hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A subsequent nationwide analysis in China reported that 18 out of 1,590 COVID-19 cases had a medical history of cancer, with an incidence of 1% compared to 0.29% in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the odds ratio of a cancer patient being infected compared to other members of the community has been reported to be 2.31 (95% CI 1.89&#x02013;3.02)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed the pooled prevalence of cancer was 3.50% (95% CI 1.70&#x02013;5.80) and pooled risk ratio for a cancer patient to develop severe disease to be 1.76 (95% CI 1.39&#x02013;2.23) across 20 studies and 32,404 patients from the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Singapore, Thailand, France, India, South Korea, as well as China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These data are corroborated by our own institutional experience, whereby routine COVID testing for all cancer patients during March to June 2020 showed a positivity rate of 0.83% (29/3,491), on a background of 2,191 active COVID-19 cases in a metropolitan population of 2.9&#x000a0;M in Toronto, Canada (0.08%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Characteristically, coronavirus (CoV) infection begins with viral entry that is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein. This process entails (i) host cell receptor binding by the S1 subunit, and (ii) proteolytic cleavage to yield the activated S2 subunit, which mediates virus-cell fusion and entry at the endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Similar to the closely related SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) type I membrane protein as its primary receptor in cross-species and human-to-human transmission, which occurs primarily via respiratory droplets and contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition to the respiratory tract and lungs, human ACE2 is broadly expressed in many organs including the heart, kidney and intestine. This is consistent with non-respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients such as acute cardiac injury, renal failure, and diarrhea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A risk map based on ACE2 expression has identified the respiratory tract, esophagus, lung, heart, kidney, ileum and bladder as highly vulnerable organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Specifically, there is enriched ACE2 expression in type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells, proximal tubules of the kidney, ileum and esophageal epithelial, and bladder urothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition to ACE2, host cell serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is also important for the S glycoprotein activation for fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Unlike SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction, which can be cleaved by furin, leading to efficient cell-to-cell transmission, possibly increasing COVID-19 disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Other important host cell factors that contribute to SARS-CoV-2 entry include phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve), lysosomal two pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2), and endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Overall, a number of factors facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19; amongst these, ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL have been repeatedly identified as central viral entry factors, as summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Routes of coronavirus entry. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains a transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which is important for (i) host cell receptor binding by the S1 subunit, and (ii) subsequent S2 subunit activation via S protein proteolytic cleavage to mediate virus-cell fusion and entry. There are two major routes of viral activation: <bold>Route A:</bold> When angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are co-expressed on the host cell surface, SARS-CoV-2 will bind to ACE2 and become activated by TMPRSS2 via proteolytic cleavage to mediate viral-cell fusion. <bold>Route B:</bold> If there is no surface expression of a protease, SARS-CoV-2 can undergo endocytosis, endosomal maturation (mediated by two pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve)), followed by cleavage with pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL).

COVID-19 can progress in patients through three stages, beginning with an initial 2- to 14-day incubation period, with or without detectable virus, during which time asymptomatic transmission can occur. The second stage consists of a non-severe symptomatic period with detectable levels of virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Symptoms can be more evident, characterized by fever, fatigue, cough and shortness of breath, with many patients developing lymphopenia and pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Initially, effective restriction of severe disease progression by the host relies primarily on innate immunity and the type I interferon (IFN) response that can be triggered by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Type I IFN robustly activates antiviral defense via over 200 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, MX dynamin like GTPase 1 (MX1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and SAM and HD domain containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase 1 (SAMHD1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which suppress viral replication and/or spread, thereby promoting clearance of infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In contrast, the virus expresses proteins that can delay or inhibit the early type I IFN response. Deregulation of innate immunity can lead to a hyperinflammatory response with over-production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-&#x003b1;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

COVID-19 patients exhibit increased production of neutrophils, increased levels of serum IL-6, C-reactive protein, and decreased numbers of lymphocytes, correlating with more severe disease requiring intensive care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

In this study, radiotherapy appears to be suppressing expression of some type I IFN response genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); type I IFN responses are required initially to limit the viral burden of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Furthermore, leukopenia and lymphopenia, which have been consistently noted in 32% and 82% of SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer patients, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Conversely, chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide) stimulates neutrophil activation and degranulation (Supplementary Fig. 3), which have been noted to occur in the hyperinflammatory response of severe COVID-19 cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These data are consistent with studies that have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer patients have more severe events if they had a recent history of treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Understanding how to modify the timing of radiation and chemotherapy to avoid exacerbating the innate immunity dysregulation observed with COVID-19 may be important to guide clinical management of cancer patients requiring treatment during active infection.</p><p id="Par27">Limitations of this analysis should be noted however, as the variables collected in the radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and COVID-19 datasets are confined to the original study design with missing data on the baseline immune characteristics of the cancer patients in the former studies, and lack of cancer characteristics in the COVID-19 dataset. Ideally, a single prospective dataset of cancer patients with and without COVID-19 with temporal transcriptomic profiles of the patients before, during, and after radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatments would be most useful in the future. Additionally, it is noted that gene-to-protein translation could not be validated for all tissue types, since these studies were limited by the number and types of antibodies used, as well as the number of available patient samples.</p><p id="Par28">In our study, we explored the potential biological rationale behind increased COVID-19 among cancer patients using published literature and an analysis of large-scale genome-wide transcriptional data of normal and malignant tissues from human adults and children. Evidence supports a mechanistic relationship underlying the increased infectivity and severity of COVID-19 in oncology patients based on increased viral entry and reduced host resistance. To mitigate risks, shortening treatment schedules or modifying the sequencing or timing of cancer treatments may be helpful if oncologically safe to do so. Close monitoring of infectious symptoms during treatment may also be warranted. We do note some recent reassuring reports, including one from the UK, that have not observed any immediate deleterious effects of chemotherapy on COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. As the global experience with COVID-19 continues to accumulate, the community will collectively achieve a greater understanding of the interactions between cancer therapy with this novel disease. Continued investigation of the biology of this disease as well as larger, comprehensive epidemiological studies will be important to further elucidate the complex relationship between COVID-19 and patients with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par29">The UCSC XenaTools platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> was used to download gene expression data from TCGA, TARGET and GTEx.

0: cBioPortal [ 42, 43] ( https://www.cbioportal.org/ accessed on 19 December 2020) contains the most well-organized and comprehensive cancer genetic data for different cancer types.
1: The TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) PanCancer PC dataset contains 492 PCs and MSKCC contains 140 PCs with follow-up data, respectively.
2: The data sets were used to analyze the LE multigene panel biomarker values in predicting PC recurrence.
3: The TCGA PanCancer ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) dataset consists of 512 patients with primary ccRCC.
4: Both PC and ccRCC TCGA PanCancer datasets have been well-demonstrated for its suitability in survival (relapse for PC and overall survival for ccRCC) biomarker studies [ 44].

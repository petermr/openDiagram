Whitham and Wielebnowski [<xref rid="B2-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] discuss how affiliative behaviors could be a sign of positive welfare in social species. However, this may also be true in socially housed species that would naturally be solitary. Conversely, eight weeks was a significant amount of time, and changes in social interactions within a group could be related to seasonal behavior or sex hormone changes in those individuals that may not have been identified by our methods, especially as we did not see any significant differences in FGM concentrations. Although more research is needed, if different enrichment goals impact the opportunity for social encounters as suggested by the current study, then the behavioral goal of enrichment given during introductions and other socially sensitive times should be considered carefully.</p>

<p>MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC1000 (Thermo Scientific) as previously described [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Reversed-phase chromatographic separation was performed on a 75 μm id. × 100 mm, C18 HALO column, 2.7 μm bead size, 160 Å pore size. Samples were run on a linear gradient of 1–30% solvent B (99.9% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) over 170 minutes, with the Q Exactive operating in the data-dependent mode to automatically switch between Orbitrap MS and ion trap MS/MS acquisition. Survey full-scan MS spectra (from m/z 350 to 1850) were acquired with a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 400 and an automatic gain control target value of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> ions. The top 10 most abundant ions were selected for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation, with the HCD normalized collision energy set to 35% and fragmentation ions detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70,000. Dynamic exclusion of target ions selected for MS/MS was set to 90 seconds, and the lock mass option was enabled using the polydimethylcyclosiloxane ion (m/z 445.12003) as an internal calibrant.

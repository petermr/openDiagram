<p id="Par29">Once the structures are adequately equilibrated, they are subjected to three axial and three shear deformations along the X, Y, and Z axes. To apply axial tensile load, the C–S–H structures are subjected to uniform tensile strain in the X-direction, and the process is continued for Y and Z-directions. Similarly, to simulate the shear loading in the C–S–H structures, a shear strain is applied along X, Y, and Z-directions, respectively.</p>

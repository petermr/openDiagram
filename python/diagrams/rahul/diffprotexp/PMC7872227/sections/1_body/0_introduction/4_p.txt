0: S.  pasteurii has a specific mechanism of nutrient source utilization.
1: It has been shown that  S.  pasteurii is unable to utilize glucose [ 15], and therefore yeast extracts are commonly used in laboratories as its carbon source.
2: Moreover, the efficient urease activity of  S.  pasteurii may play an important role in the utilization of nitrogen source, and play a crucial role in the mineralization of  S.  pasteurii.
3: Furthermore, it has been reported that the nutritional cost in the culture medium may be as high as 60% of the total operating cost [ 16].
4: A large amount of urea and ammonium salts are used in the culture medium, as not only consume a large amount of agricultural fertilizers, but also tend to pollute the environment.
5: Therefore, the high cost of growth nutrients becomes a major obstacle for the commercialization and large-scale application of microbial induced mineralization technology.
6: Under such backgrounds, researchers have begun to work on the development of nutrient alternatives for  S.  pasteurii.
7: They have successively adopted human urine and pig urine as alternative nitrogen sources [ 11,  17,  18], or used industrial wastewater as carbon sources [ 19,  20], reducing the cost of bacterial mineralization to some degree.
8: However, treatments of raw materials were generally required in those studies, and limited bacterial culture or mineralization are often observed.
9: Therefore, it is both necessary and urgent to investigate the utilization of different nitrogen source of  S.  pasteurii and reveal relevant metabolic mechanisms.

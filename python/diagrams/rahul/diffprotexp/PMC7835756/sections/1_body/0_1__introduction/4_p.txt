0: Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) is an essential compound in stress perception and signaling.
1: It interacts with the Ca 2+/K + channels, phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and Salicylic acid (SA), MAP kinases, miRNAs, and transcription factors that lead to the activation of stress-related genes [ 24, 25, 26].
2: It is considered a modulator of the stress response and immunity pathways in plants since the exogenous application of H 2O 2 can improve the responses to stress [ 27] as shown in several studies with a positive effect on tolerance to saline stress [ 28, 29, 30, 31], drought [ 32, 33], high temperatures [ 34, 35], flooding [ 36], virus infection [ 37, 38] and low lighting conditions [ 39].

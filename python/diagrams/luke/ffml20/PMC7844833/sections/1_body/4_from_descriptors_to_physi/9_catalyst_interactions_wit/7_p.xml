<p>Highly complementary information about the catalyst interaction with its environment can also be extracted from XAS measurements in the soft X-ray range, that is, addressing the problem from the perspective of the low-Z atoms in the support, ligands, or adsorbates. For example, the analysis of O K-edge XAS was used by Strasser et al. to demonstrate the filling of the O 2p/Pt 5d antibonding state, which signifies a weakening of the adsorption of oxygen species upon an increase of the lattice strain in a Ptâ€“Cu catalyst for ORR.

 </sup> Along the same line, Velasco-Velez et al. used the XAS O K-edge to probe the interactions between a gold electrode and water in the electrolyte.

0: In recent years, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses have been widely used in cancer-related research.
1: Among them, transcriptomics includes analysis of all RNA from tissue or cells, revealing the molecular mechanisms of specific biological processes and disease by studying gene transcription and function.
2: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules greater than 200 nucleotides in length that exert their functions through interactions with other components, such as protein, RNA, and DNA ( Guttman and Rinn, 2012).
3: Recent studies showed that lncRNAs play key roles in the initiation and progression of cancer ( Liu et al., 2014;  Chen et al., 2019;  Zhou et al., 2019) via sponging miRNAs as competing endogenous RNA ( Salmena et al., 2011) (ceRNA) and consequently regulating the mRNA expression level.
4: However, the mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles in tumorendothelium interaction are still unknown.
5: In order to identify the aberrantly expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in endothelial cells adhered by prostate tumor cells PC-3M, we screened expression profiles in the tumorendothelium adhesion model with the Human Gene 2.0 ST GeneChip  array.
6: Based on these data, we conducted an integrated bioinformatics analysis to clarify the molecule mechanism during this tumorendothelium interaction.

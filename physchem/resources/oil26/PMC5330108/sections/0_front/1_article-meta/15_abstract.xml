The MPE altered the morphology of <italic>F. sporotrichoides</italic> hyphae with the loss of cytoplasm content and contorted the mycelia. The increasing concentration of MPE showed increase in membrane permeability of <italic>F. sporotrichoides</italic> as evidenced by the release of extracellular constituents and pH with the disruption of cell membrane indicating decrease in lipid content of <italic>F. sporotrichoides</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The observed results showed that MPE exhibited promising new antifungal agent against <italic>Fusarium sporotrichioides</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>SUMMARY</title><p>

<p>In a previous work, our research group determined the 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> secretome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0009104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Protein sequences in the secretome were also known after the genome of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> was published [
 <xref rid="pntd.0009104.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. IP and MW values for 838 proteins were retrieved from this database and used in this work.

0: Human iPSCs (WTC-11, Coriell Institute) were cultured and maintained on vitronectin (ThermoFisher Scientific) treated culture plates in Essential8 medium (ThermoFisher Scientific).
1: Differentiation of iPSCs into MNs was directed as previously described [ 6] with slight modifications that substituted the NSC growth in suspension (D7-D13) with a growth on vitronectin substrate to improve the cell survival rate and to ensure gene expression profile characteristic to motor neuron progenitor cells (MNP).
2: Briefly, iPSCs were cultured in neural media which consisted of 1:1 DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal medium supplemented with N2, B27, 1x Glutamax and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (all from ThermoFisher Scientific), and 0.1 mM ascorbic acid (StemCell Technology).
3: On days 06 3 M CHIR99021 (StemCell Technology), 2 M DMH-1 (Tocris) and 2 M SB431542 (StemCell Technology) were added to the neural medium; days 612 the same media was used with the addition of 0.1 M RA (StemCell Technology) and 0.5 M Pur (Sigma); days 1218 cells were maintained with 0.1 M RA and 0.5 M Pur added to the neural media; finally from day 18 on cells were cultured with 0.5 M RA, 0.1 M Pur and 0.1 M CpdE (StemCell Technology), IGF-1, BDNF, and CNTF (all from R&D Systems, 10 ng/ml each).
4: For optimum neuronal network formation, cells at the MNP differentiation stage (D12) were plated on MEA at 60% area density.

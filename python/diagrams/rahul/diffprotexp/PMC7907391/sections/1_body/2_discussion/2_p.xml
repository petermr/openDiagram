 </sup> within a subset of ACE2-positive cells. This supports the consistent observation that the respiratory tract is a primary site of entry for the SARS-related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Less is known however; regarding their expression in other normal and malignant tissues that may also facilitate viral entry.

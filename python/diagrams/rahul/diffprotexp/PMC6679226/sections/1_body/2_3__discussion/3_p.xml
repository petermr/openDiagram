<p>It is interesting that, although BALF protein concentration was not significantly increased in I.P. LPS treated mice, the BALF protein expression profiles of the I.P. LPS group were significantly different from those of the controls with 38 up-regulated and 85 down-regulated proteins (

Although plasma proteins including serum amyloid proteins and hemoglobin subunit alpha were identified and found to be up-regulated in BALF from I.P. LPS treated mice, the majority of differentially regulated proteins originated from the lung including proteases/anti-proteases, as well as molecules involved in epithelial and macrophage functions. The up-regulation of plasma proteins in BALF by I.P. LPS were likely the combined results of increased vascular permeability due to LPS-induced systemic inflammatory response (including the acute phase response signaling identified by the IPA analysis) and compromised epithelial integrity as shown by down-regulation of Cadm1 and Clic5 (

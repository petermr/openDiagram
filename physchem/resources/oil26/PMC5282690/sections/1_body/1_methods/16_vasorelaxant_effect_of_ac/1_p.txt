0: To confirm the involvement of voltage operated, and /or receptor operated calcium channels, and the enhancement of calcium release form internal stores in the vasodilator effect of AcEO, two sets of experiments were carried out as described by [ 56].
1: First, cumulative doses of the AcEO (0.1100 g/ml) were added to aorta precontracted with both K + (80 mM) and Phen (1 M).
2: In another set of experiments, a comparative profile of the vasorelaxant effect of ACEO cumulative doses (10 410 1 mg/ml) and verapamil (10 8-10 6 M) was challenged on the aorta precontracted by K + (80 mM).

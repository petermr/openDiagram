<p>To investigate possible functions of the lncRNAs, we predicted potential target genes of lncRNAs in cis-regulatory relationships. We searched for protein-coding genes 10-kb upstream and downstream of all the identified lncRNAs and found 1683 lncRNAs that were transcribed close to (&lt;10 kb) 803 protein-coding neighbors. Using GO analysis for the cis lncRNA targets, we found 51 GO terms that were significantly enriched (P &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(b</xref>)). Signaling pathway analysis showed that 801 candidate cis target genes were enriched in 209 KEGG pathways, where the top 20 enriched terms included regulation of autophagy, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, among others (

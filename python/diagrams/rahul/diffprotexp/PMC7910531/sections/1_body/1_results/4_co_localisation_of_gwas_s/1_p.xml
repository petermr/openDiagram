<p id="Par9">Having established these cell- and disease stage-specific maps of molecular QTLs, we used them to identify effector genes driving GWAS signals, the majority of which reside in non-coding sequence. Co-localisation analysis can indicate whether the same variant underpins association with both disease and gene expression levels. We found strong evidence for co-localisation of five osteoarthritis signals with cartilage molQTLs for 
 <italic>ALDH1A2</italic>, 
 <italic>NPC1</italic>, 
 <italic>SMAD3</italic>, 
 <italic>FAM53A</italic> and 
 <italic>SLC44A2</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In all five instances, the GWAS index variant is non-coding. In three cases (
 <italic>ALDH1A2, SMAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>SLC44A2</italic>), the likely effector gene is the one closest to the lead variant. For the 
 <italic>NCP1</italic> and 
 <italic>FAM53A</italic> loci, the lead variants reside in introns of the 
 <italic>TMEM241</italic> and 
 <italic>SLBP</italic> genes, 141 and 18 kb away from the likely effector gene, respectively.

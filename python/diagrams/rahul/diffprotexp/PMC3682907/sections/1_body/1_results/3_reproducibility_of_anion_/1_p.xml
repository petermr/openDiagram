<p>The use of anion exchange beads to fractionate samples prior to SELDI-MS analysis greatly improves the resulting mass spectra, but the procedure must be highly reproducible in order to avoid differences in protein retention on the beads or release from the beads, which would alter protein profiles of the fractions from sample to sample. To this end, buffer concentrations and pH must be carefully monitored and, ideally, anion exchange fractionation performed on all samples on the same day, as was the case with this analysis. Anion exchange of cytosolic fractions with BioSepra Q Ceramic HyperD anion exchange beads yielded six fractions (Q1â€“ Q6). Three trials were performed and three fractions (Q1, Q2, and Q4) from each trial were spotted in triplicate onto NP20 protein chips. Seven peaks with S/N &gt; 5 were found that were common to all SELDI mass spectra of fraction Q1. The overall coefficient of variation for the peak intensities was 16.1%. Analyses of fraction Q2, with 11 peaks common to all spectra, and Q4, with 8 peaks common to all spectra, gave overall coefficients of variation of 18.6% and 17.3% for peak intensity, respectively.</p>

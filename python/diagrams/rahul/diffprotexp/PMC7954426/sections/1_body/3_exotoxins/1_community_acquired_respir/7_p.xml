<p>Although CARDS TX seems to be unique to 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, some homologous genes are present in 
 <italic>M. neurolyicum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. iowae</italic> (NCTC10166_00515 and P271_571, respectively). Comparative genome sequencing revealed that they shared 45.9% and 26.6% homology with CARDS TX, respectively. But their contribution to the virulence of these species remains to be investigated. Likewise, an ADP-ribosyltransferase also exists in 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic> (MYPE9110) [
 <xref rid="cit0225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>], but its function remains unclear. Furthermore, although 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> shares the highest homology with 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, no similar genes have been identified.

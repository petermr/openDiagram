0: The LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4, an NMP solution in polyvinylidene fluoride, and conductive carbon black (super C) were mixed evenly according to a mass ratio of 8:1:1, doctor-bladed on aluminum foil, predried at 60 C, transferred to a vacuum drying oven, and then dried overnight at 120 C. The dry electrode pieces are punched into a circular electrode with a diameter of 12 mm, and the thickness is 15 m. The CR2025 half-cells were fabricated with the LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4 cathode, lithium foil anode, 1 mol L 1 LiPF 6 in 1:1 EC/DEC as the electrolyte, and Celgard 2400 as the separator in an argon-filled glovebox.

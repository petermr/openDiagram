<p id="Par9">The heat-treated part consists of a bearing journal surface surrounded by flanges. The shaft was cut through the bearing's axis and one journal surface was trimmed to fit into the bedding. The sample was ground and polished with a 1 μm diamond suspension as the finishing step, and subsequently etched using a 3% nitric acid solution, with the prepared sample shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> as an overview. This and all following micrographs were taken by using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2m optical light microscope with an AxioCam MRc5 installed. The diameter of the bearing is 50 mm while the hardened zone of the material extends to about 5 mm depth at the journal centreline. The surface is austenitised within 12 s and quenched to room temperature within another 10 s, roughly following the

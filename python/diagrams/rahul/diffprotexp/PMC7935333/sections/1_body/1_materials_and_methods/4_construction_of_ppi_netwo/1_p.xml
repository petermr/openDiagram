<p>To investigate the interactions of proteins encoded by the identified DEGs, we constructed a PPI network by using Cytoscape (version 3.7.1) software, according to the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING; version 11.0, URL:

 </underline>), a plug-in of Cytoscape, was used to screen significant functional modules from the PPI network, and another plug-in cytohubba (version 0.1, URL: apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cytohubba) was used for hub gene identification. In addition, maximal clique centrality (MCC) method was the algorithm for hub genes identification.

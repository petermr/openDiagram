<p>Isoelectric focusing was performed as described elsewhere, with some modifications [
 <xref rid="pntd.0009104.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The sample was desalted in an Illustra NAP 5 column (GE healthcare), and the proteins were then concentrated by freeze-drying (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) and precipitated by adding TCA-DOC-acetone (2% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) to a final 0.02% concentration, 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final 10%, 200 μl of ice-cold acetone). The protein pellet was resuspended, and the final volume was adjusted to 125 μl with rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG buffer pH 4–7, and 20 mM DTT). Then, the sample was applied on Immobiline DryStrip pH 3–10, 7-cm linear-gradient strips (GE healthcare) for 16 h to dehydrate at room temperature, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Focusing was performed in an Ettan IPGphor 3 Isoelectric Focusing System (GE healthcare) starting at 500 V (for 5 h), increasing potential to 4500 V (90 min) and finally to 14,000 V. After focusing, the strips were equilibrated for 20 min in sample buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 0.002% bromophenol blue, and 0.5% DTT). The strips were then transferred onto 4.5–15% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

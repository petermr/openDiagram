 <xref rid="f4-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> is only schematic (
 <xref rid="f4-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>: linear time scale; 
 <xref rid="f4-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>: logarithmic time scale). As a consequence of the transient response of the heat flow, at the moment when the process changes from cooling to soaking, a big heat flow peak artefact results at the beginning of the soaking step: the so-called overshoot peak. This overshoot should not be involved in the evaluation. The critical dead time,

 <sub>dead</sub>, is defined by the time when the scanning rate is stabilized to zero. The exothermic effect following the overshoot-peak is caused by the precipitation reaction under study. To prove this fact, six measurements with the same parameters were performed. At any of these measurements, nearly identical heat flow curves were observed (
 <xref rid="f5-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), showing that the reproducibility of the precipitation reactions in the heat flow curves is appropriate. In some cases, the heat flow drifts for long soaking durations, even though the reaction is expected to be finished. Because of that, these data ranges were excluded too (an example is shown in the right part of the heat flow curve in 
 <xref rid="f4-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

<p id="p0070">Urosepsis mainly results from obstructed uropathy of the upper urinary tract, with ureterolithiasis being the most common cause.

Nine differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF-MS, with six upregulated (SAA1, APOL1, CP, HP, SERPINC1 and F2) and three proteins downregulated (TF, TTR and A2M).

<p>In order to gain deeper insights into the molecular differences between SAT and VAT, we next compared the gene expression profiles of these depots upon exposure to either CD or STD using commercially available PCR arrays. These arrays contain primers to 84 genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, transport and metabolism. The results revealed altered expression of four and ten genes in SAT and VAT, respectively in CD-fed rats compared to STD-fed rats (

 <italic>Slc27a3</italic>), was common between both depots, where it was up-regulated by 9.6-fold in VAT (p = 0.019) and down-regulated by 6.3-fold in SAT (p = 0.048) from CD-fed rats compared to controls. Since Slc27a3 has previously been implicated in fatty acid transport [

 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we speculated that the opposing expression patterns of this fatty acid handling protein in SAT and VAT may account for the differences in adipose tissue expansion properties observed between these depots. We therefore focused subsequent analysis on this gene.

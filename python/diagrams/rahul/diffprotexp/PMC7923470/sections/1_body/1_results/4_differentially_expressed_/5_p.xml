<p id="Par43">Among the highly expressed genes in MT, the second highest expression was noted for a TIFY-5A-like protein (
 <italic>Ma07_g01220</italic>). This gene is known for its role as a repressor of Jasmonate responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Three genes annotated as phospholipase A1-II 5-like showed increased expression in MT (
 <italic>gene-C4D60_Mb07t09300</italic>, 
 <italic>Ma02_g10300</italic>, 
 <italic>and Ma08_g26980</italic>). Phospholipase As are involved in root elongation as well as in auxin signaling [

0: The performance of different methods has been compared in a few studies.
1: In particular, amongst global network approaches, z-score and entropy-based methods have been shown to be the most reliable in reconstructing differences between synthetic networks differing in a regulators expression levels [ 103].
2: Local gene-specific approaches, taking into account only the first neighbours of genes for scoring, have higher performance in detecting disease-related genes when compared with global gene-specific approaches [ 107].
3: Moreover, preserving information about all edges without setting hard thresholds proved to be an advantage [ 108].
4: However, the different evaluation methods used cannot be directly compared, suggesting that further efforts would be needed to reach a consensus about evaluation standards.

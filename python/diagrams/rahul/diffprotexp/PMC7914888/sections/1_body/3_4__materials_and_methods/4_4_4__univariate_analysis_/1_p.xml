<p>For the cell cycle analysis, we followed the previously reported protocol [
 <xref rid="B110-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. In brief, a total of 1.0 * 10
 <sup>6</sup> B16F1 cells exposed or not to L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU were fixed in 75% (

 <sup>−1</sup> of propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 µg/mL of DNase-free RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS, protected from light for 30 min at T ° room. The cells were analyzed at a flow cytometer (BD FACSAria II ™, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The fluorescence was measured at 536 nm and 617 nm for excitation and emission, respectively, a total of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> events in three independent replicates. We estimated the relative number of cells using the FlowJo™ program that assumes Gaussian distributions of the 2N and 4N populations and using a subtractive function to establish the S phase population. Additionally, the cytometer classified the cells according to their size (FSC-A) and its graininess or morphological complexity (SSC-A). Analysis of statistical significance for multiple comparisons without correction, with an alpha = 0.05.

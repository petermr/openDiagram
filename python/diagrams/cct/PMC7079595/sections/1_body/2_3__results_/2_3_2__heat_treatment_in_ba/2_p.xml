<p>According to dilatometric results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) of this heat treatment, the A
 <sub>c1</sub> and A
 <sub>c3</sub> were equal to 680 and 950 °C, respectively. The level of reproducibility shown is excellent as the three shown curves almost overlap. However, during isothermal holding (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f004">Figure 4</xref>b), regardless of the temperature, it is clear that no bainite was formed, as the relative change in length obtained is neglectable, indicative that no transformation took place for the selected isothermal times, even after 3h at 400 °C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f004">Figure 4</xref>c presents the dilatometric curve during cooling from isothermal temperature to room temperature. The increase of relative change in length indicates the formation of fresh martensite upon cooling to room temperature. According to this, the starting temperature of martensite for all curves is 345 °C and the finish temperature is equal to 165 °C. The lack of change in the starting temperature is also a clear indicator that no transformation of austenite took place on the previous step, isothermal holding, and its chemical composition corresponds to that of the bulk for the three tested conditions, i.e., showing the same martensite starting temperature values. In summary, regardless of the chosen isothermal temperature or time, no bainitic transformation was detected during the isothermal step and only martensite forms on cooling to room temperature, as the microstructures in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f005">Figure 5</xref> also show. Thus, for both 400 and 350 °C isothermal holding temperatures, the obtained microstructures are identical. For all the above reasons, it is clear that the applied approach did not give expected results. There was no bainite formation, thus it caused no change in the stability of austenite (no carbon enrichment). Therefore, this structural component was absent in the final microstructure.

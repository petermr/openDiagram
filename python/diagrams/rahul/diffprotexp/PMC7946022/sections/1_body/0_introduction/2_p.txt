0: Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen causing diseases ranging from superficial mucosal to life-threatening systemic infections [ 79].
1: The majority of  C. albicans infections are associated with its ability to form biofilms where adhesion of yeast cells to the substrate is followed by proliferation and formation of hyphae, resulting in a network of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix [ 1013].
2: C. albicans biofilm matrix is complex, with major polysaccharide constituents being -mannan, -1,6-glucan, and -1,3-glucan which has been linked to resistance of biofilm to antifungals [ 1417].
3: However, in various niches in the host,  C. albicans coexists with numerous bacterial species, most notably  Staphylococcus aureus a major human bacterial pathogen that causes a wide variety of diseases [ 1824].
4: S. aureus alone is a poor former of biofilms, however, together with  C. albicans, this species forms a substantial biofilm where the fungus creates a scaffold for the bacteria [ 6, 25].
5: The growing use of implanted medical devices is another reason why the incidence of  Candida and staphylococcal infections has steadily increased, since the majority of these infections are emerging from biofilms formed on medical implants [ 26, 27].

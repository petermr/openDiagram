0: Expression plasmid encoding N-terminally Flag-tagged hFOXO1-3A (#13,508) was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, pCDNA3 backbone).
1: FOXO1-3A has Ala residue substitutions at Thr-24, Ser-256 and Ser-319 and is thus constitutively active.
2: The usage of this mutant was based on the fact that protein remains in the nucleus due to the inability of insulin/growth factor signaling to phosphorylate the mutated residues.
3: Like FOXL2 wild type (FOXL2 WT), the FOXL2 C134W mutant is also localized in the nucleus [ 9] and thus FOXO1-3A is the best construct for our transcriptomic study.
4: N-terminally Flag-tagged human FOXL2wt (pCS2 + backbone) was kindly given by Dr. Louise Bilezikjian [ 33] and its mutant (FOXL2 C134W) was made in our laboratory as previously reported [ 41].
5: The expression plasmids encoding human SMAD3 were kindly provided by Drs.
6: Kohei Miyazono [ 42] and Louise Bilezikjian [ 33].

<p>Thereby, a contact tube to work piece distance of 12 mm indicates the arc attaching point at the filler wire, enclosing the formed droplet at the end of the electrode (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). At this point, the electromagnetic pinch force was applied, constricting the molten droplet. However, increasing CTWD led to a displacement of the arc attaching point to the bottom of the formed droplet (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). This resulted in a reduced pinch force to constrict the molten material, due to a decreased welding current. The formation of large volume droplets was the consequence.

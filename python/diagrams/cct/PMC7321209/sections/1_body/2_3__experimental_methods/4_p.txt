0: Low-alloyed steel S355 J2 + N (1.0570) was used as substrate material with a thickness of 20 mm.
1: A solid wire of low-alloyed steel G4Si1/SG3 (1.5130,  = 1.0 mm) was used as filler material in the GMAW process.
2: Herein, the silicon percentage was increased by 0.3% by the manufacturer to enhance the binding of oxygen and reduce the formation of porosity in the weld bead.
3: Prospectively, the chosen filler material is of high interest for industrial sectors such as construction engineering and architecture.
4: The following  Table 1 shows the chemical composition of the substrate material and filler wire for WAAM.
5: During additive manufacturing, 98%Ar/2%CO 2 was used as shielding gas for the GMAW process.

 </sup>. The present study showed that circRAB11FIP1 served as the sponge for miR-129. MiR-129 inhibited the autophagy of H9c2 cells through the direct targeting of ATG14

 </sup>. The findings suggested that miR-129 inhibited the autophagy of ovarian cancer cells by directly targeting ATG14. This was consistent with previous findings

 </sup>. The present study also observed that miR-129 inhibited the autophagy of ovarian cancer cells by directly targeting ATG7. CircRAB11FIP1 promoted autophagy dependent on ATG7 and ATG14 via miR-129. These data indicated that circRAB11FIP1 promoted autophagy by sponging miR-129 via regulating ATG7 and ATG14.

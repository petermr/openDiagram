0: Western blotting was carried out according to the previously described protocol 29.
1: Rabbit polyclonal anti-RUNX1 (1:1000; cat.
2: #4334S, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit monoclonal anti-RPS6KA1 (1:1000; cat.
3: #8408S, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-LIMS1 (1:1000; cat.
4: #11890S, Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (1:10,000; cat.
5: #AM4300, Invitrogen TM) antibodies were used as primary antibodies.
6: Moreover, two different rabbit polyclonal antibodies with C-terminal epitopes were used to detect the PARL proteins: the first one (-PARL #1; 1:500) was obtained from Thomas Langer laboratory 44 and the second one (-PARL #2) was from Abcam (1:1000; cat.
7: #ab45231).
8: In addition, goat anti-mouse (1:10,000; cat.
9: #P0447, Agilent) or anti-rabbit (1:10,000; cat.
10: #sc-2004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) polyclonal immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies.

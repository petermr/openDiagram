 </disp-formula> where x
 <sub>i</sub> is the depth or width areas that Micro-hardness was measured, x 
 <sub>(b.m)</sub> is row material micro-hardness, and n is known as the number of areas that their hardness was measured. In this paper n is, 10 and x 
 <sub>(b.m)</sub> is equivalent to 256 Vickers (hardness of AISI 4130). In laser hardening process the higher MHD is desired while a higher MHD value represents a more uniform hardness in the hardened area. By comparing MHD values presented in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-03136-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, which were calculated by Equation (5), sample #9 had the higher values among the transferred hardening samples. The higher MHD showed better and more uniform distribution of the hardened profile.

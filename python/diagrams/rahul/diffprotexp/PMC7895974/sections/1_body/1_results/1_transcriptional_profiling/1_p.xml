<p id="Par6">To conduct genome-wide transcriptome analysis during the spatiotemporal transition of paraxial mesoderm, we collected presomitic mesoderm (PSM), ES, maturing somites (MS) and differentiated somites (DS) from Hamburger–Hamilton stage 14 (HH14)

 </sup> chick embryos in triplicate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). At this stage, the four most posterior somites are epithelial, but in MS cells in the ventral part undergo EMT, the dorsal dermomyotome lip forms in the epaxial domain adjacent to the neural tube and myogenic cells begin to transition into the early myotome. Differentiating somites are compartmentalised, with a primary myotome beneath the dermomyotome and a sclerotome ventrally

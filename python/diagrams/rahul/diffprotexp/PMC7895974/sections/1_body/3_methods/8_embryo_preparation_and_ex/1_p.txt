0: Hamburger and Hamilton (HH3+) embryos were captured using the filter paper based easy-culture method.
1: Briefly, eggs were incubated for ~20 h, a window was created using forceps, the embryo and yolk were transferred into a dish and thin albumin above and around the embryo was removed using tissue paper.
2: A circular filter paper ring was placed on top, excised and transferred into a separate dish containing Ringers solution and excess yolk was removed.
3: The embryo was then transferred into a dish containing albumin-agar and ready for electroporation with the ventral side up 49.
4: Plasmid DNA was injected between the membrane and embryo to cover the whole epiblast, electroporated used five pulses of 5 V, 50 ms on, 100 ms off.
5: Thin albumin was used to seal the lids of dishes and embryos were cultured at 37 C with humidity to the desired stage.

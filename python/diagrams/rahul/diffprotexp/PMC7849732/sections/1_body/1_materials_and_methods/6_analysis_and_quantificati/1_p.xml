<p>In order to specifically identify and analyze the L4/L5 segments of the rat lumbar spinal cord, we visualized the spinal cord segments under a light microscope before imaging. L4 and L5 spinal sections were identified through reference to cytoarchitectural hallmarks using a rat spinal cord atlas [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We could distinguish L4/L5 sections largely based on gray and dorsal column white matter anatomical features, as well as the outer diameter of the spinal cord. L4 and L5 transverse section segments were slightly wider than L1, L2, L3 segments and much wider than the L6 segment. Moreover, the morphology of the gray and white matters varied along the lumbar segments as well. The dorsal horns appeared similarly rounded and curved (medially and laterally) in every lumbar segment as opposed to the ventral horns of L4, L5, and L6 which presented two main caudolateral enlarged areas with two distinguishable clusters of neurons. The dorsal column white matter of L1/L2 and L3/L6 morphologically resembled a heart and an inverted cone with rounded bases, respectively. In contrast, the dorsal column white matter of L4 and L5 appeared very narrow and extended longitudinally toward the central canal. To confirm successful segment identification, two experimenters independently classified the same lumbar sections as L4/L5.

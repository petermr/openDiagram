<p id="Par26">Even though the majority of the selected proteins did not substantially differ in abundance between meniscus and articular cartilage, we detected distinct differences for certain specific proteins. However, lysozyme C was one the proteins that were significantly different between the tissue types, after FDR control, in both the DDA and DIA analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Similarly, lysozyme C was previously reported to be more abundant in articular cartilage than meniscus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Already discovered by Flemming in the 1920s, lysozymes are characterized as cationic proteins that primarily has a bacteriolytic function, and their presence in articular cartilage has been suggested to be due to ionic interactions with high levels of anionic aggrecan that would enable protein enrichment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Indeed, aggrecan was found to have a lower abundance in meniscus, which could explain the lower abundance of lysozyme C. The exact function of lysozyme C in articular cartilage remains unknown, however it is possible that lysozyme C is part of the intra-articular defence against bacteria [

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The <italic>matK</italic> sequences of <italic>O. caudata</italic> (Nees) Mez, <italic>O. cujumary</italic> Mart., and <italic>O. caniculata</italic> (Rich.) were assembled and edited using FinchTV (biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Sequences were checked against those in GenBank using the BLAST algorithm. The <italic>matK</italic> sequences from <italic>O. caudata</italic> (Nees) Mez, <italic>O. cujumary</italic> Mart., and <italic>O. caniculata</italic> (Rich.) were aligned with sequences from <italic>O. floribunda</italic> (gbEU153866.1), <italic>O. veraguensis</italic> (gb.JQ589849.1), and <italic>O. whitei</italic> (gb. JQ589831.1) available in GenBank. The sequences were edited using BioEdit V7.2.5 [<xref rid="B47-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the alignment was performed using the Clustal W [<xref rid="B48-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The distance genetic and Phylogenetic Tree was determined using Mega 7 Program [<xref rid="B49-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method and the evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter model with 10,000 replicates. The outgroups used for the construct phylogenetic tree were the <italic>matK</italic> sequences from <italic>Calycanthus chinensis</italic> (Cc) (gb|AY525339.1), <italic>Idiospermum australiense</italic> (Ia) (gi71891392), and <italic>Chimonanthus zhejiangensis</italic> (Cz) (gb|AY525341.1) belonging to the order Laurales and Calycanthaceae family.</p>

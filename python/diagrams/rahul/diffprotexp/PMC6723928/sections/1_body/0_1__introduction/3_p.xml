<p>Several new methods for evaluation of protein expression have been developed. Proteomic approaches using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), coupled with protein identification by mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics, offer a high-throughput means to study different protein expression profiles relating to a particular pathophysiological condition [

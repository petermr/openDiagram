<p>Unfortunately, the lack of pairs of protons proximal through space or protons within three bonds of more than one nitrogen atom meant that neither ROESY nor 
 <sup>1</sup>H/
 <sup>15</sup>N HMBC experiments would be useful to define the regiochemistry of the thiomorpholino moiety. Therefore, computational methods using density functional theory (DFT) GIAO-calculated 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR chemical shifts were used to predict the most probable isomer for 
 <bold>1</bold> (structures 
 <bold>1a</bold> or 
 <bold>1a′</bold>). The DFT-calculated 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR isotropic shielding values were scaled to account for the heavy atom effect of sulfur [
 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-19-00095" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] attached to C-8 and C-9a in 
 <bold>1a</bold>, and C-5a and C-7 in 
 <bold>1a′</bold>, and compared with tedaniophorbasin A’s (
 <bold>1</bold>) experimental 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data. The DFT-calculated 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data clearly indicated that structure 
 <bold>1a</bold> (mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.8) containing the N and S atoms at positions 6 and 9, respectively, was a better match with 
 <bold>1′</bold>s experimental 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data compared with that obtained for the alternate structure 
 <bold>1a′</bold> (MAE = 3.7, see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-marinedrugs-19-00095">supplementary material</xref>). The DFT-calculated 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR resonances in 
 <bold>1a′</bold> with deviations &gt;5.5 ppm were C-4, C-5a, and C-10a, whereas none of the calculated 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR resonances in 
 <bold>1a</bold> deviated from the observed data by more than 3.6 ppm (

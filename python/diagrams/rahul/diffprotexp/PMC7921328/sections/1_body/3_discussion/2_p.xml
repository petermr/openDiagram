<p>Our analysis presented comprehensive characterization of lncRNA dysregulation and clinical relevance in prostate cancer. We identified prostate cancer-specific dysregulated lncRNAs and prognostic lncRNAs, such as RP11-627G23.1 and RP11-465N4.5. We revealed the close associations between differential lncRNAs and biological hallmarks. Although immune-related hallmarks were not enriched of the largest number of lncRNAs, they took up approximately half of top significant lncRNA-hallmark associations. Allograft rejection is the top lncRNA-related cancer hallmarks, indicating the potential roles of dysregulated lncRNAs in organ transplantation. For example, in renal transplantation, oncogenic lncRNA-ATB is significantly overexpressed in acute rejection patients and regulates renal cell proliferation and cyclosporine A-mediated apoptosis (

A subset of lncRNAs enriched in most immune hallmarks suggests their potential roles in modulating cancer immunity to facilitate cancer progression. For example, lncRNA cox-2 facilitates the polarization of M2 macrophages and therefore induces the malignant phenotypes of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and angiogenesis (

 <sup>+</sup> T cell populations by activating TGF-Î² signaling (

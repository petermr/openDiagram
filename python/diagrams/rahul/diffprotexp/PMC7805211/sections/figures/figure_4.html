 <caption> Functional annotation of significant DMRs reveals differential methylation at alternative MAP2K3 exons leading to coordinated MKK3 expression. a KEGG pathway analysis of CNF and PNF methylation profiles confirms that multiple pathways are regulated epigenetically including growth factor, inflammatory, pain signaling and oxytocin pathways. b, c Differential methylation was observed in upstream regulatory sites in MAP2K3 that control alternative leading exon expression. d Western blot analysis of MKK3 protein (actin loading control). Beta-values for tumor-type DMRs (DMR1/DMR2) shown below. e DMR1 beta-values correlate strongly with MKK3/Actin ratio expression values ( p &lt; 0.01; = − 0.846) </caption>

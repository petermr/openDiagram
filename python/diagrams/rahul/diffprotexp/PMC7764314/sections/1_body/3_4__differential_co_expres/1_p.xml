<p>The methods described above have been applied to cancer biology to: (i) compare global topological features of cancer networks at different stages (“global network” approach), (ii) identify groups of co-regulated genes or pathways that are dysregulated in cancer (“module-based” approach), (iii) find specific genes changing their connectivity in cancer network (“gene-specific” approach). Moreover, despite the most frequent comparisons being tumours at different stages, many kind of conditions have been contrasted (e.g., ER+ vs. ER- breast tumours, p53 mutated vs. p53 wild type).</p>

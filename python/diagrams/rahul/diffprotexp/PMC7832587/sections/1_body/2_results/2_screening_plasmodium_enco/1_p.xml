<p>To unravel the functional and structural features of PfATP2, we examined its heterologous expression together with its putative Cdc50 proteins in the yeast 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We screened for expression of the ATP2 and Cdc50 sequences encoded by three different 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species: 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> and 
 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> aiming at identifying ATP2 and Cdc50 candidates with suitable expression yield for biochemical studies. For western blot detection, we fused a biotin acceptor domain (BAD) at either the N-terminal (BAD-ATP2) or the C- terminal (ATP2-BAD) ends of the ATP2 sequences, and a 10xHis-tag at the C-terminal end of each Cdc50 protein [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The 
 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> ortholog, PcATP2, was the only one that expressed in our system. The sequence similarity of ATP2 and Cdc50 ortologs in 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> suggest similar functional and structural features, thus making PcATP2 a fair paradigm of PfATP2.

<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The insects exposed to the garlic essential oil and toxic compounds displayed altered locomotion activity, and muscle contractions that were observed in detailed descriptions at high concentrations in LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> test. In some individuals, the paralysis was constant with concentrations near the LC<sub>50</sub> without recovery signs. Paralysis and muscle contractions in individuals of <italic>T. molitor</italic> at LC<sub>50</sub> can be explained by the toxic effect in the nervous system of the same. The rapid toxicity of essential oils and their constituents in insects indicates neurotoxic action as reported to <italic>Delia radicum</italic> Linnaeus, <italic>Musca domestica</italic> Linnaeus (Diptera: Muscidae), <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang et Li), and <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) with hyperactivity, hyperextension of the legs and abdomen and rapid knock-down effect or immobilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that has been shown to be inhibited by garlic compounds and can act only or in synergism as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and allicin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The presence of the diallyl sulfide in garlic compounds may be responsible for the toxic effect in <italic>T. molitor</italic> and may cause inhibition by cross-linking with essential thiol compounds in enzyme structures, altering the functional shape of the protein and denaturalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p>

<p>In addition to the studies described above, wherein hSMG1 was identified as a negative regulator of p53β alternative splicing, RPL26 and SRSF7 were identified as positive regulators of p53β splicing in the DNA-damage-induced alternative splicing pathway. Other studies have associated additional RNA binding proteins in basal regulation of p53β expression. The splicing factor SRSF3 was shown to inhibit alternative splicing of the p53β-unique exon, identifying another negative regulator of p53β expression [

Finally, while alternative splicing is responsible for the expression of p53β, the act of incorporating the p53β-unique exon introduces a premature termination codon (PTC), which is typically recognized by nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) machinery [
 <xref rid="B18-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consequently, the NMD factors UPF1 and SMG7 have been shown to increase p53β expression [
 <xref rid="B17-cancers-13-00251" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which indicates that p53β could be a target for NMD. The balance between alternative splicing and NMD of p53β remains to be elucidated, especially in the presence of cellular stressors. Importantly, many of these studies were performed in the absence of insult, thus it remains unknown how these factors cooperate with the DNA-damage-induced alternative splicing pathway.

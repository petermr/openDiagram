<p>We added text to the Discussion to further discuss this relationship. We note that the overlap was general, included both up- and down-regulated DE genes, and that overlapping ASD risk genes were annotated across biological pathways rather than specific to any particular function or process. Thus, while we think this is indicative of general translational relevance, we donâ€™t see a clear conclusion beyond the general overlap implicating shared processes across corticogenesis. Thus, we tried to offer some further thoughts, but want to avoid speculation too far beyond the evidence. If the reviewers had further suggestions for how to summarize, we are open to amending.</p>

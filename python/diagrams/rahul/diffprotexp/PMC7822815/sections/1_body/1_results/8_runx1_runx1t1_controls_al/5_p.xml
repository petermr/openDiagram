 <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Moreover, our experimental data also indicate the existence of such a relationship. For instance, the two t(8;21) AML cell lines Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 express a non-canonically splice variant of TRAPPC2L lacking exon 4 (Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. TRAPPC2L is not a direct target of the fusion protein, but eCLIP data from K562 cells suggest that SRSF7 binds to all exons of TRAPPC2L (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6g</xref>). Interestingly, while knockdown of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 abolishes skipping of exon 4, depletion of SRSF7 has the opposite effect. In contrast, RBFOX2 knockdown did not affect exon 4 skipping (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6h, i</xref>). These combined findings suggest that RUNX1/RUNXT1 corrupts splicing by interfering with SRSF7 function.

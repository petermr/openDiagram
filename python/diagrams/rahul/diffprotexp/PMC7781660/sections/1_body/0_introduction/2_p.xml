<p>According to the cytopathic effect (CPE) of BVDV-infected cells, BVDV is divided into two biotypes, cytopathic (CP) biotype, and non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among them, the CP or NCP biotype BVDV strains are divided into BVDV-1, BVDV-2, and atypical BVDV genotypes based on the viral sequence variation with an amino acid homology of approximately 85% [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref>]. Epidemiological investigations have showed that these BVDV biotypes and genotypes are widespread in countries and regions with developed cattle husbandry [

 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. China has one of the highest BVDV infection rates, with over 46.7% of cattle farms testing positive for the presence of BVDV with a PI rate of approximately 2.2% in the herds [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, an analysis for the epidemiological investigation data of BVDV infection from the major cattle-rearing provinces in China showed that the overall BVDV positive rate was 58.09%, testing for the presence of BVDV-specific antibodies using ELISA [

0: The involvement of potassium channels in the vasorelaxant effect was assessed following the experimental procedure previously detailed, with some variations [ 54].
1: Endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca 2+-activated potassium channels, TEA (10 2M;  n = 6), the selective voltage-activated potassium channel (K v) blocker, 4-AP (10 4M;  n = 6), the selective inwardly-rectifying potassium channel blocker, BaCl 2 (10 4M;  n = 6), and the selective ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker, glybenclamide (10 5M;  n = 6) for 20 min prior to contraction with Phen (1 M), then, the cumulative concentrationresponse curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.

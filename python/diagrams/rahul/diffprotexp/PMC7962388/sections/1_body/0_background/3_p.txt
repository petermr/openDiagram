0: While plant sexuality takes off with a specialized cell division process (meiosis) preceding the formation of haploid megaspores, apomictic mechanisms share the common characteristic of lacking any reductive division before female sporogenesis (apomeiosis) [ 1].
1: Moreover, while sexuality start the sporophytic life cycle by restoring the species-specific ploidy level through fertilization of the genetically reduced egg cell with an equally reduced male gamete, apomixis does it by inducing parthenogenesis, i. e., the spontaneous formation of an embryo from a reproductively-committed cell [ 1].
2: Finally, for the formation of the seed endosperm, the sexual route requires the fertilization of two reduced female polar nuclei with a reduced male gamete under a strict 2:1 maternal:paternal genomic contribution.
3: Instead, apomixis may alternatively proceed with the spontaneous proliferation of maternal polar nuclei (autonomy) or the fertilization of one/two female unreduced polar nuclei with a male reduced gamete (pseudogamy), a path that often deviates from the expected genome contribution ratio [ 1].
4: While in some species the three components of apomixis (apomeiosis, parthenogenesis and endosperm development) seem to be controlled by a non-recombinant superlocus, in others these factors can be readily uncoupled [ 2,  3,  14 16].
5: However, in nearly all cases there seem to be a consistent association between the expressivity of trait and the ploidy level increments [ 2,  3,  14 16].

<p id="Par18">During virus infection, the regulation of host gene expression is dynamic. The regulation at transcription and post-transcription levels plays an essential role, which involves cellular transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, alternative splicing and microRNAs, etc. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a common regulation mechanism that generates transcript isoforms with alternative 3′ ends. More than half of mammalian genes are characterized by alternative polyadenylation of their transcripts [

In this study, we used in vitro transcription sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (IVT-SAPAS) method to profile differential APA site switching events and differentially expressed genes in IPEC-J2 cells during the infection of PEDV variant strain GDS01. A comprehensive analysis of the APA switching genes and DEGs (differentially expressed genes) was carried out to understand regulation mechanisms during PEDV infection.

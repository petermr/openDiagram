0: In this study, submicron LLZNO powder with a stable cubic phase was synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction and prepared by the attrition milling process.
1: The submicron LLZNO powder had a high sintering activity, which promoted the sintering process, reduced the sintering temperature and time, and reduced the loss of Li during high-temperature sintering.
2: All these characteristics favored lithium stoichiometry and ionic conductivity.
3: Furthermore, LLZNO ceramics were obtained without mother powder while sintering under reduced temperature and time.
4: The particles-size distribution, phase structure, microtopography, total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy were characterized and analyzed.
5: The quasi-solid-state lithium batteries with LiMn 2O 4 as the positive electrode and submicron LLZNO powder as the solid electrolyte were assembled and the electrochemical performance are tested and analyzed.

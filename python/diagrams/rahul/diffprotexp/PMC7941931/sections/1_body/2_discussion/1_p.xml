<p id="Par39">MiRNAs, a class negative regulators of gene expression, play key roles in numerous plant developmental processes including seed development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, it whether and how to regulate the development of Tartary buckwheat seed remains unexplored. Here, to better understand the miRNAs-mediated molecular mechanisms of Tartary buckwheat seed development, we systematically identified the miRNA biosynthesis genes in the Tartary buckwheat genome and miRNA during Tartary buckwheat seed development. More importantly, we performed integrated analysis of miRNA and target mRNA expression profiles during Tartary buckwheat seed development, and identified the key miRNA-mRNA pairs for Tartary buckwheat seed development.

<p>Of the 7 DEPs common between MtzR lines, there were 6 functionally annotated proteins, including 2 variant-specific surface proteins (VSPs) (137 620, 37 093), 1 membrane-associated cysteine-rich endopeptidase (14 225), 1 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like transmembrane protein, and 2 proteins with oxidoreductase activity, glutamate synthase (7195) and NR-1 (6175), the latter of which was significantly downregulated in all MtzR lines and is consistent with its role in Mtz activation and resistance [

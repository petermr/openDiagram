<p id="Par14">Two leaf physiological traits (chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance) were measured every 5 days from flowering to 40DPA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In DBA Artemis, water-deficit stress significantly reduced the chlorophyll content at all time-points in the progeny from the same parents (i.e. AtCW vs AtCC, AtWW vs AtWC), except for 10, 15 and 20 DPA in the progeny from the stressed parents, where no significant difference was found between AtWW and AtWC. Chlorophyll content between control group progeny from the control parents and the stressed parents (AtWC vs AtCC) showed no significant difference. However, under water-deficit stress, progeny from the stressed parents managed to maintain significantly higher chlorophyll content than the progeny from the control parents (AtWW vs AtCW) from 10 to 30 DPA. For DBA Aurora, water-deficit stress significantly reduced the chlorophyll content at all time-points in the progeny from the same parents (i.e. AuCW vs AuCC, AuWW vs AuWC). No significant difference was found between the control group progeny from the control parents and stressed parents (AuWC vs AuCC), and no significant difference was found between water-deficit stress treated progeny from the two parent groups (AuWW vs AuCW). For stomatal conductance, in both genotypes, water-deficit stress applied in the progeny from the same parents significantly decreased the stomatal conductance at all time-points. However, the rate of reduction under water-deficit stress compared with its control was less evident in the progeny from the stressed parents. No significant difference was found between progeny under the same progeny treatment from different parent groups.

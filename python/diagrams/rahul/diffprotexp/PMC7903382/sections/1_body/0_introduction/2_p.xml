<p>Previous studies have reported that the spinal cord is closely associated with the occurrence and development of MIRI (
 <xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="bibr">9-11</xref>). Following cardiac ischemia and reperfusion, chemical mediators such as dynorphin and suppresses substance P within the myocardium activate cardiac afferent fibres projecting from the dorsal root ganglion to the upper thoracic dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This results in the release of inflammatory factors and neuropeptides within the spinal cord (

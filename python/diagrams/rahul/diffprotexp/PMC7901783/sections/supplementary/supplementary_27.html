 <caption> Biological functions of the genes that are targeted by differential expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNA). Since characterization of DEmiRNA was followed as the DEGs from RNASeq, thus, for description of the tabs refer to S3 Table. Note that in this file, up/downregulation is pertained to expression pattern of DEmiRNAs. (XLSX) </caption>

<p id="Par41">In glycerolipid metabolism pathway, the gene expression of triacylglycerol lipase was higher in the mandarin fish of Group X, and the glycerophosphoric acid metabolite was also higher in the Group X. In the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathway, stearoyl-CoA gene expression and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) metabolite were higher in the Group X. These results suggested that mandarin fish which could accept artificial diets well, might be attributed to the better capacity of glycerolipid metabolism and unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. Live food diets (such as zooplankton) and dry formulated diets have different fat levels and influences in European grayling [

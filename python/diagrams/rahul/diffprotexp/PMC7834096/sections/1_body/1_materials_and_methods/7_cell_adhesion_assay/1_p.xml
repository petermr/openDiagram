<p>The cell adhesion assay was done as described by [

 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with the following alterations: HEp-2 cells were grown for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until 70–90% confluence in EMEM (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) in 4-well glass chamber slides (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml fetal calf serum-free EMEM (FCS-free) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> with “infection mixture.” The “infection mixture” was produced as follows: five fresh colonies per strain were incubated at 37°C for 16 h under static conditions in EMEM, supplemented with arabinose (final concentration 1%) for induction of AAF expression. OD
 <sub>600</sub> was measured the following day and the infection mixture was prepared consisting of 50 µl of 10% mannose (final concentration 0.5%) for blocking type 1 fimbriae [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the calculated amount of bacterial cells (final concentration 10
 <sup>8</sup> cfu/ml) and cell culture medium up to 1 ml. After incubation of HEp-2 cells for 3 h with the infection mixture, the cells were washed thrice with PBS and fixed for 1 min with 1 ml methanol. The methanol was replaced with 1 ml of Giemsa staining solution (freshly diluted 1:20 in ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O) per well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The staining solution was discarded, and the cells were washed carefully with ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O until the water was clear. The slides were dried at room temperature and cell adherence was evaluated using 40x and 100x oil-immersion light microscopy (Zeiss Axiostar, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Classification of adherence patterns was done as described in other publications [

<p>The KEGG functional pathway statistical pie chart for the top 10 DEPs annotated to S727 and S3057 can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00130-f006">Figure 6</xref>. It is observable from the results that expression of the top 10 functional pathways was different between Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice. It is evident from the GO, KEGG annotation analysis that the metabolic pathway was the most enriched pathway present in 401 differential proteins. Although the most common pathway annotated in both rice groups was the metabolic pathway, the trend of the concurrence of this pathway seems to be most in Se-enriched rice (73%). There were six same functions among the top 10 annotated pathways but the contingency of these pathways in both rice types were different, i.e., metabolic pathways; 73%:57%, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites; 38%:30%, microbial metabolism in diverse environments; 36%:14%, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis; 20%:6%, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum; 15%:5%, starch and sucrose metabolism; 15%:11%, in Se-enriched and non-Se-enriched rice, respectively. The expression of annotated DEPs was more in the rice group responsive for Se. Thus, the Se-enriched rice seems to have better molecular functions and regulatory effects then non-Se-enriched rice. Se also seems to be an integral part of cellular components.

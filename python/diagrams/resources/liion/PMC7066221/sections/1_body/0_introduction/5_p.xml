<p id="p0050">All these facts emphasize the motivation of this work, i.e., to study self-recovery chemistry in the cathode of Zn-ion batteries, including the influencing parameters for the process and their interactions and the mechanism behind the electrochemical deposition of Mn compound during the battery cycling. Based on the understanding of the self-recovery chemistry in the cathode, we further propose a cobalt-modified Î´-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> as a cathode material with a redox-active surface for fast deposition of Mn compound. To emphasize the importance of the deposition rate of the Mn-active compounds for the self-recovery cycling capacity, an equation that describes the dynamic capacity of the Mn-based cathode is also demonstrated. The cobalt-induced facilitating of deposition is confirmed by the electrochemical and chemical characterizations of both practical coin-type batteries and a newly designed electrolyzer system. Insights into the catalysis routes of the Mn compound deposition are also revealed. This work provides guidance of the utility of the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>-containing electrolyte for the development of Zn-ion batteries and may provide inspiration for materials engineering for future functionalized cathodes, especially for other conversion-type battery cathodes, which have similar dissolution issues.

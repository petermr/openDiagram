0: Without routine therapy, ~25% of patients with KD develop coronary artery dilation or aneurysms (CAD or CAA, respectively) ( 6).
1: Mild CAD can regress, while CAA and severe CAD are difficult to restore to a normal state.
2: Mueller  et al ( 7) reported that patients with coronary artery sizes of 5.0 mm exhibited regression to the normal state, while patients with coronary artery sizes of >5.0 mm exhibited persistence or even increases in size.
3: CAA with a diameter of 8.0 mm is strongly associated with the development of coronary artery stenosis and myocardial infarction ( 7).

<p id="Par37">Our results are consistent with previous work in human subjects which show a decrease in pre-movement motor cortical EEG beta power during early stages of forcefield, and visuomotor adaptation task—involving perturbing forces being applied to the limb

 </sup>. Forcefield adaptation normally involves the integration of visual and proprioceptive information

 </sup>. This would suggest the change in beta activity within the motor cortex is independent of the mode of sensory feedback. However, previous studies indicate that forcefield and visuomotor adaptation may involve different neural pathways/processes within the cerebellar cortex

 </sup>. One possible explanation to unite these findings is that signals arising from distinct cerebellar cortical regions are integrated within the cerebellar nuclei and/or thalamus before being forwarded to the motor cortex for the preparation of subsequent limb movements.

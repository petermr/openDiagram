<p>The MS/MS spectra were searched using the MASCOT engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.2) in the Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (Thermo Electron, San Jose, USA.) against the Uniprot 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> fasta database (38,369 sequences, downloaded March 4th, 2013) and the decoy database. False discovery rates (FDR) were calculated by running all spectra against a decoy database using the MASCOT software. To identify proteins, the following options were used: Peptide mass tolerance = 20 ppm, MS/MS tolerance = 0.1 Da, Enzyme = Trypsin, Missed cleavage = 2, Fixed modification: Carbamidomethyl (C), iTRAQ 8plex (K), iTRAQ 8plex (N-term), Variable modification: Oxidation (M). The quantification was performed based on the peak intensities of the reporter ions in the MS/MS spectra. The ratio of label 115 and 116 represents the expression of proteins with the protein identification confidence of a 1% FDR (Unwin et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The proteins were considered over expressed when the iTRAQ ratio was above 1.5 and under expressed when the iTRAQ ratio was lower than 0.67. The Proteome Discoverer tool was used to categorize the proteins detected by Gene Ontology (GO) annotation according to the cellular component, biological process and molecular function.

<p>In 2017, Park and Dinca proposed a Cu(II)–azolate MOF (MIT-20) as a tunable solid electrolyte for Li
 <sup>+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> after soaking in the corresponding halide or pseudohalide salts (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Its Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>-substituted analog, MIT-20-MgBr
 <sub>2</sub>, exhibited the Mg ionic conductivity of 8.8 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at the room temperature. MIT-20 was attractive for its feature of immobilizing anions by the Cu(II) metal center, allowing the favorably free migration of cations within the one-dimensional pores. Later in 2019, Miner from Dinca's group continued their work on the tunable solid electrolyte of MOF (Miner et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The MOF was Cu
 <sub>4</sub>(ttpm)
 <sub>2</sub>·0.6CuCl
 <sub>2</sub>, possessing high surface area with plenty of Cu(II) cations to bound halide anions. Its analog, Cu
 <sub>4</sub>(ttpm)
 <sub>2</sub>·0.6CuCl
 <sub>2</sub>-MgBr
 <sub>2</sub>, exhibited an ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for Mg ions, demonstrating the promising future of MOF-based solid electrolyte to optimize the ionic conductivity via the control of identity, geometry and distribution of the cation hopping sites.

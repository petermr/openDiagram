<p id="Par20">Meanwhile, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of the 74 dysregulated proteins in the anxiety-susceptible group were analyzed. A total of 407 BP, 105 CC, 83 MF, and 10 KEGG pathway terms were significantly enriched. The top ten enriched GO terms are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>. BP category analysis indicated that most proteins were related to histone trimethylation and methylation and metabolic processes. CC category analysis indicated the differential proteins belonging to the nucleus, intracellular and organelle components, and MF indicated the majority of the proteins were predicted to be engaged in RNA, protein, and complex binding, as well as enzyme activity. Enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways showed the dysregulated proteins were mainly involved in various metabolic and neuropsychiatric disease pathways (Fig.

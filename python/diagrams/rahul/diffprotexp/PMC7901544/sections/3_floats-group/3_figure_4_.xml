   <bold>Generation of FAV4_Del carrying Fiber-2 without N-terminal 7–40aa</bold>. (a) Strategy of the CRISPR/Cas9 platform for generating the 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited virus FAV4_Del. LMH cells were first transfected with sgRNA1 and sgRNA2, and then LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4-EGFP and transfected with donor plasmid at 24 hours post-transfection. The 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited virus FAV4_Del was then purified by limiting dilution assay and viral plaque assay. (b) PCR identification of the 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited virus FAV4_Del. Viral genome of purified FAV4_Del, FAdV-4 and unpurified FAV4_Del were extracted and identified by PCR. (c) Western blot analysis of the 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited virus FAV4_Del. LMH cells were infected with the 
   <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited virus FAV4_Del and FAdV-4. 4 d post-infection, the infected LMH cells were harvested and lysed, and the lysates were then examined with western blot by mAb 1C9 against Fiber-2. Experiments B and C were performed for three times with comparable results

<p>Safety concerns of LMBs are of paramount importance in practical applications. A series of safety tests of the pouch‐type battery using the Li–B–Mg composite as anode, namely, the acupuncture, impact and overcharge tests, were conducted after preformation procedure. Among them, the acupuncture test is the simulation of a battery under the circumstance of a forced internal short circuit. Video S3 (Supporting Information) recorded the process of the acupuncture test, from which no instant explosion and no open fire can be observed after the needle puncture (the inset on the upper right in Figure S10A in the Supporting Information). The pouch battery also withstood the impact test without explosion and open fire (Video S4 and Figure S10B, Supporting Information), which is aimed at simulating a heavy object impacting the power supply. Resistance to overcharge is also an essential aspect of the safety properties for monomer battery so an overcharge test has been conducted and the results are shown in Figure S10C (Supporting Information). Although it can be observed that swelling has occurred during the rise of voltage yet no explosion nor smoke occurred even when the voltage has reached to 10 V. This experiment demonstrates a higher safety characteristic of the LiCoO

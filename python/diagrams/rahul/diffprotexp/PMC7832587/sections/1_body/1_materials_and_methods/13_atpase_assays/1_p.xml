<p>Between 5 and 10 µL of home-made GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads coupled with PcATP2-GFP-BAD/Cdc50B-10xHis (wild-type and mutant), and corresponding to 100 ng of PcATP2-GFP-BAD, were diluted into 50 µL of the reaction buffer (50 mM MOPS-Tris pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM NaN3, 0.5 mg/mL DDM, 0.1 mg/mL CHS), supplemented or not (“no lipid” experiments) with 0.45 mg/ml of the phospholipid substrate and, when indicated, with 0.025 mg/ml of PI4P. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and moved to ice for 15 min more. The reaction was initiated after the addition of 1 mM ATP-Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and incubated at 37°C for 25 min. The reaction was stopped by dropping the test tubes into liquid N
 <sub>2</sub>. To quantify the hydrolyzed ATP, we used the BIOMOL® Green solution (Enzo Biochem Inc), a proprietary mixing solution that uses a molybdate/malachite green-based assay to quantify the released Pi. Thus, 100 µL of BIOMOL® Green solution was added to each sample, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation, samples were quickly spun down to pellet the beads, and 100 µL of clear supernatant were deposited in a 96-well plate to measure the absorbance at 620 nm. Standard calibration curves at each experimental buffer condition were made using a phosphate standard solution provided by the BIOMOL® Green supplier.

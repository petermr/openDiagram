0: Unlike EOC, LMP tumor is a unique epithelial subtype of ovarian tumor that intermediates between benign and malignant tumors [ 4].
1: Meanwhile, LMP tumor is also known as borderline malignant ovarian cancer due to lack invasion of the underlying stroma [ 5].
2: Thus, the prognosis of LMP and EOC differ considerably due to their different invasiveness, with 5-year survival rate > 90% for LMP versus a < 30% survival for advanced high-grade EOC [ 6].
3: Furthermore, unilateral oophorectomy should be considered in LMP patients in view of its younger onset age, which is different from EOC [ 7].
4: However, a portion of LMP tumors display diffuse non-invasive extra-ovarian implants, and accurate identification of these implants can be very difficult [ 4].
5: Moreover, approximately 2030% of LMP cases are finally confirmed to be EOC [ 4].
6: Thus, it can be seen that the diagnosis based on histopathology without using molecular markers will lead to inaccurate diagnosis of LMP.
7: Therefore, identifying potential differential diagnostic markers for LMP and EOC may improve the diagnostic accuracy and also contribute to the development of novel therapeutic & preventive strategies for EOC.

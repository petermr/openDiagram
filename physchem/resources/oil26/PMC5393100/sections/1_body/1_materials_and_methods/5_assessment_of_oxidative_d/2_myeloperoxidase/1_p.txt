0: Defrosted plasma was mixed with 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.167 mg/ml o-dianisidine hydrochloride and 0.0005% H 2O 2.
1: Absorbance of the mixture was measured at 460 nm for 3 min using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (GBC, Cintra 40).
2: One unit of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was equal to the change in absorbance per min at room temperature in the final reaction.
3: [ 21]

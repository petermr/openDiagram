<p>Under the conditions of obesity, excessive FFAs will lead to glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, which eventually weaken the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, thereby inducing insulin resistance (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bathina and Das, 2018</xref>), which will further affect the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This ultimately leads to a vicious cycle of obesity and type II diabetes. In addition, the abnormality of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is the most common genomic abnormality in breast, ovarian, bladder, and other cancers (

Rap1 is a small G protein of the Ras superfamily that is present in a variety of important cellular processes, which regulate cell survival and proliferation through the regulation of PI3-AKT. Ras proteins can act as molecular switches that control the integrity of actin cytoskeleton, regulate cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell migration. Overactive Ras signaling can lead to cancer (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Goodsell, 1999</xref>). The Ras signaling pathway activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, participates in cell growth and division, stimulates protein synthesis, and inhibits cell apoptosis. In conclusion, VAT-derived ASCs may make patients with excessive VAT more susceptible to insulin resistance by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thus increasing the risk of multiple tumor diseases in obese patients.

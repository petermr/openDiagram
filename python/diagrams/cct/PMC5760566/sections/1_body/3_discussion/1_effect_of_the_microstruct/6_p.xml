 </sup>, the HAGBs determine the effective grain size, as they play a vital role in blocking crack propagation. The grain boundary energy of the HAGBs is much higher than that of the LAGBs, because in the former a higher number of atoms deviates from its equilibrium position. When the cracks propagate towards the HAGBs, their direction changes multiple times due to the irregular arrangement of the atoms, and the crack propagation energy is consumed. Therefore, HAGBs can effectively hinder the propagation of cracks, reduce the crack growth rate, improve the fracture toughness of the steel, and improve the impact energy. This will result in the Charpy energy curves moving towards the low temperature zone (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), reducing the DBTT. HAGBs can disrupt crack propagation, i.e., the propagation direction changes at these boundaries and the crack propagation path increases. As such, the toughness of the steel increases with increasing fraction of HAGBs. Furthermore, according to Hwang

 </sup>. HAGBs serve as effective obstacles to cleavage-crack propagation, thereby resulting in a decrease in the DBTT.

<p id="Par28">We performed extensive HMLP-MD simulations around the Phase I–II boundary, with different starting configurations, to determine candidate structures and phase stability of H
 <sub>2</sub> Phase II. At 150 K and 20 GPa, the orientations of the H
 <sub>2</sub> molecular axes are almost randomly distributed along different directions, indicating Phase I with freely rotating molecules. Upon compression to the high pressure of 80 GPa and cooling to a low temperature of 50 K, the material transforms to an orientationally ordered phase in which the molecular rotations are restricted (Fig.

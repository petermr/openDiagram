(<bold>B</bold>) Inverted Upset plot from <bold>A</bold> showing the pathways shared by genes highlighted by WEBGESTALT in each pathway. (<bold>C</bold>) Cladogram of Afrotheria with sequenced genomes. Exemplar tumor suppressor duplicates are mapped onto lineages in which those genes are duplicated. Dots represent a duplication event of the color-coded genes. Note that we are unable to determine duplication status for some genes in Proboscideans because of assembly gaps in ancient genomes (indicated with skull and crossbones); these genes appear to be independently duplicated in extant species (African Forest, African Savanah, and Asian elephants) because they are missing from ancient genomes, biasing ancestral reconstructions of duplication status. (<bold>D</bold>) Gene expression levels of genes from panel <bold>C</bold> that have two or more expressed duplicates.</p><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="fig4sdata1"><label>Figure 4&#8212;source data 1.</label><caption><title>Data set used for manual coding gene potential associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-65041-fig4-data1.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d39e1353" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-65041-fig4"/></fig>

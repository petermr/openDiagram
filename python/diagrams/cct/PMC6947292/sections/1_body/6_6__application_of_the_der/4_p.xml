<p>Ni-based alloys can also benefit from precipitation strengthening. Recently the precipitation behaviour of Inconel 718 (a Ni-17Cr-17Fe-5Nb-3Mo alloy, mass fraction in %) during cooling from solution treatment was investigated [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f084">Figure 84</xref>a shows continuous DSC cooling curves for this alloy after solution annealing at 980 Â°C for 60 min, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f084">Figure 84</xref>b illustrates the hardness and the specific precipitation heat, which depend upon the cooling rate. Linear cooling (e.g., cooling in the DSC) involves a two-stage precipitation process that is kinetically suppressed by an increase in the cooling rate. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f084">Figure 84</xref>b that there is a substantial direct hardening effect of quenched induced precipitates. This effect is known to occur in Ni-based alloys in an extend allowing technological application for strengthening [

 <xref rid="B230-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Compared to Al alloys, this effect is much stronger due to the substantially larger fractions of alloying elements involved in precipitation. The UCCR in terms of hardness after ageing is in the range of just 0.1 K/s.

<p>For the rest of LE genes, their contributions are critical for the LE gene panelâ€™s effectiveness in predicting PC release, although their differential expression following PC pathogenesis and their biomarker values as individual genes were not significant. This enhancement properties are likely attributable for these genes being components of the CREIGHTON_ENDOCRINE_THERAPY_RESISTANCE_3 gene set.</p>

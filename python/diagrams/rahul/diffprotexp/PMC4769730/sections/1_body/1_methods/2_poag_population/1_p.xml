<p>A total of 40 POAG and 23 age/sex-matched post-mortem TM specimens were used for the study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Both slit lamp and clinical data were collected the day before surgery from each patient including age, gender, ocular history, diagnosis and duration of disease, previous medications, IOP, visual acuity and other ocular surgical interventions. The inclusion criteria comprised patients who needed to undergo trabeculectomy for uncontrolled IOP under maximal tolerated topical medical therapy, while the exclusion criteria comprised patients with systemic (either inflammatory, autoimmune and/or immunosuppressive) or pre-existing ocular (retinal vein/artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration) diseases, or previous trabeculectomy or other ocular surgery or use of topical or systemic corticosteroids. All POAG TM samples were further grouped according to the IOP-lowering topical therapy ongoing before glaucoma surgery [Group 1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14): prostaglandin analogs (PGE) + carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI); Group 2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26): PGE + CAI + beta-blockers (BB)].

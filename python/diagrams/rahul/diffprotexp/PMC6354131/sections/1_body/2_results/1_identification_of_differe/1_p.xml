 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the clinical data of all the patients involved in this study. Protein samples of the non-shock and shock groups were run on 2-DE gels, and each sample was run at least three times to ensure reproducibility. For the non-shock group, an average of 645 ± 45 spots was obtained (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), indicating no difference in spot count between the two groups (

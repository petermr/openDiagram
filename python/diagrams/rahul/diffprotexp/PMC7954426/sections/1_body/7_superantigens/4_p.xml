<p>Moreover, C3H/HeJ upregulates the expression of B7-1 co-stimulatory molecules on peritoneal adherent cells upon MAM stimulation, whereas C3H/HeSnJ downregulates it [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of anti-B7-1 antibody, the type 1 cytokine profile of MAM-injected C3H/HeJ mice changed to type 2 and significantly delayed the lethal toxicity of 
 <italic>M. arthritidis</italic>. On the contrary, type 2 shifted to a type 1 profile and enhanced arthritis in C3H/HeSnJ mice [
 <xref rid="cit0291" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. These results clearly demonstrate the importance of TLR control of B7-1 function in regulating cytokine response and inflammatory disease induced by MAM. Similarly, MAM interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 to differentially modulate IL-17/Th17-related cytokines. In C3H/HeSnJ mice, blockade of TLR4 antibodies decreases the IL-17 and IL-6 production, while TLR2-knockout mice demonstrate increased levels of both cytokines [
 <xref rid="cit0297" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>], suggesting that TLR4 is required for the IL-17/Th17 cascade. Furthermore, inhibition of B7-1 significantly enhances the MAM-initiated TLR4-dependent IL-17/Th17 cascade [
 <xref rid="cit0298" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>], thereby aggravating 
 <italic>M. arthritidis</italic>-induced arthritis. Previous studies have shown that the sensitivity of different C3H substrain mice to arthritis is ascribed to the different cytokine profiles induced by MAM [
 <xref rid="cit0289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>]. However, in CBA/J and DBA/2Â J mice, MAM-induced lethal toxicity is independent of arthritis [
 <xref rid="cit0299" ref-type="bibr">299</xref>], indicating that MAM is not the primary arthritogenic factor in these strains.

0: Protein digestion was performed according to the reported FASP procedure (Wisniewski et al.,  2009).
1: In brief, 200 g of proteins at two different conditions (1/4 MIC of tylosin treated cells and nontreated cells) were added into 30 L STD buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM DTT, 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and ultrafiltered (Microcon units, 30 kD) with UA buffer (8 M Urea, 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0).
2: To block reduced cysteine residues, 100 L 0.05 M iodoacetamide was added into UA buffer and incubated for 20 min in the dark.
3: The filters were washed three times with 100 L UA buffer and twice with 100 L DS buffer (50 mM triethylammoniumbicarbonate at pH 8.5).
4: Finally, the proteins were digested with 2 g trypsin (Promega) in 40 L DS buffer at 37C for 1618 h. Then, the resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate.
5: The peptide content was estimated by UV light spectral density at 280 nm using an extinctions coefficient of 1.1 of 0.1% (g/l) solution calculated on the basis of the frequency of tryptophan and tyrosine in vertebrate proteins.

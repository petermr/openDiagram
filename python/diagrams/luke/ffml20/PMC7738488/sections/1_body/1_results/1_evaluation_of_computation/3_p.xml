<p id="Par8">Taking into cognizance, both experimental and simulation studies, the moderate size of the dendrimer concede them to acquit as soft deformable particles rather than compact spheres, reproducing them as an attributable candidate for drug delivery. This is conclusively confirmed in the present study. Comparison between the computational and theoretically calculated molecular weight are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The inferences distinctly substantiate the close agreement between computational and theoretical data.

<p>Scaffold (version Scaffold_3.4.5, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 80% probability, as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 90% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.

<p>To summarize, based on the proteomic assessment, we report that day 3 and day 5 queen and worker larvae have different protein profiles and different biological requirements that lead them to follow distinct caste trajectories. This study indicates that 3-day old larva is already on the pathway for the intended direction. Therefore, further studies will target earlier larvae ages (less than day 3) for detail investigations on molecular mechanisms underlying caste divergence at early post embryonic developmental stage.</p>

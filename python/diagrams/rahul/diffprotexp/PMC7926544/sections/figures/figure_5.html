 <caption> The ERAD of NKCC2 mediated by STCH involves both the proteasome and the lysosome. ( A) Mannose trimming is required for STCH effect on NKCC2. OKP cells transiently transfected for with Myc-NKCC2 alone or with GFP-STCH, were treated with 25 μM of kifunensine (KIF) or without for 12–14 h prior to cell lysis. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Myc and anti-GFP antibodies. Bottom, densitometric analysis of NKCC2 bands from untreated and treated cells with kifumensine (KIF). Data are expressed as percentage of control ± SE. *, p &lt; 0.02 versus control ( n = 3). ( B) STCH decreases NKCC2 expression in a proteasome-dependent and lysosome dependent manner. 16 h post-transfection, HEK cells were treated with or without 2 μm MG132 or 100 μm chloroquine for 6 h prior to cell lysis. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-GFP antibodies. Bottom, densitometric analysis of NKCC2 bands from untreated and treated cells with MG132 or chloroquine (CHLO). Data are expressed as percentage of control ±S.E. #, p &lt; 0.05 versus control ( n = 3). NS, a non-specific band illustrating the equal loading of protein extracts. </caption>

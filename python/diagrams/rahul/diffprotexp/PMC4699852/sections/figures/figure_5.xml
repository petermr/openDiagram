  <title>Time courses of relative expression levels of phosphorylated ERK, TrkB, and phosphorylated CREB for 
   <italic>me_</italic>SWH-treated MSCs in NIM (upper panel) and in NIM with ERK inhibitor (lower panel).
  </title>
  <p>The relative levels of each protein at different time points were normalized to that at the time immediately prior to induction. The height of each bar in the graphs indicates the mean fold change. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of 3 or 4 replicate samples.</p>

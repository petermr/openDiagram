<p>All differential expression analysis was performed independently for each developmental stage via comparison of matched MIA and control samples. Thus, all samples considered in each DE GLM analysis and the same tissue make up and same developmental stage, precluding the inclusion of any covariate. Within stage, dissections were performed blinded to condition and variation across samples should be random and thus averaged out across replicates. We hope this clarifies the method and addresses this comment. To clarify this in the manuscript, we describe these methods as follows:</p>

0: The use of omics technologies has gained popularity to uncover the use of anabolic agents in human sports, animal husbandry [ 21], and aquaculture [ 22].
1: Indeed, proteomic analyses have been applied for the screening of steroid effects on body tissues such as prostate [ 23], gonads [ 22], breast [ 24], muscles [ 25] and blood components [ 26].
2: In this study, we used two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) in combination with mass spectrometry and western blotting to profile the proteome of GnRH neurons.
3: We hypothesized that 17-meT will modulate the expression of proteins associated with neuroendocrine regulation, synaptic plasticity, and cellular stress; key biological processes that might impact reproductive competence and integrity.

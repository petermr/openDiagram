<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par19">Investigation of the haplotypes defined by the 12 SNPs genotyped across the peak of the <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus in the AM panel allowed a condensed five-SNP haplotype across the region to be determined (Supplementary Table 4). This defined 10 haplotypes, six of which were associated with low ToxB sensitivity (the &#8216;group 1&#8217; haplotypes: 1.1 to 1.6) and four with high sensitivity (the &#8216;group 2&#8217; haplotypes: 2.1 to 2.4), with the differences in ToxB sensitivity between these two haplotype groups found to be highly significant (Welch two sample <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>t</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;25.5, <italic>P</italic>&#8201;~&#8201;0) (Supplementary Figure&#160;1). Additionally, clear recombinations proximal (haplotype 2.2) and distal (haplotypes 2.3 and 2.4) to <italic>Tsc2</italic> delimited the target region to a 1921-kb region between 231.063 Mbp (TraesCS2B01G046400) and 250.180 Mbp (TraesCS2B01G051000) in the AM panel. All three of the most significant SNPs identified by GWAS (&#8722;log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;52.63; BS00070050_51, BS00072620_51 and BS00075303_51) originated from gene model TraesCS2B01G048500, and all three cosegregate on the &#8216;NIAB Elite MAGIC&#8217; genetic map at 34.38&#160;cM. Additionally, BS00070050_51 was also identified as the marker immediately proximal to the <italic>Tsc2</italic> QTL peak in the MAGIC IM and CIM analyses. In the AM panel, this SNP perfectly predicts sensitivity to ToxB, with alleles A:A and G:G diagnostic for sensitivity (score&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1) and insensitivity (score&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.6), respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Supplementary Table 2). When GWAS was repeated using the <italic>Tsc2</italic>-lined marker BS00070050_51 as a cofactor, no additional significant associations were found.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of allele scores at the <italic>Tsc2</italic>-linked SNP marker BS00072620_51 with the number of varieties in the AM panel found to have low and high ToxB sensitivity (sensitivity scores&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1 and&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;3, respectively)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">BS00072620_51 genotype</th><th align="left">ToxB sensitivity&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1</th><th align="left">ToxB sensitivity&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1</th><th align="left">Totals</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">A:A</td><td char="." align="char">442</td><td char="." align="char">0</td><td char="." align="char">442</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B:B</td><td char="." align="char">0</td><td char="." align="char">38</td><td char="." align="char">38</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td char="." align="char">442</td><td char="." align="char">38</td><td char="." align="char">480</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The 480 accessions used represent those with both genotype and phenotype data</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

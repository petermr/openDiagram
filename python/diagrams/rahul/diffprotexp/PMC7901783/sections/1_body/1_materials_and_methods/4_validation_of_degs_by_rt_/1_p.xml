<p>To validate RNASeq results, nine significant DEGs were randomly selected to conduct quantitative RT-PCR on total RNA samples used for RNASeq experiment. To target each gene, two random samples were selected as template: one from mock-inoculated and one from virus-inoculated sample. For each sample, two technical replicates were used. Primers were designed by Primer3 software (

Total RNA was primed by random hexamer and reverse transcribed using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instruction. The cDNA synthesis was carried out on Eppendorf Mastercycler Nexus Thermal Cycler (Hamburg, Germany). The PCR reaction was conducted in a final volume of 10μl [1 μl cDNA, 0.4 μl of each primer (10 μM), 3.2 μl RNase/DNase-free water, and 5 μl PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA)]. The amplification conditions were 2min at 50°C for UDG activation, initial denaturation of 2min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1min. The qPCR was performed by QuantStudio™ 6 Flex Real-Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Elongation Factor 1α (CqEF1α)(XM_021888526.1) was considered as the reference gene for normalization of gene expression. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2

<p>However, several recent studies emphasized the importance of the synergy between Co and Fe species in ensuring high OER activity of the Co–Fe catalysts. EXAFS measurements for CoOOH nanosheets arrays suggested the incorporation of Fe-species within the CoOOH material,

 </sup> and systematic changes in the Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra with increasing Co to Fe ratio in layered double hydroxide catalysts were observed, suggesting a strong interaction between the Fe and Co species.

 </sup> A recent study also demonstrated that similar structural transformations take place in Co–Fe layered double hydroxide catalysts under OER conditions as in Ni–Fe catalysts, and DFT simulations revealed that Co–O–Fe centers in Co–Fe catalysts provide similar stabilization of OER intermediates as Ni–O–Fe centers in the Ni–Fe catalysts.

 </sup> For Co–Fe catalysts with spinel-like structure, Smith et al. proposed an interesting model with multiple active sites, where the incorporation of Fe played a dual role.

 </sup> First, in the as-prepared samples the addition of Fe affected the oxidation state of Co, with the average oxidation state of the Co species being reduced (becoming closer to 2+) with increasing Fe concentration. Under OER conditions, the Co

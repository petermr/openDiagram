<p>The biexponential fitting curve gives a more accurate estimate of the relaxation time associated with the water reorientation process because it removes the contribution from the water librational dynamics. It is also important to note that the single‐water relaxation times computed from the integration of the first‐order Legendre polynomial‐time correlation functions cannot be directly compared with reorientation times obtained experimentally using DRS. To realize such comparison the TCF of the 
 <italic>total</italic> system dipole correlation should be considered by computing the auto‐ and cross‐correlation terms, as done by Sega and Schroder,

 <italic>without</italic> CIPs have very similar water reorientation behaviour (Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A), whereas significant differences can be observed in the solutions 
 <italic>with</italic> CIPs (Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). The correlation function

 <sub>1</sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>) is, therefore, sensitive to solution speciation and could provide insights into the cooperative effect of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> ions on the water dipole reorientation dynamics. In the next section, changes compared to bulk behavior will be used to determine the hydration numbers of aqueous MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solutions as a function of concentration.

0: After drying the plant material, the essential oil has been obtained by steam distillation using a Clevengertype apparatus (Clevenger,  1928).
1: The heating temperature was fixed at 100C, which allowed a constant flow of condensation.
2: Each time, 300 g of vegetable material, consisting either of roots or stems, leaves, and young flowers was placed in a flask with 500 ml of water and subjected to distillation for 3 hr.
3: The organic phase from the distillation was separated from the aqueous phase by extraction with diethyl ether.
4: The organic phase obtained was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove traces of water, and the essential oil was recovered after the evaporation of the diethyl ether on a rotary evaporator.
5: The samples of essential oil were stored in a refrigerator before submitting them to GCFID and GCMS analysis.

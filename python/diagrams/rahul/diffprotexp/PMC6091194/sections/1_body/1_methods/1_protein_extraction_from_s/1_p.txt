0: The experiments described herein were approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, as set forth under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.
1: To obtain enough protein for analysis, cochleae were isolated from 16 P3, P14, and P30 CBA/J mice.
2: In addition, three biological replicates were prepared for each age group.
3: All dissections were accomplished in cooled PBS, while maintaining the dissecting dish on ice.
4: To extract a cochlea, the tympanic bulla was excised after which the bone, ligament, and stria vascularis was removed, isolating the sensory epithelium along with the modiolus.
5: The modiolus was kept intact, initially, since this method provided an intact extraction of the sensory epithelium.
6: Three biological replicates from each age group were prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis.
7: In each experiment, the cochlear sensory epithelium was washed gently 3 in 1X PBS, centrifuged for 3 min at 1000  g, and the supernatant removed.
8: These washes allowed for the removal of the modiolus prior to detergent treatment.
9: Cochlear sensory epithelia were sonicated in lysis buffer containing 4% ( w/ v) SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 500 g/mL AEBSF, 10 g/mL leupeptin, 100 g/mL pepstatin, 2 g/mL aprotinin, and 1 mg/mL microcystin using a sonic dismembrator (Model 100; Thermo Fisher).
10: The extract was incubated on ice for 30 min, then heated at 95 C for 4 min, followed by centrifugation at 16000  g at 4 C for 15 min.
11: The supernatant was removed and the pellet extracted in lysis buffer.
12: Both lysates were combined, then centrifuged at 20800  g at 4 C for 60 min.
13: The supernatant was retained for digestion and analysis.

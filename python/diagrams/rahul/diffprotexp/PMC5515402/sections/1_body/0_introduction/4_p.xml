 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, we used two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) in combination with mass spectrometry and western blotting to profile the proteome of GnRH neurons. We hypothesized that 17Î±-meT will modulate the expression of proteins associated with neuroendocrine regulation, synaptic plasticity, and cellular stress; key biological processes that might impact reproductive competence and integrity.

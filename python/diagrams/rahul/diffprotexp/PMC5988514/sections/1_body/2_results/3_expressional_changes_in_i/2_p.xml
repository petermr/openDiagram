<p id="par0095">CV-PTC and FV-PTC samples shared dysregulation of evolutionary conserved Ras GTPase-activating-like proteins (IQGAPs) (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). IQGAP1 was found at increased levels in CV-PTC (fc ≥ 2), while the expression of this protein was not changed in benign and FV-PTC lesions. On the other hand, IQGAP2 protein was one of the two proteins that showed increased expression in FV-PTC lesions (fc ≥ 2) and statistically significant decreased expression in CV-PTC, suggesting different mechanism of actions of these scaffold proteins in thyroid tumor biology.

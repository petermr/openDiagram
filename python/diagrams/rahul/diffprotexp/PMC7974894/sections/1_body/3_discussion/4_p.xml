<p>Although SLC20A1, also named PiT-1, is not annotated in KEGG database, a recent study also identified SLC20A1 as a marker of tumor cell metabolism 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. As one of the 
 <italic>SLC20</italic> family members, SLC20A1 functioned as sodium-driven inorganic phosphate transporter, which consists of the basic tumor cell metabolite transporters among glucose, glutamine and inorganic phosphate 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. Several studies suggest that SLC20A1 are upregulated in tumor cells and have been considered to be important promoters of tumor progression 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. Beyond the Pi transport, SLC20A1 was also demonstrated for function in tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. These reports not only indicated the potential role of SLC20A1 in the tongue cancer metabolism, but also supported the undiscovered oncogenic role SLC20A1 in tongue cancer progression.

<p id="Par13">Approximately 368.70 million raw reads were generated by Illumina paired-end transcriptome sequencing and used for the downstream analysis. After the quality control, on an average 95.66% of clean reads (high quality reads having Phred score &gt; q30) were obtained. The high-quality RNA-seq reads were de novo assembled into transcripts using Trinity, as no reference genome sequence is available for 
 <italic>Urochondra setulosa</italic>. The transcriptome coverage efficiency was assessed, in absence of reference genome, by relating the unique genes with the closest available transcriptome in de novo sequencing

 </sup>. The trinity assembly of high quality reads resulted in 165,794 transcripts, further clustering resulted in 120,231 transcripts (in all treatments) with an average contig length of 1259 bp and N50 of 1819 bp for 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic> samples (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Since the shorter sequences may lack a characterized protein domain or may be too short to show sequence matches, resulting in false negative results, the contigs which were less than 300 bp in length were excluded (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As a whole, a total of 96.79 million, 91.76 million, 90.05 million and 90.09 million raw reads were obtained from the control and salt treated transcriptome libraries of 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). More than 94% high-quality reads (clean reads) were obtained for each group and used for downstream analyses.

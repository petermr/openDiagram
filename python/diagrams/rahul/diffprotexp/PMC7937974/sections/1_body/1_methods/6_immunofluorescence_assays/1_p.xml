<p>HCAECs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and sealed with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (1:500 dilutions, Beyotime) was used to detect rabbit anti-E-selectin (1:200 dilutions, CST, Danvers, USA). Dil (Beyotime) was used for cell membrane labeling. Here, 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Keygen) was used for nucleus labeling. Fluorescence was measured by confocal microscopy. The NIS Element Viewer statistical software was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity.</p>

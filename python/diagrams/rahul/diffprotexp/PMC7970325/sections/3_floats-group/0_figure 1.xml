  <p>Differential expression of previously reported marker genes in different thyroid tumor types. Genes 
   <italic>SERPINA1, TACSTD2, LAMB3</italic> were reported as the markers upregulated in PC; genes 
   <italic>ACVRL1, PLVAP, TFF3</italic> and 
   <italic>CPQ</italic> were reported as the markers upregulated in FA. Each box shows gene expression distribution in each group, the ends of the box are the upper and lower quartiles, median in shown by horizontal line inside the boxes, whiskers extend from the upper and lower hinges of the boxes towards the highest and lowest values, respectively, at most 1.5 ∗ interquartile range of box. A black point corresponds to a tissue sample. Expression counts were processed as reads per million (RPM).

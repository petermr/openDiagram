<p id="Par16">There are several interesting findings about the selected genes reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. First, the channel genes with the highest average expression levels in all chambers are subunits of the voltage-dependent calcium channels: the main subunit of T-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel 
 <italic>Cacna1h</italic> (20 in LA) and the auxiliary subunits of L-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels 
 <italic>Cacna2d2</italic> (48 in RA), and 
 <italic>Cacna2d1</italic> (41 in LV and 49 in RV). This observation reveals the importance of ion channel density in controlling the heart rhythm

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, out of all quantified 199 ICT genes, the largest AVE were for

 <italic>Kctd14</italic> (1075 in LA, 825 in RA, 834 in LV, 825 in RA).

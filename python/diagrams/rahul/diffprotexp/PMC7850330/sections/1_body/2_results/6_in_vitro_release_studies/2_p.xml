<p>This study was carried out to assess the release rate of loratadine and sulpiride from the selected nanoemulsions F2 and F3 in comparison to the raw drugs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). The release of both drugs was enhanced from the investigated nanoemulsions displaying significantly higher values relative to those of the raw drugs (F
 <sub>2</sub>&lt;50). The percentage amounts loratadine and sulpiride released after half an hour were 52.3%±.16 and 30%±0.3 from F2 or 58%±3 and 30%±2 from F3 respectively. On the other hand, the corresponding raw drugs showed 7%±1 and 6%±0.5 respectively at the same time interval. At the end of 8
 <bold> </bold>hours, the percentage amounts loratadine and sulpiride released were 98%±2 and 93%±0.1 from F2 or 95%±1.5 and 91%±2 from F3 while the raw drugs displayed 35%±0.1 and 30%±0.3 respectively. The difference between the release of loratadine and sulpiride from F2 and F3 was insignificant (F
 <sub>2</sub>&gt;50). 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the correlation coefficient (r) and release exponent (n) for the selected nanoemulsions (F2, F3). It is clear that the Higuchi’s diffusion and Baker–Lonsdale models had the highest correlation coefficient (r). Therefore, the release data of loratadine and sulpiride from the selected formulations was best fit to both models.

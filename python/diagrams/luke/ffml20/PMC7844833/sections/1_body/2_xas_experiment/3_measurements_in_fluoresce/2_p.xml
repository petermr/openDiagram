 </xref>, the fluorescence intensity emitted by the sample absorbing the X-rays (total fluorescence yield) can be often considered proportional to the absorption coefficient. Some notable exceptions are known. For example, the fluorescence signal at the L
 <sub>2,3</sub> edges of 3d transition metals does not follow this rule due to the dominance of distinct decay channels in the total fluorescence signal.

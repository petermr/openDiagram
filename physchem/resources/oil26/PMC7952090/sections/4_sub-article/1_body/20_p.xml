<p>We acknowledge that there may be “ghost” duplication events, ie., genes that duplicated in, for example, the Tethytherian stem-lineage that are maintained in the Stellar’s sea cow genome and lost in the manatee genome; This will be reconstructed as a Proboscidean-specific gene duplication. Without genomes from multiple extinct Sirenian and Hyracoidea lineages we are not able to differentiate these alternate duplication histories. We have added a note to our Materials and methods section “Reconstruction of Ancestral Copy Numbers” to ensure this limitation of the method is clear.</p>

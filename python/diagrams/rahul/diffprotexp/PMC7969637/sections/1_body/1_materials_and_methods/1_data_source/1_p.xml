<p>This study utilized the mRNA chip data in the GEO database, and the samples were from data sets numbered GSE26440, GSE26378, and GSE66099. GSE26440 included 98 whole blood samples of septic children and 32 whole blood samples of healthy children; GSE26378 included 82 whole blood samples of septic children and 21 whole blood samples of healthy children; GSE66099 included 229 whole blood samples of septic children and 47 whole blood samples of healthy children. The whole genome expression profiles of the above samples were detected by Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array chip platform.</p>

0: The lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid, and loaded into a nanoViper C18 trap column (3 m, 100 A).
1: The online chromatographic separation was performed on Thermo Scientific Easy-nLC 1200 system.
2: Post trapped and desalted with 100% solution A (0.1% formic acid), the peptides were separated with solution B (80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) elution gradient from 8 to 38% in 50 min on an analytical column (50 m  150 mm, 3 m C18 100 A).
3: Mass spectrometry (MS) experiment was performed on a ThermoFisher Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer fitted with a Nano Flex ion source.
4: The MS was operated using an ion spray voltage of 1.9 kV and an interface heater temperature of 275 C. A data-dependent acquisition mode with full MS scans was used to acquire tandem MS data.
5: MS1 spectra were acquired in the  m/ z range of 3501200, and MS2 spectra were acquired in the  m/ z range of 1101200.
6: The acquisition survey scans of 250 ms were followed by up to 14 product ion scans of 50 ms.
7: The MS spectra with charge state 2 and above were selected for fragmentation by higher-energy collision dissociation.
8: The dynamic exclusion time was set for 25 s.

 <sup>–1</sup> diminishes on decreasing the methanol loading from 8 to 2 molecules per acidic site, and with no indication of such bands for the lowest methanol loading of 1 molecule per acidic site. To verify this, the difference spectra derived from the earliest measurement and at a later stage of the reaction are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>. It is clear that the bands assignable to methoxy species emerge at 2980 and 2876 cm

 <xref rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,

 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and is in line with earlier infrared and NMR reports.

 <sup>–1</sup>, and 2973 and 2865 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> diminishes on decreasing the methanol loading from 8 molecules per acidic site to 2 and no bands attributable methoxy species are present for the lowest methanol load of 1 molecule per acidic site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting the occurrence of loading dependent room temperature methoxylation. This conclusion is further corroborated by the evolution of the methyl rock band of methoxy species at 1180 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (

 <caption> Expression of carrot coding and noncoding RNAs. ( A) PCA analysis of the global gene expression of the 12 evaluated libraries (three replicates for each color-phenotype and tissue type combination). ( B) Differentially expressed genes (up- and down-regulated) between purple and orange carrots (Bonferroni’s adjusted p value &lt; 0.01) distributed by coding and noncoding transcripts. </caption>

 <p>To investigate novel biomarker for diagnosis of cervical cancer, we analysed the datasets in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and confirmed the candidate biomarker in patient sample. And we found the good repeatability and consistency of KRT17 and CRISP2, they may be good candidate biomarkers. Combined analysis of KRT17, CRISP2 expression at both genetic and protein levels can determine different histological grades of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Such combined analysis is capable of improving diagnostic accuracy of cervical cancer.

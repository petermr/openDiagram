  <p>Normalized spectral counts (means ± SE; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) of differentially expressed linear alkane oxidation proteins during growth on a linear alkane (

   <sub>14</sub>/C14) a non‐hydrocarbon control (Pyruvate/PYR) and a branched alkane (Pristane/PRI) in 
   <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> SK2
   <sup>T</sup>; treatments not sharing a letter (
   <italic>a</italic> or 
   <italic>b</italic>) differ at 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (Tukey's HSD). Two different alkane oxidation systems were detected.
  </p>
  <p>A. 1. Cytochrome P450 introduces oxygen into the alkane at the terminal carbon converting it into a primary alcohol. 2. AlkJ2 further oxidizes the primary alcohol generated into an aldehyde. 3. Ferredoxin reductase oxidizes NADH to NAD
   <sup>+</sup> shuttling electrons (e
   <sup>−</sup>) to the P450 through a ferredoxin.
  </p>
  <p>B. 4/5. Monooxygenases introduce oxygen into the alkane at the terminal carbon converting it into a primary alcohol. 6. AlkJ2 further oxidizes the primary alcohol generated into an aldehyde. 7. Aldehyde dehydrogenase converts the aldehyde into a fatty acid, which enters β‐oxidation. 8. Aldehyde reductase also converts the aldehyde into a fatty acid, which enters β‐oxidation. 9. Rubredoxin reductase oxidizes NADH to NAD
   <sup>+</sup> shuttling electrons (e
   <sup>−</sup>) to the monooxygenase through a rubredoxin.

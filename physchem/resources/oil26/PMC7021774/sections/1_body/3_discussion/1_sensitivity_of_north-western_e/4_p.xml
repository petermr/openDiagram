<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par27">Although neither of the two tetraploid wheat accessions screened here were sensitive to ToxB, the <italic>Tsc2</italic>-ToxB interaction has previously been reported in <italic>T. durum</italic>. This was first shown in the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) hexaploid wheat bi-parental mapping population, in which ToxB sensitivity is conferred by the synthetic hexaploid wheat line &#8216;W7984&#8217; (Friesen and Faris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). As &#8216;W7984&#8217; was developed from a cross between <italic>T. durum</italic> variety &#8216;Altar 84&#8217; (the AB sub-genome donor) and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> accession &#8216;CI 18&#8217; (D sub-genome donor), the ToxB sensitivity on chromosome 2BS identified in the ITMI population must have originated from <italic>T. durum</italic>. More recently, QTL analysis of ToxB sensitivity and <italic>Ptr</italic> race 5 isolates in an &#8216;Altar&#8217;&#160;&#215;&#160;&#8216;Langdon&#8217; durum population has demonstrated the role of ToxB sensitivity conferred by the <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus with tan spot susceptibility in <italic>T. durum</italic> (Virdi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2016</xref>).</p>

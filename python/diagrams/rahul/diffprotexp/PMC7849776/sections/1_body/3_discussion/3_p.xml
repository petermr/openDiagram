<p>Staphyloxanthin, the yellow pigment, has been shown to have roles in protecting 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> against reactive oxygen species in the host [
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The loss of yellow pigment in the absence of the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene suggests that YjbH exerts oxidative stress resistance by regulating staphyloxanthin production. Based on the effect of YjbH on other oxidative stress-related genes, it is evident that YjbH plays a role in providing oxidative stress tolerance to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which is an important defense mechanism against host immunity. This function was further verified by our in vivo oxidative stress model using silkworm, where an ROS scavenger was able to rescue 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> against host-immunity and increased the virulence of 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn.

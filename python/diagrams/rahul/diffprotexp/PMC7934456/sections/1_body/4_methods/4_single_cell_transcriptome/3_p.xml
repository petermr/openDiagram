<p id="Par46">The single-cell samples were collected in tubes containing lysis components and ribonuclease inhibitors. Amplification was then performed by using the Smart-Seq2 method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. An Oligo-dT primer was introduced to the reverse transcription reaction for first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by PCR amplification to enrich the cDNA and a magnetic bead purification step to clean up the synthesized material. Next, the cDNA product was checked by a Qubit® 3.0 Fluorometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to ensure the expected output of length approximately 1–2 kbp. Subsequently, cDNA was sheared randomly by ultrasonic waves for Illumina library preparation, including DNA fragmentation, end-repair, 3′ end A-tailing, adapter ligation, PCR amplification, and library validation. PerkinElmer LabChip® GX Touch and Step OnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System were introduced for library quality inspection after library preparation. Qualified libraries were then loaded on the Illumina Hiseq platform for PE150 sequencing.

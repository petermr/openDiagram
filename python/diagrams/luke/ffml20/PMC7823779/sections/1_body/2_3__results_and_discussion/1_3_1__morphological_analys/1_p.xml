<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b, more wrinkles and bends exist on the surface of NGO than GO. The integrity of the graphene lattice may be damaged by the nitrification process. These uneven surfaces are able to expand contact area with other materials, beneficial to heat transformation. The uneven surface is also shown in TEM images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). The high-resolution image of the edges of NGO sheets indicates that the NGO sheet has only two layers. In AFM images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f004">Figure 4</xref>d), we measure the thickness of the NGO sheet, which is around 1.1 nm. Thirty samples are counted for thickness and the values are all the multiple of 1.0â€“1.1 nm. Only three samples were given over five layers, which could prove low power stripping for a long time could exfoliate graphene materials well.

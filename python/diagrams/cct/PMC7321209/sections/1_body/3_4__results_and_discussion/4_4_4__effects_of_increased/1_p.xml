<p>In wire arc additive manufacturing, the adjustment of energy input affects the cooling conditions and moreover metallurgical properties of the metallic work piece. Though, microstructure and mechanical properties can be influenced. A common approach to characterize un- and low-alloyed steel during welding is the estimation of the t
 <sub>8/5</sub>-time according to DIN EN 1011-2:2001-05 [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This describes the time interval of cooling of the weld bead and the heat-affected zone (HAZ) from 800 to 500 °C. In this temperature range, phase transformations from γ- to α-phase take place, which are decisive for the mechanical-technological properties. Therefore, a continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram can be used to estimate microstructure and mechanical properties in dependence on the chemical composition and occurring cooling rates. Since no diagram of the applied filler material is available from the manufacturer, a CCT-diagram of steel with a chemical composition as similar as possible was used.

Though, minor deviations in silicon and manganese content of approximately 0.3% can be seen. Due to this, slight deviations in phase proportions and hardness in comparison to the used filler wire G4Si1/SG3 may occur.

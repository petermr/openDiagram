  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Over the past 200 years, these animals have suffered from habitat destruction and alteration such as river channelization and impoundment, overharvesting, pollution, invasive species, and the more recent enigmatic declines

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Approximately two thirds of the 300 species found in the United States and Canada are now classified as endangered, threatened, or vulnerable, and 10% have become extinct
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. As numbers of freshwater mussels continue to decline, conservation efforts have increased in order to protect existing populations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. Many of these efforts involve translocating mussels to other habitats or into captivity in propagation and research facilities. In the United States, over a dozen federal and state facilities, zoos, and aquariums specialize in freshwater mussel propagation as recommended in species recovery and conservation plans

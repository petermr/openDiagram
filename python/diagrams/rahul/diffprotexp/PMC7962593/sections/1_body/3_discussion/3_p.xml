<p>Consistent with our KEGG enrichment results, HIF-1α contributes to the pathogenic role of macrophages in sepsis.
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> HIF-1α promotes the expression of multiple gene products, including enzymes that promote glycolysis.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Some studies consider HIF as a potential biomarker of sepsis, but this remains controversial.
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) contributes to sepsis immunosuppression by increasing apoptosis.
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> TNF-α levels in plasma increase progressively as sepsis progresses, with the highest values found in patients with septic shock. This finding supports a prognostic biomarker role for this cytokine.
 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Th17 cytokine production is reduced in sepsis, which may adversely affect long-term mortality.
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Treatment with IL-7 increases the responsiveness of Th17 cells and reduces the mortality of secondary fungal infections, making IL-17 a potential therapeutic agent.
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> A ratio of Th2 to Th1 cells are clearly up-regulated in severe sepsis patients, and their continuous dynamic elevation is associated with acquired infection and 28-day mortality in the intensive care unit.

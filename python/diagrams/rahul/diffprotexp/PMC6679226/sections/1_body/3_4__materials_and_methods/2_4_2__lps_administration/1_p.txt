0: For I.T.
1: instillation of LPS ( Escherichia coli O111:B4; List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA, USA), mice ( n = 6) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (150/10 mg/kg) and intubated with a 22G catheter (EXEL International, Los Angeles, CA, USA) using the Biolite mouse intubation kit (BioTex, Houston, TX, USA).
2: LPS reconstituted in sterile saline at 0.05 mg/mL was administered into the lungs through the 22G catheter at a final dosage of 0.1 mg/kg.
3: For I.P.
4: administration, LPS at 1 mg/mL in sterile saline was injected I.P.
5: to achieve a final dosage of 5 mg/kg ( n = 6).
6: Mice receiving vehicle (sterile saline) alone I.T.
7: ( n = 3) or I.P.
8: ( n = 3) were used as the controls.
9: In addition, another cohort of mice was treated with I.P.
10: saline ( n = 3, 48 h) or I.P.
11: LPS (5 mg/kg,  n = 9) and sacrificed at different time points following treatment (24, 48 and 72 h,  n = 3 per time point).

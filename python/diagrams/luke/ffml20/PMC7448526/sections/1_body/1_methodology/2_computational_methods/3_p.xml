<p>Vibrational frequencies were calculated using ChemShell, with a task-farmed finite-difference approach,
 <xref rid="cit40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> allowing us to confirm that geometries correspond to local minima.

 <xref rid="cit55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> For the vibrational frequency calculations, the adsorbate, active site and second neighbouring framework atoms were displaced; comparison of this approximation against the displacement of all atoms in the QM region shows no differences, as previously reported.
 <xref rid="cit56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Because our simulations aimed to calculate mainly vibrational frequencies of the CH
 <sub>3</sub> group, a scaling factor for the computed vibrational frequencies was calculated using data for the CH
 <sub>3</sub> asymmetric stretch of methanol at 93 K, which is the lowest experimental temperature reported.
 <xref rid="cit57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> The resulting scaling factors of 0.9306 and 0.9553 were used for normal and deuterated methanol, respectively. The scaling factors are well within the range previously employed of between 0.9 and 0.9614.

<p>The differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened by a standard screening criterion [
 <xref rid="B54-life-11-00177" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]: fold change &gt; 1.2-fold (up-regulated by more than 1.2-fold or down-regulated by less than 0.83-fold) and p-value &lt; 0.05. The comparison of CK-04 vs. CK-0 group (effect of Al stress on masson pine seedlings without inoculation) showed 215 DEPs, including 137 up-regulated and 78 down-regulated proteins in CK-04 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-11-00177-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) showed that these DEPs were mainly involved in small molecule metabolic process, catalytic activity, and ion binding. The functions of these proteins were identified as catalytic activity, binding, structural molecule activity, transporter activity, and antioxidant activity.

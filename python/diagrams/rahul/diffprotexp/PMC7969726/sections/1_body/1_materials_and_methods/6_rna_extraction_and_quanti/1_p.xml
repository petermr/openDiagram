<p>Total RNA was isolated from fresh tissues and cell lines, and purified using TRIzol reagent (BIOO Scientific Co., Austin, TX, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using standard procedures with a Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Vazyme Biotech) was performed in 96-well plates. The mRNA levels were normalized to the expression of 18S mRNA. For APA validation, we used percentage of distal polyadenylation site usage index (PDUI) value by analyzing PDUI = long 3′UTR transcript/total transcript. For AS validation, we used percent spliced-in (PSI) value by analyzing PSI = skipping exon (SE) transcript/total transcript. Sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for each transcript are listed in

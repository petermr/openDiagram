 <caption> CircRAB11FIP1-induced autophagy enhanced ovarian cancer cell growth and migration. A– C LV2-1, LV2-NC, LV2-1 + PCMV5-ATG7, or LV2-1 + PCMV5-ATG5 was transfected into SKOV3 cells. Cell proliferation and migration were examined 48 h later. D– F LV6, LV6-NC, LV6 + ATG7 siRNA, or LV6 + ATG5 siRNA was transfected into A2780 cells for 48 h. Then, cell proliferation and migration were examined. Error bar stands for standard error. * P &lt; 0.05. Scale bar = 100 µm. </caption>

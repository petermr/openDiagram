0: The first description of the chemical profile of the essential oils from different parts (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers) showed that the oils from the aerial parts were mainly rich in  pmenthadienol isomers, and the main ones are  cis and  transpmentha1(7),8dien2ol,  cis and  transpmentha2,8dien1ol.
1: The essential oil of the roots is rather rich in sesquiterpene compounds, and aristolone, with a content of approximately 40%, is the major compound.
2: (Silou, Loubaki, Figueredo, & Chalchat,  2006).
3: Studies of the essential oils of species of the genus  Elyonurus are very limited; however, it appears that  Elyonurus hensii is the only species of the genus that is rich in  pmenthadienol isomers.
4: However, these isomers are present at significant contents in the oils of  Cymbopogon giganteus and  Cymbopogon densiflorus.
5: Indeed, the essential oil of  Cymbopogon giganteus from the Ivory Coast is characterized by high contents of  cis and  transpmentha2,8dien1ol (8.7% and 18,4%, respectively) and  cis and  transpmentha1(7),8dien2ol (16% and 15.7%, respectively), and this oil presents antimicrobial properties (Boti et al.,  2006).
6: Moreover, the antimicrobial properties were also observed on the essential oil of  Cymbopogon giganteus from Burkina Faso (Menut et al.,  2000), Cameroon (Jirovetz, Buchbauer, Eller, Ngassoum, & Maponmetsem,  2007), Benin (Ayedoun, Sohounhloue, Menut, Lamaty, & Bessiere,  1999), and Mali (Sidibe, Chalchat, Garry, & Hamara,  2001); these species produce essential oils rich in  pmenthadienol isomers.
7: The essential oil from the flowers and leaves of  Cymbopogon densiflorus of Zambia is also rich in  pmenthadienol isomers, and it contains 22.4%  transpmentha2,8dien1ol and 11.1%  cispmentha1(7),8dien2ol.
8: The oil of the Brazilian plant presents a similar composition (Boelens,  1994; Chisowa,  1997).
9: The literature reports several uses of  Cymbopogon densiflorus: the crushed leaves are used as a treatment for rheumatism in Gabon, the flower head is smoked in a pipe as a cure for bronchial affections in Malawi, and the plant sap is used in the CongoBrazzaville, where it is also given as a treatment for asthma and to calm fits (Akhila,  2010).
10: Manifestly, the essential oil of  Cymbopogon densiflorus exhibits biological activities.
11: The massive presence of  pmenthadienol isomers in the essential oil of  Elyonurus hensii points also to possible antimicrobial properties.
12: Aristolone is also an interesting constituent since it is likely to induce an antalgic activity (TianShung, Amooru, Damu, & Kuo,  2004).

<p>We grew six human and six chimpanzee Epstein-Barr virus-transformed LCLs in glutamine-depleted RPMI (RPMI 1640 1× from Corning [15–040 CM]), completed with 20% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMax (Gibco [35050–061]), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. We cultured all cells at 37°C at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. We passaged each cell line a minimum of three times, then maintained cells at 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL in preparation for collection. Cell line numbers and details can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. The human lines were derived from Yoruba individuals collected as part of the HapMap project and can be ordered through the Coriell Institute (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">International HapMap Consortium, 2005</xref>). The sample IDs and Research Resource Identifiers for the human cell lines are the following: NA18498: CVCL_P466, NA18499: CVCL_P457, NA18502: CVCL_P459, NA18504: CVCL_P460, NA18510: CVCL_P461, NA18523: CVCL_P468. Chimpanzee LCLs were originally transformed from individuals from the New Iberia Research Center (University of Louisiana at Lafayette), Coriell IPBR repository and Arizona State University (

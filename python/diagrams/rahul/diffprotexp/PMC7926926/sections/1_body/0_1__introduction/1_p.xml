 <italic>Pinus massoniana</italic> Lamb., also known as masson pine, is native to South China and a pioneer species in the forest chain dominating the subtropical areas of East Asia [
 <xref rid="B1-life-11-00177" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Salient features, including resistance to environmental stress, ability to grow in marginal soils, and tolerance to metal contaminated soils, have enabled this species to be highly used for afforestation and reforestation in China [

 <xref rid="B3-life-11-00177" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. massoniana</italic> accounts for 7.74% of the total arborical forest zone in China [
 <xref rid="B4-life-11-00177" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Masson pine has been widely adopted for its timber and pulp due to the fast-growing habit and the high yield advantages [
 <xref rid="B5-life-11-00177" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Besides its economic importance, the afforestation of this species has potentially contributed to improve the ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration [

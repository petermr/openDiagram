<p>We used mutual information to measure similarity and co-expression networks (RC-miR) based on adjacency matrices for the differentially expressed miRNAs. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f004">Figure 4</xref>d, in cells exposed to 5-Brd-2â€²-dU, 9 clusters of miRNAs were identified, two of them over-expressed (miR-129-3p, miR-99b-5p, miR-378-3p, and miR-30d-5p) and (miR-129-5p, miR-21a-5p, and miR-335-3p), which according to TargetScan would have as a common target the factor 
 <italic>E2F2</italic>; the cluster miR-455-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-335-5p on 
 <italic>p21</italic> and the cluster miR-29c-3p and let-7e-5p on 
 <italic>Ccnd1</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). While for under-expressed miRNAs, we found the cluster let-7a-5p and let-7b-5p that would have as a putative target

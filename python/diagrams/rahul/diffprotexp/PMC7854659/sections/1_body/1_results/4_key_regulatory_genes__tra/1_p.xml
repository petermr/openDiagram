 </sup>, were used to identify TFs potentially modulating the expression of DEG and TS genes. Based on those metrics, we identified 129, 119, and 90 TFs for liver, muscle, and cerebrum tissues, respectively, grouped into 52 families (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01). Shared TFs were identified between cerebrum and muscle (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), muscle and liver (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8), and liver and cerebrum (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7). The 
 <italic>HOXA4</italic> (
 <italic>z-score</italic> =  − 6.88), 
 <italic>ZBTB33</italic> (
 <italic>z-score</italic> =  − 4.37), and 
 <italic>GATA1</italic> (
 <italic>z-score</italic> =  − 3.85) genes showed the most extreme value for RIF1 in liver, muscle, and cerebrum, respectively. A list of all RIF1 and RIF2 significant TFs is presented in Tables

  <p>Network of differentially expressed proteins in KD with CAD and CAA. (A) Network based on functionally-enriched KEGG pathways. The proteins in the network were differentially expressed proteins in the present study. (B) Network associated with the variations within patients with KD and CAD/CAA. CFH (yellow cluster), MBL2 (pink cluster), KNG1 (grey cluster), FN1 (green cluster) and SERPINC1 (green cluster) were identified as primary candidates involved in CAA and CAD (presented as bigger nodes with red circles). P&lt;0.05 was a threshold for KEGG pathway enrichment. KD, Kawasaki disease; CAA, coronary artery aneurism; CAD, coronary artery dilation; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; FN1, fibronectin 1; CFH, complement factor; KNG1, kininogen 1; MBL2, mannose binding lectin 2; SERPINC1, serpin family C member 1; FDR, false discovery rate.</p>

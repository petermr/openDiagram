Among these proteins, 27 were predicted to be secreted, and 59 were intracellular or membrane proteins. Most of the secretory proteins (70.4%) were decreased in metastasized liver perfusates. The main canonical ingenuity pathway to which these secretory proteins belonged was acute phase response, which indicated that the liver-associated immune reaction was damaged by the metastasis. In contrast, most of the intracellular or membrane proteins (86.4%) exhibited higher relative abundances in the metastasized liver perfusates. Some of these proteins, including Rpl21, Atic, Eif3s2, Echs1, Eps15 and Ywhab, have previously been reported to be involved in cancer genesis and progression. As a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, Ywhab plays a key role in cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation and has been reported to be involved in the development of breast cancer. Its abundance was elevated by 3.5-fold in the metastasized perfusates.

Because most biomarkers used in the clinical setting are not satisfactory due to their limited specificity and sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], an enormous effort has been made to screen and characterize new disease biomarkers during the past several decades. Recently, advances in proteomic technology, with high-throughput as its characteristics, have presented new possibilities to detect disease biomarkers.</p><p>Two strategies are routinely employed in current proteomics-based approaches for biomarker discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The first characterizes differential protein expression patterns by comparing serum/plasma from animal models or patients with samples from normal controls. The second compares diseased tissues/cells with their normal counterparts. Despite the unique advantages of the first strategy, the extremely complexity of blood presents a significant challenge for the detection of useful potential biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Disease-specific proteins can be characterized relatively more easily by the second strategy. However, most of these proteins remain within the cell and do not enter the bloodstream, which makes them unavailable for measurement via routine blood assays in a clinical setting.</p><p>Perfusates contain secretory proteins, membrane proteins and intracellular proteins released by an isolated perfused organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Because perfusates pass through the same vascular systems in the organ as does the blood, in theory, perfusate proteins can easily enter into the bloodstream and be detected via routine blood assays. Additionally, the structural and functional integrity of the organ remains relatively intact during perfusion, which preserves the disease state more naturally compared to assays performed at the tissue or cellular level. Therefore, perfusates have the innate advantages in discovery of disease biomarkers. Perfusates from isolated rat hearts during reperfusion were collected after brief periods of ischemia, and some known clinical biomarkers for myocardial ischemia were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) model was first introduced by Claude Bernard in 1855. It is a widely employed physiological model for studying liver functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In our previous work, the IPRL model was combined with mass spectrometry to study the liver secretome at the organ level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the current study, perfusates were collected from rat livers metastasized by Walker-256 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Eighty-six differentially expressed perfusate proteins were identified and various important proteins related to liver metastasis were identified, which indicates the value of these perfusates for biomarker discovery. To our knowledge, there has not been a study on differential protein expression in the perfusates from metastasized organs aimed at biomarker discovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Establishment of the liver metastasis model</title><p>Metastasized cancers can form in the liver after inoculation of the spleen with cancer cells because the liver collects the blood from the spleen.

Each SCX fraction was loaded in-line onto a peptide trap and then resolved using a 0.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;mm Magic C18AQ reverse phase column (Michrom Bioresources, Inc.) with the Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent, Inc.). Separation of the peptides was performed at 500&#x000a0;nL/min and was coupled with online analysis via tandem mass spectrometry using an LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, Inc.) equipped with a Michrom nanospray ionization source (Michrom Bioresources, Inc.). The elution gradient for the reverse phase column ranged from 95% mobile phase A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 97.9% water) to 40% mobile phase B (10% water, 0.1% formic acid, 89.9% acetonitrile) over 210&#x000a0;minutes. Peptide ions were detected in a survey scan from 400&#x02013;2000&#x000a0;amu (1 &#x003bc;scan), followed by seven data-dependent MS/MS scans (1 &#x003bc;scan, isolation width of 2&#x000a0;m/z, 35% normalized collision energy, dynamic exclusion for 1&#x000a0;minute). Five technical replicate analyses were performed for each pooled perfusate sample.</p><p>All MS/MS spectra were searched against the rat IPI 3.49 protein sequence database (40,131 entries) using SEQUEST algorithm-based Bioworks 3.3.1 (Thermo Finnigan, Inc.). The search parameters were set as follows: precursor mass tolerance, &#x000b1;2.0&#x000a0;amu; fragment mass tolerance, &#x000b1;1.0&#x000a0;amu; tryptic cleavage only at lysine or arginine, with up to two missed cleavage sites allowed; and a static modification of +57&#x000a0;amu on cysteine. The search results were further processed with the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) (Institute for Systems Biology). The SEQUEST results were validated using PeptideProphet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which also calculates the probability of peptide identification. ProteinProphet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] was applied to assemble the peptides into proteins and calculate the probability of protein identification. The probability of protein identification was calculated based in part on the peptide probability and the SEQUEST Xcorr score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Only proteins identified with a probability &#x0003e;0.9 were considered for further analysis, as this cutoff resulted in a calculated false discovery rate (FDR) of approximately 1%.</p></sec><sec><title>Spectral counting</title><p>The spectral count weight (SCW, the proportion of one protein&#x02019;s spectral count compared to the total spectral count for one MS analysis) was used to estimate the relative abundance of one protein in each sample. Each of the pooled perfusate samples from the model and control rats was subject to five MS analyses, as described above. Ten sets of SCW values were obtained for every protein identified in the ten MS analyses. The SCW value was set to zero when a protein was not identified in an MS analysis. The difference between a protein&#x02019;s SCW values in the model and control groups was analyzed for statistical significance with Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test using SPSS software (version 11.5). A <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 was set as the cut-off for statistical significance.</p><p>After quantification, three selection criteria were applied to increase the credibility of protein identification and quantification. First, the proteins identified by a single peptide were excluded, regardless of how many spectra were identified. Second, for proteins showing an elevated relative abundance in the model perfusates, we required that they be identified in all five MS analyses performed in the model perfusates, and for proteins showing an elevated relative abundance in control perfusates, we required that they be identified in all five MS analyses conducted in the control perfusates. Third, we selected proteins showing fold changes&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2.5 as confidently differentially expressed proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Computational prediction of secretory proteins</title><p>SignalP 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>) was used to predict the N-terminal signal peptides for classically secreted proteins. Two algorithms in SignalP, including neural network algorithm and hidden Markov model, were employed to predict the signal peptides. We considered the proteins that were positively predicted by both algorithms to be secreted.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of differentially expressed perfusate proteins in plasma by Western blotting</title><p>A 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l aliquot of plasma collected for validation was first diluted in 1&#x000a0;mL of PBS. Then, the same volume of diluted plasma from every group was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) with a transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were first blocked in a 5% BSA/TBS solution for 1&#x000a0;h at room temperature. All antibodies were purchased from Abcam. The primary antibodies were diluted in a 1% BSA/TBS solution to the ratios indicated in the specific instructions from Abcam, and the membranes were then incubated with the antibodies overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The membranes were then incubated with the secondary antibodies, diluted 1:10,000 in a 1% BSA/TBS solution, for 2&#x000a0;h at room temperature. The protein signals were detected and quantified with the AlphaEaseFC system.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>YZ designed the whole experiment, drafted the manuscript and participated in the establishment of the metastasized model, the collection and sample preparation of liver perfusates, proteomic analysis of liver perfusates.

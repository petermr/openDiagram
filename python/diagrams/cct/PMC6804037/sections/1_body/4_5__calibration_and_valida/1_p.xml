<p>The calibration of the FEM model was achieved by comparing the micrographic cross section after the heat treatment. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f016">Figure 16</xref> displays the comparison between the simulated and experimental hardened zone for sample #8. The geometry of the hardened zone was like that achieved in the laser surface transformation hardening.

<p>AT consists of various cell types, with adipocytes as the major cell type present in mature tissues. Progenitor populations of stem cells and preadipocytes are also present. These latter cells can differentiate into various cell types, including adipocytes and its corresponding subtypes. Proliferation and differentiation of preadipocyte to mature cells continually sustain and maintain AT function. AT is present throughout the life cycle, and 50% of human subcutaneous fat cells are renewed every 8 years [
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], illustrating the necessity of dynamic adipocyte replenishment through adipogenesis. Furthermore, from a global public health perspective, dysfunction of AT is linked to chronic diseases/disorder (i.e. obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes) [

Many studies that elucidate the processes of adipogenesis have used different cell lines, such as 3T3-L1, 3T3-F442A, MSCs, murine and human adipose stem cells (ASCs), and MEFs [

 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28–34</xref>]. Some of these same models have also been used to explore transcriptomic aspects of adipogenesis [

 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50–52</xref>]. Though MEFs have been used extensively, yet little is known about the dynamics of adipogenesis at a global gene level.

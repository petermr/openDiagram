0: To explore the prognostic performance of each subtype-specific DIP, survival analyses were carried out through stratification of patients into high- and low-risk groups based on their prognostic index (PI), which is the linear component of the Cox model (PI =  1x 1 +  2x 2 +...+  px p, where  i is coefficient acquired from the Cox fitting, x i is the expression value of each gene).
1: Analyses were implemented through the SurvExpress tool [ 18] utilizing two RNA-Seq originated datasets of ccRCC with 415 samples, and pRCC with 278 samples including clinical data.
2: In addition, RNASeq originated chRCC dataset with 9 samples with clinical data retrieved from TCGA [ 11] was analyzed separately through the pipeline established in our previous study [ 8] due to the absence of any dataset related to the chRCC subtype in the SurvExpress database.
3: The signatures of survival in each risk group were estimated by KaplanMeier curves and Hazard Ratios (HR).
4: Statistical significance of each plot was evaluated by the cut-off for log-rank  p-value< 0.05.
5: Hazard ratio (HR = O 1/E 1/O 2/E 2) was calculated to discover the significance of the survival curves based on the ratio between the relative death rate in group 1 (O 1/E 1) and the relative death rate in group 2 (O 2/E 2), where O denotes the observed number of deaths, and E denotes the expected number of deaths.

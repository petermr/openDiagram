  <p>Identification of differential regulation in liver and skeletal muscle of 
   <italic>ob</italic>/
   <italic>ob</italic> mice
  </p>
  <p>(A) The number of DEPs encoded by DEGs in the liver and skeletal muscle. The IDs of proteins and genes were unified based on Ensembl protein ID. See also 
   <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref> and 
   <xref rid="mmc8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>(B) The number of metabolic enzymes among the DEPs in the liver and skeletal muscle. The IDs of proteins were unified based on Entrez.</p>
  <p>(C) The number of allosteric regulators of DEMs and metabolic enzymes regulated by those identified by the analysis using BRENDA and the number of allosteric regulations for metabolic enzymes. See also 
   <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>(D) The number of substrate or product of DEMs and metabolic enzymes regulated by those identified by the analysis using KEGG and the number of regulations by substrate or product for metabolic enzymes. See also 
   <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>.

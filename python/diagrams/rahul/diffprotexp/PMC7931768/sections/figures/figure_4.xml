  <p>An interferon (IFN)-dominant gene signature is correlated with a hallmark IFN-response protein (A) myxovirus resistance protein A (MXA) and (B) CD303
   <sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid dendritic cells demonstrated by immunoreactivity in punch biopsies. Representative photomicrographs of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MXA and CD303, bar graphs with their quantification and Spearmanâ€™s correlations between each IHC biomarker and the IFN RNA summary score. CLE-A, cutaneous lupus erythematosus-affected skin; DLE, discoid lupus erythematosus; Expt, experiment; HV, healthy volunteer; HV-U, healthy volunteer-unaffected skin; mRNA, messenger RNA; SCLE, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

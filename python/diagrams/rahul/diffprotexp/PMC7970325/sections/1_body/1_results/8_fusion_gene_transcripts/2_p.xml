<p id="p0215">We screened RNA sequencing reads for the clinically relevant hybrid transcripts with eleven oncogenes: 
 <italic>ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, BCR,</italic> and 
 <italic>ABL1</italic>. We found reads directly supporting two fusion transcripts with genes 
 <italic>ALK</italic> and 
 <italic>RET</italic>. One was in-frame fusion for well-known 
 <italic>NCOA4-RET</italic> translocation [107] (
 <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref>A), and another one was frameshift fusion of 
 <italic>ALK</italic> oncogene with a previously unknown upstream partner 
 <italic>ARHGAP12</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16</xref>A). Seventh exon of 
 <italic>NCOA4</italic> was fused with the eleventh exon of 
 <italic>RET</italic>. In turn, third exon of 
 <italic>ARHGAP12</italic> was fused with the fourth exon of 
 <italic>ALK</italic>. In both cases, exon coverage also supported fusion status for the 
 <italic>ALK</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16</xref>B) and 
 <italic>RET</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref>B) genes as the relative coverage downstream to the fusion site was higher than upstream (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B).

0: Immunofluorescence assay and plaque assay were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of IPEC-J2 cells to PEDV GDS01 infection and the kinetics of virus replication.
1: The IPEC-J2 cells were infected with the GDS01 strain and harvested at different time points.
2: After 7 hpi ( hours post-inoculation), immunofluorescence resulting from staining with a PEDV-specific monoclonal antibody was observed (Fig.
3: 1a).
4: Until 13 hpi, cytopathic effects (CPEs) caused by PEDV GDS01 infection of IPEC-J2 cells were characterized as vacuolation, formation of syncytia and fusions of the cells.
5: After infection, the virus titer declined at 7 hpi and then increased and peaked at 25 hpi, suggesting the eclipse phase of infection of the virus in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig.
6: 1b).
7: In general, these data suggest that IPEC-J2 cells are sensitive to PEDV GDS01 infection.

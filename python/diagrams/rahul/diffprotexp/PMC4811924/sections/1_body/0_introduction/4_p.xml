<p>At present, most of the available information regarding biofilm formation by drug intervention is based on transcriptomic analyses. However, a limitation of transcriptomic analysis for identifying biofilm-regulated gene network raised concerns among investigators. The method of proteomics is thought to be an essential complement to transcriptomic analysis for discovering key regulators of biofilm (Sauer, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Different immunogenic components of planktonically grown 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> proteins such as secreted or cell wall-associated proteins had been studied by using immunoproteomic assays (Zhang and Lu, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Geng et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Additionally, our lab found that quorum-sensing played a crucial role leading to biofilm formation through quantitative proteomic analysis of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilm inhibited by sub-MIC erythromycin treatment 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, there are no reports regarding the proteomic analysis of sub-MIC tylosin inhibiting biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. suis in vitro</italic>.

<p>Many efforts have been devoted to the identification of pairs of genes changing their relationships in cancer, in a “gene-specific” approach. This approach is particularly suited for the prioritisation of therapeutic targets, often defined as the genes that most strongly change their interaction pattern in cancer. Nevertheless, for ease of interpretation, often top-ranking genes are studied as an ensemble to run functional enrichment analysis, confirming the recurrence of immune-related categories for DC genes.</p>

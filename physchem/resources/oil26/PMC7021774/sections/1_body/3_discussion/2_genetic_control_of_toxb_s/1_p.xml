<p id="Par28">QTL mapping using the MAGIC and AM panels found ToxB sensitivity to be predominantly controlled by 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic>. The MAGIC proximal marker originated from a wheat gene model that also contained GWAS hits 1–5 and 10. However, analysis of haplotypes around the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> region in the AM panel unambiguously positioned 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> distal to gene model TraesCS2B01G046400 (based on SNPs Kukri_c148_1512, Kukri_c148_1346, representing GWAS hits 7 and 8, respectively) based on recombination events in ‘Orbit’ and ‘Cadogan’. The MAGIC marker immediately distal to the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> QTL peak corresponded to AM hit 12 (Kukri_c63748_1453), with analysis of haplotypes in the AM panel positioning this marker distal to 
 <italic>Tsc2,</italic> based on recombination events in four varieties: ‘Selkirk’, ‘Elka’, ‘Thatcher’ and ‘Aronde’ (Supplementary Tables 2 and 4). Therefore, the genomic regions defined by GWAS in the AM panel and genetic analyses in the MAGIC population combined to localise 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> to a 1921-kb region containing 104 gene models, based on the wheat cv. ‘Chinese Spring’ reference genome.

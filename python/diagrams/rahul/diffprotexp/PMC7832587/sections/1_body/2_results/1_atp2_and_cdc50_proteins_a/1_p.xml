<p>ATP2 is highly conserved in 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. For instance, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ATP2 (PfATP2, VEuPathDB ID: PF3D7_1219600), 
 <italic>P. vivax</italic> ATP2 (VEuPathDB ID: PVX_123625), and the ATP2 orthologs from the malaria mouse models 
 <italic>P. berghei,</italic> (VEuPathDB ID: PBANKA_1434800) and 
 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> (VEuPathDB ID: PCHAS_1436800, named in this work PcATP2) (Figure supplement 1) share ∼60% amino acid identity [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, homologs to ATP2 are also present in the genome of other disease-causing intracellular parasites belonging, to the Apicomplexa phylum like 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (Figure supplement 1) [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], although it is still unknown if these transporters are also essential. These sequences contain the typical membrane topology of 10 predicted transmembrane segments (TMs), the conserved P-type ATPase motif, DKTG, (intracellular loop between TMs 4 and 5, where the aspartate is transiently autophosphorylated during the transport cycle), and the specific P4-ATPase motif DGET (intracellular loop between TMs 2 and 3), implicated in protein dephosphorylation [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, the well-conserved PICL (or PISL) motif present in TM4 of P4-ATPases is also conserved in these apicomplexan sequences (Figure supplement 1). Interestingly, the glutamine in TM1 and the two asparagine residues in TMs 4 and 6, that coordinate the substrate’s phosphatidylserine (PS) moiety in ATP8A1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and in ATP11C [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], are also conserved in these apicomplexan sequences (Figure supplement 1). In ATP8A1, the isoleucine and leucine residues of the PICL motif in TM4 also stablish hydrophobic contacts with the PS moiety of the substrate [

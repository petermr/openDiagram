<p>The physical broadening (β) of the diffraction lines was used to estimate the volume-averaged domain size (

 <sub>v</sub>) and the root-mean-square strain (
 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>RMS</sub>) according to the so-called ”double-Voigt” method [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] equivalent to the Warren-Averbach approach [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This method, in which Voigt functions were used to describe the contribution of both the crystallite size and the lattice micro-strain to the broadening of the diffraction lines, was performed using the computer program BREADTH [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Physically broadened diffraction line profiles (β) were obtained by convolution-fitting approach (program SHADOW [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]) in which the instrumental profile (a split Person VII function fitted to the very narrow diffraction lines of zincite [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]) is convoluted with a refineable Voigt function to fit the observed diffraction lines profile. The results of convolution-fitting of the diffraction lines in products S1, S2, and S3 are shown in

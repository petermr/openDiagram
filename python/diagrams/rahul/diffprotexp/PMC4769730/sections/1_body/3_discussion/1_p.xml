<p>POAG represents one of the major leading causes of blindness worldwide, with poor early diagnosis and prognosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Several genes/proteins (soluble and stress-related mediators, growth factors, cytoskeletal and ECM-associated proteins) have been identified in POAG (mainly in TM-derived cells, aqueous humors, tears and blood) and proposed as potential candidates for the prognosis of disease and monitoring of therapy [

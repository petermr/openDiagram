<p>Further, we analyzed the influence of miRNA expression on differential expression of their target genes between the cultivars. A total of 31 miRNA‐target gene pairs (69%) among the differentially expressed miRNAs and their differentially expressed target genes exhibited antagonistic correlation (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). In the above set, 22 miRNA‐mRNA pairs exhibited the down‐regulation of miRNAs and higher expression of their target genes at stage(s) of seed development in JGK 3. For the remaining nine miRNA‐mRNA pairs, upregulation of miRNAs and down‐regulation of their respective target genes in JGK 3 was observed (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Among the 31 target genes represented in these pairs, the genes encoding transcription factors, signaling proteins, and metabolic enzymes were included. Interestingly, the transcription factors belonging to bZIP and homeobox‐
 <italic>REVOLUTA</italic> families were included. These transcription factors showed upregulation in JGK 3 cultivar, whereas their corresponding miRNAs such as Car‐miR319 and Car‐miR166 family members were expressed at lower levels in JGK 3. This observation suggests the possible role of miRNA‐mediated regulation of

 <italic>REVOLUTA</italic> family of transcription factors in determining seed size/weight in chickpea.

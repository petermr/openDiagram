<p>During the last decades, the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer has been widely recognized. The development and widespread application of high-throughput technologies, including microarray and RNA-sequencing, has provided a novel understanding of the molecular complexity of this disease.
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7â€“9</xref> Several studies have demonstrated that TNBC cells express genes characteristic of normal basal/myoepithelial cells, such as 
 <italic>KRT5, KRT14, KRT17</italic> and 
 <italic>EGFR</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Some molecular features of TNBC have been discovered, including a high frequency of 
 <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, aberrant activation of PI3K pathway, inactivation of 
 <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 
 <italic>BRCA2, RB1</italic> loss, and cyclin E1 amplification.
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, little is known about the etiological factors which promote the initiation and development of TNBC, and the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC are far from elucidated.

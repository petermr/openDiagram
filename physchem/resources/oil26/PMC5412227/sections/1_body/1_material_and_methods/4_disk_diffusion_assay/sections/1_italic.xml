<italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil was placed on the surface of the plate. In order to accelerate essential oil diffusion into the agar, the plates were incubated at 4 &#176;C for 1 h followed by incubation at 37 &#176;C, for 24 to 48 h. The diameters of the inhibition zones (mm) were measured, including the diameter of the disks. Gentamycin (30 &#956;g/disk) and vancomycin (30 &#956;g/disk) served as positive controls for Gram-positive and Gram-negative, respectively. All tests were performed in triplicate.

<p>Serum and urine samples were collected from patients that were diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma at the General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from June 2017 to June 2018. The discovery set consisted of 30 healthy individuals and 70 lung adenocarcinoma patients at early stages (stage Ia1, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10; stage Ia2, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10; stage Ia3, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10; stage Ib, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10; and stage II, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) and late stages (stage III, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10; stage IV, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). Healthy controls were age- and gender-matched to the lung adenocarcinoma patients (

All samples were collected from patients with an empty stomach in the morning. All participants provided signed informed consent, and samples were collected following the protocol approval. All methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines, and all experimental protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital (Number S2018-007-001). Each serum sample was allowed to clot for 45 min and then centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. For urine samples, a morning midstream urine specimen was collected and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. All samples were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use.

<p>Another example of an accessory protein is TopJ, a J-domain chaperone molecule of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, which is located at the base of the terminal organelle and is necessary for cytadhesion and gliding motility [
 <xref rid="cit0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Interestingly, TopJ mutants maintain normal levels of P1, P30, P90, P40, HMW1, and HMW2, but their cytadhesion and motility are diminished, while the formation/positioning of terminal organelles is delayed or poorly coordinated with cell growth. Similarly, P1 fails to translocate or fold correctly on the surface of mycoplasma cells, indicating that TopJ may function in terminal organelle maturation, migration, or both, during cell division [

0: Energy and materials, important pillars of the modern developing society, are closely related to human civilization.
1: Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, an environmentally friendly and new green energy, have wide applicability in the fields of energy storage and transportation (Song et al.,  2018).
2: The ever-increasing demand for high current charge-discharge capability, high energy density, and long service life has driven the development of the lithium battery industry (Zhou et al.,  2019).
3: Olivine phase lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) is one of the focused cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (Padhi et al.,  1997a, b).
4: It has many superior properties, such as that Fe is low-cost and environmentally benign, that the covalently bonded PO 4 groups make the chemical properties more stable and prolong service lifetime, and that it has a high theoretical capacity (170 mAhg 1) and flat voltage plateau (3.45 V vs. Li/Li +).
5: However, LiFePO 4 materials have some drawbacks, such as inferior electronic conductivity (ca.10 910 10 Scm 1) as well as slow one-dimensional lithium ion diffusion, which is a formidable obstacle to the high performance of lithium-ion batteries (Goodenough and Kim,  2010; Dathar et al.,  2011).
6: A considerable number of methods have been adopted with the aim of alleviating the above shortcomings.
7: These methods can be categorized into two main classes: particle size control (Prosini et al.,  2003; Zhao et al.,  2016) and conductive material coating (Chang et al.,  2019; Han et al.,  2019; Ma et al.,  2019; Tao et al.,  2019).

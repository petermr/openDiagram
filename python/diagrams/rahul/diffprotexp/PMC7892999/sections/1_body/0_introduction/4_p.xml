<p id="Par5">Non-coding RNAs with a length higher than 200 nucleotides are defined as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). They were originally considered to be transcriptional byproducts, or transcriptional ‘noise’, and were often dismissed in transcriptome analyses due to their low expression and low sequence conservation compared with protein-coding mRNAs. However, specific lncRNAs were shown to be involved in chromatin modification, epigenetic regulation, genomic imprinting, transcriptional control as well as pre- and post-translational mRNA processing in diverse biological processes in plants

 </sup>. Certain lncRNAs can be precursors of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNAs), triggering the repression of protein-coding genes at the transcription level (transcriptional gene silencing or TGS) or at post-transcriptional level (PTGS)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, other lncRNAs can act as endogenous target mimics of miRNAs, to fine-tune the miRNA-dependent regulation of target genes
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>

 <italic>cis</italic>- and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-acting mode
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. The 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting lncRNAs can be classified by their relative position to annotated genes

 </sup> and notably include long noncoding natural antisense (lncNATs) transcribed in opposite strand of a coding gene, overlapping with at least one of its exons
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. Other so-called intronic lncRNAs are transcribed within introns of a protein-coding gene
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> whereas long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are transcripts located farther than 1 kb from protein-coding genes

 </sup>. Among these 
 <italic>cis</italic>-lncRNAs, NATs are of special interest as they have been shown to provide a mechanism for locally regulating the transcription or translation of the target gene on the other strand, providing novel mechanisms involved in the regulation of key biological processes

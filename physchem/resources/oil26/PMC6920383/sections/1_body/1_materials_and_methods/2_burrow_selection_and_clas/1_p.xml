<p id="Par11">In the mesic grassland, burrows were selected from an extensive burrow survey performed during April 2015. Randomly selected 1 ha plots within all reserve management blocks were searched for burrows, with 60 of the resulting 203 burrows randomly selected for sampling during April and May 2015

 </sup>. In the arid scrubland, burrows were located systematically during April 2015 by traversing the study site. Eleven burrows were found across the entire reserve, but one was occupied by a beehive and no soil measurements could be obtained from it

 </sup>. In the semi-arid savannah, five adjacent reserve management blocks within the southern part of the reserve were selected during March 2016 and burrows were located opportunistically within these management blocks (a total of 71 burrows were sampled). At all sites, burrows had a tunnel shape structure with a roof, distinguishing them from shallow feeding scrapes and natural depressions. In addition, all sampled burrows were separated by at least 10 m.

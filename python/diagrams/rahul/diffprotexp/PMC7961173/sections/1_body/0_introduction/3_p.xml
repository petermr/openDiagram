<p id="Par4">Placental development during the first trimester is especially vulnerable to xenobiotic insult because the first trimester encompasses a critical window for establishing adequate maternal blood supply to the placental bed. Fetal origin extravillous trophoblasts are specialized placental cells that play a critical role in placentation. During the first trimester, these cells acquire an invasive phenotype and migrate into the maternal decidua from the chorionic villi. Once in the decidua, the cells facilitate remodeling of the spiral arteries necessary for increased maternal blood supply to the placenta (Burton and Jauniaux 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Pijnenborg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1981</xref>). Furthermore, as the pregnancy progresses to the second and third trimesters, the extravillous trophoblasts form cell columns at the tips of chorionic villi that anchor the villi to the maternal basal plate and stabilize them in the intervillous space (Kaufmann and Castellucci 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1997</xref>). Dysfunctional trophoblasts may jeopardize the maternal blood supply to the placenta and result in abnormal placental development. Moreover, placental insufficiency, a condition caused in part by inadequate spiral artery remodeling, may contribute to intrauterine growth restriction (Burton and Jauniaux

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>) and pre-eclampsia (Brosens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1972</xref>; Steegers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2010</xref>).

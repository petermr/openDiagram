<p>The tedaniophorbasins are structurally unique compounds, possessing a ring system that has not been reported either naturally or synthetically. The closest related structure is the synthetic 7,8-benzo derivative (
 <bold>5</bold>) prepared through reaction of 6,7-dichloro-1,3-dimethyllumazine with 2-aminothiophenol (

 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-19-00095" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A similar reaction between mercaptoethylamine and 6,7-dichloro-1,3-dimethyllumazine could yield tedaniophorbasin B (
 <bold>2</bold>). Marine pteridine alkaloids have previously been isolated from polychaete worms [

 <xref rid="B20-marinedrugs-19-00095" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All previously reported marine pteridine alkaloids, however, have been unsubstituted at C-7, thus making the tedaniophorbasins the first C-7 substituted pteridines to be reported from a marine source. There have not been any previous chemical investigation of sponges from the genus

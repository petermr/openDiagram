  <p>Impact of different AAF variants on bacterial autoaggregation. Shown is the relative decrease in OD
   <sub>600</sub> when compared to the OD
   <sub>600</sub> at the start of the experiment. Autoaggregation was tested for 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> strain 55989 
   <italic>agg</italic>3
   <sup>−</sup> carrying one of the plasmids pBAD24
   <italic>aaf</italic>I, pBAD24
   <italic>aaf</italic>III, pBAD24
   <italic>aaf</italic>IV and pBAD24
   <italic>aaf</italic>V or pBAD24 (NC). Samples were taken in ten min intervals until reaching a plateau. (a) Representative results of an autoaggregation assay. Except for 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> strain 55989 
   <italic>agg</italic>3
   <sup>−</sup> expressing AAF/IV, the bacterial culture sedimented completely at t = 60 min. (b) Shown are average values for each time point and standard deviations of three biological replicates. Whereas the sedimentation of AAF/I-, AAF/III- and AAF/V-expressing cells differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from the negative control already after 10 min, AAF/IV-expressing cells differed only after 30 min significantly from the negative control (the first time point at which the sedimentation speed is significantly different from the negative control is indicated with an * for each AAF variant). The sedimentation speed of AAF/IV-expressing cells was significantly different from AAF/I-, AAF/III- and AAF/V-expressing bacteria until t = 20 min (indicated with **)

<p>A possible role for ASIC3 in Crohn’s disease patients is demonstrated by biopsy samples showing a 2.5-fold increased expression of ASIC3, which was hypothesized to contribute toward visceral hypersensitivity in chronic inflammatory pain [

 <sup>−/-</sup> mice were observed to have a reduction in distention sensitivity of 50%, which would correlate with a reduction in pain [

 <sup>−/-</sup> mice [

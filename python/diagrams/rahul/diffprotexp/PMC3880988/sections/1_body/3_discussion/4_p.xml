<p>Elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-alpha), a GTP-binding protein plays a central role in protein biosynthesis. In this study, this factor was found significantly down-regulated in cMSC (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). EF1-alpha is a key regulator of various physiological processes, such as aging, proliferation, apoptosis, protein degradation and cytoskeletal rearrangement 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>. Phosphorylated EF1-alpha by type-I TGFβ receptor kinase at Serine 300 exerted a direct inhibitory on protein synthesis, therefore reducing cell proliferation 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. Detailed molecular mechanism of this pathway remains unexplored. It was suggested that phosphorylated EF1-alpha represents a mechanism by which cell cycle is inhibited as a relative fast response to TGF-β 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. EF1-alpha also interacts with the cytoskeleton by binding and bundling with actin filaments and microtubules

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. In this context, EF1-alpha functions in regulating the transport, anchorage and translation of mRNA on actin filaments that may be important in ACs

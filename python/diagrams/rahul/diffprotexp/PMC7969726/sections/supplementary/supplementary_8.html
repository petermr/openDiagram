 <caption> CPSF1-depletion inhibits liver cell line proliferation. CPSF1 was silenced by transfection with CPSF1 siRNAs or overexpressed with plasmids in QSG7701 cells. (A) CPSF1 protein levels were determined by western blotting. Statistical significance was calculated using Student’s t-test. (B) Cell proliferation in the CPSF1-silenced or CPSF1-overexpression groups was detected by CCK8 assay over five consecutive days. The relative absorbance was measured at OD 450. Fold enrichment was normalized to the absorbance on day 1 and assessed using two-way ANOVA. (C) Colony formation assays determined the effect of CPSF1 on cell growth. The number of colonies was counted using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States) and analyzed using Student’s t-test. Statistical data are presented as mean ± SD. * P &lt; 0.05 and ** P &lt; 0.01. </caption>

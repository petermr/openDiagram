<p>For the iTRAQ labeling, the peptides were labeled with the 8-plex iTRAQ reagent by following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Each iTRAQ reagent was dissolved in 70 Î¼L of ethanol and added to the respective peptide mixture. The peptides from the 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilms treated by tylosin were labeled with 115 isobaric reagent, and the peptides from the nontreated 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> biofilms were labeled with 116 isobaric reagent. Then, the samples were multiplexed and vacuum dried. Three independent biological experiments were performed.

They have direct effect on cells' proteome through disturbance of ubiquitination process and also influence gene expression. The aim of this study was to compare microRNA profiles in <i>USP8</i>-mutated and wild-type tumors and determine the probable role of differential microRNA expression by integrative microRNA and mRNA analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with Cushing's disease (<i>n</i> = 28) and silent corticotroph tumors (<i>n</i> = 20) were included. <i>USP8</i> mutations were identified with Sanger sequencing. MicroRNA and gene expression was determined with next-generation sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <i>USP8</i>-mutated patients with Cushing's disease showed higher rate of clinical remission and trend towards lower tumor volume than wild-type patients. Comparison of microRNA profiles of <i>USP8</i>-mutated and wild-type tumors revealed 68 differentially expressed microRNAs. Their target genes were determined by in silico prediction and microRNA/mRNA correlation analysis. GeneSet Enrichment analysis of putative targets showed that the most significantly overrepresented genes are involved in protein ubiquitination-related processes. Only few microRNAs influence the expression of genes differentially expressed between <i>USP8</i>-mutated and wild-type tumors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Differences in microRNA expression in corticotropinomas stratified according to <i>USP8</i> status reflect disturbed ubiquitination processes, but do not correspond to differences in gene expression between these tumors."

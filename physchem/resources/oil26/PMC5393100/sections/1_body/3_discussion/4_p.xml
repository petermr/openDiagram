Hepatic enzymes including AST and ALT were increased in animals fed with CDD. Treatment with AE and AO as well as gold standard drug, simvastatin, significantly reversed this increase in comparison to vehicle-treated group. Jamshidzadeh <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that different extracts and essential oil of anise fruits have hepatoprotective activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Anise fruit decreased CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats as well as hepatoma cell line.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p>

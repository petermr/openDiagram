<p>In addition, duplicate genes that lack coding potential, such as 
 <italic>PTENP1</italic>, can also be expressed and while not translated function as LINC RNAs (in this case acting as a sponge for microRNAs that target the parent 
 <italic>PTEN</italic> transcript). In each case classifying duplicates into putatively functional and non-functional categories would misclassify 
 <italic>TP53RTG</italic>, 
 <italic>LIF6</italic>, and 
 <italic>PTENP1</italic>.

0: All experiments and methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
1: The experimental design, animal management, and tissue collection were approved by the North Dakota State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and previously reported by Crouse et al.
2: 17.
3: In brief, 14 Angus-cross heifers with average initial body weight = 313  24.9 kg were randomly assigned at breeding to receive dietary intake of either 100% of energy requirement 71 for 0.45 kg/day of body weight gain (control; CON,  n = 7) or were fed a diet to delivery 60% of CON intake (restricted; RES,  n = 7).
4: The diet was delivered via total mixed ration (TMR), and consisted of grass hay, corn silage, alfalfa haylage, grain, and mineral mix.
5: Dried distillers grains with solubles (53.4% NDF, 31.3% CP) were supplemented in addition to the TMR and fed to achieve the target nutrient content of the CON and RES diets 17.
6: The two nutritional levels supplied to the heifers were chosen to represent two nutritional states (weight gain versus maintenance) as well as conditions applicable to beef production systems.

 <caption> Annotation and expression of IRF7 AS forms. ( A) Transcript annotation of IRF7. Exons are numbered at the top, relative to the RefSeq annotation; genomic coordinates are indicated. Coding exons are indicated in black; noncoding exons are indicated in blue. PacBio sequence identifiers are at the left. PB123733, PB6624.10, and PB6624.20 are novel transcripts. ( B) Quantitation of the most abundant IRF7 transcripts from short-read RNA sequencing. Data are presented as transcripts/million (TPM). Note that RSV infection induces major isoform switching. </caption>

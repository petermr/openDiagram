<p>Western blot analysis was used to determine protein levels, as described previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Equal amounts of samples were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and were then blotted to a poly-vinylidine difluoride membrane. Subsequently the membrane was blocked and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-β-actin polyclonal antibodies (Beyotime) used as the internal reference antibody. The membrane was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Millipore, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelynes, France). Band densities were quantified using the LAS3000 apparatus (Fujifilm, Raytest, Courbevoie, France), and normalized to the total amount of β-actin.

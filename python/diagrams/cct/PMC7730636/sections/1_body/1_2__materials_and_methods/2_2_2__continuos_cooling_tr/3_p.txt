0: Depending on the temperature, the resulting phase change reflects itself in a linear dilatation curve as a deviation of the direction of this curve, and its length changes on the experimental material.
1: The temperature  Ac1 examines the start of austenite formation when the material is heated due to the deviation of the dilatation curve from its linear direction.
2: The final transformation of austenite formation occurs at the temperature  Ac3, where again the dilatation heating curve begins to have its linear character.

<p id="Par30">When performing hierarchical clustering of the 717 DEGs between FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> and FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> in all 5 conditions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d), we observed different patterns of expression with respect to the control, with the most common pattern being genes upregulated in FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> with respect to FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> and to the control, but not upregulated in FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> respect to the controls. This suggests that a majority of the expression changes involved genes that were not canonical targets of FOXL2 wild type, but became target of gain-of-function FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>, in line with a previous study by Weis-Banke et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, samples that overexpressed FOXO1 in addition to FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> or FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup> clustered closer to the controls than their counterpart without FOXO1, suggesting that FOXO1 attenuated the effects of overexpressing FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> or FOXL2
 <sup>WT</sup>. These two observations will be further investigated in the following analyses.

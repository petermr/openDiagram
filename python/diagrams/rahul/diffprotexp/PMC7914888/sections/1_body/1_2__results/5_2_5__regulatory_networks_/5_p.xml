<p>In cells exposed to L-Tyr, 10 sets were found, of which, it was coincident with 5-Brd-2â€²-dU, finding over-expressed miR-129-3p, miR-99b-5p, and miR-30d-5p and miR-211-3p, miR-149-5p and miR-129-5p clusters as a possible target of 
 <italic>p21</italic>. We found two clusters of potential regulators for 
 <italic>Ccnd1</italic>: one with over-expressed miRNAs (miR-149-5p and miR-129-5p) and one under-expressed (miR-320-3p and miR-23b-3p), which could imply a coordinated regulation by expression to the high and low of the whole set of miRNAs. Regarding sets of under-expressed miRNAs, we found a cluster with the 
 <italic>let</italic>-7 family (a, c, d) and the miR-151-5p, whose potential target was 
 <italic>E2F2</italic>.

<p>Basing on the reproducible crude protein profiles, we explored whether TNFα affected protein expression in HepG2 cells. We semi-quantitated the expression level of identified proteins by using spectra counting and found that 520 of the total 1332 identified proteins basing on a minimum of 2 unique peptides were significantly altered [log
 <sub>2</sub>(level in TNFα treatment/level in control)&gt;1.0 or &lt;-1.0]. The quantitative analysis was summarized in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and the number of significantly altered proteins in each experimental replicate was also indicated. According to the analysis, 211 and 309 proteins were with up-regulated and down-regulated expression in TNFα-treated cells, respectively.

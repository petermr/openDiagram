<p>To explore the relationship between the expression pattern of these DEGs and their biological functions, we performed cluster analysis of all identified DEGs. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 2,044 DEGs in NV vs. NDH, NV vs. NDV, and NDV vs. NDH paired comparisons indicated that they could be classified into nine clusters, and DEGs belonging to a given cluster showed a similar expression pattern (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g004">4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g005">5A</xref>). Among all DEGs, a few highly expressed DEGs were found in clusters 1, 4, 5, and 6. Many DEGs in cluster 1 were highly expressed in NDVs and NDHs, whereas their expression in NVs was relatively lower, and most highly expressed DEGs (|log
 <sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 3) were involved in nitrogen metabolism. The expression levels of highly expressed DEGs (|log
 <sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 3) in clusters 4, 5, and 6 differed in the NDH and NDV samples; some were involved in gas vesicle protein biosynthesis. Among the highly expressed DEGs belonging to clusters 6, 7, and 9, genes encoding phosphate ABC transporter permease, transposase, and cation efflux system proteins were strongly downregulated in the NDH sample.

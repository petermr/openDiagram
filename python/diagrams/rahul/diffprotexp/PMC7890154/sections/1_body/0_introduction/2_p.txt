0: Wheat is ancient and staple cereal crops grown in large part of the world under a wide range of agro-climatic regions.
1: Major share of carbohydrate and calories in the diet are provided by wheat [ 1, 2].
2: It contains 1.52% fat, 1.52% minerals, vitamins, and 2.2% crude fibers.
3: Various abiotic stresses like drought stress, chilling injury, heat stress (HS), salinity stress, etc.
4: have severe impact on the yield and grain-quality of wheat across the globe [ 3].
5: Terminal HS is defined as an elevation in temperature above ambient (>32 C) during flowering and grain-filling stages [ 4, 5].
6: Terminal HS has severe effect on different biological processes operating inside the plant system causing enormous losses in grain yield.
7: Since, the ambient temperature is predicted to continue rising under climate change (1.5 C between 2030 and 2052; IPCC, 2018), HS will be more severe for most of the agriculturally important crops, especially wheat [ 6].
8: The grain-quality and overall yield has been reported to be severely affected due to fluctuation in temperature during fertilization and grain-filling stages [ 7].
9: Heat stress during pollination stage causes formation of defunct pollen, unwinding of stigma, improper fertilization, false-seed setting, defragmentation of starch particles, and formation of shriveled grains [ 8].
10: Terminal HS reduces the grain-filling duration as well as the length of peduncle minimizing the total grain yield [ 1].

<p>Skin tissue after different treatments were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. 5 µm thick sections were cut and mounted onto slides. Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated to TBS following standard protocol. Sections were blocked in TBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) + 1% BSA, followed by staining with biotinylated HABP with 0.4 μl of (0.5 μg/μl stock) (EMD Millipore, 385911) HABP/100 μl + 1% BSA in PBS applied overnight. Slides were then developed with Streptavidin and DAB with Hematoxylin counterstaining and covered using Aquatex. Parallel sections that went through the whole procedure, with the only exception of HABP application, served as no staining controls, while sections that were pretreated for an hour with 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Worthington Biochem, LS002594) at 37 °C served as negative controls to demonstrate the specificity of the staining.</p>

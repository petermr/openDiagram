0: Recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has enabled scientists to made progress in research on the severity of infectious diseases.
1: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides a great opportunity to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the influenza genome and disease severity [ 26].
2: However, few study was conducted to study the host-related genomic factors of severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection using NGS.

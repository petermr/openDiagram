 </sup>. Based on the sequencing depth and gene length of the read count, FPKM (Fragment reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) was chosen in this study as the key parameter in gene expression analyses. Differential gene expression was analyzed using count data from the TopHat‐HTSeq pipeline was by DESeq v1.42.0

  <p>Alignment of the cryo-EM structure of Drs2p and a 3D structural model of PcATP2. The 3D structural model of PcATP2 (cartoon representation) was aligned with the cryo-EM structure of the autoinhibited conformation of Drs2p (PDB ID 6roh, mesh representation [
   <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Protein domains of PcATP2 in the cytoplasmic region between TMs 2 and 3 that are absent in Drs2p are depicted in blue. Protein domains of PcATP2 in the cytoplasmic region between TMs 4 and 5 that are absent in Drs2p are depicted in magenta. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Lateral perspective of the molecule. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Cytoplasmic view after 90Â° rotation of 
   <italic>A</italic> through the x axis. The grey shadow square in 
   <italic>A</italic> represents the putative position of the surrounding membrane.

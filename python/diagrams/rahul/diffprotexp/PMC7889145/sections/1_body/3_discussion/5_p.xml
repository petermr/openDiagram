<p>We identified additional insertion of genes 
 <italic>Kng2, Kng1, Eif4a2</italic> and 
 <italic>Rfc4</italic> that were contained in the BAC used for 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene construction. These passenger genes may have functional consequences in various tissues throughout the mouse, as their expression is not limited to adipocytes. The impacts of increased passenger gene expression are difficult to predict, but tissue-specific expression changes are expected, and these may have implications for any study of adipose tissue physiology. Tissue-specific gene expression data from the ENCODE project [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for each passenger gene, and 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> and 
 <italic>Adipoq</italic> are shown in Supplemental Figure 3 A-F.

0: To further ascertain the ability of PirB protein to induce apoptosis in shrimp hemocytes,  in vivo experiments were carried out.
1: First, healthy laboratory acclimatized shrimp were divided into two groups (30 each).
2: One group of shrimps was each injected at the third abdominal segment with 0.8 M rPirB, while the other group of shrimps was each injected with an equal volume of PBS (negative control).
3: Hemocytes collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-treatment were stained with the Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide apoptosis detection kit and analyzed by flow cytometry.
4: Triplicate samples were analyzed per treatment for at least three independent experiments.

<p id="Par20">Notably, we identified genes related to changes in erythrocyte differentiation that have not been well explored in previous studies. Compared to critical survivors, the non-survivors showed obvious activation of the erythrocyte differentiation pathway. Erythrocyte differentiation occurs in bone marrow, not peripheral blood. RBCs are reported to contain 8400 human genes, including erythrocyte differentiation genes [

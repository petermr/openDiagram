<p>The different proteins coordinate with each other in-vivo to express their biological behaviour. Thus, the pathway-based annotation broadens further understanding of their biological function. The KEGG is a main public pathway-related database (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</uri>). The pathway analysis can determine important biochemical, and metabolic and signaling pathways regulated by proteins. The KEGG database results indicated that the differential proteins participated in 90 signaling pathways in total (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00130-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The top 10 metabolic pathways were starch and sucrose metabolic pathways (9.03%), glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway (9.03%), endoplasmic reticulum protein processing pathway (6.94%), ribosome metabolism (6.6%), photosynthetic biochar fixation pathway (5.21%), fructose and mannose metabolism (4.86%), galactose metabolism (4.17%), amino acids, nucleotides glucose metabolism (4.17%), purine metabolism (4.17%) and pyruvate metabolism (4.17%). The number of proteins expressed, and pathway ID is given in

0: HTR-8/SVneo cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were then treated with medium alone (control) or DCVC (10 or 20 M) in quintuplicate for 6 or 12 h. CyQUANT  Cell Proliferation Assay (Invitrogen) was used to quantify cell proliferation.
1: The stain specifically binds to cellular DNA, and the fluorescence is proportional to the number of cells.
2: The assay was performed according to the manufacturers protocol.
3: Briefly, dye binding solution was prepared by diluting CyQUANT  reagent in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).
4: After exposure to DCVC, the growth medium was removed and CyQUANT  dye binding solution was added to each well.
5: Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 C. After incubation, fluorescence was measured (excitation: 485 nm; emission 530 nm) using a SpectraMax M2e Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).

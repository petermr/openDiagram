  <title>Alternative splicing mechanisms associated with isoform switches and consequences for protein expression.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold> Schematic showing different splicing events that can lead to gene isoform switches. 
   <bold>B</bold> Quantification of the number of isoforms showing more or less splicing events in AD compared to controls for each dataset. 
   <bold>C</bold> Quantification of the number of isoforms showing (i) gain or loss of coding potential, domains/signal peptides identified, intrinsically disordered regions (IDR), intron retention, open-reading frame (ORF) sequencing similarity; (ii) switch (simultaneous gain and loss) of domains identified or IDR; (iii) sensitive or insensitive to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD); and (iv) longer or shorter ORF sequencing similarity.

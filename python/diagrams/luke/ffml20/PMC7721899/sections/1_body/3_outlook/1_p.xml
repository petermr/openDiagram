<p id="Par25">This paper establishes that the nature of the input–output relationship of a complex material such as C–S–H can be effectively predicted and interpreted using ML. Due to the limitation of the experimental data available in the literature, especially for different C–S–H compositions, this study uses physics-based MD simulations to generate the elastic constant dataset for different C–S–H compositions. Note that only the compositional ranges of C–S–H that is observed experimentally is used. The molecular structure for each composition is simulated by implementing ReaxFF. Further, instead of a single effective mechanical property such as Young’s modulus or hardness, this study evaluates different individual components of the stiffness moduli, in particular, nine stiffness components. Using the dataset generated from MD simulations, the elastic constants for C–S–H are predicted by implementing two ML techniques: Gaussian Process (GP) and neural network (NN). By judicious selection of optimal level of complexity, and accuracy reliable predictions of the properties can be obtained while ensuring there is no under- or overfitting. A comparative evaluation between the ML techniques reveals that GP and NN show significantly improved predictions as compared to other adopted techniques and NN is found to offer the highest level of accuracy with considerably lower MSE and good R

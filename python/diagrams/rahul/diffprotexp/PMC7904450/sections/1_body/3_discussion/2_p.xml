<p id="p0080">When evaluating mean concordance scores across all 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cell lines containing statistically significant differential gene expression signatures for all four drug treatments, fluoxetine treated cells generated transcriptional profiles highly similar to the transcriptional profiles of 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown cells (mean concordance score = 0.7061). Furthermore, fluoxetine treated cells also generate gene expression signatures similar to 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown cells. When evaluating mean concordance scores across all 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown cell lines containing statistically significant differential gene expression signatures for at least one drug treatment of interest, fluoxetine treated cells generate transcriptional profiles that parallel the transcriptional profiles of 
 <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown cells (mean concordance score = 0.3440). While bioinformaticians are still refining interpretations of concordance scores, it is generally accepted that concordance scores larger than 0.3210 are valuable in establishing significant relationships between comparands

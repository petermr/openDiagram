<p>Next, the corresponding genes of some up-regulated proteins were identified, and their expression profiles were compared between LB-04 and LB-0 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-11-00177-f003">Figure 3</xref>). All assayed genes were up-regulated under LB-04, supporting the expression pattern of their related proteins. In particular, the genes governing putative spermidine synthase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN44650_c0_g1</italic>) and chlorophyll a-b binding protein (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN46586_c4_g5</italic>) proteins showed significantly higher expression in LB-04 than LB-0. These results emphasize that the identified genes and their corresponding proteins have a positive regulatory role in Al stress response when masson pine is inoculated with

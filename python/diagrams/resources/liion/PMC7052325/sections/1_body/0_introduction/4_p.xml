<p>In this mini review, we will present a comprehensive development of solid Mg ion conductors, including phosphates, borohydrides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and chalcogenides. It highlights the performance and the limitation of each material and also discusses the conduction mechanism on the basis of the crystal structure and the strategy to improve the ionic conductivity.</p>

<p id="Par33">RNA sequencing data and qRT-PCR analysis have identified increased expression of one of the retinoic acid response genes CYR61 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The CYR61 is a well-known protein that is involved in angiogenesis. Since we observed upregulation of ALDH1A2 protein in abnormal astrocytes surrounding the cerebral AVM nidus, we analyzed the expression of CYR61 protein in the astrocytes surrounding the cerebral AVMs. To study this, we performed immunohistochemical analysis with CYR61 antibody in the cerebral AVM and control tissues and observed high expression of CYR61 protein in the brain parenchyma cells surrounding the AVM vessels and reduced expression in AVM blood vessels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b). In contrast to this, we observed very low expression of CYR61 protein in blood vessels as well as brain parenchyma cells of control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b). To substantiate this finding, we analyzed the expression of CYR61 in astrocytes using triple immunofluorescence staining of AVM nidus and control tissues with GFAP, ALDH1A2, and CYR61 antibodies. We observed increased expression of CYR61 in astrocytes around the AVM and strongly co-localized to GFAP, ALDH1A2. However, we observed very minimal expression of these proteins in the astrocytes of control tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>câ€“e). Taken together, our study provides the direct evidence that abnormal astrocytes surrounding the cerebral AVMs contain increased expression of ALDH1A2, a key rate-limiting enzyme of retinoic acid signaling and its target protein CYR61. In conclusion, this study proposes that development of cerebral AVM nidus could be due to multifactorial stimuli and is possible within the vascular cells as well as from the adjacent abnormal astrocyte cells.

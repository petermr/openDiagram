<p id="Par8">All previous intestinal comparative gene studies, however, share a major problem, described by Boyko as “the artificiality of comparing gene expression levels in regenerating and intact tissues”

 </sup>. Many studies end up using the normal intestine as a baseline in their comparisons to determine the differences in gene expression profiles. This comparison is apt for late regenerative stages, but during the early events of regeneration, the regenerating rudiment shares more cell and tissue types in common with the normal mesentery than with the normal intestine. This point is highlighted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, where the percentage composition of the different tissue layers is shown for the early stages of regeneration. Therefore, when using the normal intestine as a reference, genes expressed in the intestine luminal epithelium would appear as being under-expressed during the first week of regeneration since at that stage no lumen has formed. In contrast, genes that appeared as highly expressed in the early regenerate might be due to their preferential expression in the mesothelial layer and not necessarily due to being activated by the regeneration process.

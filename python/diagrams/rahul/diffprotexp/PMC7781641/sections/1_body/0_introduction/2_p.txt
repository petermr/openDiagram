0: One type of chronic pain that is particularly traumatic for patients is trigeminal neuropathic pain which is caused by inflammation and demyelination of the trigeminal nerve pathways.
1: We have developed a highly robust, long-lasting, and easily induced animal model of trigeminal neuropathic pain that accurately depicts the kind of pain suffered by patients.
2: We call this model FRICT-ION (Foramen Rotundum Inflammatory Constriction Trigeminal InfraOrbital Nerve) [ 1].
3: The FRICT-ION model persists through long time frames suitable for testing therapeutics for chronic pain (>6 months) [ 2].
4: An equivalent clinical trial model used in clinical drug testing is third molar extraction.
5: This common procedure provides ready proof-of-concept, dose-ranging, and efficacy testing for pain therapeutics that are later effectively guided through FDA approvals [ 2, 3].

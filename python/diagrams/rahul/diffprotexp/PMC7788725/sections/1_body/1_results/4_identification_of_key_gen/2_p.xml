<p id="Par40">For the biological process of the candidate genes identified by SICER (LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes bind to euchromatin), signal transduction and cardiac muscle cell differentiation are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. As to pathway analysis of the candidate genes identified by SICER, we observed that TGF-beta pathway was mostly associated with these genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Here, we selected 4 genes (CREBBP, BMP4, BMP7, and PPP2R2B) as key genes according to TGF-beta pathway and consulted literature, which showed a high correlation with the study. The 4 key genes (PPP2R2B, BMP4, CREBBP, and BMP7) were distributed in chromosomes 5, 14, 16, and 20 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), and we identified the signal distribution of the 4 key binding sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). The signal strengths of these genes were reduced in the DCM compared to the control group, except for BMP7.

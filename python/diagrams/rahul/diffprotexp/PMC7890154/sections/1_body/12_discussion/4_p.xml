<p id="par0250">We also isolated recombinant MAPK protein of âˆ¼40.3 kDa from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> through heterologous expression. Recombinant MAPK protein showed maximum activity under T
 <sub>1</sub> treatment, which further decreases with increase in the temperature. 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of MAPK under HS showed very high activity in BT-Schomburgk (thermosusceptible) during grain-filling compared with HD3086 (thermotolerant). Pollination, being the critical stage, is more prone to elevation in temperature, as compared to grain-filling. Heat stress during pollination directly affects the pollen interaction with stigma, tube growth, fertilization and disrupts the transportation of photosynthates and accumulation in grains causing the formation of empty pockets in seeds [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The MAPK in case of BT-Schomburgk showed drastic reduction in the activity under T
 <sub>1</sub> at pollination stage. This leads to maximum yield penalty in BT-Schomburgk and is the reason behind its thermosusceptible nature, as compared to HD3086 (thermotolerant), which shows stable MAPK activity during critical stages under HS. Few researchers have reported improved stress tolerance in Arabidopsis, tobacco and cereals through genetic manipulation of MAPK [

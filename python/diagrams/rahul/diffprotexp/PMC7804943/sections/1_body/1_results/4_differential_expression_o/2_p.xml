<p id="Par16">These observations prompted the question as to whether additional ribosomal protein genes share a similar expression pattern and may have been missed in the above analysis. To address this, we examined the expression profiles of all annotated ribosomal proteins by compiling genes associated with GO terms containing the term “ribosomal subunit” (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Interestingly, an additional 29 ribosomal protein genes were found to display upregulation in the proximal-distal versus dorsal-ventral-superficial-deep axes comparisons. These findings suggest that the composition of ribosomal components in pyramidal neurons in the proximal-distal axis is distinct from that of the dorsal, ventral, superficial, and deep pyramidal neurons, consistent with increasing evidence for cell-type- and condition-dependent quantitative and qualitative differences in the translation machinery

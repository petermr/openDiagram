<p>In general, although the SCEs exhibit enhanced ionic conductivity, the total ionic conductivity is limited by polymer matrix. There are still many challenges to achieve acceptable value for practical application of SCEs at room temperature. In order to enhance the ionic conductivity of SCEs, the ceramic fillers with different morphologies are introduced to reduce the crystallinity of polymer electrolyte and construct high‐efficient ionic transportation channels.

 </xref>. Although, the 3D framework possesses more continuous conductive pathway for the migration of lithium‐ions, large number of voids in SCEs may lead to incompatible and poorly contacted interfaces, which hinders the lithium‐ion transfer to some content. In the most of the present research work, the electrochemical performance data of as‐prepared lithium batteries were obtained at high temperature (beyond glass transition temperature of polymer matrix). Thus, in order to enable application of SCEs at room temperature, their ionic conductivity still needs to be further improved by structure design of ceramic and composition tuning of polymer matrix.

<p id="p0120">Expression levels of VATA, GPDA, HSP70, 1433Z, UCHL1, and ALF were confirmed using Western blotting (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Expression levels of VATA, HSP70, 1433Z, UCHL1, and ALF were significantly up-regulated in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> versus wild type. Although GPDA expression appeared to be lower in RGE-treated flies, this was not significant. These results of Western blotting are consistent with those of the 2-DE MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis.

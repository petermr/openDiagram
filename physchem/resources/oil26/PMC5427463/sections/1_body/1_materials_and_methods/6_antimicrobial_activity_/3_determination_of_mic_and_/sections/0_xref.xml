The test was performed in sterile 96-well microplates with a final volume in each microplate well of 100 &#956;L. For susceptibility testing, 90 &#956;L of LB broth or PDB were distributed from the second to the twelfth test wells. A stock solution of the SoEO was prepared by dissolving 100 &#956;L of the oil in ethanol and then adjusted to a final concentration of 50 mg/mL. The first well of the microplate was prepared by dispensing 170 &#956;L of the growth medium and 10 &#956;L of the SoEO to reach a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and then 90 &#956;L of scalar dilutions were transferred from the second to the ninth well. Thereafter, 10 &#956;L of indicator strain (final inoculum concentrations of 10

0: Changes in gene expression characterize a multitude of human diseases and have been successfully used to predict molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with pathological processes 1.
1: Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and causes a progressive cognitive decline, for which there is no effective treatment or cure.
2: Although expression analyses in brain diseases are generally limited by tissue availability, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data have been generated from  postmortem brain samples of healthy and AD individuals 2  4.
3: However, a comprehensive description of the gene expression alterations in the AD brain remains elusive.

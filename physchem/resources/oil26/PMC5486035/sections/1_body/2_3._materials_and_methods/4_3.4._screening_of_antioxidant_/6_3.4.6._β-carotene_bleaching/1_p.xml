<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The &#946;-carotene bleaching assay was performed using an emulsion prepared according to Smeriglio et al. [<xref rid="B37-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Aliquots of this emulsion (7.0 mL) were mixed with 0.28 mL of sample solution (range 4&#8211;0.5 mg/mL). An emulsion without &#946;-carotene was used as control. The reaction mixture was initially recorded at the starting time (<italic>t</italic> = 0) at 470 nm and then incubated at 50 &#176;C in a water bath for 120 min, with the absorbance recorded every 20 min. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as the reference compound and the results were expressed as inhibition (%) of &#946;-carotene bleaching using Equation (1).</p>

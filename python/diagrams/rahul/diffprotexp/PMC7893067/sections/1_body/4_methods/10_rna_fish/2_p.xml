<p id="Par35">RNA FISH was carried using hybridization and wash buffers from LGC Biosearch Technologies. In short, 10^5 human SHSY-5Y cells were seeded on 18 mm #1 round cover glass (VWR) in a 12 well culture plate. Cells were cultured in 1:1 mixture of Ham's F12 and DMEM (Gibco) medium (Gibco) with 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and phenol red, supplemented with 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Sigma), 10% FBS (Sigma) and 1 × PEST (Sigma). Cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Following overnight incubation, cells were fixed and permeabilized according to manufacturer recommendations. Cells were incubated for 16 h with FISH probes in the hybridization buffer (LGC Biosearch Technologies). Cells were then washed using wash buffer A (LGC Biosearch Technologies) for 30 min at 37 °C, and DNA stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, cells were washed in wash buffer B, and coverslips were mounted in Vectashield anti-fade (VectorLabs) and imaged immediately. Imaging was carried out on Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 Widefield Fluorescence Microscopy using an Olympus 63x/1.42 PlanApo objective and using and ZEN imaging software. Z-stacks were collected at 0.5 μm intervals for 18 fields per sample. Z-stacks were deconvolved using orthogonal projection (ZEN imaging software).

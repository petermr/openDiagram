<p id="Par18">Comparative proteome profiling in the prefrontal cortex of the CMS-treated rats revealed 25 downregulated and 32 upregulated proteins in the depression-susceptible group, 57 downregulated and 17 upregulated proteins in the anxiety-susceptible group, and 33 downregulated and 89 upregulated in the insusceptible group. In the two CMS-susceptible groups, just 13 proteins were observed to be regulated in the same way, which might represent some shared aberrant elements between depression and anxiety disorders. Also, 25 similarly regulated proteins were found among the two susceptible and the insusceptible groups as a CMS-exposed result (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Intriguingly, up to 87% of these proteins were distinctly associated with the three phenotypes. This suggested that these stressed rats had distinct molecular patterns as responsive to CMS. Further analysis by unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 212 differential proteins classified these samples into three different cohorts, also reflecting the three distinct responses to stress (Fig.

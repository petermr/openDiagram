<p id="Par19">The median age of patients at surgery was 4 days (IQR 2–6 days) with median gestational age of 39 weeks and median weight at surgery of 3.2 kg. The patients were all Caucasian, predominantly male and of non-Hispanic ethnicity. We stratified the patients by the primary clinical outcome—one group that developed LCOS and the other that did not develop LCOS (No-LCOS). Of the total population, eight patients developed LCOS. Patients that developed LCOS were more likely to have a lower birth weight (

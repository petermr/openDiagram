0: The halophyte grass  Urochondra setulosa was collected from Rann of Kutch (the natural saline habitat of the halophyte) Bhuj, Gujarat, India and raised through root cuttings in pots and then established in lysimeters filled with sandy soil in a screen house under natural conditions at ICARCentral Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI), Karnal, Haryana, India (Fig.
1: 1).
2: The treatment levels of salinity i.e.
3: ECe ~ 30 dS/m (~ 300 mM NaCl), ECe ~ 40 dS/m (~ 400 mM NaCl) and ECe ~ 50 dS/m (~ 500 mM NaCl) were maintained through saline water irrigation (3:1 chloride dominated salinity) in three replicates along with one set of control.
4: Leaves were harvested at vegetative stage after 48 h of saline irrigation.
5: In terms of soil salinity, ECe of 4dS/m equals to approximately 40 mM NaCl 13.
6: All methods were performed following the relevant guidelines and regulations.

0: TCE exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes, including multiple measures of restricted (or reduced) fetal growth (Forand et al.
1: 2012; Ruckart et al.
2: 2014).
3: In rats, TCE treatment during mid-gestation decreases fetal weight and elevates oxidative stress biomarkers in the placenta (Loch-Caruso et al.
4: 2019).
5: Despite links between TCE exposure and elevated risks of adverse birth outcomes in humans and rats, the underlying toxicological mechanisms of these associations have scarcely been explored, as previously reviewed by Elkin et al.
6: ( 2020c).
7: The placenta, the multifaceted organ that supports the fetus during pregnancy, is at risk of TCE-induced toxic injury because it is capable of metabolizing TCE to its reactive metabolites (Burton and Fowden  2015), and is likely in direct contact with the chemical and its metabolites circulating in maternal blood (Laham  1970).
8: Indeed, one study reported TCE blood concentration levels of approximately 2 mg/L in females volunteers exposed to 100 ppm TCE for 4 h via inhalation (Fisher et al.
9: 1998).

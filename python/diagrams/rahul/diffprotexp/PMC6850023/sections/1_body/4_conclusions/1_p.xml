<p>In conclusion, 
 <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> SK2
 <sup>T</sup>, an important OHCB that can dominate microbial communities following marine oil spills, possesses the ability to degrade branched alkanes, which provides it a competitive advantage over many other marine alkane degraders that can only degrade linear alkanes. This study has significantly enhanced our understanding of the fundamental physiology of 
 <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> SK2
 <sup>T</sup> by the identification of the expressed enzymes for degrading linear and branched alkanes. It has also highlighted the differential expression of sets of β‐oxidation proteins to overcome steric hinderance from branched substrates.

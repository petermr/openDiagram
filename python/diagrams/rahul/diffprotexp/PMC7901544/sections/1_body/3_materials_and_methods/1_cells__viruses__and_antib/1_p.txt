0: Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells were purchased from ATCC.
1: The KPNA3-KO, KPNA4-KO LMH cells were generated in this study and stored in our laboratory.
2: All these cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium/F12 (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonsera, Shanghai, China) in 5% CO 2 incubator at 37C.
3: The FAdV-4 strain SD was isolated and stored in our laboratory, and propagated in LMH cells.
4: The recombinant virus FAdV-4-EGFP was generated and stored in our laboratory.
5: KPNA3 (ab6038) and KPNA4 (ab6039) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Abcam.
6: Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3B5 against Fiber-1 and mAb 3C2 against Fiber-2 were generated in our laboratory, and mAb 1C9 against Fiber-2 was kindly provided by Professor Hongjun Chen.

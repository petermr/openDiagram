0: The -carotene bleaching assay was performed using an emulsion prepared according to Smeriglio et al.
1: [ 37].
2: Aliquots of this emulsion (7.0 mL) were mixed with 0.28 mL of sample solution (range 40.5 mg/mL).
3: An emulsion without -carotene was used as control.
4: The reaction mixture was initially recorded at the starting time ( t = 0) at 470 nm and then incubated at 50 C in a water bath for 120 min, with the absorbance recorded every 20 min.
5: Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as the reference compound and the results were expressed as inhibition (%) of -carotene bleaching using Equation (1).

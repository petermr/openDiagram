<p>Finally, the reliability of the TTP diagram shall be discussed. All heat flow curves were shifted horizontally by Δ
 <italic>t</italic> (for a definition of Δ
 <italic>t</italic>, see 
 <xref rid="f4-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and the related text). The amount of Δ
 <italic>t</italic> varied between −2.7 s to +1.4 s; see 
 <xref rid="f14-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref>. As the largest values of Δ
 <italic>t</italic> are present at high temperatures, where the peak times are also relatively large, the influence of the time shift, Δ
 <italic>t</italic>, on the evaluated peak times is relatively small.

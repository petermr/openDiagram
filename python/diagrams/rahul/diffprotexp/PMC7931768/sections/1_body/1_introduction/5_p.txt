0: This pilot research study assessed whether an adhesive tape device ( https://dermtech.com), which is used in clinical practice for melanoma diagnosis, can recover informative RNA signals that would be specific of lupus disease pathogenesis from the epidermis of participants with DLE or SCLE, as compared and contrasted with healthy volunteers (HVs), and whether it can be used to identify a gene signature that may differentiate affected (A) from unaffected (U) skin.
1: To compare RNA tape gene signature results with a traditional sampling method, from each skin lesion, paired tape RNA and punch biopsy samples were taken.
2: Using punch biopsies, protein immunoreactivity from semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) was correlated with gene signature scores from tape RNA.

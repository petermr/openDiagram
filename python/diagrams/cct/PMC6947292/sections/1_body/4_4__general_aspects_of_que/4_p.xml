<p>If the reactions at higher temperatures are suppressed to a certain extent by higher cooling rates, another reaction (or multiple reactions) occur(s) at lower temperatures [

 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. The quench-induced MTRs and LTRs of precipitation hardening Al alloys may therefore initially give an increase in the fraction transformed with increasing cooling rates (see the enthalpy change of the LTR in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f040">Figure 40</xref>). This is also typically related to an increase in the reaction temperatures. The reason for this behaviour is increasing supersaturation (due to the increasing suppression of the HTRs). This increases the driving force for precipitation of the related phases (which typically competes for the same alloying element atoms, like the HTRs).

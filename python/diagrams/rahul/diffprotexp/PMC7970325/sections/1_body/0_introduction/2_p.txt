0: About 300 000 new cases of thyroid cancer are recorded globally each year [ 1].
1: Thyroid cancer is also the fifth most common cancer in women [ 1,  2], and it can move to the fourth place during the next decade [ 3].
2: Thyroid cancer is a common term for several heterogenous malignancies of thyroid gland, and its clinical manifestation, treatment and prognosis are generally defined by specific tumor subtypes.
3: There are three main types of cells from which thyroid cancers are derived: follicular thyroid cells, Hurthle cells, and parafollicular C cells [ 4].
4: The most common subtypes of thyroid cancer are follicular thyroid cell-derived tumors, including papillary thyroid cancer (PC), follicular thyroid cancer (FC), and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer [ 5].
5: In addition, a small proportion of thyroid malignancies belongs to parafollicular C cell-derived medullary thyroid cancer (MC) [ 6].
6: Molecular characterization of thyroid cancer subtypes can partially solve the problem of understanding specific carcinogenesis mechanisms and selecting appropriate treatments.

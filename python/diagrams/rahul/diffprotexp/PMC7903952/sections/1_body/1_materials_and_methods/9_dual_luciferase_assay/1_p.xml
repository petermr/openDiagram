<p>Psicheck Luciferase Reporter vectors (Sangon co., LTD, shanghai, china) ligated with Wild-Type (WT) and Mutant-Type (MUT) PPP1R14B/LINC00466 3ʹ-untranslated-regions (3ʹUTR) were established. Thereafter, HEK293T cells (Thermo Fisher, USA) were added into 48-well plates for 24 h of incubation. miR-137/NC and PPP1R14B/LINC00466 WT-vector/MUT-vector were co-transfected into cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used to analyze the results. Experiments were repeated at least three times.</p>

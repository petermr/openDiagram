<p id="p0015">In addition, resistance of recurrent thyroid cancers to radioactive iodine treatment, confirmed by observations, poses another challenge for early diagnostics of tumors prone not to respond to the standard therapy regimens [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such diagnostics could be used to individually tune treatments, e.g. by adjusting dosage of therapeutic agents and timeline of treatment [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Two decades ago, a connection between thyroid cancer radioactive iodine resistance and activity of sodium iodide symporter gene 
 <italic>SLC5A5</italic> was discovered [

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, it is clear that the problem has not been solved yet as there are no effective instruments in clinics to predict thyroid cancer resistance to radiation therapy [

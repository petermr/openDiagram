0: Transcriptome sequencing aims at the set of all transcripts, including mRNAs, rRNA, tRNA, and other noncoding RNAs, produced in one or a population of cells in a specific developmental stage or physiological condition [ 13].
1: In the present study, using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we screened a number of differential genes in the small intestinal tissue of Kazakh sheep after infection with  E. granulosus.
2: In terms of their functions, we concluded that innate immune response plays the first defense role in CE resistance in sheep.
3: In addition, adaptive immune response played an important role in defense against  E. granulosus infection.
4: Moreover, our study revealed that metabolic changes contribute to defense against  E. granulosus infection.
5: These findings laid the foundation for a discussion of the molecular mechanism of Kazakh sheep resistance to  E. granulosus.

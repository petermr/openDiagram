<sup>5</sup> bacteria/mL before use. A 0.1 mL portion from this bacterial dilution was spread on Mueller&#8211;Hinten (MH) agar (MHA, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Subsequently, sterile paper discs (Macherey-Nagel, D&#252;ren, Germany, LOT: 141112) 6 mm in diameter were placed within 15 min onto the inoculated agar surface containing 10 &#181;L of the essential oil or 10 &#181;L of sterile water as control. Petri dishes were incubated at 37 &#176;C for 24 &#177; 1 h. After incubation, the inhibition zones were measured as the complete inhibition in mm, as a diameter including the disc. The inhibition zones were measured in triplicate with a vernier caliper. The distance from the colonies closest to the disc to the center of the disc was doubled to obtain a diameter.

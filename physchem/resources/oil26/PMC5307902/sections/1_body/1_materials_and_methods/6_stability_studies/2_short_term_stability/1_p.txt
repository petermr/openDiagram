0: The short-term stability was evaluated by the micro-emultocrit technique (MET).
1: [ 32] The formulations were stored in closed containers at room temperature and were not homogenized before testing.
2: The heparin-free capillary tubes were filled to 75% with each formulation and placed in a micro-centrifuge (Quimis, model Q10.500, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at 10,500 rpm for 10 min.
3: The evaluation was realized at room temperature on the storage days 1 (D1), 30 (D30) and 90 (D90).
4: After the centrifugation cycle, the IC calculations were performed in accordance with (equation 2).
5: The short-term stability realized by the micro-emultocrit technique revealed not only, that the emulsion stability was highly influenced by the gravity acceleration, but also managed to predict influences provided in the HLB values.
6: The Stability measurements were made in triplicate for each of the three days.

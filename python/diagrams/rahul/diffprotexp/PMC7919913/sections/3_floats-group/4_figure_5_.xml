  <p>The target genes of miR-21 in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes were transfected with NC RNA, miR-21 mimic or miR-21 inhibitor for 72 h. RT-qPCR showed that miR-21 mimic inhibited the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH, whereas miR-21 inhibitor induced the expressions of SORBS2and ENH (A and B). Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of SORBS2 and ENH at the protein level were also inhibited by transfection of miR-21 mimic but induced by miR-21 inhibitor (C and D). *

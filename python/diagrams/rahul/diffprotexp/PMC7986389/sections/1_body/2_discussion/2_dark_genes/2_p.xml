<p id="Par42">In our experiments, we further selected the top 463 of the highest-weighted genes (i.e., the most differentially expressed genes; called the top-463 DEG set) to avoid an unbalanced gene number in comparison to the WMFVSs and WFVSs identified by the WMFVS and WFVS methods, respectively. For each of the cancer gene data sets, the precisions of the all-DEG set, top-463 DEG set, WMFVS and WFVS are shown in Fig.Â

<p id="Par47">BPI, a lipopolysaccharide-binding protein with bactericidal activity towards gram-negative organisms, neutralizes lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory responses, enhances phagocytosis regulation, and possesses anti-fungal properties [

Considering the overexpression of a broad spectrum of neutrophil granule-related genes (ELANE, BPI, MMP8, CRISP3, and CEACAM8) as well as DEFA3 in the CI group, following disruption of the cervical barrier, ascending vaginal microorganism infection may occur, causing intra-uterine inflammation/infection, maternal systemic inflammatory response, and neutrophil activation. Alpha defensin and MMP8 were previously proposed as biomarkers of PTB because of their higher concentrations in the amniotic fluid of PTBs than in that of full-term births [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, there is little information on their expression in CI. Our results showed that the serum concentration of alpha defensin 3 in the CI group was significantly higher than that in controls. Therefore, alpha defensin 3 is a candidate biomarker for CI.

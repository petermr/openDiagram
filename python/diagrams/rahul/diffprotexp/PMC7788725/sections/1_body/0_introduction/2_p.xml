<p id="Par30">To date, multiple mutation sites of LMNA (lamin A/C) related to DCM have been reported, such as LMNA-D300N, LMNA-H222P, and LMNA-N195K [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Also, increasing researches support that LMNA mutations cause DCM through dysregulation of various molecular pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, AKT/mTOR pathway, and WNT pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previous evidences had shown that MAPK pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway have abnormal activation in LMNA mutation induced-DCM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

<p id="Par18">We identified a total of 101, 114 and 116 differentially expressed miRNAs with known functions in the H1 vs H3, H1 vs H8 and H3 vs H8 in a pairwise fashion, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) in ovaries of Hu sheep. The key miRNAs identified include oar-let seven families (aâ€“d, f, g and i). The oar-let seven family is one of the first discovered miRNA groups, and its family members are highly conserved in sequences across animal species

 </sup>. The oar-let seven family were predominantly downregulated in H1 vs H3 compared to H1 vs H8 and H3 and H8 groups (up-regulated). These changes observed at the miRNA expression level could control different pathways. Also, miRNAs have been estimated to regulate more than one-third of protein-encoding mRNAs

 </sup>. Studies have shown that many non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs are involved in the regulation of ovarian development, influencing the reproductive ability of animals, and are closely related to ovarian tissue-related diseases

 <caption> The degree of liver injury caused by metastasis was recovered on day 12. The level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the serum was used as a marker of liver injury. The ALT levels increased to the maximum level on the 6th day (Day 6) after inoculation and returned to the control level on the 12th day (Day 12). On the 3rd (Day 3) and 6th day (Day 6), the ALT levels in the model rats were significantly higher than in the control rats, p &lt; 0.05(*), (n = 3 for each group). </caption>

<p>For practical heat treatment, as well as for heat treatment simulation of metals, their quench sensitivity, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., the transformation (respectively precipitation) behavior depending on the process temperature and duration, must be known. For steels, a broad range of isothermal time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams and continuous TTT diagrams exist [
 <xref rid="b1-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], because they can be determined by 
 <italic>in situ</italic> dilatometric methods. However, for aluminum alloys, such time-temperature-precipitation (TTP) diagrams have been scarcely available in the past, due to the lack of suitable 
 <italic>in situ</italic> characterization methods. Only a few isothermal TTP diagrams for aluminum alloys exist; these have been determined by 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> characterization methods.

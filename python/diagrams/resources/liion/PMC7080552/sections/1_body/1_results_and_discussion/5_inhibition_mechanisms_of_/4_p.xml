<p>In situ optical microscopy was employed to record the Li electrodeposition on the 3D Li–B–Mg composite and pure Li electrode in the carbonate‐based electrolyte. The results are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b and Videos S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. From Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, one can hardly observe dendrite formation on Li–B–Mg electrode surface, as shown in the first row of Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b. However, tremendous amount of Li cluster appears and it grows rapidly into irregular bulges during electrochemical plating. These results illustrate that the Li–B–Mg electrode is indeed capable of maintaining relatively flat surface by inhibiting dendrite growth during cycling.

0: The test microbes were taken from the broth culture with an inoculating loop and transferred to the test tubes containing 5.0 mL sterile distilled water.
1: The microbial suspension turbidity was adjusted to McFarland standard number 0.5, in Mueller Hinton Broth (Himedia, India).
2: A cotton swab was then used to inoculate the test tube suspension onto the surface of the Mueller Hinton agar plates and the plates were allowed to dry.
3: The agar was allowed to set and harden.
4: Holes were made by using a sterile cork borer from each petri-plate to ensure proper distribution of holes (cups) in the periphery and one in the centre.
5: Agar plugs were removed.
6: Different cork borers were used for different test organisms.
7: Two standard discs (6 mm in diameter) were transferred onto the agar surface by using sterile forceps.
8: Each hole was impregnated with 40 L of a sample solution containing 400, 600 and 800 g sample.
9: This was done also for methanol (negative control) as a blank.
10: These plates were kept for half an hour at a low temperature so that the test materials were diffused to the surrounding medium by this time.
11: The plates were then incubated at 37 C for 20 h. The diameter of the inhibition zone against each microorganism was measured by slide calipers and compared the results with standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin (5 g/disc) and tetracycline (30 g/disc) (positive control).

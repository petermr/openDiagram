<p>Western blotting was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], with some modifications. Equal amounts of whole protein extracts were suspended in 6x Laemmli Sample Buffer, heated, loaded, and then electrophoresed on Pre-Casted TGX-SDS gels (Bio-Rad, CA). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad Turbo Trans-Blot apparatus. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBST [25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20] overnight at 4°C and the appropriate primary antibodies were added overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then washed with TBST and probed with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) secondary antibodies at 22°C for 1 h. Blots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal Femto, Pierce, IL) and images were obtained using a VersaDoc 1000 system (Bio-Rad, CA). All Western blots were performed at least in triplicate from three independent experiments, and densitometry analyses were normalized to β-actin expression using NIH ImageJ (v1.47d). Data from Western blots is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.). Student’s t-test analyses were employed and statistical significance was established as *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01.

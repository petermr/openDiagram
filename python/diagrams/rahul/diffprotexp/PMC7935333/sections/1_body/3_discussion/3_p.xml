<p>In the present study, we screened out six hub genes from the whole PPI network. According to the existing studies, the hub genes play key roles in multiple cancer-related biological processes. 
 <italic>CD3D, CD3E</italic> and 
 <italic>CD3G</italic> are located in the same cluster on chromosome 11, and encode a group of polypeptide named CD3-delta, CD3-gamma and CD3 epsilon. These polypeptides, along with the T-cell receptor alpha/beta and gamma/delta heterodimers, form the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex (TCR/CD3 complex) which plays an important role in coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular signalling pathways.

 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It was reported that 
 <italic>CD3D, CD3E</italic> and 
 <italic>CD3G</italic> were associated with improved OS in five cancer types, including breast cancer.
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> According to the survival analysis of TCGA data, this is consistent with our result. Another immune-associated hub gene, 
 <italic>ITK</italic>, encodes an essential intracellular tyrosine kinase expressed in T-cells, which is thought to play a role in T-cell proliferation and differentiation.

 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Research of ibrutinib, an inhibitor of both ITK and BTK, demonstrated that inhibiting ITK could shift the balance between Th1 and Th2 T cells and potentially enhance antitumor immune responses.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, the effect of 
 <italic>ITK</italic> on breast cancer has not been elucidated so far.

<p>Genome wide association study of common SNVs discovered that multiple common SNVs locating on 
 <italic>PTBP3</italic> gene had significant differences in allele frequency between severe and mild influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected patient groups. The gene and segment based analysis of the joint effect of common SNVs emphasized the importance of the 
 <italic>PTBP3</italic> and 
 <italic>LEAP2</italic> gene. PTBP3 belongs to the PTB family of RNA binding protein and is a regulator of cell differentiation. Interestingly, PTBP3 protein has been found to be highly restricted to B cells where it played pivotal role in regulating antibody diversification [

 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>LEAP2</italic> encodes a cysteine-rich cationic antimicrobial peptide that is expressed predominantly in the liver and plays a vital role in host immunity. 
 <italic>LEAP2</italic> has been suggested to be related to a potential mechanism of microbial translocation and subsequent immune activation in HIV-infected and HCV-infected patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In general, these discoveries showed that common SNVs might play an important role that could not be ignored in severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

<p>We quantified changes in the proteome using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) identifying proteins significantly up‐regulated, while growing on either linear alkanes (tetradecane,

 <sub>14</sub>) or pristane (the branched alkane 2,6,10,14‐Tetramethylpentadecane) looking at the key differences in the expression patterns on each substrate.

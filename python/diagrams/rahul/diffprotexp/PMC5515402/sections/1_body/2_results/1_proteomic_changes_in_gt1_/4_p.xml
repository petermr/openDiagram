<p>Overexpressed proteins in the category of glucose metabolism were: succinyl-CoA ligase [GDP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial (SUCB2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH/G3P), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), and alpha-enolase (ENOA). In this same category, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6A1, mitochondrial (CX6A1) was underexpressed. In the category of cell motility, cofilin-1 (COF1) and vinculin (VCL) were found overexpressed and underexpressed, respectively. In proteins associated to cell cycle regulation, enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) was underexpressed, while COF1 was also associated with this category. Other overexpressed proteins for the cellular stress response, were stress-induced-phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) and heat shock protein HSP90-beta (HSP90B). Similar overexpression patterns were obtained for glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 &amp; 2 (GSTM1 &amp; 2), two key proteins associated with detoxification processes. On the other hand, overexpression of disulfide-isomerase A6 (PDIA6), a protein related to protein modification and binding, was also observed. In the category of transport-related proteins, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 28 homolog (VPS28) was found underexpressed. Finally, ERH, a protein linked to RNA binding and cell cycle, and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), a regulatory protein of nucleotide binding, were found underexpressed. Six proteins, FLNA, HSP90B, ENOA, G3P, PGAM and PPIA were represented in multiple spots and were also emphasized in Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180409.t001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180409.t002">2</xref>. From the 23 identified proteins, only two of them were found both overexpressed and underexpressed in different spots. These proteins were filamin (FLNA) and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA), in the categories of cell motility and protein modification and binding, respectively.

<p id="Par33">A total of 20 miRNAs were moved to a secondary list, which were known in previous reports to be involved in grain filling in rice. Of the new DGEs detected, around 50 miRNAs had the least of single occurrence and 3 miRNAs (namely: miR 159b, miR397b and miR1846e) occurred to a maximum in all the 6 stages. While 46 miRNAs were negatively regulated, 38 miRNAs were positively regulated including all the 3 stages of grain filling among SR-159 vs. SR-157. In 37 miRNAs FC was detected to reverse either from positive to negative or vice versa between SR-159 vs. SR-157 (Supplementary Table

<p>In the urine, 1,161 proteins were identified. Urine samples from healthy controls were compared to urine samples from different lung adenocarcinoma groups to obtain differential protein levels. Proteins that were upregulated by &gt;1.5-fold or downregulated by &lt;0.67-fold in urine were considered significant. Based on this rule, levels of 461 urine proteins were increased, and levels of 332 proteins were decreased (

We had carried on the thorough analysis to the result and discovered the expression of the prostate-specific antigen, and prostatic acid phosphatase decreased significantly in the metastatic group (stages III and IV) and neutrophil defensin 1 increased significantly in the metastatic group compared to the nonmetastatic group (stages I and II) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(c)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref>). Changes in these proteins were consistent with those reported in the literature.

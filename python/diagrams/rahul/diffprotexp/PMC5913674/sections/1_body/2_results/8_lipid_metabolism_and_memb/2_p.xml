<p>A range of proteins involved in fatty acid lipid metabolism were also among DEPs. These included 3 fatty acid acyltransferases in WB-MtzR, including significant downregulation of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase (12 109) and upregulation of the glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase homologue (5772) involved in protein myristoylation modifications. The majority of the long chain fatty acid CoA ligases (gLCFACL) were unchanged in expression in MtzR lines, though 17 170 was upregulated in both WB-MtzR and 713-MtzR. Among proteins involved in neutral lipid metabolism, only 1 putative phospholipase-B like protein (115 159) was identified, which was upregulated in 106-MtzR. Multiple proteins related to inositol signaling lipids were detected among DEPs, although none observed in 713-MtzR. In WB-MtzR upregulation of inositol 5-phosphatase 4 (gI5Pase) (9077) and inositol-3-phosphate synthase (17 579) proteins was observed, while 106-MtzR, in contrast, downregulated gI5Pase along with a putative gPI4P5K.</p>

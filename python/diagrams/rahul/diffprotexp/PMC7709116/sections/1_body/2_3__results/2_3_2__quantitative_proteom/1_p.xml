<p>We adopted and further optimized a recent low input sample preparation protocol for MS/proteomic profiling of FACS-purified cells [
 <xref rid="B25-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our goals were to minimize sample handling, and to improve the lysis of fixed cells and the TMT labeling and fractionation of relatively low amounts of TMT-labeled tryptic peptides (~2 µg). The FANS-sorted D1 and D2 nuclei (i.e., 50,000 from the approximately 80,000 nuclei that were isolated from each pair of mice that constituted a biological replicate) were isolated in individual microTubes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), lysed, and the proteins were digested to peptides using Pressure-Cycling Technology (PCT) with MicroPestles and Caps in a Barocycler 2320 EXT. PCT with a MicroPestle, which is a disposable mechanical tissue homogenizer that fits inside the microTube sample container, was used to perform tissue homogenization and protein extraction by alternating cycles of ultra-high and low hydrostatic pressures [
 <xref rid="B26-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Under repeated pulses of high hydrostatic pressure, the PCT-microTube walls collapse around the incompressible Teflon MicroPestle, creating a homogenizer-like environment. Additionally, the pressure cycle also acts directly on the sample, further disrupting membranes and solubilizing the proteins. These two concurrent actions contribute to more efficient tissue lysis and protein extraction, even for fixed tissues. After trypsin digestion, which also was carried out using PCT, each digest was then transferred to a C18 Stage tip for sample desalting and on-column TMT labeling that avoids an extra desalting step. After confirming the labeling efficiency, the 10 individual samples, which included one blank and one pooled carrier sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), were mixed and fractionated by high pH SDB-RPS to reduce the complexity of the full proteome digests and increase the numbers of identified peptides and proteins. Sample losses were minimized by carrying out the SDB-RPS peptide fractionation in stage tips [

 <xref rid="B33-proteomes-08-00027" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Initially, the mass spectrometer carries out MS1 scans during which labeled peptides with the same sequence (and thus mass) from the 10 different samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-08-00027-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) appear as single unresolved, additive mass/charge (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic>) precursor ions. After CID MS/MS fragmentation of the precursor peptide ion, the top 10 fragment ions for each peptide MS2 were “notched out” and co-fragmented with HCD to produce MS3 scans that were analyzed in the Orbitrap. Maxquant was used to process the raw data with the MS3 spectra being used to quantify relative peptide and protein intensity.

0: The  matK sequences of  O. caudata (Nees) Mez,  O. cujumary Mart., and  O. caniculata (Rich.)
1: were assembled and edited using FinchTV (biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand).
2: Sequences were checked against those in GenBank using the BLAST algorithm.
3: The  matK sequences from  O. caudata (Nees) Mez,  O. cujumary Mart., and  O. caniculata (Rich.)
4: were aligned with sequences from  O. floribunda (gbEU153866.1),  O. veraguensis (gb.JQ589849.1), and  O. whitei (gb.
5: JQ589831.1) available in GenBank.
6: The sequences were edited using BioEdit V7.2.5 [ 47] and the alignment was performed using the Clustal W [ 48].
7: The distance genetic and Phylogenetic Tree was determined using Mega 7 Program [ 49].
8: The evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method and the evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter model with 10,000 replicates.
9: The outgroups used for the construct phylogenetic tree were the  matK sequences from  Calycanthus chinensis (Cc) (gb|AY525339.1),  Idiospermum australiense (Ia) (gi71891392), and  Chimonanthus zhejiangensis (Cz) (gb|AY525341.1) belonging to the order Laurales and Calycanthaceae family.

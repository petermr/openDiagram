<p>The seasonal spread of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus remains the main subtype in intensive care patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which alerted us to speed up research on severe viral infection. In this study, we systematically studied the molecular mechanism underlying the disease severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection using a host-based WGS method. The results revealed several novel host-related candidate genes and putative pathways associated with severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection from different categories, including common SNVs and rare functional SNVs.

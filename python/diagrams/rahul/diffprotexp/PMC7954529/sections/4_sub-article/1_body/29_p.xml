<p>For the gene functions please see comments to other reviewers above. We do not have a great way to annotate if a gene is expected to show differential regulation between species other than by overlapping the genes with other regulatory traits as we have done here. We note in the results the number of genes that we have APA and protein data for (3,391) and the number of genes we tested for expression and APA (7,462).</p>

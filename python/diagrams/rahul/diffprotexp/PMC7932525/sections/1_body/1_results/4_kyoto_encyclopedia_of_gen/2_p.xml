<p>To determine the main biological functions of the identified DEGs, GO functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed. All 2,044 DEGs were assigned to three GO categories, including biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Most of these DEGs were involved in the following functions: cofactor transferase activity, cofactor binding, substrate-specific transporter activity, catalytic activity, acting on a protein, and transition metal ion binding. Moreover, most DEGs contributed to cellular and metabolic processes, including those pertaining to organic cyclic compounds, heterocyclic compounds, small molecules, and phosphorus. Most corresponding proteins were located in the cell membrane including the intrinsic and integral parts of the membrane.

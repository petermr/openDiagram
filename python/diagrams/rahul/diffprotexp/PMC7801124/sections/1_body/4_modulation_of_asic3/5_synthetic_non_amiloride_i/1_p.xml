<p>Abbott Laboratories reported A-317,567 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6b</xref>) as the first small molecule blocker of native and recombinant ASICs, including ASIC3 [
 <xref rid="cit0186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. This molecule is peripherally active and ~4 times more potent against ASIC3 than amiloride with an in vitro IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 9.5 µM (at pH 4.5) and an in vivo analgesic effect from 9 µmol/kg (in rats). Importantly, A-317,567 showed potent analgesic effects in rat models of inflammatory and post-operative pain without affecting the urine output (at concentrations up to 30 µmol/kg), as well as crossing the BBB (&lt;20-fold concentration vs periphery) [

The CNS penetration and thus potential for therapeutic and/or side effects was further evaluated, specifically the anxiolytic effect with mixed effects being observed [

<p>At 440 °C, 10% of the precipitated volume is reached after about 135 s, and at 300 °C, the same relative volume is reached after 80 s. For the high and medium temperature range, the precipitation temperatures and times can be correlated with the continuous cooling precipitation diagram in

 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The same batch of EN AW-6005A and the same solution annealing parameters were applied [
 <xref rid="b31-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, during continuous cooling, only two main precipitation areas were found: within a temperature range of about 480 °C to 390 °C, the precipitation of coarse β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si (up to some 10 μm in length) nucleating at large primary precipitates was detected. At temperatures between about 390 °C and 230 °C, the precipitation of precursor phases, like β’ and B’, were found. Those precipitates were much more homogenously distributed.

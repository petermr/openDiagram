<p id="Par7">Tissue samples were mechanically disrupted and homogenized using a Mini-BeadBeater-8 (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, Oklahoma). RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). RNA concentration and integrity were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (Columbus, Ohio). All samples had an RNA Integrity Value (RIN) of &gt; 7.5. RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (Wooster, Ohio). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, California) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, California) as 100 base pair (bp) paired-end reads.</p>

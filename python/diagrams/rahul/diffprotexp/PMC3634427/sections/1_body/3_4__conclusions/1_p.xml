<p>The initial growth inhibition under dehydration conditions occurs prior to any inhibition of photosynthesis or respiration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94-ijms-14-04912">94</xref>]. Cell growth is among the primary processes to be affected by abiotic constraints, especially drought and cold. Growth is limited by the plant’s ability to osmotically adjust or conduct water, and this is normally done by the accumulation of osmotically active compounds. Soluble sugars act as potential signals, interacting with light, nitrogen and abiotic stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95-ijms-14-04912">95</xref>]. The accumulation of sugars under chilling temperatures follows the same trend in both species. Our results suggest an important role of sucrose, fructose and glucose in acclimation to cold. On the other hand, there is a larger carbohydrate accumulation in Désirée when submitted to osmotic stress. It suggests that the cleavage of sucrose might play a key function in Désirée under osmotic stress. Furthermore, our results are consistent, at least for Désirée, with the suggested relationship between the downregulation of ascorbate peroxidase, the downregulation of photosynthesis related proteins and lower growth.

0: Preparation of cDNA libraries and Illumina novaseq 6000 RNA sequencing were performed at Novogene Co., LTD (Beijing, China).
1: Differential expression analysis of HCAECs incubated with serum from acute KD patients with CAL (KD-CAL+,  n = 3) or KD without CAL (KD-CAL,  n = 3) was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.16.1).
2: DESeq2 provides statistical routines for determining differential expression in digital gene expression data using a model based on the negative binomial distribution.
3: Genes with a  P-value<0.05 found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed.

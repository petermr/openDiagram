<p>sgRNAs targeting the 
 <italic>egfp</italic> and 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic> gene, and the donor plasmid, with each 2 μg, were co-transfected into LMH cells. 24 h post-transfection, the LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4-EGFP at 0.1 MOI. The rescued 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAdV-4, designated as FAdV-4_Fiber-2_del7-40aa (FAV4_Del), was then purified through limiting dilution assays and virus plaque assays. The purified FAv4_Del was further identified by western blot, PCR and sequencing. Moreover, Co-IP was also carried out to evaluate the interaction between KPNA3/4 and FAV4-Del.

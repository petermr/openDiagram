<p id="Par8">The steel in this study was a modified C38 tempering steel forged into shape and subsequently inductively surface hardened. Its chemical composition is specified by the manufacturer to be according to the ranges listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Its base microstructure was pearlitic-ferritic with a grain size of approximately 30 μm and contained randomly distributed MnS inclusions. These did not affect the hardening process and are irrelevant to the following investigation. The hardening was performed to heat treat a minimum depth of 3 mm from the surface. Samples for dilatometry were cut from untreated zones of the component shafts, measuring 10 mm in length and 4 mm in diameter, and tested using a Bähr DIL805A quenching dilatometer. The phase transformation temperatures were determined at a heating rate (HR) of 3 Kmin
 <sup>−1</sup>, noting a distinct split of Ac
 <sub>1</sub> into a starting temperature Ac
 <sub>1b</sub> and an end temperature Ac
 <sub>1e</sub>. All of these temperatures increase with heating rate, so that the heat treatment in practice, with a heating rate of 81.67 Ks
 <sup>−1</sup>, experiences Ac
 <sub>1b</sub> at 790 °C, Ac
 <sub>1e</sub> at 840 °C and Ac
 <sub>3</sub> at 895 °C. Differing cooling rates were examined at this heating rate up to an austenitisation temperature of 1000 °C, with 10 seconds of holding time to allow for appropriate austenitisation of the samples. The material exhibits a distinct bainite nose between

<p>Agmatine, (an arginine metabolite, structurally similar to GMQ) and arcaine (an analogue of agmatine) have also been shown to activate ASIC3 at pH 7.4 through interaction with the non-proton sensing domain, also referred to as the palm domain region of the receptor [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7e</xref>) had the greatest effect (on both transient and sustain phase currents) at pH 5.0, increasing currents by 20% (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.2 mM) and 7% (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9.7 mM), respectively. Given that inflammation increases both ASIC3 and agmatine expression [

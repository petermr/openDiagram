<p>Additionally, a weak diffraction hallo could be seen for PC5 (15.3°), respectively, PC12 (15.2°), which is shifted to lower diffraction angle values comparing with the broad reflection centered at 22.6° for CAR, accounting for the contributions of the amorphous macromolecular regions. The blue-shifting of this diffraction contribution could imply the formation of chain entanglements between PVA and ι-carrageenan in the amorphous macromolecular domains. This behavior has also been documented for PVA/chitosan [

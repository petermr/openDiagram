<p id="Par16">To determine whether these conclusions are sensitive to the pulling speed used in the SMD simulations we have performed simulations in which the pulling speed is 5-fold larger,

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) indicating that, consistent with the slower pulling speed, ErmCL is harder to pull through the tunnel than H-NS. Thus, our conclusions do not depend on pulling speed. In the rest of this study we report results in which v = 5 m/s in the SMD simulations.

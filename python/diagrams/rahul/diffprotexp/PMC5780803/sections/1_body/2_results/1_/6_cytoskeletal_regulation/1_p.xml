<p>Overall, 3 proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization were upregulated in Caki-1 cells and the relative ratios were all &gt;1.5 at the three time points (
 <xref rid="f7-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Among them, Î±-actinin-1 (ACTN1) cross-linked with the actin cytoskeleton, through cadherin, integrins, vinculin, catenin or talin, and mediated the adhesion of adjacent cells or the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix (

 <xref rid="f7-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Additionally, the expression of COL1A1, which can promote cell adhesion and cell proliferation, was also increased (
 <xref rid="b23-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The cytoskeletal PDZ-LIM protein family has a PDZ domain with a scaffolding function through which the coordinated assembly of proteins can occur. These results indicate that XIAP participates in cytoskeletal regulation through ACTN1, COL1A1 and PDLIM7.

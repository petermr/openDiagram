<p>Furthermore, the structure design of SCEs plays a significant role for strong inhibition of the lithium dendrite growth. For instance, an SCE consisting of rigid LAGP pellet and soft PEO‐1%‐75%Li
 <sub>2</sub>S·24%P
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>5</sub>·1%P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> (LPOS) layer (ASSLB) was fabricated, which presents excellent chemical stability against the lithium metal and great inhibition to lithium dendrite growth (Figure

 <sup>−2</sup> current density at 60 °C, indicating that the interface between SCE and lithium metal maintains stably during the long‐period test. Wang et al.

 <sub>8</sub>/LiTFSI layer (≈100 nm) (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1507-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). The quite less resistance offers sufficient ionic conduction and high mechanical module, which successfully protects the Li metal from reacting with LAGP and suppresses the lithium dendrite nucleation due to excellent interfacial contact with Li metal. Therefore, the PEO‐polymer coating layer on the LAGP based SCE can effectively reduce the interfacial impedance and homogenize the Li‐ion flux to suppress Li dendrite formation, which also can prevent the side reaction between LAGP and Li metal anode.

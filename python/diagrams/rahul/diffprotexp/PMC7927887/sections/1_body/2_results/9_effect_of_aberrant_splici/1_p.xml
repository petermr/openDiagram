<p>A survival analysis was performed on a subset of the data, splitting samples with t(11;14) and t(4;14) into the high, medium, and low number of novel splice junctions. Survival analysis for the t(11;14) group showed a non-significant difference in PFS in the t(11;14) with a high number of novel splice junctions 
 <italic>versus</italic> low, but no difference in OS (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S6</italic>). OS and PFS for the t(4;14) group showed a significant adverse survival in the high splice group within t(4;14) (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.009 and 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig006">Figure 6C</xref> and D). To determine additional features that may contribute to this ultra high-risk group, we performed a univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Features in the univariate analysis included the number of driver mutations (0-4, 5-9 and 10+ mutations), ISS (I, II and III), novel splice site group (high, medium and low), bi-allelic inactivation of 
 <italic>TP53</italic>, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (&gt;4.6%), and double-hit (being defined as amp1q on a background of ISS III or bi-allelic inactivation of 
 <italic>TP53</italic>).

 </sup> Bi-allelic inactivation of 
 <italic>TP53</italic>, double-hit, high novel splicing, having more than ten driver mutations, and LOH were associated with poorer PFS (
 <italic>P</italic>≤0.05). High novel splicing, LOH, double-hit and bi-allelic inactivation of 
 <italic>TP53</italic> were associated with poorer OS (
 <italic>P</italic>≤0.05). Next, we took the features found significant in the univariate analysis as co-variates in the multivariate analysis to see how they jointly impact PFS and OS. In the analysis for PFS, only double-hit remained significant, but for OS, only high splicing remained close to significant (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.051, hazard ratio 6.62 [95%CI: 0.99-44.14]) (

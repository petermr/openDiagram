0: All aerobic nitrogen fixation occurs in heterocysts in a semiregular pattern, and nitrogen fixed in heterocysts is transported to vegetative cells in the filament; vegetative cells supply carbon and reductants to heterocysts [ 6,  9].
1: The heterocyst is the site of dinitrogen fixation and provides oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase with a low-oxygen environment [ 10].
2: In general, heterocysts lack photosystem II activity and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, and they cannot photoreduce CO 2 via the reductive pentose phosphate pathway to provide carbon skeletons for assimilation of fixed nitrogen [ 6,  11 13].
3: The heterocyst develops a special glycolipid layer that serves as a gas diffusion barrier, and the heterocyst glycolipid layer can be modified in response to the external O2 concentration [ 10,  14].
4: However, other studies suggested that heterocysts are not the only cells capable of nitrogen fixation in heterocystous cyanobacteria and that vegetative cells can fix molecular nitrogen using another nitrogenase encoded by a homologous gene cluster named as nif2 [ 15].
5: Mutants of heterocystous cyanobacteria ( het) that fail to produce heterocysts retain their nitrogen fixation ability when incubated under micro-oxic or anoxic conditions [ 16].
6: Thus, studies are needed to evaluate the nitrogen fixation ability of vegetative cells and photosynthetic ability of heterocysts in cyanobacteria.

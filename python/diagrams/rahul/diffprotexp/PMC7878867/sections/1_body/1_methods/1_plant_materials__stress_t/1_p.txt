0: Two Australian durum wheat varieties, DBA Artemis and DBA Aurora, were grown in controlled glasshouse conditions as previously described 4.
1: Both varieties originate from South Australia with good tolerance to abiotic stresses: DBA Aurora having higher tolerance towards water-deficit stress and DBA Artemis having higher tolerance towards heat stress 4.
2: The seeds used for the current study were collected from the parent plants in the control group and parent plants in the water-deficit stress group from the previous year 4.
3: Here, four seed groups were planted: AtC (DBA Artemis seeds from control group parents), AtW (DBA Artemis seeds from water-deficit stress group parents), AuC (DBA Aurora seeds from control group parents), and AuW (DBA Aurora seeds from water-deficit stress group parents).
4: Progeny from each parent group were treated with control or water-deficit stress again, thus totalling eight treatment groups: AtCC (DBA Artemis control group parents, progeny treated with control), AtCW (DBA Artemis control group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress), AtWC (DBA Artemis water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with control), AtWW (DBA Artemis water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress); AuCC (DBA Aurora control group parents, progeny treated with control), AuCW (DBA Aurora control group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress), AuWC (DBA Aurora water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with control), AuWW (DBA Aurora water-deficit stress group parents, progeny treated with water-deficit stress).
5: See Supplementary Table  S1 for a summary of the treatment groups.

  <title>Characterization of as-cast BT
   <italic>X</italic> rods with a diameter of 10 mm.

  <p>(
   <bold>a–h</bold>) The back-scattered scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of BT15, BT20, BT30, BT40, BT60, BT80, BT90, and BT95, respectively. BT15 shows a fully amorphous structure, and other samples have a two-phase microstructure. The growing intensities of the diffraction peaks (110) of β-Ti from BT20 to BT95 suggest an increasing volume fraction of β-Ti. (
   <bold>i</bold>) The X-ray diffraction patterns of BT
   <italic>X</italic>. The compositions of BT
   <italic>X</italic> are designed using the lever rule and calculated by equitation (5), as listed in 
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>. The designed mole fractions, 
   <italic>x</italic>, of β-Ti have a strong influence on the final microstructure and the measured volume fractions of β-Ti are listed in 
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>.

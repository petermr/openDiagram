0: The aim of this work is to investigate the   in vitro cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of the essential oils of   Aloysia citriodora Palau, harvested in different regions of Morocco.
1: The chemical profile was established using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.
2: The cytotoxic activity against P815, MCF7, and VERO cell lines as well as the normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was evaluated using the MTT assay.
3: Standard, ATCC, strains of bacteria (  Escherichia coli,   Staphylococcus aureus, and   Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were cultivated in Muller Hinton media.
4: Then, agar disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using microdilution method.
5: The essential oils obtained were predominantly composed of   -spathulenol (15.61%), Ar-curcumene (14.15%), trans-caryophyllene oxide (14.14%), and neral (10.02%).
6: The results of the assays showed that the cytotoxic effect of the essential oil of   A. citriodora was high on P815 and moderate on MCF7 and on VERO cell lines.
7: However, no cytotoxic effect was observed on PBMCs.
8: On the other hand, essential oils showed a significant antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
9: MICs ranged between 2.84 and 8.37 mg/ml.
10: Essential oil of   A. citriodora leaves possesses significant antibacterial effect and cytotoxic activity against tumor cell lines.

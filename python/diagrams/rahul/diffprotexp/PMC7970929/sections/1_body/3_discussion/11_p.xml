<p id="Par37">Another consequence of salt stress is an ionic imbalance which leads to ion-induced injury and disturbance in water homeostasis. In response to ionic imbalance, most of the halophytes and glycophytes accumulate a number of low molecular mass compatible solutes i.e. proline, betaine, and sugars to accommodate an excess of ions in the vacuole

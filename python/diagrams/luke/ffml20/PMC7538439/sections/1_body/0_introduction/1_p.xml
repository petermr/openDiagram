<p id="Par3">Since the discovery of solid molecular hydrogen in 1899, the nature of this phase has remained controversial

 </sup>. It is now believed that the solid “Phase I” comprises rotating hydrogen molecules on a hexagonal close-packed lattice

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. With increasing pressure the rotation becomes hindered
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup> by intermolecular interactions, both steric and electrostatic, leading ultimately to phase transformations to a low temperature Phase II
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, in which quadrupole–quadrupole interactions (EQQ) arrest the rotation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, and a high-pressure Phase III
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>

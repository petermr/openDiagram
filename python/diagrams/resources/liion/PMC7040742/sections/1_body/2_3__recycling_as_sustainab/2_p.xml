<p>Spent LIBs represent a large environmental risk owing to the fluorinated components, organic solvents, nanoparticles, and leachable metals in their composition [

 <xref rid="B6-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. First, to minimize these risks, proper gas cleaning systems should exist in all recycling facilities to minimize the emission of fluoride and organic volatile compounds during battery crushing, pretreatment, and smelting [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the costs of off-gas cleaning systems for pyrometallurgical process plants are high [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Second, caution should be exercised regarding the propagation of nanoparticles in air and water sources. The crushing and heat treatment of LIBs promote the release of nanoparticles, which could present significant ecotoxicological effects [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; thus, pyrometallurgical process plants should be equipped with off-gas cleaning systems. The waste effluent of hydrometallurgical processes should be properly treated (using coagulation and filtration) to avoid the dispersion of nanoparticles and toxic soluble compounds. Lastly, the disposal of spent LIBs in landfills raises concerns as the toxic and heavy metals in these LIBs, such as Cr, Co, Cu, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Tl [
 <xref rid="B3-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], could contaminate ground water sources.

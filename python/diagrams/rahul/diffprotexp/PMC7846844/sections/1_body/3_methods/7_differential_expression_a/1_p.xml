Then, it is calculated by taking the intersection of the potential lincRNA obtained from the pipeline to obtain the differentially expressed lincRNA (DELincRNA), at the same time, it is intersected with the protein coding gene expressed in the sample to obtain a differentially expressed protein encoding gene.

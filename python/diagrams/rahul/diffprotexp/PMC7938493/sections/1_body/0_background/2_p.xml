<p id="Par41">RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with RNA to form ribonucleoprotein complexes that regulate RNA expression and function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As important participants in post-transcriptional regulation, RBPs are involved in almost all post-transcriptional regulation processes, including RNA splicing, translation, transport, localisation, degradation, and stabilisation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. RBP dysregulation has been reported in multiple cancers, which affects tumorigenesis and development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the knowledge of RBP-related mechanisms in the development of cancer remains rudimentary and inconclusive. Therefore, clarification of the roles of RBPs in BLCA will help us to better understand tumour pathogenesis and develop prognostic and response biomarkers.

<p>The vibrational spectroscopic response of bound water was monitored in thin birnessite films exposed to water vapor (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>). First, we note that the O–H stretching (ν
 <sub>1</sub>) region (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a,d) responds to water uptake through the development of (i) a 3230 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> band from O–H stretches with strong intermolecular coupling and from the Fermi resonance (2·ν
 <sub>2</sub>) of the bending mode (ν
 <sub>2</sub> ≈ 1630 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), (ii) a 3400 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> band from water involved in a hydrogen bonding network with other water molecules, and (iii) a ∼3562 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> band from water molecules that are directly hydrogen-bonded with oxygens of the basal faces of the interlayer region. This latter assignment is supported by our previous work on layered aluminosilicates, as by our molecular simulations to be presented in the following section.

 <italic>et al.</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>) For example, a double-band for AcidBir during outgassing (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>c) could be evidence for coexisting water populations under low water loadings. We will, however, not focus on this aspect of hydration in this study.

<p>The composition of the equilibrium phases for selected mixture points at 323 K was experimentally determined. The mixtures were gravimetrically prepared, agitated and left to separate for 12 h under temperature control. The equilibrium phases were carefully separated to determine the respective concentration of IL, CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and water in each phase. All mixing points were made in duplicate. DLS measurements were performed to evaluate the variation in [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]
 <sup>+</sup> aggregate size as a function of CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH concentration. A constant [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl concentration of 20.0 wt.% was used in all DLS measurements, corresponding to the micellar regime of this surfactant [

Samples were irradiated with a HeNe laser (λ = 565 nm) and the intensity fluctuations of the scattered light were detected at a backscattering angle of 173° to generate an autocorrelation function. The autocorrelation function was corrected from the default settings for deionized water by adjusting for the solution viscosity (3.586 cP) and refractive index (1.3324). The cumulant analysis of this function provided by the software DTS v 7.03 yielded the particle size and the distribution width. Each composition tested was analyzed three times to ensure the formation of stable aggregates. Ultrapure water was used in all analyses.

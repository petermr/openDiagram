<p>The network from the TNA algorithm was filtered by DEGs from Elk-1-VP16 and PEA3-VP16 overexpression microarray results to create a much more unique regulatory network of ETS members. As a result of filtering, a final regulatory network was constructed with 3366 target genes and 6610 interactions with ETS regulons, and the gene regulatory network was visualized with Cytoscape (

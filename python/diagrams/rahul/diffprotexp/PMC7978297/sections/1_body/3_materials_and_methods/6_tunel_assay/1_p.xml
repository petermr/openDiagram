<p>The stained ovarian sections were examined using a TUNEL BrightGreen Apoptosis Detection Kit (Vazyme, A112-03, Nanjing, China). According to the instructions for usage, after incubation of the secondary antibody for MVH in histological staining workflow, the slides were washed twice with PBS and treated with proteinase K for 10 min. Following two further washes with PBS, the slides were incubated with 1 × Equilibration Buffer for 25 min at room temperature, and the BrightGreen Labeling Mix was applied at 37 ℃ for 80 min. Then, the samples were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 for cell nuclei and sealed for observation under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51, Japan).</p>

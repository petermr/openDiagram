 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows the contraction of cross-sectional area (RA) of high-alloy mould steel in different temperature. RA increases from 57.6 % in 1623 K, to 86 % in 1473 K. The samples show good ductility between 1198–1523K, and the RAs are above approximately 70 %, reaching to 89 %. The RA decreases along with the temperature, when the temperature is lower than 1323 K. Mintz. etc 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> have observed the increase of continuous slab surface cracking when the RA is less than 40%. So, the RA value of 40 % was set as a criterion to evaluate the brittleness. From our results, the III brittle zone of high-alloy mould steel was 973–1148 K, which is also the cracking susceptibility zone suggesting the low ductility of slab. Moreover, due to the high carbon content, there was no II brittle zone, which is distinctive with other high-strength steel with low alloy content. As a conclusion, the straightening temperature should be above 1148 K to avoid the cracking in slab during the continuous casting.

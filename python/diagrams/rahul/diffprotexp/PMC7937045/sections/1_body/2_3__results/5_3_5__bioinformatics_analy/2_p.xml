<p>In the BP analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>), the biological processes associated with cell proliferation, including DNA replication, chromosome assembly, and organization, as well as beta-catenin-TCF complex assembly, were significantly altered relative to normal samples. Changes in biological processes also changed cellular components and molecular functions. In the CC analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>), significant changes in cancer patients included the interaction of cellular genetic material and DNA proteins. In the MF analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>), changes in histone binding were most pronounced, because histidine is abundantly present in the cell chromatin, and the protein regulates changes in genetic material by binding to histones. Taken together, the GO analysis demonstrated significant changes in protein function in lung cancer patients, particularly those associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis.

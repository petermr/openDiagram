0: MWCNTs were modified by treatment in boiling 8 M nitric acid for 2 h. The ratio of MWCNTs to HNO 3 (aq) (in g:dm 3) was 0.75:0.1.
1: The acid treatment leached the residual catalyst particles and introduced surface functional groups of acidic properties.
2: The procedure of chemical modification of MWCNTs was repeated three times.
3: The decrease in the mass of MWCNTs was 2.5  0.2% in each case.
4: The as-obtained product was rinsed several times with ultrapure deionized water (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) until the pH of supernatant reached 7 and subsequently dried in air for 24 h at 120 C.

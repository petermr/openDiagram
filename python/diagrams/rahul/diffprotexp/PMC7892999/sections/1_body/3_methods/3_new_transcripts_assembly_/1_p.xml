 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup> program (GffCompare classes “u”, “x”, to adjust). Only new transcripts whose length was greater than 200 nt were kept. The classification of the newly predicted transcript was performed as follow: (1) coding, if their predicted open reading frame (ORF) was greater than 120 aa or if they were predicted as coding by CPC2

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>; and (3) non-coding, if they were predicted as non-coding by CPC2 calculator or in case of homology with known structured non-coding RNA in Rfam (miRNA precursors, lncRNA). For each transcript, the longest ORF on the forward strand with at least 70 amino acid was predicted using TransDecoder ("-S -m 50", v5.5.0)

 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> displayed an ability to grow over a wide range of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes of different length and displayed highly similar growth on 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes from 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>10</sub> to 
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>32</sub> (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">1</xref>), with no significant differences in growth rates. After a short lag phase, measurable growth was observed after 3 days on all 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, with cultures displaying a linear growth pattern that entered the stationary phase after 14 days. No growth was observed on the branched alkane pristane. We compared the proteomes during the early stages of growth (day 4) on the medium-chain alkane tetradecane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>14</sub>), the long-chain alkane octacosane (
 <italic>n</italic>-C
 <sub>28</sub>) compared to the non-hydrocarbon control Tween 80 (one of the very few non-hydrocarbon substrates the strain can grow on).

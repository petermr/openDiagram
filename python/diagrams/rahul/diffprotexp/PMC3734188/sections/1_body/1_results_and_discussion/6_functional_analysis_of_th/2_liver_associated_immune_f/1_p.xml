 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, the Ingenuity Canonical Pathway in which the greatest number of secretory proteins participated was acute phase response signaling. The acute phase response is a well-known liver function that plays an important role in immune defense. The perfusate proteins involved in this pathway included TTR, MBL2, FN1, CRP and SERPINF1. Most of these proteins showed a decreased relative abundance in metastasized perfusates (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S3), which indicated that the liver-associated immune function was damaged by the metastasis or the state of cancer cachexia.

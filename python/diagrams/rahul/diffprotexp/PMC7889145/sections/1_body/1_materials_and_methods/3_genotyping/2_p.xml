<p>Tail DNA was prepared using the following procedure adapted from a previously described method [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. First, a 2–3 mm section of the tail tip was placed in a 1.5 mL tube, and 200 µL of 25 mM NaOH/0.2 mM EDTA (pH = 12) was added to the tube. Next, the tail in the basic solution was mixed at 1200 rpm at 98°C on a thermomixer for 35 minutes. 200 µL of 40 mM Tris HCl (pH = 5) was then added to the tube. The neutralized tail DNA solution was diluted 50-fold immediately prior to use, and this diluted solution was used as a template for genotyping reactions. PCR reactions consisted of 1X PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 0.1–0.5 μM forward and reverse primers depending on the genotyping assay, 10–20 ng crude tail genomic DNA in a total reaction volume of 10 μL. Reactions were amplified on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The instrument cover was set to 105°C and the PCR program included a hold stage (1 cycle: 50°C/2 min, 95°C/2 min), a PCR stage (35 cycles: 95°C/1 sec, 60°C/45 sec with data collection), and a final melting curve stage (95°C/1 sec, 60°C/20 sec, 95°C/1 sec with a temperature transition of 0.15°C/sec and continuous data acquisition during the melting transition). Data were analysed using the Thermo Fisher Cloud analysis platform, with manual assessment of PCR amplification plots and melting curves by comparison to historical control PCR reactions and expected PCR product melting temperatures. Genotyping primers are shown in

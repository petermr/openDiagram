<p>As in the case of other spectroscopies, the absorption of X-rays is described by Fermi’s Golden Rule:

 </disp-formula>where |
 <italic>i</italic>⟩ is the initial (ground) state of the absorbing atom and the summation is carried out over all available final states |
 <italic>f</italic>⟩. They correspond to the situation with one electron (photoelectron) excited to a higher energy level (localized or delocalized) and all other electrons in the atom rearranged due to the presence of positively charged holes in the core state. A Dirac function δ(ϵ

 </sub> – ϵ

  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> – 
 <italic>E</italic>) describes the conservation of energy. The operator 
 <italic>T̂</italic> describes the interaction of the electron with the photon and for practical calculations can be treated in a common dipole or more complex quadrupole approximation. The intensity and shape of the XANES features is thus affected by the density of unoccupied localized and delocalized states as well as by the selection rules for a particular transition.

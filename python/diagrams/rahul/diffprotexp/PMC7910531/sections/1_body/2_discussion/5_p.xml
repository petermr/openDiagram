<p id="Par21">Although these data demonstrate the context-specificity of molecular indicators of disease, this work also has limitations. Cartilage remains a difficult tissue to study at the molecular level, given the low cell accessibility. The analyses were performed on extracted tissues characterised by macroscopic grading using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scoring system

 </sup> and although all tissues were collected from weight-bearing areas (i.e. mechanically-loaded), a degree of cell disease state heterogeneity is inevitable in the pooled sample collection. However, the collection of both disease states from the same individual eliminates inter-individual variation as a source of confounding. Finally, although these data represent the largest cohort of its depth and kind in osteoarthritis, they are observational in nature. Future biological experiments (e.g. by gene knock-out or over-expression) will be key to prove which gene expression changes are causal in disease development and progression. The genes with convergent evidence from this study as well as osteoarthritis GWAS are presented to help such research and accelerate the pathway to translation.

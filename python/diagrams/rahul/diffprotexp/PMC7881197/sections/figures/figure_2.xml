  <p>AS6 effects on genome-wide gene expression in HUMEC and MCF7 cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes upon AS6 treatment in HUMEC (left; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 1233) and MCF7 cells (right; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 7374). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Comparison of differentially expressed genes (foldchange &gt; 4 in yellow) upon AS6 treatment between HUMEC and MCF7 cells displaying a significant difference (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1059 vs 5297, respectively) in responding to AS6 in these two cell types. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Box plots of all (left, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 81,707 and 91,152 in HUMEC and MCF7 cells respectively) and differentially expressed genes [DEGs; up- (middle; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 599 and 3772 in HUMEC and MCF7, respectively) and down-regulated (right, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 634 and 3602 in HUMEC and MCF7, respectively)] comparing HUMEC and MCF7 cells. (
   <bold>D</bold>) GO analysis of upregulated genes in AS6-treated HUMEC. In all GO analysis tables, the X-axis is –log
   <sub>10</sub>P-value. (
   <bold>E</bold>) PPI analysis showing the relatedness of upregulated protein-coding genes in AS6-treated HUMEC. (
   <bold>F</bold>) GO analysis of downregulated genes in AS6-treated HUMEC. (
   <bold>G</bold>) PPI analysis showing the relatedness of downregulated protein-coding genes in AS6-treated HUMEC.

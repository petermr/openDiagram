<p>Typical composition of some spent cathodic materials is presented in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-00801-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The presence of Cu and Al in the black mass could be attributed to either pieces of current collectors that were entrained in the sample during the preparation of the black mass or the metal plating on the cathode surface owing to the redox processes that could have occurred at both electrodes during over-discharging [

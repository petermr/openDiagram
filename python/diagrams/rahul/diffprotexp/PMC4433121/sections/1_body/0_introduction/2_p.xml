<p>Proteomic techniques are increasingly applied in the search for diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer [

Despite harboring various products of the epithelial cells’ activity, the liquid component of a thyroid cyst is routinely discarded in FNAB workflow. By contrast, in ovarian cancer and hemangioblastoma, the protein content of cyst fluids is frequently investigated regarding their protein content [

 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Given the possible diagnostic utility of the thyroid cyst fluid content which could improve FNAB, this study aimed at identifying differentially expressed proteins in cPTC by applying a proteomic approach.

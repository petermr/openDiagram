<p id="Par61">The same study was applied to common DEATs. In this case, out of 32 total transcripts, only a few could be assigned to GO terms corresponding to CC (nucleus), MF (zinc ion binding, stearoyl-CoA9-desaturase activity, ATP binding and amylase activity) and BP (mature ribosome assembly) (not shown). Although the limited number of DEATs did not allow a proper KEGG pathway evaluation, we could identify that fatty acid metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway, starch/sucrose metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were changed (not shown).</p>

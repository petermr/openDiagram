<p>We used a number of analyses to confirm that our ability to detect PAS was not biased by gene expression level or species. If our ability to detect PAS was biased by gene expression, we might expect a positive correlation between gene expression level and the number of PAS we detected. In our data, the number of PAS per gene is negatively correlated with gene expression level in both species (

 <sup>−16</sup>; chimpanzee: Pearson’s correlation −0.19, p&lt;2.2×10
 <sup>−16</sup>). If our ability to detect PAS were biased by species, we would expect to identify more PAS per gene in one species over the other. This is neither the case genome-wide nor when we test each gene independently. We identified, on average, 3.87 PAS per gene in humans and 3.46 PAS per gene in chimpanzees. On average, per gene, the number of PAS in human minus the number of PAS in chimpanzee is 0.39 with a median value of 0 (

Moreover, as expected, the physical distribution of PAS across genes is conserved, with the majority of PAS located in 3' UTRs (17,688, 40% in chimpanzee; and 17,620, 40% in human) and a considerable proportion located in introns (14,095, 32% in chimpanzee; and 14,119, 32% in human) (

<p>In addition to 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants, there is growing evidence to suggest that heterozygous pathogenic variants in the gene that encodes the parkin protein are also susceptibility factors for PD with a lower age of onset (
 <xref rid="b34-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="b35-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It was previously reported that heterozygosity for a single 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variant in patients with deletions may contribute to PD (
 <xref rid="b36-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In the present study, two cases of heterozygous 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants were studied. The c.2T&gt;C (p.M1T) variant was previously described in a Chinese patient (
 <xref rid="b37-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). This variant showed a change in the start codon from ATG to ACG, resulting in the complete absence of the parkin protein. It was reported that 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> point variants are not exclusive to PD, and the presence of a single point variant in a patient in the absence of a second variant should not be considered a cause of disease unless it is corroborated by family data and functional studies (
 <xref rid="b38-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, another report revealed that a large proportion of patients with a sporadic form of PD (21 of 327 patients with PD, 6.4%) were carriers of heterozygous deletions or duplications in 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> (
 <xref rid="b39-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The authors suggested that these heterozygous forms may be considered dominant mutations with low penetrance (
 <xref rid="b39-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Therefore, further studies are required to identify the PD-associated effects of disease caused by heterozygous 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants.

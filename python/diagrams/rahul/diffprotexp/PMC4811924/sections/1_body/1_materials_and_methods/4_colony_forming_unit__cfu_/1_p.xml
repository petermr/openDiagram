<p>Overnight cultures of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> were adjusted to an OD 600 of 0.2. Then, the bacteria were inoculated into 96-well microtiter plate wells containing 200 μL of THB alone (untreated wells) or adding the tylosin solution with the final concentrations of 1/4 MIC (0.125 μ g/mL). In addition, a negative control (with THB alone) and a positive control (with bacteria alone) were also included. After incubation at 37°C for 72 h without shaking, the medium was removed by aspiration, and the wells were washed three times with sterile physiological saline. Biofilm cells were removed from wells by sonication for 5 min in 200 μL of THB. The cell suspensions (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) underwent 10-fold dilutions in THB, and 100 μL of each dilution was spot plated onto THB soft-agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.

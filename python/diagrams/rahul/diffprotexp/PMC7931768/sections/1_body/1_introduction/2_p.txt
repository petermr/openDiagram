0: Genetic and clinical observations have highlighted an essential role of type I, type II and type III interferons (IFN-I, IFN-II and IFN-III) in SLE and CLE pathogenesis.
1: 513 A type I IFN signature has emerged as a major risk factor for SLE disease activity.
2: 5 1417 IFN signatures, and myxovirus resistance protein A (MXA), a protein induced by IFN, have been detected in the affected skin of patients with active CLE.
3: 1820 The central role of IFN-I in CLE pathogenesis is further supported by data showing improvement in disease activity in participants with SLE with active skin disease treated with agents targeting IFN-I (anti-IFN- or anti-IFN-I / receptor).
4: 2123 Recently, a humanised monoclonal antibody (BIIB059) targeting blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA-2), uniquely expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)master regulators of the IFN response showed following treatment a strong association between reduction in MXA expression in skin and reduction in disease activity and demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease activity in CLE.

<p>Similarly to the AlSi and AlMgSi alloys, the reactions are in total increasingly suppressed with increasing cooling rates. Thus, in most cases, the reactions at higher temperatures are first suppressed, while the reactions at lower temperatures first show an increase in the fraction transformed. The latter is due to the increased concentration of alloying elements left in solution after the suppressed HTR is complete.</p>

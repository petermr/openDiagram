<p id="Par64">Applying RT-qPCR we further validated a subset of key gene markers of pluripotency, NSCs, MNPs, and MNs which were found to be differentially expressed by RNA-Seq profiling. Both methods detected the rapid decrease of pluripotency marker 
 <italic>Oct4</italic> by D7 and increase of 
 <italic>Nestin</italic>, 
 <italic>Pax6</italic>, and 
 <italic>NgN2</italic> expression reaching peak levels at D13 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a-d). Markers of MN specification (
 <italic>Isl1</italic>, 
 <italic>HB9</italic>, 
 <italic>MAP2</italic>, and 
 <italic>ChAT</italic>) increased throughout the course of neuronal maturation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e-f, h). 
 <italic>ChAT</italic> expression levels gradually increased throughout the differentiation process from NSCs to MNs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>h). Collectively, quantitative analysis of gene expression via RNA-Seq closely correlated with RT-qPCR data showing dynamics of gene activities typical for the conversion of pluripotent cells to MNs. We observed transient activation of 
 <italic>Nestin</italic>, a key regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell division in NSC, and stable expression of pan-neuronal markers 
 <italic>Pax6</italic>, 
 <italic>NgN2</italic>, and 
 <italic>MAP2</italic>. Our data indicated there was gradual accumulation of gene transcripts responsible for the synthesis of neurotransmitter, 
 <italic>ChAT</italic>, and transcription factors, 
 <italic>Isl1</italic> and 
 <italic>HB9</italic>, whose concerted actions shape the phenotype and physiological activity of MNs.

<p id="Par44">Adaptors were removed from raw paired-end sequencing reads and trimmed for quality using Trim Galore! (v.0.5.0) using default parameters. QC was performed before and after read trimming using FastQC (v.0.11.6) and no data quality issues were identified after checking the resultant QC reports. Processed reads were mapped to galGal5 cDNA using kallisto (v.0.44.0)

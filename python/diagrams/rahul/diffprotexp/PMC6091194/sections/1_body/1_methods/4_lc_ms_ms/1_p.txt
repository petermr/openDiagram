0: Each SCX fraction was analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS.
1: Prior to separation, 5 L of each peptide fraction was injected onto a 100 m  25 mm sample trap (New Objective, Woburn, MA) to remove salts and contaminants.
2: Peptide separation was performed on a 75 m  10 cm C 18 column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) using a gradient from 98% solvent A (95% ddH 2O and 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% FA) and 2% solvent B (80% acetonitrile and 20% ddH 2O containing 0.1% FA) to 40% solvent B over 180 min with a flow rate of 300 nL/min on an Eksigent nanoLC (Thermo Scientific Inc.).
3: Mass spectrometry data were collected using an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc.).
4: A DDA top 10 method was used with an isolation window of 3 around the precursor and 35 normalized collision energy value (NCE).
5: Full MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer over the m/z 3001800 range with resolution 60,000 and MS/MS resolution was 7, 500 with a minimal signal of 2.00E + 03.
6: The MS proteomics data are deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository [ 27] with the dataset identifier PXD001973.

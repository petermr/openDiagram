 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. High strength mainly results from the specific microstructure consisting of soft ferritic matrix and hard cementite lamellae. However, the lamellar pearlite is not appropriate for machining or cold forming. The spheroidization of cementite lamellae is beneficial to the cold formability of steels; hence, the pearlite steel is usually to be subjected to spheroidization annealing [

 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During annealing, the cementite lamellae gradually change their shapes into spherical particles to produce a mixed microstructure, in which globular cementite particles are uniformly distributed throughout the ferrite matrix [

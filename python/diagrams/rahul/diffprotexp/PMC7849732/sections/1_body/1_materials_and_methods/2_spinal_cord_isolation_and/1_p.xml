<p>Twelve Sprague-Dawley juvenile (p21) rats of both sexes (n = 6 male, n = 6 female) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 3 g/kg urethane (Sigma-Aldrich). Lumbar spinal cord segments were dissected through ventral laminectomy according to a procedure previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The collected spinal cords were immediately placed in an ice-cold, oxygenated, sucrose protective solution containing 50 mM sucrose, 92 mM NaCl, 17 mM D-glucose, 26 mM NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 7 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>. All the meninges and blood vessels were quickly removed from the meninges and blood vessels spinal cord segments. The tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h at 4°C, then placed in a first step of 10% sucrose for 24 h, a second step of 10% sucrose for at least 6 h, and in 30% sucrose solutions (in PB) for 72 h at 4°C. Spinal cord tissues were embedded in OCT using cryo-molders and then flash frozen through submersion in isopentane that was supercooled by liquid nitrogen. The embedded spinal cords were then stored at −80°C up until sectioning with a microtome cryostat (ThermoScientific). The spinal lumbar segments were sliced into 25 µm thick transverse sections. Each section was serially mounted onto pre-treated slides (FisherBrand

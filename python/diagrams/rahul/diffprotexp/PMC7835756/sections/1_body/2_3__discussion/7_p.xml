<p>Taken together, the data obtained in the present study strongly suggest that the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> overproduction in the transgenic tobacco could be associated with rapid recognition of stress and triggering of defense responses, which may be critical in the well-timed activation of the defense system and by consequence, in the physiological adaptation to stress. This is related to the study of Zhou et al., in where spaceflight induced a significant number of genes DmC-DEG associated with ROS signaling, demonstrating that ROS genes play a fundamental role in the physiological adaptation of plants to stress [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00178" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Considering that the spaceflight environment is a unique and unconventional stress condition, they highlighted the importance of the ROS signaling in the shaped responses to stress, which made them a critical point to stimulate the adaptation of the crops to a more changing and unpredictable environment. Finally, the whole-genome differential cytosine methylation found between the two transgenic tobacco lines helps explain the differential phenotype related to stress response displayed by these plants; moreover, suggesting that an epigenetic component at cytosine DNA methylation it is important in the phenomenon.

0: There were 3 groups of chickens.
1: Six chickens from the control group were sacrificed on day 48 of life.
2: An additional 6 chickens (group 2) were infected intravenously with 10 7 CFU of wild type  S. Enteritidis in 0.1 mL PBS on day 44 of life.
3: The last 6 chickens (group 3) were orally vaccinated on day 1, revaccinated on day 21 of life with 10 7 CFU of  S. Enteritidis SPI-1 mutant in 0.1 mL of inoculum and challenged intravenously with 10 7 CFU of wild type  S. Enteritidis on day 44 of life.
4: Intravenous mode of infection was used mainly to stimulate macrophage and heterophil response rather than to model natural infection of chickens with  S. Enteritidis.
5: All chickens in groups 2 and 3 were sacrificed 4 days post infection, i.e.
6: when aged 48 days.
7: The spleens from the chickens from all three groups were collected into PBS during necropsy.
8: To confirm  S. Enteritidis infection, approximately 0.5 g of liver tissue was homogenised in 5 mL of peptone water, tenfold serially diluted and plated in XLD agar, as described previously [ 11].

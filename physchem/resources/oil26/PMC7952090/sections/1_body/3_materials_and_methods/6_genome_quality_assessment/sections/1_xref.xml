CEGMA was run using the default settings for mammals (&#8216;Cut-off length for sequence statistics and composition&#8217;=1; &#8216;CEGMA max intron length&#8217;=100,000; &#8216;CEGMA gene flanks&#8217;=10,000, &#8216;Selected reference gene set&#8217; = CVG). For each genome, we generated a correlation matrix using the aforementioned genome quality scores, and either the mean copy number or mean ECNC for all hits in the genome. We observed that the percentage of duplicated genes in non-Pseudoungulatan genomes was higher (12.94&#8211;23.66%) than Pseudoungulatan genomes (3.26&#8211;7.80%). Mean copy number, mean ECNC, and mean CN (the lesser of copy number and ECNC per gene) moderately or strongly correlated with genomic quality, such as LD50, the number of scaffolds, and contigs with a length above either 100K or 1M (

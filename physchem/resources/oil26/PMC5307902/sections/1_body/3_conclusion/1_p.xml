<p>The development of emulsions containing essential oil remains a technological challenge, specifically in the improvement of their topical applicabilities. However, in the present work the feasibility of production of disperse systems was demonstrated using only the essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic>Plectranthus amboinicus</italic> in the disperse phase, and its HLB value was described for the first time. Accordingly, the combination of surfactants [Span 80
 <sup>®</sup> and Tween 20
 <sup>®</sup>] leads to a required HLB value of 15.7.

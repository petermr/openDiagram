<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The essential oil was dissolved in 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain 10% (w/v) solution. For MIC test of the selected bacteria, the essential oil was first diluted in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth in screw capped tubes containing broth medium in the concentration of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.25&#160;&#956;g/mL. Bacterial suspensions of the test organism were prepared in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth. 1&#160;mL of the dilution was added to each sterilized screw capped tube containing 1&#160;mL of sample suitably diluted in the sterilized broth medium to give a final volume of 2&#160;mL. A culture medium without sample (solvent DMSO) was used as a negative control. Ciprofloxacin (100&#8211;0.191&#160;&#956;g/mL.) was used as positive control. Tubes were incubated aerobically at 37&#160;&#176;C for 18&#160;h and the growth was indicated by turbidity. The lowest concentration (preventing visible growth indicated by no turbidity) was identified as the MIC and expressed in &#956;g/mL. The complete absence of growth was considered as the MBC [

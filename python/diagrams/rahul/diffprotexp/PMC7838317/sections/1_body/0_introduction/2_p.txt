0: Captive holding of animals in zoos or other specialized facilities is a common and important conservation strategy 10,  11.
1: Many facilities have captive breeding programs that propagate threatened and endangered species for reintroduction to extirpated areas or augmentation of existing populations 9,  12  14.
2: Some captive breeding programs maintain species threatened with extinction in zoos and aquaria for multiple generations to ensure their survival, with the goal of future reintroduction once threats to their existence have been removed 15.
3: Freshwater mussels are also often translocated to different habitats or brought into captive holding facilities for temporary refuge and propagation to mitigate damage from in-stream construction activities, toxic river spills, and zebra mussel infestations 16  19.
4: These ex situ management efforts are powerful tools used to maintain or increase biodiversity, but may also cause stress for the animals, making them more vulnerable to factors that directly contribute to translocation failure, such as starvation, disease, and reduced reproductive capacity 20.

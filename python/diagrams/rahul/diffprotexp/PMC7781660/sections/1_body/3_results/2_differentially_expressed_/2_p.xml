<p>It is well known that signaling pathway analysis can help to better understand the biological functions of genes, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs can be used to determine the biochemical metabolic and signal transduction pathways, which further facilitate us to explore the host–virus interactions. So we also performed signaling pathway analysis using the KEGG databases, the results of which showed that the genes differentially regulated by BVDV infection were mainly involved in TNF signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, apoptosis signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, and Ras signaling pathway, compared to those in the C group (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(b</xref>)) associated with the top 10 signaling pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(d</xref>)) were analyzed. The correlation and overlap of the related molecules in the top 10 signaling pathways related to mRNA up-regulation and the top 10 signaling pathways related to mRNA down-regulation were analyzed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4</xref>, DEGs including IL1R1, PPP3CC, BIRC2, LPIN1, TIAM1, MAPK8, IGF1R, JAK1, CYLD, ACLY, HMGCR, ACSS2, and MAP3K1, etc., are mainly enriched in NF-κB signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Fatty acid biosynthesis, etc., suggesting that BVDV infection not only affects the host immune responses but also affects lipid synthesis and metabolism activity in host cells.

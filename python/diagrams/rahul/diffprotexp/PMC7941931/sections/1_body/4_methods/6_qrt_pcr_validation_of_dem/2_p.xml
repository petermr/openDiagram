<p id="Par56">For differently expressed target genes, reverse transcription and qRT-PCR reactions were carried out by using PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa, Beijing, China) and TB Green® Premix Ex Taq™ (Tli RNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa, Beijing, China), respectively. 
 <italic>FtActin</italic> was used as the reference gene. All samples were performed three independent biological replicates. The relative expression level of each gene was calculated by using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method. The primers used in this experiment are listed in Additional file

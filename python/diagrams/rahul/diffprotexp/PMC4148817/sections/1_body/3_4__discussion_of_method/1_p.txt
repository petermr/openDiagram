0: The proteomic method used in this study provides quantitative data that form a basis for subsequent biological verification in  in vivo studies.
1: Direct analysis of changes in protein abundance avoids some of the pitfalls associated with more traditional methods of quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting.
2: Measurements of gene transcripts as indicative of subsequent protein expression at any given time (either by microarray or RT-PCR) are fraught with inaccuracies leading to a poor or lack of correlation between mRNA and protein [ 45, 46].
3: Proteins are produced in bursts that are stochastic in time and in amounts, consistent with having low numbers of mRNA copies.
4: Poor correlation also can be explained by the different lifetimes of the two biomolecules within a cell.
5: Proteins are accumulated products, while mRNAs are instantaneous messengers that are degraded within minutes.
6: Tilton  et al.
7: [ 47] compared gene and protein expression and found a substantial disconnect between mRNA analysis and proteome profiling in identical cell samples.
8: We have unpublished data consistent with this observation.

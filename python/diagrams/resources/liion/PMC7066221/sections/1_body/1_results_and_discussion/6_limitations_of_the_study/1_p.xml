<p id="p0180">Our work has demonstrated how cobalt modification can facilitate the deposition of Mn compounds on the Î´-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode and lead to stable performance of Zn-ion batteries. Although the catalytic effect of cobalt species was evidenced by electrochemical analysis and supported by multiple 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> characterizations, in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanism is still needed. Further investigation with advanced

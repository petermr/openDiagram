0: The PSM table was aggregated into protein log2 ratio by median sweeping method described in the section of Data Set D1.
1: The protein matrix of log2 ratios for proteins with no missing quant values (11,188 proteins) was used as input for subsequent  t test, ROTS, Limma and DEqMS analysis.
2: For Limma (vsn) method, PSM raw intensity table was first treated by variance stabilization normalization and then aggregated into protein ratio matrix.
3: The statistical analysis was focused on the comparison between the 3 replicates with 7.5 g and the 4 replicates with 15 g of spiked in  E. coli protein extract (the group with 45 g spike-in had substantial global impact on protein ratios after normalization).
4: The mass spectrometry proteomics data for data set D3 have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the JPOST partner repository with the data set identifier PXD013277.

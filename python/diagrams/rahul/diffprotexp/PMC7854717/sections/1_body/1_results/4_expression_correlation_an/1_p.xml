 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> presents examples of significantly (p-val &lt; 0.05) synergistically, antagonistically and independently expressed ICT genes (a), the percentages of significant synergistic expressions of the ICT genes with each-other in each chamber (b) and of the same ICT genes between two adjacent chambers (c). Panel d shows the sodium channels that were synergistically expressed in two adjacent chambers. The in-phase fluctuation of gene transcripts in two adjacent chambers indicates expression synchrony of that gene in those chambers. We found that expression synchrony of ICTs is significantly higher between the two ventricles than between the two atria.

<p>The conclusion based on animal experiments was further confirmed in HEK293 cell experiments. ETHE1 levels changed in a dose- and time-dependent manner after DU exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c and d</xref>). In addition, we found ETHE1 co-localized with the mitochondria in cells, which confirmed that ETHE1 mainly localized to the mitochondria and was a DU toxicity-sensitive protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). To clarify the function of ETHE1 in the nephrotoxicity of DU, we obtained an HEK293 cell line with a low level of ETHE1 expression through siRNA interference. The western blot results confirmed that the expression of ETHE1 protein decreased after siRNA interference (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction of the survival rate of cells after DU exposure was more significant compared with that in negative control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Application of exogenous MT could still significantly increase the survival rate of cells after DU exposure, and the survival rate of siRNA-ETHE1 cells was lower than that of negative control cells (transfected with a blank vector), suggesting that ETHE1 might be involved in the process of DU-induced nephrotoxicity. In addition, the protection of DU by MT might be partially achieved through the action of ETHE1.

<p id="Par43">In conclusion, our results show an adaptation related attenuation of beta oscillations during movement preparation, recorded by scalp EEG over the motor cortex in humans and as motor cortical LFP signals in cats. Our findings are consistent with the reduction in beta power being a result of increased afferent input to the motor cortical PTNs in the early stages of adaptation, which could correspond to changes in the excitatory/inhibitory balance disrupting the ongoing beta oscillations, thus enabling modifications to established motor programs in response to error signals detected by other brain regions such as the cerebellum. Further work is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms supporting this beta phenomenon.</p>

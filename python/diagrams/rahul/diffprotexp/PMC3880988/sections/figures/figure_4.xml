  <p>GAG secretion of MSC, cMSC and AC culture from day-0 to day-28 were compared to their respective control using parametric 2-sided independent 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. GAG secretion in both cMSC and AC was significantly higher than MSC (
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). GAG secretion of cMSC was significantly enhanced at day-21 compared to day-0 (
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01).

<p id="Par37">To further confirm the differential binding genes obtained from ChIP-seq, we detected the DEGs in RNA-seq data. The Volcano plot, respectively, showed DEGs in control and DCM, according to criteria of

 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 1.0. For target genes associated LMNA alone with euchromatin (MACS), we identified a total of 22 significant genes in control samples (MACS) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In order to further discover the genes that are the most related to DCM caused by LMNA mutation in euchromatin, we integrated differential expressed genes, and the genes involved in the functional enrichment analysis mentioned above (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b–g, Additional file

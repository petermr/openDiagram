<p>The historical assumption was that, since they bind to the same receptor, all ligands of the ERα are expected to induce largely overlapping gene transcription profiles. To our knowledge, the findings of the current study are the first to demonstrate that, in vivo, estrogen, tamoxifen, and raloxifene differ widely on their effects on gene transcription in the CNS, where we report a fundamental sexual dimorphic response to ERα ligands in spinal cord. Since tamoxifen and raloxifene have been shown to cross the brain–blood barrier and no differences in the penetrance between males and females were observed (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28-32</xref>), our data indicate that the differences in gene expression in males and females are not due to differences in their ability to cross the brain–blood barrier and are the results of the transcriptional activity of the ERα. The implications of these findings could be profound for neurodegeneration, since, while the neuroprotective effect of SERMs originally generated great enthusiasm, the mixed effect of SERMs in clinical trials rapidly led to a lack of interest in these drugs, at least toward neurodegenerative diseases. Our data suggest that the potential of SERMs as a therapeutic intervention against neurodegenerative diseases should remain high and consider specific SERMs for specific diseases as well as sex as a critical biological variable in the design of future trials.

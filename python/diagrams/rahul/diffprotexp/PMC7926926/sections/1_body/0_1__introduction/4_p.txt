0: Morphophysiological changes and cellular responses under Al-stress conditions are ascribed to the gene expression and cellular metabolism.
1: Previous reports for Al stress resistance in different plants identified multiple pathways including, membrane transporters, oxidative stress pathways, primary metabolism, cell wall synthesis, and protein metabolism [ 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43].
2: However, the genetic pathways for induced Al stress tolerance in  P. massoniana are not well documented.
3: In particular, clarifying the contribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi in  P. massoniana resistance to abiotic stresses has been the focus of recent studies [ 44, 45]

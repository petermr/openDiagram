 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). The strong dispersion force between residue 6 and ERY implies that this residue is important in ribosome stalling. This result is consistent with Arenz

 </sup>. In the case of H-NS, the N-terminal interactions of residues 1, 3 and 6 with ERY are dominant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Furthermore, the non-bonded forces between ERY and ErmCL’s C-terminus are mainly attractive while in H-NS residues 1 and 6 exhibit repulsive electrostatic forces. This suggests that the differential impact that ERY has on ErmCL and H-NS’s motion through the tunnel arises from the larger electrostatic and dispersion forces their C-terminal residues experience.

<p>Galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles of B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes at 0.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> between 0.005–3.0 V are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-00249-f005">Figure 5</xref>a to probe the favourable bulk or micro-dimensional effect of the metal-intercalated carbon structure upon battery performance. In comparison to the B-SO@C electrode, the B-SFO@C electrode features a more obvious charge plateau in the range of 1.0–1.5 V, hinting that reversibility of the conversion reaction of Sn/SnO
 <sub>2</sub> in the B-SFO@C electrode is superior to that of the B-SO@C electrode. This also reveals the vital impacts which the Fe component exerts upon manipulating the electrochemical features of SnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based materials. The initial discharge/charge capacity of B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes reaches 1389/973, 1103/662 and 1353/842 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, with corresponding initial Coulombic efficiencies (ICE) of 70%, 60% and 62%. Strikingly, the ICE of the B-SFO@C electrode here exceeds not only the values of B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes, but also the counterparts of many elaborated nanosized SnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based composite anodes (45–55%) recorded to date [

 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-10-00249" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The central reason behind the high ICE of the B-SFO@C electrode is that the irreversible capacity loss engendered by both the formation of SEI film and by the irreversible conversion chemistry of SnO
 <sub>2</sub> is pronouncedly weakened. In other words, the much smaller ICE of B-SO@C and B-SFO correlate with the absence of the binary intercalation structure, which leads to the production of irreversible phases of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O and Li

Besides, the inherently poor electrical conductivity of single metal Sn phases induces the relatively unsatisfactory initial discharge/charge capacities. Such disadvantage can be addressed via introducing the second component of Fe (irrespective of carbon skeleton), which remarkably enhances both the ion access to and the electron conveyance along the electroactive materials.

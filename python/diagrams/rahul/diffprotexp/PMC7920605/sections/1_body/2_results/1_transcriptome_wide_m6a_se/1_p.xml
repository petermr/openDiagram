<p>We compared m6A methylation peaks at each site in MH7A cells after stimulation with TNF-α. The differences and overlaps in m6A methylation between the individuals are shown by the Venn diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2A</xref>. We found 13,763 m6A peaks in the control group and 13,621 m6A peaks in the TNF-α group, of which 12,896 m6A peaks were common between the two groups. Compared with the control group, 725 peaks appeared and 867 peaks disappeared in the TNF-α group, indicating that there was a significant difference in the m6A modification pattern of MH7A cells after stimulation with TNF-α.

<p>Previous reports have shown that YjbH is involved in controlling the protein levels of Spx, which is activated in response to disulfide and oxidative stress in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, we observed the downregulation of several genes related to oxidative stress from the RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Table S1). Thus, we were intrigued to test whether YjbH is involved in virulence by protecting 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> against oxidative stress in the host. For this purpose, we determined the lethal dose fifty (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) values of the strains in the presence and absence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). NAC is a free radical scavenger; it eliminates reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as OHâ€¢, HOX, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We found that by the pre-injection of NAC into silkworm hemolymph, LD
 <sub>50</sub> values were significantly decreased, rendering the strains more effective in killing the silkworms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6(a</xref>)). We further found that NAC did not affect protease and pigment production by the mutants in vitro (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6(b</xref>)). These results suggested that YjbH functions in protecting 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> from oxidative stresses in the host.

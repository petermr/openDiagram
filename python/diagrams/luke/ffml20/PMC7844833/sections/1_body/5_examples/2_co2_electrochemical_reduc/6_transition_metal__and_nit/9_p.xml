<p>Nonetheless, it appears that the single-site nature of the TMCN catalysts prevents them from forming more complex reaction products. A possible path to resolve this issue could be preparing catalyst with two metal sites next to each other.

 </sup> Catalysts with diatomic metal nitrogen sites (Ni/Fe–N–C) were synthesized by Ren et al.

 </sup> Unlike the case of the Ni–N–C and Fe–N–C samples, a pronounced peak in the Fourier-transformed EXAFS data attributed to metal–metal bonds was observed in the bimetallic sample, which was interpreted as a signature of the neighboring metal sites.

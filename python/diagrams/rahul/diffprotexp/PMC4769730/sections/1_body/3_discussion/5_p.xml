<p>Of interest, the significant increase of MIP1α/δ and decrease of MIP1β as well as the increase of VCAM1 and decrease of ICAM3 might support the presence of an anti-inflammatory response, as observed in other systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. As for IL10, the increase of MIPs might be involved in the modulation of macrophage migration, the activation of granulocytes and the modulation of IL5, IL3, IL4 and IL12 inflammatory/profibrogenic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The high sTNFRI expression might represent a point of interest, since it has been recently reported that this soluble receptor might be involved in the regulation of TNFα receptor activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. With respect to the significant low expression of IL18 and IL16 actually we have no explanation.

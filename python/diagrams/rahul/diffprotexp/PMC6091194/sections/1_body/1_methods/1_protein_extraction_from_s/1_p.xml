<p id="Par37">The experiments described herein were approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, as set forth under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. To obtain enough protein for analysis, cochleae were isolated from 16 P3, P14, and P30 CBA/J mice. In addition, three biological replicates were prepared for each age group. All dissections were accomplished in cooled PBS, while maintaining the dissecting dish on ice. To extract a cochlea, the tympanic bulla was excised after which the bone, ligament, and stria vascularis was removed, isolating the sensory epithelium along with the modiolus. The modiolus was kept intact, initially, since this method provided an intact extraction of the sensory epithelium. Three biological replicates from each age group were prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis. In each experiment, the cochlear sensory epithelium was washed gently 3× in 1X PBS, centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 
 <italic>g</italic>, and the supernatant removed. These washes allowed for the removal of the modiolus prior to detergent treatment. Cochlear sensory epithelia were sonicated in lysis buffer containing 4% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 500 μg/mL AEBSF, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, 100 μg/mL pepstatin, 2 μg/mL aprotinin, and 1 mg/mL microcystin using a sonic dismembrator (Model 100; Thermo Fisher). The extract was incubated on ice for 30 min, then heated at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by centrifugation at 16000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet extracted in lysis buffer. Both lysates were combined, then centrifuged at 20800 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant was retained for digestion and analysis.

<p id="par0170">Based on the digital fold expression, we randomly selected few DEGs, as identified through transcriptome data mining [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We have used the following genes for the expression analysis - heat-responsive transcription factors (
 <italic>HSFA6e, WRKY</italic>), HSPs (
 <italic>HSP17</italic>, 
 <italic>HSP26</italic>), antioxidant enzymes (
 <italic>SOD</italic>, 
 <italic>POX</italic>) and genes of starch biosynthesis pathway associated enzymes [
 <italic>AGPase</italic> (large subunit) and 
 <italic>SSS</italic>]. Expression analysis of 
 <italic>HSP26</italic> was observed maximum (18.1-fold) in wheat 
 <italic>cv</italic>. HD3086 under T
 <sub>2</sub> followed by 
 <italic>HSP17</italic> (16.8-fold). The expression of 
 <italic>WRKY</italic> TF was observed minimum under HS, when compared with other DEGs (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a). In case of BT-Schomburgk, the maximum expression of 
 <italic>HSP17</italic> (9.2-fold) was observed in response to T
 <sub>2</sub> (

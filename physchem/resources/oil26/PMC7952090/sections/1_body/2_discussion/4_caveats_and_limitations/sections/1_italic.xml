<italic>LIF</italic> duplicates, was on the role gene duplication in general may have played in the resolution of Peto&#8217;s paradox in large-bodied Afrotherians, particularly Proboscidea. Duplication of tumor suppressor genes, however, is unlikely to be the sole mechanism responsible for the evolution of large body sizes, long lifespans, and reduced cancer risk. The evolution of regulatory elements, coding genes, genes with non-canonical tumor suppressor functions, and immune cell recognition of cancerous cells are also likely important for reducing the risk of cancer.

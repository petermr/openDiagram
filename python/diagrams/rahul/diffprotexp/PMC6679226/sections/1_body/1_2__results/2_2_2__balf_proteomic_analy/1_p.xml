<p>We performed proteomic profiling of BALF samples from three groups of mice using the tandem mass tag (TMT) 10-plex platform: control mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 with I.T. instillation of sterile saline), I.T. LPS group (0.1 mg/kg, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), and I.P. LPS group (5 mg/kg, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). The total identified and quantitated proteins in this assay was 1017, greater than most published reports on BALF proteome [

 <xref rid="ijms-20-03401-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among them, molecules related to bronchial and type II alveolar epithelial cell functions including cell adhesion molecule 1 (Cadm1), chloride intracellular channel protein 5 (Clic5) and surfactant protein B (Sftpb) were reduced in both treatment groups, whereas lactotransferrin (Ltf) and resistin-like alpha (Retnla), involved in lung innate immunity, were up-regulated by both I.T. and I.P. LPS challenges. There were also significant differences in BALF protein expression profiles between I.T. and I.P. LPS groups. As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03401-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, there were 10 proteins that were up-regulated by I.T. LPS but down-regulated by I.P. LPS, and 4 proteins that were down-regulated by I.T. LPS but up-regulated by I.P. LPS.

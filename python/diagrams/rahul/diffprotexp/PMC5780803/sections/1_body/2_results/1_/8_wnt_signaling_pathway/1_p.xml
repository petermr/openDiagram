<p>The enzyme UGDH catalyzes the two-fold oxidation of UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid, the activated nucleotide sugar donor required for the synthesis of heparin sulfate glycosminoglycans (
 <xref rid="b26-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). To a large extent, the biological functions of heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) depend upon the interaction of the glycosaminoglycan chains with different protein ligands. HSPGs are present at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. Through their projection into the extracellular space, HSPGs are capable of interacting with signaling molecules and can ultimately influence the activity route of their recipient cell. For example, HSPGs can influence the activities of the Wnt growth factor (

 <xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-7383" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> indicates that the expression of UGDH in Caki-1 cells is significantly higher than that in the XIAP-knockdown cells. However, no change was observed prior to and following the induction of apoptosis (

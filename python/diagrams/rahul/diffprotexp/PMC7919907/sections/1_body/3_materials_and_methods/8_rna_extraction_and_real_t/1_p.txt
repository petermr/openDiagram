0: RNA extraction and RTPCR were performed as previously described [ 59].
1: Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
2: About 2.0 g of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA of viral RNA and host RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Random Hexamer primers.
3: After digestion of genomic DNA with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega), target gene was amplified on a Thermal Fisher QuantStudio TM 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master mix (carboxy-X-rhodamine; Roche) and following HCoV-NL63 N gene-specific primers (Forward: 5'-CTGTTACTTTGGCTTTAAAGAACTTAGG-3; Reverse: 5'-CTCACTATCAAAGAATAACGCAGCCTG-3) or HCoV-OC43 N gene-specific primers (Forward: 5'-CGATGAGGCTATTCCGACTAGGT-3; Reverse: 5'- CCTTCCTGAGCCTTCAATATAGTAACC-3).
4: GAPDH was also amplified to serve as a control using human GAPDH-specific primers (GAPDH-F: 5-ACACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTG-3 and GAPDH-R: 5-CACCACCCT GTTGCTGTAGCC-3).
5: The amplification conditions were: 95 C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 C and 60 s at 60 C. Melting curve analysis was performed to verify the specificity of each amplification.
6: All experiments were repeated three times independently.

<p id="Par77">Here we introduce a complete sense/antisense gene expression catalogue from florets of apomictic and sexual 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic>, involving four subsequent reproductive developmental stages, from premeiosis to anthesis. This comprehensive sequence collection quantitatively reveals apomixis vs. sexual heterochronic expression and sense/antisense mediated regulation. In particular, contrasting transcriptional and hormonal control was detected and thoroughly characterized. Our analysis exposed a considerable alteration of sense/antisense expression occurring at the onset of parthenogenesis. The experimental approach used in this work established a set of differentially expressed sequences well beyond the former group of candidates detected in 
 <italic>Paspalum</italic>, which even discriminated the sequence orientation, giving important clues on antisense-mediated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. This dataset will be applied to a more efficient selection of apomixis candidate genes, contributing to the future development of molecular tools for harnessing the trait.

  <p>a) Left, quantification of sTREM1 levels in BAL samples from patients with IPA (cases, n = 50) compared to controls (n = 48). sTREM1 levels were expressed as log10 pg/mL. Data are presented as scatterplots representing individual data points and a line indicating the mean value with SD. Right, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to evaluate the ability of sTREM1 to diagnose invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). B) Left, quantification of sTREM1 levels in BAL samples from patients with IPA and high GMI &gt; 3.0 compared to controls. TREM1 levels were expressed as log10 pg/mL. Data are presented as scatterplots representing individual data points and a line indicating the mean value with Sd. Right, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to evaluate the ability of sTREM1 to diagnose IPA. p-values from sTREM1 levels comparisons were calculated using the Mann–Whitney U test. ****, p &lt; 0.0001, ***, p &lt; 0.001; **, p &lt; 0.01</p>

<p id="p0115">Nine KEGG pathways (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were enriched from the dataset using STRING software (version 10.0) (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The most significant pathways for the differentially expressed proteins were metabolic pathways (10 proteins, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.11 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>) and hippo signaling pathway (3 proteins, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 7.36 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>), which are involved in potentiation of the antiaging process in flies. As to the “metabolic” pathways, six of 10 enriched proteins (ALF, CYC2, PTPS, VATA, ND75, and ENPD) were found to be up-regulated in RGE-treated 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, whereas EST6, IDH3A, PRI2, and ADH were down-regulated. Regarding the “hippo” signaling pathway, most of the enriched proteins (1433Z and ACT6) were up-regulated in RGE-treated flies.

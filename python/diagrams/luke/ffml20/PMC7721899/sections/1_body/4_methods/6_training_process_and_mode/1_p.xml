<p id="Par52">This section describes the training and model fitting (overfitting, underfitting, or balanced) for all the adopted methods. The total data is initially split into a training set and test set by 80:20 proportion. While the test dataset is kept unseen during the model training process, the training set is further split into 80% for training and 20% for validation. Here, to validate the model, a fivefold cross-validation is implemented. The optimum complexity is achieved when the minimum error for both the training error and validation error is achieved.</p>

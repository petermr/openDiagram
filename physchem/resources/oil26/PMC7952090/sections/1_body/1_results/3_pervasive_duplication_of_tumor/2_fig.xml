Branches are colored according to log<sub>2</sub> change in body size. Inset, phylogeny with branch lengths proportional to gene expression changes per gene. (<bold>B</bold>) Upset plot of cancer related Reactome pathways enriched in each Afrotherian lineage; lineages in which the cancer pathway enrichment percentage is less than background are shown in gray. Note that Upset plots are Euler diagrams showing intersections between sets; lines indicate intersections in pathway terms between lineages connected by that line (for example, the line connecting the points for Aardvark and Tenrec indicate pathway indications for those two lineages), and empty sets are not shown. (<bold>C</bold>) Wordcloud of pathways enriched exclusively in the Proboscidean stem-lineage (purple), shared between Proboscidea and Tethytheria (blue), or shared between Proboscidea and any other lineage (green).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-65041-fig3"/><p content-type="supplemental-figure"><fig id="fig3s1" specific-use="child-fig" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Figure 3&#8212;figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Estimated Copy Number by Coverage (ECNC) consolidates fragmented genes while accounting for missing domains in homologs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A single, contiguous gene homolog in a target genome with 100% query length coverage has an ECNC of 1.0. (<bold>B</bold>) Two contiguous gene homologs each with 100% query length coverage have an ECNC of 2.0. (<bold>C</bold>) A single gene homolog, split across multiple scaffolds and contigs in a fragmented target genome; BLAT identifies each fragment as a single hit. Per nucleotide of query sequence, there is only one corresponding nucleotide over all the hits, thus the ECNC is 1.0. (<bold>D</bold>) Two gene homologs, one fragmented and one contiguous. 100% of nucleotides in the query sequence are represented between all hits; however, every nucleotide in the query has two matching nucleotides in the target genome, thus the ECNC is 2.0. (<bold>E</bold>) One true gene homolog in the target genome, plus multiple hits of a conserved domain that span 20% of the query sequence. While 100% of the query sequence is represented in total, 20% of the nucleotides have four hits. Thus, the ECNC for this gene is 1.45. (<bold>F</bold>) Two real gene homologs; one hit is contiguous, one hit is fragmented in two, and the tail end of both sequences was not identified by BLAT due to sequence divergence. Only 75% of the query sequence was covered in total between the hits, but for that 75%, each nucleotide has two hits. As such, ECNC is equal to 2.0 for this gene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-65041-fig3-figsupp1"/></fig></p><p content-type="supplemental-figure"><fig id="fig3s2" specific-use="child-fig" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Figure 3&#8212;figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Correlations between genome quality metrics and ECNC metrics.</title><p>Gene copy number metrics, and the genome quality metrics most strongly associated with them, are highlighted in red.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-65041-fig3-figsupp2"/></fig></p></fig>

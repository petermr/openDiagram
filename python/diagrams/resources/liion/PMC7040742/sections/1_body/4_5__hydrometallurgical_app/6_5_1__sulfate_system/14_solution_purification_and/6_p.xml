<p>Electrowinning is a frequently used technique for plating metallic form of cobalt and nickel or electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) [

 <sup>2</sup>. Because the standard reduction potential of cobalt (II) (−0.28 V vs. Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE)) is lower than the potential for evolution of hydrogen (0 V vs. NHE), a low pH will promote the evolution of H
 <sub>2(g)</sub>. To avoid this side reaction, the cathode material should also exhibit a high overpotential over hydrogen. Prabaharan et al. and Lupi et al. used stainless steel and aluminum, respectively, as cathode material [

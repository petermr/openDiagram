0: For the iTRAQ labeling, the peptides were labeled with the 8-plex iTRAQ reagent by following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems).
1: Each iTRAQ reagent was dissolved in 70 L of ethanol and added to the respective peptide mixture.
2: The peptides from the  S. suis biofilms treated by tylosin were labeled with 115 isobaric reagent, and the peptides from the nontreated  S. suis biofilms were labeled with 116 isobaric reagent.
3: Then, the samples were multiplexed and vacuum dried.
4: Three independent biological experiments were performed.

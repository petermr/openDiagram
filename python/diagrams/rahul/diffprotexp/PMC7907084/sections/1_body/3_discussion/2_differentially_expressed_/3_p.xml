 <italic>CCNB2</italic>,
 <italic> CCNA1</italic>,
 <italic> CDC20</italic>,
 <italic> BUB1B</italic>, and 
 <italic>MAD2L1</italic> genes are also found to be differentially expressed in G1d and G1p cells. CCNB2 is essential for cell cycle control at the G2/M (mitosis) transition

 </sup>. Cyclin A1 (
 <italic>CCNA1</italic>) may not only be involved in G2/M transition, but also be required for nuclear envelope breakdown
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. Both genes showed higher expression levels in G1p cells. This finding was further confirmed by qPCR assay in our study (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). CDC20 (cell-division cycle protein 20), as the essential regulator to activate the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C), plays an important role in cell cycle progression
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. The gene 
 <italic>BUB1B</italic> encodes a kinase, which inhibits the APC/C in kinetochore to delay the onset of anaphase and ensure proper chromosome segregation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. The MAD2 protein, encoded by the gene 
 <italic>MAD2L1</italic>, binds to the mitotic spindle assembly to prevent the onset of anaphase until all the chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. Since all these genes showed higher expression levels in Gp cells at both follicular stages, these findings further support that G1p cells contain a greater percentage of mitotic cells.

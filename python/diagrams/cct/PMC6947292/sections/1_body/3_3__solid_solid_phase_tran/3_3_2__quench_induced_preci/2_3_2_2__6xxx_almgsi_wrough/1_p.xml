<p>In this work, a total of 10 different AlMgSi wrought alloys are investigated, none of which contain substantial amounts of Cu. The set of AlMgSi alloys includes two high-purity ternary alloys and eight commercial variants, which also contain further alloying additions and impurities besides Mg and Si, such as Mn, Fe and Cr.</p>

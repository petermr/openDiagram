<p id="Par9">In summary, our study proved that Clusterin is a target of metformin and the susceptibility to Clusterin-depended growth inhibitory effects of metformin in bladder cancer. Moreover, metformin targets Clusterin and inactivates SREBP-1c and its downstream target FASN, leading to blockage of de novo fatty acid synthesis to inhibit growth of bladder cancer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1p</xref>). These results uncovered an important role for Clusterin-regulated lipogenesis in maintaining bladder tumor growth and survival. This study provides a novel potential approach for individualized treatment with metformin in cancer patients with differential expression of Clusterin.

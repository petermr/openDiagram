<p id="Par25">Of all above transcripts, 75% were potentially protein coding, while the rest were non-coding RNAs (Fig.

We aligned in silico translated proteins against the human NCBI RefSeq proteins (release 92, last modified on 18 March 2019) and the newest non redundant releases of GenBank CDS translations, UniProtKB/SwissProt, Protein Data Bank, Protein Information Resource and Peptide/Protein Sequence Database proteins (updated on 11 April 2019) using NCBI blastp

 </sup>. Out of 1055 in silico translated proteins, 722 proteins were 90% or more identical to the proteins annotated in the public databases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, bottom panel). Such proteins form a clear peak on the curve of identity distribution and, to reduce noise, only these proteins were selected for downstream analysis.

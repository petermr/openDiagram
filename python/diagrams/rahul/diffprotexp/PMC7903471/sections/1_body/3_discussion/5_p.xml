<p>The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is involved in the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 and the regulation of the joint inflammatory microenvironment, based on significantly abundant KEGG signaling pathways. The present study suggested that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is related to the occurrence and progression of knee osteoarthritis. In addition, the present study identified several chemokine signaling pathways that are involved in the differentiation and metabolism of osteoclasts, which may also be related to the development of joint inflammation (

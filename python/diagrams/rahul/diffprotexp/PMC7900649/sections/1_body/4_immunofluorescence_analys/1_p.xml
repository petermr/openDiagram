<p id="Par37">IPEC-J2 cells were cultured until 80–90% confluence in 12-well plates and then infected with GDS01 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. At 7, 13 and 25 h post-inoculation (hpi), cells were collected and washed with PBS before fixation with cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. After washing twice with PBS, cells were blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS at RT for 1 h. Anti-PEDV N protein mouse monoclonal antibody 2B11 [

After washing thrice with PBST, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig(H + L) (1:500 diluted in PBST) at 37℃ for 1 h. After washing thrice with PBST, fluorescent images were taken under inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ti-U).

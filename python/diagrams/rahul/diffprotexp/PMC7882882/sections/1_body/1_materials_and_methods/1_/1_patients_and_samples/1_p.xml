<p>Patients diagnosed for NFPA (n=73) who underwent surgical resection at Beijing Tiantian Hospital (Beijing, China) from October 2007 to July 2014 were included in the study. The study inclusion criteria were: i) Patients older than 18 years; ii) MRI/CT showed a sellar region lesion; iii) pathological diagnosis was pituitary adenoma with no hormonal excess and iv) sufficient pre- and postoperative clinical and radiologic data. The exclusion criteria were: i) Patients with functioning adenoma, including tumor which secreted ACTH, prolactin, growth hormone and/or TSH and lead to the corresponding clinical syndromes of hormone excess and ii) history of pituitary surgery or radiotherapy. The patients included 34 men and 39 women, with a median age of 52 years (age range, 25–73 years). Out-patient clinic follow-up was conducted, the minimum follow-up time was 4 months, and the median follow-up time was 60 months (range, 4–98 months). The clinicopathological characteristics of all patients are shown in 
 <xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-12525" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>. All tumor samples were immediately placed into a sample tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored. Among them, 6 cases of recurrence within 1 year were randomly selected as the fast recurrence group and 6 cases of recurrence after 5 years were selected as the slow recurrence group. The postoperative recurrence of NFPA refers to the increase in the maximum tumor diameter by &gt;2 mm from the day of surgery to the end of follow-up as measured from any direction on magnetic resonance imaging. The histological subtype of tumors was defined according to the World Health Organization 2017 classification of endocrine tumors (

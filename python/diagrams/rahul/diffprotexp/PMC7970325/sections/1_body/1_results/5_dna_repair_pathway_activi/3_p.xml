<p id="p0160">Using these data we confirmed the previously revealed tendency that the majority of differential DNA repair pathways have minimal activation signature in FA, medium in FC and maximal in PC (

 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>). DNA repair pathway activation levels in adjacent pathologically normal tissues were very similar to the levels observed in the corresponding tumors (R Pearson = 0.8492, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16,

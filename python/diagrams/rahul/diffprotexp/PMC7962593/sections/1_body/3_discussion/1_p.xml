<p>Early recognition of sepsis is key to timely treatment. In this study, we subjected sepsis-related sequencing data to bioinformatics analysis in order to explore the sepsis-related molecular dysregulation mechanisms. Compared to other studies using the same datasets,
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> the present work used WGCNA and PPI networks to identify potential diagnostic markers for sepsis not only in adults but also in children. We further identified potential biomarkers associated with septic shock as well as methylation modification status. We found that in patients with sepsis, multiple metabolic pathways were significantly up-regulated, whereas infiltration by immune cells was significantly decreased. We identified nine potential biomarkers associated with sepsis progression. In addition, we found evidence that the expression of MAPK14, FGR, and CD247 is modified by methylation, which may facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock.

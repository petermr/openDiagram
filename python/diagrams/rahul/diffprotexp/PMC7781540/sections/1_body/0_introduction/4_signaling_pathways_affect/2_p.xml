<p>The increases in K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 expression following stimulation of microglia with LPS, AβO or αSyn
 <sub>Agg</sub> seem to involve many of the same signaling cascades that are affected by K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition, and K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers typically prevent increases in Kv1.3 expression. The K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 promoter contains multiple NF-κB and SP1 binding sites and inhibitors of NF-κB or p38MAPK independently reduce αSyn
 <sub>Agg</sub> stimulated Kv1.3 up-regulation in microglia [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], demonstrating that both the p38MAPK and the classical NF-κB pathways mediate the transcriptional regulation of K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>). The Src family kinase Fyn works upstream of the NF-κB transcription factor by regulating the nuclear translocation of its component p65 [

 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that Fyn knockout reduces both LPS and αSyn
 <sub>Agg</sub> induced increases in K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 current density in cultured microglia, an effect that can be mimicked by treatment of microglia with the Fyn inhibitor saracatinib or by deficiency for PKCδ, suggesting that the Fyn/PKCδ kinase signaling cascade is involved in mediating K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 upregulation in response to inflammatory stimuli [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As demonstrated in a Duolink proximity ligation assay, Fyn is directly interacting with Kv1.3 and is phosphorylating the channel at Y135 to increase its activity.

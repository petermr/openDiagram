<p>In the function of cell death and cell survival, there were 78 and 34 proteins involved, respectively, and 31 of them were common to both SWCNT and MWCNT exposures. Overall there was an increase of proteins associated with cell death and a decrease in proteins associated with cell survival. Interestingly, however, while the pathways were activated, our previous studies have indicated there was little actual cell death [

 <xref rid="B10-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This conclusion is based on the observation that while the TEER had a significant decline indicating a decrease in barrier function, the monolayer maintained a measureable TEER which would not be possible if the cells died and the junctional interactions were lost. So the decrease of these proteins may turn down the pathways that are essential for cell survival and basic metabolism and increase proteins associated with cell death. In future experiments, it will be interesting to determine if chronic (&gt;24 h) exposure will actually cause a decrease in cellular viability.

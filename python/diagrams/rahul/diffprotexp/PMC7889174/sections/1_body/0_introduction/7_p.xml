<p>To extend our understanding of the dynamic process of nuclear evolution beyond the NPC and lamina to the whole of the NE, we examined a set of NE and 
 <underline>NE-a</underline>ssociated proteins, that we collectively term ‘NEA’, from metazoan and kinetoplastid datasets together with published work (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). We analyzed conservation of NEA proteins across eukaryotes, finding only a small contingent to be broadly conserved with the majority of the cohort being remarkably divergent; frequently, identifiable orthologs can only be found in closely related organisms.

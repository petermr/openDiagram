0: Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, which belong to the family  Adenoviridae, aviadenovirus [ 1].
1: FAdVs are grouped into five species (FAdV-A to FAdV-E) with 12 serotypes (FAdV-1 to 8a and 8b to 11) based on restriction enzyme digest pattern and serum cross-neutralization test [ 2].
2: Different from other serotype fowl adenoviruses, FAdV-4 mainly causes hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) in 36 week-old broiler chickens with high morbidity and mortality [ 35].
3: HHS caused by FAdV-4 was first reported in Pakistan in 1987 [ 6], and then spread into other countries and regions, including Iraq, India, Japan, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Hungary, Korea, and China [ 7, 8], and resulted in enormous economic loss to the poultry industry worldwide.
4: However, the molecular pathogenesis of FAdV-4 is barely known.
5: Fibers are thought to be critical for viral infection and pathogenesis of FAdV [ 9].
6: It should be noted that serotypes FAdV-1, FAdV-4, and FAdV-10 have two Fibers (Fiber-1 and Fiber-2).
7: Zhang et al recently reported that Fiber-2 and Hexon, but not Fiber-1, were the virulent determiners for the highly pathogenic FAdV-4 isolates in comparison with the nonpathogenic strain [ 10].
8: Our group and other groups recent studies found that the Fiber-1, not Fiber-2, directly triggered the viral infection of FAdV-4 via its shaft and knob domains [ 11, 12].
9: However, the molecular basis of the Fiber-2 in the pathogenesis of the highly pathogenic FAdV-4 need to be further elucidated.
10: Here, Fiber-2 was identified to be interacted with the karyopherin alpha 3/4 (KPNA3/4) via its N-terminus of 140aa, and KPNA3/4 could facilitate the replication of FAdV-4.
11: Moreover, a rescued FAV-4-Del virus with a deletion of 740aa in Fiber-2 was highly attenuated  in vitro and  in vivo, and could provide efficient protection against the lethal challenge.

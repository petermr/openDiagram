0: The human BMSCs used in the present study were isolated from bone marrow tissues collected from healthy volunteers as previously described [ 23 25].
1: Briefly, 8 ml of bone marrow tissue from each volunteer was first washed with 12 ml of pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and separated by density gradient centrifugation (500 g; 20 min) using Lymphoprep medium (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway).
2: The interface liquid layer containing the mononuclear cells was carefully collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in low-glucose Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco).
3: After culturing at 37 C in a humidified chamber supplied with 5% CO 2 for 48 h, non-adherent cells were removed by changing the culture medium.
4: The remaining cells were cultured at 37 C under normal cell culture conditions with the renewal of DMEM medium every 3 days and passaged when cell confluence reached over 80%.
5: After three successive passages, the isolated BMSCs were used for various assays.
6: The research was approved in advance by the Ethical Committee of Sun Yat-sen University.
7: Written informed consent was obtained from each volunteer.

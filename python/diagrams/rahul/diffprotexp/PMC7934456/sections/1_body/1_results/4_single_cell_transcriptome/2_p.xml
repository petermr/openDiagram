<p id="Par25">We analyzed DEGs between sterile and restorer lines for advanced recognition of differences in gene expression patterns. We identified 831 genes in the comparison of fertility and infertility, including 501 upregulated genes and 330 downregulated genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). The genes with significant differences of FDR ≤0.05 were selected for KEGG enrichment pathway analysis. The results showed enriched genes in Photosynthesis, Photosynthesis-antenna proteins, Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, Starch and sucrose metabolism, Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, Fructose and mannose metabolism, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, and other metabolic pathways (Fig.

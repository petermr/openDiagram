 <caption> Effect of smoking and sex on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL expression. ( a) Expression of ACE2 (left), TMPRSS2 (middle), and CTSL (right) in TCGA data for males and females for 33 cancer types (n = 12,736) with available annotations in TCGA. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed and significant differential expression between groups was labelled **** p &lt; 0.0001 between males and females. ( b) Expression of ACE2 (left), TMPRSS2 (middle), and CTSL (right) in TCGA data for non-smokers and smokers with lung squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer, bladder urothelial carcinoma or esophageal carcinoma (n = 873). Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed and significant differential expression between groups was labelled. *** p &lt; 0.001 between non-smokers and smokers. ( c) Expression of ACE2 (left), TMPRSS2 (middle), and CTSL (right) in TCGA data for non-smokers and smokers with lung squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer, bladder urothelial carcinoma or esophageal carcinoma split into age groups: below 40 years (n = 68), between 40 and 60 years (n = 328), above 60 years (n = 477). Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed and significant differential expression between groups was labelled * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01 between non-smokers and smokers. </caption>

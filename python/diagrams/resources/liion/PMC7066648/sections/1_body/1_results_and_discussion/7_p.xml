<p>The cycle performance is further examined in this section. As shown in

 </xref>a, this 7 cm-long yarn-shaped LIB has a capacity of 0.45 mA h at 0.1 C. In addition, in the discharge platform range of 3.1–3.2 V, the battery has a voltage curve similar to that of the coin-type full battery, which rationalizes the design principle of the yarn-shaped LIB. With a cyclic charge/discharge analysis at 0.1 C (

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>b), the charging platform (3.4–3.55 V) and the discharging platform (3.0–3.2 V) indicate the typical charge/discharge curve of the battery. The cyclic stability test of the assembled yarn-shaped LIB at 0.2 C (

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>c) shows that the capacity retention is 42.78% and the Coulombic efficiency remains 54.2% from the 1st cycle to the 50th cycle. During the charging process, the anode experiences volume expansion, resulting in the generation of structural debris and new surface area. The additionally formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film will increase the amount of lithium-ion consumption. During the discharging process of the battery, the structural debris that have poor contact or have been detached from the conducting network of the anode will not participate in the electrochemical reaction, and these lithium ions are irreversibly lost. Therefore, Coulombic efficiency is not very satisfactory. To better understand the cycling capability of the yarn-shaped LIB, EIS measurements were performed before the 1st and after the 50th charge/discharge cycle (

 </xref>d). After 50 cycles, the ionic and electronic conductivities of the yarn-shaped LIB are reduced because the calculated impedance increases from 263.4 to 324.6 Ω and the linear slope of the low-frequency region is decreased. It is possibly due to the occurrence of interfacial side reactions inside the battery and SEI film formed on the surface of the electrode.

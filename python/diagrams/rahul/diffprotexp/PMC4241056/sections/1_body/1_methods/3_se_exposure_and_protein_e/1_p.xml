<p>In order to investigate the effects of Se in different chemical forms on the protein expression to Caco-2 cells, sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se were prepared at 100 nmol L
 <sup>-1</sup>. Before Se exposure, three forms of selenium sources were all diluted to the required concentration by HBSS. After washing, the Caco-2 cells three times by HBSS, the cells were incubated with HBSS containing 100 nmol L
 <sup>-1</sup> of Se in different forms (or only HBSS as control) for 2 h at 37°C in cell incubator. Two hours later, the cells were washed with HBSS triple and collected into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Then, the electrophoresis cell lysis solution was added to the Eppendorf tube, and the Eppendorf tubes were oscillated about 1 h to ensure the lysis sufficiently. Then, the ultracentrifuge was used to centrifuge the solution for 1 h at 4°C, 40,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, and the liquid supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C. Protein quantification was performed using the commercial protein assay kit with BSA as the standard (Jiancheng Biotechnology Co., Nanjing, China).

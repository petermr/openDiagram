0: Dissections of dorsal telencephalon/pallium or developing cortex were performed at E12.5 + 6 hr, E14.5, E17.5, and P0 from control (saline) and poly(I:C)-exposed MIA litters.
1: At E12.5, due to the smaller embryo size, dissections were made via a diagonal cut that maximized collection of dorsal telencephalon, but could have also included some subpallium/ventral telencephalon and superficial tissues.
2: For later time-points, dissection was of pallium/developing cortex.
3: Potential variance in the individual dissections should be mitigated by the inclusion of multiple replicates across both groups.
4: Dissections included both hemispheres from males and females, with exact numbers and sample details reported in  Supplementary file 20.
5: Independent litters were used for RNA-seq and immunoblotting.

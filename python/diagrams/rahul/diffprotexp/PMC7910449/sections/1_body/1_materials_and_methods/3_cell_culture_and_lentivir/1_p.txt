0: In this study, the ovarian cancer cell line was cultivated with Rosewell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, R8758) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin, followed by incubation at 37C in the presence of 5% CO 2.
1: The lentiviral vectors (LV2-1 and LV2-2) and the lentiviral overexpression vector (LV6, all from GenePharma) were transfected with circRAB11FIP1.
2: MIR-129 mimics and inhibitors were also provided by GenePharma.
3: An ATG5 or ATG7 overexpression plasmid was constructed using a pCMV5 vector.
4: The siRNA sequence targeting circRAB11FIP1 was as follows: LV2-1: 5-CAUGAUGAAGGUGGUAUAATT-3; LV2-2: 5-GAUGAAGGUAUAAGUUTT; ATG7: 5-CAGAAGGAGUCACAGCUCUUCCUUA-3; ATG5: 5-CAAUCCCAUCCAGAGUUGCUUGUGA-3; and negative control (NC) siRNA: 5-UUCUUCGAAGGUGUCACGUTT-3

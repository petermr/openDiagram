 <p> IC 50 of essential oils of A. citriodora against P815, MCF7, and VERO cell lines. AG: Agadir, BM: Beni Mellal, BE: Berkane, DE: Demnate, and MA: Marrakech. The data shown are the mean values ± SEM of three different experiments; each one was performed in duplicate. Statistical significance was determined with the one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Scheffe's test. Significance was considered at p &lt; 0.05 ( ∗), p &lt; 0.01 ( ∗∗), and p &lt; 0.001 ( ∗∗∗) compared to control (untreated cell). </p>)

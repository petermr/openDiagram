0: Total RNA was isolated from three different developmental stages of Tartary buckwheat seeds by using the EASYspin Plus Plant RNA Kit (Aidlab, Beijing, China) and digested by DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) to remove the genomic DNA.
1: Then, 2 g total RNA was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using the miRcute miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) following the manufacturers instructions.
2: The qRT-PCR was performed on a CFX96 Real-time System (BIO-RAD, USA) using the miRcute Plus miRNA qPCR Kit (SYBR Green) (Tiangen, Beijing, China).
3: Three independent biological replicates were used, and the  FtU6 was used as the reference gene.
4: The relative expression level of each miRNA was calculated by using the 2 Ct method.
5: All primers used in this experiment are listed in Additional file  1: Table S12.

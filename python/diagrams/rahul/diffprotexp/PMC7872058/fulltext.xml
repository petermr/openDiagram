The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) is a recently characterized pro-inflammatory receptor constitutively expressed on the surface of neutrophils and macrophages. A soluble form (sTREM1) of this protein that can be detected in human body fluids has been identified. Here we investigated the role of TREM1 during invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). IPA patients displayed significantly higher levels of sTREM1 in bronchoalveolar lavages when compared to control patients. Functional analysis in TREM1 showed that the levels of sTREM1 and TREM1 pathway-related cytokines were influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms in TREM1. In addition, we confirmed a role of TREM1 on antifungal host defense against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> in a murine model of IPA. TREM1 deficiency increased susceptibility to infection in the immunosuppressed murine host. Deletion of TREM1 showed delayed innate and adaptive immune responses and impaired pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. The absence of TREM1 in primary macrophages attenuated the TLR signaling by altering the expression of both receptor and effector proteins that are critical to the response against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. In this study, and for the first time, we demonstrate the key role for the TREM1 receptor pathway during IPA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>TREM1</kwd><kwd><italic>aspergillus fumigatus</italic></kwd><kwd>diagnostic biomarkers and fungal immune response</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001" disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe disease that can develop in immunocompromised hosts, such as individuals with neutropenia, those treated for hematological malignancies, and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT) [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>]. Despite improvements in antifungal therapy and the availability of better diagnostic tools, the detection, definitive diagnosis, and treatment of this disease remains challenging.</p><p>IPA usually starts in the lungs via the inhalation of airborne conidia. There, innate immunity is mediated by neutrophils, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages, which are the first line of defense against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and responsible for local inflammatory responses against this pathogen [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The recognition of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> by macrophages is performed by pattern recognition receptors, which include C-type lectin and toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize specific fungal components [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>]. Over the last decade, an additional family of evolutionary conserved innate immune receptors has been identified: the triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among them, TREM1 is the best-characterized member of the TREM family of receptors. TREM1, belonging to the Ig superfamily, is a cell-surface activating receptor with a single extracellular V-type Ig-like domain, a transmembrane region containing charged lysine residues, and a short cytoplasmic tail lacking signaling motifs. Receptor domains of TREM1 include both activating and inhibitory isoforms whose ligands are unknown [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>TREM1 is constitutively expressed by neutrophils and macrophages and its expression is further up-regulated by microbial components [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the precise role of TREM1 has not yet been clearly defined, it is well documented that TREM1 amplifies TLR4 and TLR2 inflammatory signaling [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, TREM1 can be secreted as a soluble form (sTREM1), and therefore it has been utilized as a diagnostic marker for inflammatory processes including infections. For instance, the presence of sTREM1 in samples from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from mechanically ventilated patients has been shown to be a good indicator of infectious pneumonia [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Compared to sepsis and bacterial pneumonia, studies evaluating the role of TREM1 in aspergillosis are relatively limited. Increased TREM1 expression is observed in monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, while reduced TREM1 expression is observed in individuals suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, TREM1 has been shown to modulate the immune response directed against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> during experimental fungal asthma [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in infected rat corneal epithelium [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to characterize the role of TREM1 in IPA. We assessed sTREM1 levels in clinical samples of IPA patients compared to controls and we tested for TREM1 functionality by assessing whether individual genetic variation in TREM1 had an impact on the detected levels of sTREM1 and other cytokine-driven immune responses against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. In addition to gain a deeper understanding of the role of TREM1, we compared the course of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infections and immune responses in TREM1-deficient (<italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and wild-type (<italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>+/+</sup>) mice.</p></sec><sec id="s0002" disp-level="1"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001" disp-level="2"><title>Patients and sample collection</title><p>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected from hospitalized adult patients (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age) during routine diagnostic workup following suspicion of infection at the Leuven University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium.

TREM1 is an immune receptor expressed on innate immune cells, such as neutrophils, mature monocytes, macrophages [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and platelets [<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. TREM1 is also expressed on lung alveolar macrophages, and this tissue-specific pattern of expression has suggested a potential role for this molecule in the activation of local inflammatory response during lung infections [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Besides the cell receptor, a soluble form of TREM1 (sTREM1) has been described [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. sTREM1 may be produced from a splice variant or following the shedding of membrane-bound TREM-1 by metalloproteinase-mediated proteolytic cleavage [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The biological function of sTREM is still unknown but based on data of other soluble forms of membrane receptors, sTREM1 may act as a negative regulator of TREM1 signaling by neutralizing TREM1 ligands and thus interfere with the pro-inflammatory function of the TREM1 receptor [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. sTREM1 can be detected in biological fluids during infection or inflammation, therefore, its relevance as a diagnostic biomarker is becoming important. There are several studies reporting that TREM1 plays a role in sepsis [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Plasma sTREM1 levels were positively correlated with high scores of severity and mortality [<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Serum levels of sTREM1 have also been reported to predict bacteremia in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a recent study, the association between serum sTREM1 levels and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) showed that serum levels were significantly increased in TB patients and these higher serum levels correlated with disease severity and treatment outcomes [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>A clear pathological hallmark of IPA is the pulmonary involvement which makes the BAL fluid examination a widely used procedure for the evaluation of patients with suspected aspergillosis. For instance, the detection of galactomannan, a polysaccharide present in the cell wall of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, in BAL fluids, has been advocated as a sensitive test for diagnosing IPA (26). In this study, we identified a specific role of sTREM1 in the clinical presentation of IPA. Patients with IPA had significantly higher levels of sTREM1 in BAL fluids when compared to control patients. Higher sTREM1 levels were also correlated with higher values of galactomannan. We could discard this finding as attributable to a general response to infection since events of viral, bacterial, and other fungi were diagnosed within the control group (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Considering the specific expression of TREM1 in the lung, we could suggest that the use of TREM1 alone or in combination with other biomarkers present in respiratory samples could improve our capacity to anticipate a more accurate diagnosis for IPA.</p><p>Functional analysis of SNPs in TREM1 has shown that levels of sTREM1 can be regulated by individual variability at genomic level with a potential impact on the progression and severity of the disease and patient outcome [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, a clinically relevant association of the rs2234237 T-allele with higher levels of sTREM1 has been reported in mechanically ventilated burn patients and in sepsis [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. TREM family receptors have been also suggested to regulate the cellular adhesion process and trans-endothelial migration [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this context, the T allele at rs2234246 was associated with increased levels of sTREM1, affecting its expression levels, and with increased levels of soluble L-selectin which are thought to represent a homeostatic effort to limit excessive inflammation [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we stratified sTREM1 levels detected on the BAL of IPA and control patients according to TREM1 genotypes. We found changing levels of sTREM1 for rs2234237 and rs2234246 and we also found that TREM1 genotypes influenced the profile of proinflammatory cytokines. Based on the fact that in IPA higher levels of inflammatory mediators at the site of infection might indicate a more severe infection [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we could hypothesize that TREM1 genotypes associated with an increase of sTREM1 levels and alteration of pro-inflammatory cytokines production in response to <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection may impact disease progression that can ultimately affect patient outcomes.</p><p>We found that humans with pulmonary Aspergillosis manifested elevated levels of sTREM1 in BALs. Accordingly, mice infected with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> showed increased lung sTREM1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>). In vivo, the role of TREM1 has been characterized in experimental murine models of microbial sepsis, infection with influenza virus, <italic>Leishmania</italic> major and other bacterial infections, in which suppression of TREM1 signaling conferred significant protection [<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43&#x02013;45</xref>]. In these models, protection was associated with reduced severe inflammation and diminished expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the case of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infections, although reduced cytokine-driven inflammation can contribute to less damage in the lungs, impaired innate immune response and a lower capacity to mount early cytokine responses represent a primary risk factor for susceptibility, particularly in an immunosuppressed host [<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this sense, our study showed that, compared to WT mice, immunosuppressed <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice were more susceptible to aspergillosis. We found that both granulocytes and monocytes were recruited after infection in the murine lungs although cell recruitment was affected in the TREM1&#x02013;deficiency setting. Granulocytes and monocytes were diminished in <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> infected mice compared to infected WT mice at 2 dpi. Fungal burden was checked in both groups (data not shown) to discard that the observed differences were not a consequence of differential fungal growth in the lungs. Furthermore, we showed that the difference in the amount of granulocytes and monocytes was still maintained after 5 dpi and they were below the initial values in the <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> background. Since recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear cells into the lungs is a crucial event in the early phases of IPA [<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], we could attribute an increased susceptibility of <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice to an impaired pulmonary inflammation in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> that impacted survival in the immunosuppressed host.</p><p>The innate immune response during <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection triggers the development of an acquired immune response inducing the development of diverse CD4 T-cell responses that include T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells. In this sense, our results suggest an impaired immune response characterized by diminished recruitment of T-cells (CD3, CD4, and CD8) and B-cells (CD19) to the lungs of <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice, especially at 2 dpi.</p><p>Histological visualization of lungs agreed with above-mentioned results and showed that infection with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> produced lung inflammatory responses in both murine genetic backgrounds. However, WT mice showed a significant infiltration of inflammatory cells and it was possible to appreciate destruction of blood vessels. As described before [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], an important role of TREM1 has been reported in cellular adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils and monocytes. The histological pattern of <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice would correlate with an impaired recruitment of inflammatory cells in the lungs and an apparent decrease of tissue damage due to the absence of TREM1. Although we could hypothesize that suppression of the TREM1 pathway may be beneficial for the pathological processes associated with IPA, our results indicate a higher susceptibility to infection by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. This agrees with fact that a right balance between moderating excessive inflammation while preserving the capacity for microbial control is required for a successful resolution of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infections [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The recognition of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> conidia induces the expression of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines [10;11]. In line with previous results, we observed that the complete deficiency of the receptor was associated with decreased <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. The production of CXCL1, IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF, and IL-6 was decreased in the lungs of <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice at early stages on the infection (2 dpi). Time course pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>), followed the same pattern than the detection of sTREM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>). While pro-inflammatory cytokines and sTREM1 levels decreased at 3 dpi, the number of immune cell was still increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4</xref>). These findings agree with the hypothesis that this soluble form can be neutralizing the production of cytokines [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] but it does not mediate a direct effect in the influx of immune cells.</p><p>The early control of microbe&#x02019;s invasion primarily depends on professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages. In vitro studies have suggested that TREM1 may enhance phagocytosis [<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, we observed that the capacity of phagocytosis of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia was slightly reduced in the absence of TREM1. In addition, gene expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, the adaptor protein MyD88 as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, CXCL1, MCP1, IL1&#x003b2;, and TNF&#x003b1;, were quantified in order to corroborate the hypothesis of a synergistic effect between TREM1 and inflammatory reactions mediated by TLR4 and TLR2. Using murine macrophages isolated from <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice, we observed a decreased expression of all the studied genes in the absence of TREM1 after 6&#x000a0;hours of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge. These <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest a role for TREM1 in the recognition of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and support the role of TREM1 as an important modulator of the inflammatory response against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. From a mechanistic point of view, we could suggest that TREM1 acts as a supplementary molecule amplifying the immune response, but not initially inducing it, since its absence does not suppress completely the expression of TLR2 and TLR4. These receptors are important for the recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells to the lungs during IPA. The fact that the expression of the TLR&#x02010;MyD88 pathway is reduced in conditions of TREM1 deficiency will impact the response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> by restraining the release of cytokines and chemokines and less effective recruitment of immune cells to the lungs.</p><p>Collectively, our data provide evidence for a potential diagnostic value of sTREM1 in IPA. Initial findings on TREM1 functionality suggest that the impact of TREM1 SNPs in IPA should be further investigated. In addition, we showed a role of TREM1 on antifungal host defense against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> in a murine model of IPA. TREM1 deficiency in mice, increased susceptibility to infection in an immunosuppressed murine model of IPA. Based on our findings, we can suggest that TREM1 deficiency mediates susceptibility against <italic>Aspergillus</italic> in mice due to a delayed innate and adaptive immune responses and impaired pro-inflammatory cytokine response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6548"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_1879471_SM6548.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank to Professor Christoph Mueller (Bern University) for providing us with breeder pairs of <italic>Trem</italic>1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p></ack><sec id="s0023" disp-level="1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><sec id="s0024" disp-level="1"><title>Transparency declarations</title><p>LAF, LBM, SMG, IGJ, BA, CC, LL, JAM, EM, MLG, AC do not have a financial relationship with any commercial entities that have an interest in the subject of this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s0025" disp-level="1"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Bernal-Mart&#x000ed;nez L designed and performed experiments, analyzed data, and prepare the manuscript, Gon&#x000e7;alves SM and Gonzalez Jimenez I performed experiments; de Andres B and Cunha C performed experiments, analyzed data and contributed for preparing the manuscript; Lagrou K and Maertens JA provided patient samples and reviewed the manuscript; Mellado E and Gaspar ML designed research and contributed for preparing the manuscript; Carvalho A designed research, analyzed data and contributed to writing the manuscript; Alcazar-Fuoli L designed and performed experiments, analyzed data and wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="s0026" disp-level="1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplemental data for this article can be accessed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2021.1879471">here</ext-link>.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Kontoyiannis</surname>

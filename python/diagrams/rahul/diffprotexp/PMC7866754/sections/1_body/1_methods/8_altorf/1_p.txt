0: Along with the out-of-frame peptides from retained intron and UTR classification, all peptides from MSTRG transcripts (excluding antisense transcripts) that overlap with known genes were also compared with the corresponding six frame translated coding sequences.
1: The frame from which the peptides are translated can then be detected, and those from non-canonical frame, were classified as products of AltORFs.
2: However, it is worth noting that almost half of these AltORF peptides map to frames that are antisense (frame 4, 5 and 6) to the canonical genes (341/732 peptides in oocyst sporozoites, and 379/733 peptides in salivary gland sporozoites), these peptides are categorized as AltORF products as they are not associated with antisense transcript.

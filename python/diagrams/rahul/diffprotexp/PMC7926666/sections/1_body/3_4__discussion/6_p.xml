<p>Additionally, to shed light on the further experimental studies, we identified MET protein as an ideal potential drug target in pRCC and showed the high potential of twenty-one Zinc molecules (
 <xref rid="jpm-11-00158-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) as candidate therapeutics for future preclinical studies. The integration of the transcriptome and protein interactome data with the drug knowledge helped to uncover 21 in silico validated potential drug candidates for pRCC. These in-silico findings can be used further to design and synthesize novel MET inhibitors. Furthermore, ZINC73196087, ZINC72318117, ZINC72318118, ZINC73163075, ZINC73165724, ZINC73196196, and ZINC72318119 have been shown to demonstrate effective anti-proliferative activity against a panel of c-Met-amplified gastric cancer cell lines [

We propose that these ZINC compounds should also be evaluated with experimental studies for RCC cell lines and we conclude that these molecules might be potential therapeutics for the management of the pRCC. Further in vitro/in vivo pharmacological evaluations and clinical validations are needed for approval of these candidate drugs.

0: For cohort 1, all steps of protein digestion, 6-plex TMT labelling, peptide fractionation and LC-MS analysis on the Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system coupled with the high-resolution LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), were previously described 12 and are recapitulated in the Supplementary Methods.
1: The sample preparation protocol formed the basis of processing for cohorts 24 using 10-plex TMT labelling and an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with otherwise only minor alterations as described in the Supplementary Methods.

 <caption> (A) Spectral counts (means ± SE; n = 4) of differentially expressed terminal alkane oxidation proteins during growth on a medium-chain alkane ( n-C 14,), a long-chain alkane ( n-C 28,) and a non-hydrocarbon control (Tween 80) in Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1. ∗ denotes spectral counts significantly greater ( P &lt; 0.05) during growth on n-C 14 relative to growth on n-C 28 and TW. (B) Oxidation of an n-alkane by the identified proteins in the non-heme iron alkane monooxygenase system. The ferredoxin reductase (FdxR) oxidizes NAD(P)H to NAD(P) +. The electrons (e -) generated from this are shuttled to the alkane monooxygenase (AM) by the ferredoxin (Fdx). The monooxygenase introduces oxygen into the alkane at the terminal carbon converting it into a primary alcohol. This alcohol is further oxidized to an aldehyde and then to a fatty acid by the alcohol dehydrogenase (AD) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD), respectively. </caption>

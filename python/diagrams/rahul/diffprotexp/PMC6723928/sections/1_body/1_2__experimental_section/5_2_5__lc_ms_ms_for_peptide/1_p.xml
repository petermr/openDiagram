<p>Nano LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Easy 
 <italic>n</italic>-LC (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, USA) and an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a nano-electrospray source. Samples were separated on a C18 nanobore column (150 mm × 0.1 mm, 3 μm pore size; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mobile phase A for LC separation consisted of 0.1% formic acid and 3% acetonitrile in deionized water, while the mobile phase B had 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A linear chromatography gradient of 5% B to 30% B in 23 min, 30% B to 60% B in 3 min, 95% B in 3 min, and 3% B in 6 min with a flow rate of 1500 nL/min was used. Mass spectra were acquired using data-dependent acquisition with a full mass scan (350–1200 
 <italic>m/z</italic>) followed by 10 MS/MS scans. For MS1 full scans, the orbitrap resolution was 15,000 and the AGC was 2 × 105. For MS/MS in the LTQ, the AGC was 1 × 104.

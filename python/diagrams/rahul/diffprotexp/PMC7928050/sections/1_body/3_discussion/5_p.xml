<p>Remarkably, we observed a highly significant downregulation of major urinary proteins when comparing genes expression profiles 7 to 15Â days after transplantation. Literature to these proteins is rather scarce, presumably because these proteins do not have direct homolog in humans. Mups have been described as pheromones. This here presented work may rise attention to possible other significance of these proteins. Zhou et al. suggested that Mup1 plays a role in the systemic glucose and lipid metabolism regulation in hepatocytes[

<p>Biofilms are bacterial communities attached to the surface of a biotic or inanimate object, usually surrounded by bacterial extracellular macromolecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides, DNA, RNA, lipids, and phospholipids [

 <xref rid="cit0170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Due to the physical barrier effect of biofilms and the special microenvironment within the membrane, biofilms contain the following peculiar features: (I) resistance to environmental stressors, antibiotics, antibodies, and host defense; (II) bacterial persistence in the environment and inside the host leading to chronic infection, or paroxysmal acute infection when planktonic cells are periodically released from the biofilm [

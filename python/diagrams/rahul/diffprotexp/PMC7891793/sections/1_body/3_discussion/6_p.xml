<p>Another gene that was differentially expressed only in the treatment group 6 was CMTM7, which is a “CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 7”. It belongs to chemokine-like factors super family (CKLFSF). It has been demonstrated that lack of CMTM7 causes reduction in innate-like B cell population B-1a leading to a deficiency of natural IgM and IL-10 [

Considering the fact that CMTM7 expression in lung tissue with lesion was lower, we can only speculate that its expression was reduced in lesions because the presence of B-1a cells was no longer required in resolving lung tissue. In contrast it may be upregulated in lung tissue without lesion to attract and support innate-like B cells.

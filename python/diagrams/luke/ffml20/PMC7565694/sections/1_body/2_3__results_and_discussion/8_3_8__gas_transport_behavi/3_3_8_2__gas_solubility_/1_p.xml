<p>To understand the gas sorption behavior, the sorption isotherms of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PI matrices were investigated by GCMC simulations. The results are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f014">Figure 14</xref>. The initially rapid uptake at low pressures followed by a slower gain in loading at high pressures was observed. At low pressures, the Langmuir-mode adsorption at the micro-voids was dominant, while the Henry-mode adsorption at the inter-polymer chain free volume was primary at high pressures [
 <xref rid="B52-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The sorption data of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O fitted well to dual mode sorption model and the obtained solubility coefficients are listed in 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The solubility coefficients of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PI matrices showed the trend of Kapton ˃ 2,7-CPPI ˃ 2,7-CPI. The smaller size and fewer number of cavities in 2,7-CPI resulted in fewer gas sorption sites and thereby the lowest solubility coefficients. The large size and more number of cavities in Kapton led to its highest solubility coefficients. Additionally, H
 <sub>2</sub>O presented larger solubility coefficient than O
 <sub>2</sub> in a particular PI matrix, which was contrary to the trend of their diffusion coefficients. This was mainly due to the strong affinities between H
 <sub>2</sub>O and PI matrix [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], high critical temperature (H
 <sub>2</sub>O: 647 K, O
 <sub>2</sub>: 155 K) and small size of H
 <sub>2</sub>O, which favored the adsorption processes of H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the polymer matrix.

<p id="Par6">A fascinating characteristic of macrolides is that even when they can tightly bind to wild-type bacterial ribosomes, they cannot block the synthesis of all proteins. Kannan and coworkers

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> have identified protein sequences in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureas</italic> that can bypass the drug-obstructed tunnel to become partially or fully synthesized. A key finding is that the ability to bypass macrolides does not depend on the entire sequence of the synthesized protein, but rather on its N-terminal sequence

 </sup>. The N-terminal segment of H-NS can be synthesized even when erythromycin is bound in the exit tunnel, although its movement is slowed down

 </sup>. Furthermore, while the synthesis of a protein known as OsmC is inhibited by erythromycin, this inhibition is overcome when various lengths of H-NSâ€™s N-terminal residues are covalently attached to the N-terminus of OsmC, saturating at 12 H-NS residues

 </sup>. Erythromycin is still bound in the tunnel after translation of the entire H-NS protein

 </sup>, indicating that H-NS peptide bypasses erythromycin. Despite the important role of macrolide resistance in antibiotic development, motifs of peptides that are stalled by erythromycin, telithromycin and azithromycin have been extensively studied

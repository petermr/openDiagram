<p>The release of cellular constituents into the supernatant was measured following Paul

 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] method. The 2 days old mycelia from PDB were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 20 min, washed 3 times, and resuspended in 100 mL phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.0). The resulting suspension was treated with MPE with MIC and MFC for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. Then, 2 mL of sample was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 2 min, and 1 mL of supernatant was used to measure the cellular constituents in spectrophotometer at 260 nm.

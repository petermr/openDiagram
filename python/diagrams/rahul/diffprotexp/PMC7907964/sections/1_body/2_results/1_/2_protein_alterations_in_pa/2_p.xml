<p>According to the criteria used to filter all MS and MS/MS data, there were 122 proteins in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants and 119 proteins in the 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants that could be compared with those found in age-matched healthy controls. Heat map analysis revealed the differential protein expression levels of fibroblasts with each 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variant compared with those of fibroblasts from healthy controls (

 <xref rid="f1-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In addition, the top 25 proteins with the highest differential expression in each variant were selected and displayed (

 <xref rid="f1-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Among these, the average expression of 5 and 11 proteins in patients with PD patients with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants, respectively, was altered by &gt;1.5-fold compared with that of the controls (

 <xref rid="tII-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="table">B</xref>). The levels of ANXA2, histone H4, protein S100-A11 (S100A11), transgelin (TAGLN) and RPL18 were higher in the fibroblasts from patients with GBA-PD. The levels of TUBB, CD antigen 81, elongation factor 1-α (EEF1A1), spectrin α chain (SPTAN1), histone H2A type 1-B/E (HIST1H2AB), L-lactate dehydrogenase A chain (LDHA), spectrin β chain (SPTBN1), electron transfer flavoprotein subunit α (ETFA), filamin-B (FLNB), polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) and COL1A1 were altered in fibroblasts from patients with PARK2-PD.

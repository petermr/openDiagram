<p>Although some issues still need to be overcome to increase the applicability of the proposed system, namely the low Co(II) distribution and the cost and toxicity of [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl IL, this work provides guidelines for the development of responsive non-aqueous mixtures for the integrated leaching and separation of critical metals from complex waste streams. The close to fourfold concentration of Co(II) in the mixture through the simple addition of water greatly simplifies downstream purification, opening the possibility for Co(II) recovery by electrodeposition [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This proof of concept demonstrates how the judicious mixture of an IL with an organic acid can result in the selective “one-pot” leaching and solvent extraction separation of target metals from multiple impurities present in a real waste matrix through the simple addition of water as a counter-solvent. This contrasts with leaching processes using aqueous acidic solutions or hydrophilic eutectic solvents from which additional separation stages requiring further solvent consumption are required.

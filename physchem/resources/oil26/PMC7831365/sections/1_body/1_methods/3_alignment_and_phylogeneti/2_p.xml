<p>A gene tree was reconstructed by Mrbayes 3.2 (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>) with a general time reversible (GTR) substitution model and rate heterogeneity modeled with a Gamma distribution, as conducted by MrModeltest version 2 using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Nylander, 2004</xref>). In bayesian analysis, four simultaneous runs with four chains each were run for two million generations, sampling every 1,000 trees. The first 25% of these trees were discarded as burn-in when computing the consensus tree. Tracer v1.5 software was used for checking convergence among chains in Bayesian analysis. When the ESS value is higher than 200, and the average standard deviation of spilt frequencies is lower than 0.01, we think it reach convergence level.

<p>Cytosolic and mitochondrially enriched fractions were further fractionated using ion exchange chromatography in a spin column format (UFC30HV00 column, UFC3000TB centrifuge tube, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Samples (100 μg each) were equilibrated with 50 μl of buffer A (9 M Urea, 2% CHAPS in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 9.0) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Buffer B (buffer A diluted 1 part to 8 parts with 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 9.0) was used to dilute samples to 200 μL. The quaternary ammonium anion exchange beads (Q ceramic HyperD F, Pall BioSera, New York, NY) were equilibrated with three changes of 200 μL of buffer B. Samples were loaded onto the column and mixed on an end-to-end mixer for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged for 1 minute at 1000 g. This eluate was the flow-through fraction. The column was removed from the centrifuge tube and placed in the next centrifuge tube (Q1, pH 9). 400 μL of pH 9 elution buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 9.0, 0.1 OGP) was loaded onto the column and placed on the end-to-end mixer for 10 minutes and then centrifuged. This process was repeated for fraction Q2 (pH 7.0 elution buffer: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 0.1% OGP), fraction Q3 (pH 5.0 elution buffer: 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 0.1% OGP), fraction Q4 (pH 4.0 elution buffer: 100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0, 0.1% OGP), fraction Q5 (pH 3.0 elution buffer: 50 mM sodium acetate pH 3.0, 0.1% OGP), and fraction Q6 (organic wash: 33% isopropanol, 17% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluroacetic acid). All fractions were stored at -80°C until use. Three fractions (Q1, Q2, and Q4) derived from the cytosolic fraction of pooled control mice brains were employed for the reproducibility study. The EAE study employed mitochondrial fractions (Q1- Q6), from individual EAE and control mice.</p>

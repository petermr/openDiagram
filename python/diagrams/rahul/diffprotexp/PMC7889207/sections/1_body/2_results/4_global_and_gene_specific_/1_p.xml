<p>To gain insight into the involvement of DNA methylation in the CD-induced gene expression changes in SAT and VAT, we assessed global DNA methylation levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results revealed that DNA methylation levels were reduced by 50% in SAT (p &lt; 0.001) and 52% in VAT (p = 0.025) from CD- compared to STD-fed rats (

 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> gene expression was significantly upregulated in response to CD-feeding in VAT, we next explored whether 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> expression changes in this depot were due to DNA methylation. To this end, we analysed the DNA methylation status of the 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> exon 1 region in VAT isolated from CD- or STD-fed rats using pyrosequencing. An analysis of six CpG sites situated within the first exon of 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(a</xref>)) revealed hypomethylation at one CpG site (CpG5), positioned 668 base pairs (bp) downstream from the transcriptional start site (TSS) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(b</xref>)). Moreover, analysis of the cumulative methylation across all six CpG sites revealed significantly lower DNA methylation in CD- compared to STD-fed rats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(c</xref>)). Since 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> was not differentially expressed between the diet groups in SAT, we did not pursue pyrosequencing analysis for this depot.

<p>The FT-EXAFS spectrum for a spinel-like structure features three distinct peaks (see

  <xref rid="fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>
 </xref>a), where the first broad feature at ∼1.5 Å corresponds to the superposition of all metal–oxygen contributions with different corresponding metal valences and tetrahedral/octahedral coordinations and is thus significantly distorted due to many nonequivalent metal–oxygen bonds contributing to it. The second peak at ∼2.5 Å corresponds to the bond between Oh cations, while the third peak ∼3.1 Å is attributed to the presence of absorbing atoms in a Th environment and is a superposition of contribution of bonds between Th–Oh metal species and Th–Th metal species. By following the changes in the intensities of these peaks, Wu et al. were able to track the changes in the occupancy by Co of tetrahedral and octahedral sites with increasing the Fe doping in CoFe

 </sup> The quantitative analysis of these trends is, however, challenging. While the aforementioned single-scattering contributions are dominating, MS contributions and additional metal–oxygen bonds also add to the second and third peaks in the FT-EXAFS, complicating its deciphering. A complex fitting scheme based on some significant simplifications and constraints for this class of materials was developed by Calvin et al.

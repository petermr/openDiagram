<p id="Par37">In the combined analysis of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMSâ€™s near-isogenic lines with multiple omics, we screened 24 differential genes and carried out yeast two-hybrid detection of these differential genes with the restorer gene 
 <italic>Rfp</italic> sterility gene 
 <italic>orf224</italic> in 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS, looking for the same 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS fertility changes related protein. Finally, we screened seven 
 <italic>Rfp</italic> interacting proteins, whose primary functions are RNA editing, anther development, and tapetum development-related protein interactions. The sterility gene 
 <italic>orf224</italic> protein screened out five interacting proteins; their main functions are electronic the respiratory transmission chain, anther development, and oxidative phosphorylation related proteins. Therefore, we speculate that the restorer gene 
 <italic>Rfp</italic> acts on the sterility gene by forming a protein complex with the above types of proteins, resulting in the loss of function of the sterility gene and the restoration of fertility. Infertility genes mainly interact with proteins related to the electron respiratory transport chain, directly act on proteins related to anther development, or interact with proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, which affect the development of anthers and fail to develop pollen grains that are initially normal. Therefore, we have screened 12 candidate genes through multi-omics joint analysis combined infertility genes and restorer genes for follow-up research, which provides a specific data basis for the analysis of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS, and also provides help for revealing the potential molecular mechanism of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS.

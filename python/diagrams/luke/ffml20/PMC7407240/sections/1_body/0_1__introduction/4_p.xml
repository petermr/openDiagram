<p>In this paper, poly (vinyl alcohol) has been blended with ι-carrageenan in different weight ratios to obtain hydrogels through physical crosslinking (alternative freeze–thaw cycles). The hydrogels were used as drug release vehicles for three types of antibiotics: tetracycline, amoxicillin and gentamicin sulfate. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first report of using ι-carrageenan as a coblending component to obtain hydrogels through physical crosslinking. The benefit of using this carrageenan stems from the presence of two sulfate groups per galactan structural unit, which allows for increased interaction with PVA through hydrogen bonding, and more active binding/release tuning sites in the hydrogel matrix, compared to κ-carrageenan which presents one sulfate group per the same structural unit. Additionally, only a few studies have used ι-carrageenan-containing materials as drug release matrices. This study could serve to enlarge the dynamically expanding database of biopolymer-synthetic polymers systems description, as well as of hydrogel materials application possibilities.</p>

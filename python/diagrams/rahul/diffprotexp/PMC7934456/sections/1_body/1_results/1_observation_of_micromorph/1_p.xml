<p id="Par17">We used the sterile line 1141A of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS and the restoring line material bing409. After 13 generations of backcrossing, we constructed the NIL material of the restoration gene of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS. There was no phenotypic difference between the sterile line and the restorer line throughout the asexual development period. However, in the later period of the restorer growth, the 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS’s flower buds and flowers’ morphology differed significantly. After stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy observation of the difference between the anther and pollen of the sterile line and restorer line, we found a considerable difference in pollen between the sterile and restorer lines. In the sterile line, the buds and stamens were dried up, the petals became smaller and contracted, and there was no pollen and significantly less nectary (Fig.

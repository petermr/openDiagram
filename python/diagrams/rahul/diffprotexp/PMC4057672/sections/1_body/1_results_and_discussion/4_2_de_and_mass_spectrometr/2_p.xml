 <xref rid="t1-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 14 protein spots were selected and enzymatically hydrolyzed. MALDI-TOF/MS identification was performed on these 14 proteins, with 8 were successfully identified. SSP2102 and SSP3101 were Apoa1 apolipoprotein. SSP3402, SSP4401 and SSP6502 were Alb serum albumin, while SSP5103 and SSP6103 were Prdx6 uncharacterized protein (

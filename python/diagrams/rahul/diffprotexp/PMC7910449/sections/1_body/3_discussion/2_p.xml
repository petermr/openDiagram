 </sup>. The present study demonstrated that circRAB11FIP1-mediated autophagy enhanced EOC cell proliferation and migration. In addition, the circRAB11FIP1 level was upregulated in EOC tissues compared with matched non-carcinoma tissues. Therefore, circRAB11FIP1 might serve as a candidate marker to diagnose and treat EOC.

<p>In contrast to that, AAF/I, AAF/III, and AAF/V showed aggregates that were partially reminiscent of the strictly two-dimensional “stacked-brick” pattern described for the corresponding wild type cells [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>, note loci with less dense bacterial aggregates). However, most of the formed bacterial aggregates were rather three-dimensional, which may have disturbed the formation of a regular two-dimensional arrangement. Notably, the bacteria expressing AAF/I formed the largest aggregates on HEp-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>), as previously observed for the corresponding EHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, this appears to be a trait that is mediated directly by this specific AAF subtype.

<p>LMH cells infected with FAdV-4 or FAV4_Del or transfected with pcDNA3.1-F1 or pcDNA3.1-F2 plasmid were harvested and lysed on ice in lysis buffer with PMSF, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors, then the cell lysate was centrifuged with 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 minutes. And then the lysate was mixed with 2 μg of antibodies against Fiber-2 or KPNA3/4 at 4°C overnight. Then, 30 μL of protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the mixture for additional of 3 h incubation, the mixture of protein and beads was then washed five times with PBS, boiled with protein loading buffer, followed with western blot analysis.</p>

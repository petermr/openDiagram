 <caption> (a) Schematic depiction of the ML-EXAFS analysis method: in situ EXAFS data are processed via wavelet transform and fed into a neural network trained on theoretical EXAFS spectra. The NN then yields the corresponding partial RDFs. Data taken from ref ( 25). (b) Au–Pd and Au–Au and (c) Pd–Pd and Pd–Au partial RDFs, reconstructed by an NN from the corresponding experimental Au L 3-edge and Pd K-edge EXAFS data for PdAu NPs with different Pd concentration. The RDFs are integrated to obtain partial coordination numbers for the first four coordination shells, and the latter are used to model possible NP size and the distributions of metals (d).

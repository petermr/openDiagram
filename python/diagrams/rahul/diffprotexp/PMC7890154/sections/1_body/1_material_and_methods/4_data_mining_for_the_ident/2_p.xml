<p id="par0055">The RNA-seq data generated earlier for the identification of SAGs in wheat under HS (

We identified 21 putative transcripts showing homology with MAPK reported from different plants (Table S1). Even, the identified DEPs (as mentioned earlier) were characterized for their fold expression by calculating the ratio of pixilation of the protein spot in HS-treated upon the control. MAPK, being prominent DEPs, were further targeted for the identification of specific MAPK gene using reverse genetics approach.

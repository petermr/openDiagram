<p>To check whether Hsp70 interaction with NKCC2 takes place also at the ER, we visualized the subcellular distribution of EGFP-NKCC2 and Myc-Hsp70 by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, EGFP-NKCC2 (green) co-localized with Myc-Hsp70 (red), indicating that these two proteins share overlapping subcellular localization. Interestingly, similar to STCH, Hsp70 protein displayed also co-localization with the ER marker calnexin, which in agreement with the notion that the interaction engages mainly the immature and ER resident form of NKCC2. Interestingly, in cells co-expressing GFP-STCH and Myc-HSP70, these two NKCC2 binding partners appeared also to share some overlapping subcellular localization. Collectively, these data provide evidence, that similar to the non-inducible Hsp70-like protein STCH, the stress-inducible Hsp70 interacts also with the immature form of NKCC2, an interaction that takes place very likely at the cytoplasmic side of the ER.

<p id="Par13">By analyzing the differential expression of genes between Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, we identified 1319 up-regulated and 478 down-regulated genes in Cluster 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). To further explore gene expression patterns over time, we selected six patients, whose transcriptome features changed from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2 in adjacent time periods (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, red box-shadow). Differential genes were divided by Mfuzz software into clusters with similar patterns along longitudinal time-points. We identified differentially expressed genes in Cluster 1-to-2 transition in all six time-point pairs, including 263 up-regulated genes and 32 down-regulated genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b–d). To verify the reliability of these 295 genes, we further selected 4 paired of adjacent time-points showing Cluster 2-to-1 transfer, with 85.2% of down-regulated genes and 99.2% of up-regulated genes showing consistency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, blue box-shadow). Thus, the expression of 295 genes showing cluster transition may be key factors that change during the time in which patients exhibit critical disease. Enrichment analysis further showed that, compared to Cluster 2, genes related to acute inflammation response decreased in Cluster 1, while genes related to protein catabolism, erythrocyte differentiation, ferroptosis, and organelle disassembly increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). These results suggest that cellular catabolism was enhanced, but the immune response was somehow weakened in Cluster 1. As approximately 80% of Cluster 1 samples were from deceased patients, the overall physiological changes observed in Cluster 1 may highlight the biological function of these pathways in COVID-19 patient prognosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).

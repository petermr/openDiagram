<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Four Petri dishes (12&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1.5&#8201;cm) were used as an arena, connected to a central board with plastic tubes (diameter 2&#8201;cm) at an angle of 45&#176;. The other dishes were distributed around them in equidistant distances and two plates were put together symmetrically opposed. Two hundred and forty individuals (120 larvae and 120 adults) of <italic>T. molitor</italic> were released in the central board and the control group received sugarcane and chayote. A total of 5&#8201;uL of the estimated LC<sub>90</sub> lethal concentration of garlic essential oil and toxic compounds were applied on absorbent filter paper (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2&#8201;cm) placed in two opposite plates used as treatment and two opposite ones with 5&#8201;uL of distilled water for absorbent filter paper represented the control. Four replicates per treatment and control were evaluated by the number of individuals per plate after 24&#8201;hours calculating the repellency index (IR): RI&#8201;=&#8201;<italic>2</italic>&#8201;<italic>G</italic>/(<italic>L</italic>&#8201;+&#8201;<italic>P</italic>), where G is the percentage of insects in the treatment and P is the percentage of insects in control. Treatments were classified as neutral if the index was equal to one (1); repellent, higher than one (1), and; attractive lower than one (1).</p>

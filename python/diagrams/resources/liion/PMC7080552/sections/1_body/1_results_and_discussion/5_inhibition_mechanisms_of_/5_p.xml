<p>EIS measurements were also carried out to examine the interfacial stability of the Li–B–Mg anode and pure Li anode over the range of 0.01–10
 <sup>5</sup> Hz during cycling. Figure S9 (Supporting Information) shows the results of the interfacial resistance measurements after different cycles at 0.5 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with a fixed capacity of 0.5 mA h cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. It can be clearly observed from Figure S9 (Supporting Information) that the Li–B–Mg composite assembled symmetrical battery exhibits a stable and ultralow interfacial resistance of less than 15 Ω during the cycling after the first cycle. On the contrary, pure Li assembled symmetrical battery displays erratic resistance behavior, indicating that an unstable interface between metallic Li and the electrolyte has been formed.

<p>TREM1 gene expression induction, together with other genes of the pathway, was first seen in a previous transcriptomic analysis of murine lungs infected with 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (Alcazar-Fuoli L., personal communication, Figure S1). To confirm these findings and to correlate increasing sTREM1 levels in response to 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection in mice, we assessed sTREM1 levels in lung homogenates of WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>). We observed that those levels were significantly increased after infection and then decreased gradually.

<p id="Par24">Plant height and tiller number per plant of the high sterile cultivar SR-159 were larger than that of low sterile cultivar SR-157, but flag leaf area was smaller in the former compared to the latter (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Both cultivars had similar panicle length and average grain weight, but differed considerably in panicle weight and number of primary and secondary branches per panicle and grain number. Panicle weight was smaller in SR-159 although it had more numbers of primary and secondary branches and grains per panicle. Possession of higher number of grains and branches increased their compactness (density) in the panicle of SR-159. Although panicle spikelet number was high in SR-159, most of them were barren, which decreased the margin of contribution to panicle grain weight more than that of SR-157 cultivar.

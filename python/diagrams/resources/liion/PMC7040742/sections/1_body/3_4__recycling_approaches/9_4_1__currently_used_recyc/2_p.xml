<p>Pyrometallurgy is the most common method currently used in the recycling industry by major companies, such as Umicore (Belgium), Dowa and Sumitomo (Japan), Accurec (Germany), Batrec (Switzerland), and Nickelh√ºtte Aue Gmbh (Germany). The pyrometallurgical process is usually followed by hydrometallurgical steps to extract valuable metals from the matte, as pyrometallurgical processes cannot achieve the efficient separation of various metals. In contrast, recycling plants that use only hydrometallurgical processes are still rare, and the most important are Retriev (Canada and US) and Recupyl (France). A review of the development status of hydrometallurgical recycling processes is provided in the subsequent sections. </p>

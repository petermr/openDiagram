  <p>GO terms and KEGG pathways enrichment of the reference genes associated with novel peptides identified in oocyst sporozoite and salivary gland sporozoite. For GO terms enrichment the p-value cut-off was 0.01, and 0.02 for KEGG pathways. Percentage of genes means how many percents of the background genes (in 
   <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>) with a particular term are present in the gene set of interest

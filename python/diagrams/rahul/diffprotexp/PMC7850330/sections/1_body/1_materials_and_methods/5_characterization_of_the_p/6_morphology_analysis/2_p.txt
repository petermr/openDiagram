0: The morphology of the selected nanoemulsion (F3) was investigated through transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan).
1: The selected nanoemulsion was suitably diluted with deionized water and dripped on a copper mesh.
2: For enhancing the image quality, 2% w/v phosphotungstic acid solution was added as a negative stained standard (Mallick et al.,  2020).
3: The morphology was also further confirmed via scanning electron microscope.
4: The samples were positioned on polycarbonate substrate while the excess water was removed by drying first at ambient temperature and then by carbon dioxide.
5: Samples were coated with gold and examined under a scanning electron microscope (KYKY EM3200, China) running at an accelerating voltage of 20  kV.

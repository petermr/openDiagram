<p id="par0115">A remarkable result of our proteomic analysis revealed that FV-PTC cannot be accurately clustered due to the proteome similarity between benign and FV-PTC. Our finding is highly consistent with the key publication of Nikiforov et al., where an international panel of pathologists and clinicians reclassified noninvasive FV-PTC as “non-cancer” to reflect its noninvasiveness and low recurrence risk

Interestingly, some proteins regulating the energy metabolism showed increased expression (fc ≥10) in FV-PTC lesions when compared to the benign tissues. Cellular proliferation relies on the energy and biomass production from tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In order to fulfill the demands of TCA cycle, pyruvate is converted to oxaloacetate. The enzyme pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes this reaction and replenishes mitochondrial oxaloacetate levels

Additionally, branched chain amino acid catabolism provides major nitrogen source for glutamine, an important amino acid for the production of proteins, hexosamines and macromolecules. In fact, the role of glutamine and glucose in cancer and cellular proliferation has already been under spotlights (reviewed in Pavlova and Thompson et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). Although these lesions are considered less aggressive, the increase in pyruvate carboxylase and members of branched-chain amino acid dehydrogenase in FV-PTC highlight the change in energy metabolism. Moreover, up-regulated expression of mitochondrial proteins also indicated the higher demand for energy production in FV-PTC lesions.

0: P3 membranes were solubilized as described in the previous section and 200 L of the detergent-solubilized supernatant was injected in a Superose 6 10/300 GL gel-filtration column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) Glycerol, 0.1 mg/mL DDM, 0.02 mg/mL CHS.
1: Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) experiments were performed in an AKTA TM purifier chromatography system (GE healthcare) with a fluorescence detector (FP-4025, JASCO) connected in line with the column.
2: The excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorescence detector were set, respectively, to 460 and 520 nm.
3: FSEC chromatograms were plotted using Plot2 software and data was normalized.

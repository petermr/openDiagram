<p>LFQMS identified and quantified 2,852 unique protein database entries in the Calu-3 cell line (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="proteomes-01-00219-s001">Table S1 and S2</xref>). Statistical analysis by ANOVA (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and Pairwise Multiple Comparisons (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) determined that incubation with CNT at concentrations of 10 μg/mL and 100ng/mL resulted in significant changes protein expression profiles (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-01-00219-f002">Figure 2</xref> show the log2 fold change and 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of all proteins in treated compared with untreated, control cultures. At the high concentration, the volcano plot tends to be symmetrical, which indicates the exposure to high concentration of CNTs caused comparable increases and decreases in protein expression. Additionally, the expression of few proteins was significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Conversely, at the low concentration, the abundance of many proteins was significantly changed and the volcano plot is skewed to the left, indicating that the relative amount of a majority of the proteins was decreased after CNT exposure. Among all the exposures, only 3, 2, 1, 1 proteins had increased expression at concentration of 10 μg/mL MWCNT, 10 μg/mL SWCNT, 100 ng/mL MWCNT, 100 ng/mL SWCNT, respectively. After exposure to high concentration of MWCNT and SWCNT, only 8 and 13 proteins significantly changed, while after exposure to low concentration of MWCNT and SWCNT, the abundance of 283 and 282 proteins was significantly altered (

<p>After euthanization by cervical dislocation, mouse brains were dissected on ice into three different brain regions: hippocampus (H), cortex (C), cerebellum (CB). Samples were homogenized in homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors), sonicated for 5 min in a water bath and incubated with rotation for 15 min. Insoluble debris was removed by a centrifugation step for 20 min at 13,000×

<p>The significant increase of the nasal mucosa relative mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1 and TGF-β in positive control group after induction of nasal mucosa inflammation indicated that the induction of inflammation was successful resulting in upregulation of this expression. The absence of change in the marker’s expression after treatment by free drug nanoemulsion indicated that the treatment with the plain nanoemulsion had no effect on these markers. The significant decrease of the marker’s expression after treatment with co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride conventional emulsion indicated that the treatment with the emulsion causes downregulation of these marker’s expression. However, the further and highly significant decrease of these markers after treatment with the nanoemulsion formulation, F3, revealed a superior downregulation of the inflammatory markers. Thus, the co-loaded loratadine and sulpiride nanoemulsion had a more efficacious action in managing inflammation compared to the corresponding emulsion formulation.</p>

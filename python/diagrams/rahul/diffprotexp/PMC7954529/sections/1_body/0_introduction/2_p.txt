0: The main mechanisms that contribute to mRNA isoform diversity are alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA).
1: Alternative splicing produces different combinations of coding sequences in mature mRNA and protein.
2: APA occurs at genes that have more than one polyadenylation site (PAS) and can result in mRNAs with different coding sequences or variable 3' UTR lengths.
3: Like alternative splicing, APA that occurs within the gene body can affect protein sequence and function.
4: ( Lee et al., 2018;  Pan et al., 2006;  Sandberg et al., 2008;  Tian and Manley, 2017;  Vasudevan et al., 2002;  Yao et al., 2018).
5: Unlike with alternative splicing, a PAS in a coding region will lead to a truncated isoform rather than a different combination of included exons.
6: APA that occurs outside of the coding sequence, in the 3' UTRs, can lead to differential inclusion of protein-binding motifs that can affect translational efficiency, mRNA stability, and mRNA localization ( Mayr, 2017;  Tian and Manley, 2017).
7: Yet, despite its potential to produce tremendous variation in mRNA and protein regulation, few studies have explored the contribution of APA to regulatory divergence between species.
8: Indeed, our current understanding of APA conservation in mammals comes from few comparative studies of humans and rodents ( Ara et al., 2006;  Wang et al., 2018a).
9: However, these studies used sequence conservation rather than direct measurements of PAS usage to characterize APA ( Wang et al., 2018a).
10: Thus, it remains possible that many mammalian PAS are functionally divergent despite having similar sequences.

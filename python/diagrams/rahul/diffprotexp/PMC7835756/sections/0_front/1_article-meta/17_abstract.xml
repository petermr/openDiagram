 <p>Epigenetic regulation is a key component of stress responses, acclimatization and adaptation processes in plants. DNA methylation is a stable mark plausible for the inheritance of epigenetic traits, such that it is a potential scheme for plant breeding. However, the effect of modulators of stress responses, as hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>), in the methylome status has not been elucidated. A transgenic tobacco model to the 
  <italic>CchGLP</italic> gene displayed high H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> endogen levels correlated with biotic and abiotic stresses resistance. The present study aimed to determine the DNA methylation status changes in the transgenic model to obtain more information about the molecular mechanism involved in resistance phenotypes. The Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed a minimal impact of overall levels and distribution of methylation. A total of 9432 differential methylated sites were identified in distinct genome regions, most of them in CHG context, with a trend to hypomethylation. Of these, 1117 sites corresponded to genes, from which 83 were also differentially expressed in the plants. Several genes were associated with respiration, energy, and calcium signaling. The data obtained highlighted the relevance of the H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> in the homeostasis of the system in stress conditions, affecting at methylation level and suggesting an association of the H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> in the physiological adaptation to stress functional linkages may be regulated in part by DNA methylation.

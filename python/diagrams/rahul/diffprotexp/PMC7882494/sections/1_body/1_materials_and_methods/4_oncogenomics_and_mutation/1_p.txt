0: cBioPortal 6 is an online server for exploration, visualization, and analysis of multidimensional cancer genomics data ( Cerami et al., 2012).
1: We use it to analyze the impact of the COL11A1 gene in the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma TCGA PanCancer dataset containing 594 samples.
2: It provides a wide range of analysis tab within its server.
3: The oncoprint demonstrates the overview of the COL11A1 gene across the dataset and also generate the heatmap of the correlated gene.
4: Further using the mRNA expression data of the top 25 positively correlated genes, a clustered heatmap is generated using the delimited data on the Clustviz server 7.
5: The cancer type summary tab provides a detailed overview of the COL11A1 gene across the different subtypes of colorectal cancer i.e., mucinous adenocarcinoma of colon and rectum, colon adenocarcinoma, and rectal adenocarcinoma.
6: It also shows the mutation of the COL11A1 gene for colorectal cancer and the mutational correlation within the associated gene set.
7: The different types of mutations associated with the COL11A1 gene for colorectal cancer were analyzed using COSMIC-Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer 8 which is the worlds largest source of expert for manually curated somatic mutation information related to human cancers ( Tate et al., 2019).

0: Using R library  seurat54, we created a seurat object ( CreateSeuratObject), normalized data ( NormalizeData), found variable genes ( FindVariableFeatures), and rescaled data using a linear model ( ScaleData, use.umi =  F).
1: After that, we generated 50 PCs ( RunPCA) but only used 35 of them based on the PCs visualization distribution ( ElbowPlot).
2: Since Allen data were already annotated, we only used tSNE ( RunTSNE) to facilitate visualization.
3: A group classified as None by Allen metadata were removed from our analysis.
4: This strategy generated 7 main different cell types: Astrocytes, Endothelial cells, Glutamatergic Neurons, GABAergic Neurons, Microglia, Oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs).
5: To assign genes to specific cell types, we used the AverageExpression function.
6: Using pct.exp bigger than 0.1, we created a list of genes that were expressed by each cell type.

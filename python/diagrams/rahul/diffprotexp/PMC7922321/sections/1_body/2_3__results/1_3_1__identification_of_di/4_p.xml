<p>Previous microarray studies where either constitutively active Elk-1-VP16 or PEA3-VP16 was overexpressed in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells have identified a number of transcriptional targets for these ETS proteins. In order to narrow down our search and focus on gene regulatory networks of ETS proteins, we have identified overlapping genes by comparing DEGs from glioma grades 2â€“4 with the microarray results from Elk-1-VP16 and PEA3-VP16 overexpressing cells; 2637 genes were found to be at the intersections of these two experiments, with 63 genes commonly regulated in both glioma tumor samples (DEGs), as well as cell line studies (Elk-1-VP16 and PEA3-VP16) (

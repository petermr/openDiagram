<p>Trophozoites from each isolate were maintained in flat-sided 10-mL tubes (Nunclon delta) filled with complete TYI-S33 medium [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] containing 6 mM glucose and subcultured twice weekly. Mtz-resistant lines were cultured in the presence of Mtz (Sigma Aldrich; 100 mM stock dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) at a final concentration of 30 μM, while parental lines were maintained in 1% DMSO. The Mtz-sensitive lines used in this study included WB1B (WB-MtzS), BRIS/83/HEPU/106 (106-MtzS) and BRIS/87/HEPU/713 (713-MtzS) along with their respective Mtz-resistant progeny lines WB1B-M3 (WB-MtzR), BRIS/83/HEPU/106-2ID10 (106-MtzR) and BRIS/83/HEPU/713-M3 (713-MtzR). IC
 <sub>50</sub> for Mtz for resistant and susceptible isolates was previously determined as detailed in Ansell et al. [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Isolate nomenclature and references for axenization and induction of Mtz resistance induction are provided in Table

<p id="Par6">To investigate the role of Clusterin in tumorigenesis, subcutaneous tumors bearing stable knockdown Clusterin (UMUC3-shCLU) and parental UMUC3 cells (UMUC3-shCtrl) were implanted, respectively. The tumors derived from UMUC3-shCLU cells resulted in a remarkably slower growth rate (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5a</xref>), smaller tumor size, and weight (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5b</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that Clusterin, FASN, and SREBP-1c protein levels were decreased in UMUC3-shCLU cell developed tumor tissue (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5c</xref>). These results suggest that Clusterin depletion can effectively suppress bladder tumor xenografts in vivo.

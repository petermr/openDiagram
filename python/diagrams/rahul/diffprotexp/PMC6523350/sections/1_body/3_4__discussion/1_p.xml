<p>Protein is both the specific executive of life activities and the embodiment of the final life function. Its integrity cannot be denied, and the countless indispensable functions performed by proteins are still the debate of the century. However, to fully exploit natural genetic information, efforts should be made to develop and utilize novel tools. Proteomics is an emerging novel tool to study proteins. An integrated proteomic approach (iTRAQ), with the combined use of high throughput mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), was employed. The basic essential functions performed by proteomics are: (i) Proteomics can study proteins with specific physiological functions on a large scale, and then clarify the information about the whole protein. (ii) It can obtain the qualitative and quantitative information of key proteins to effectively study the function and interaction of proteins, protein expression, and post-translational modification, etc. (iii) The presence of differentially expressed proteins may lead to differences in the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Therefore, protein expressional change identification is critical and has deep regularity effects. It will, therefore, be helpful in identifying the mechanism of Se-enrichment in rice. </p>

<p id="Par7">After harvesting, tissues were processed for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that PSM, ES, MS and DS samples cluster into three distinct groups, with MS and DS samples clustering together (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis comparing PSM and ES revealed up-regulation of 713 genes and down-regulation of 583 genes; comparing ES and MS revealed up-regulation of 145 genes and down-regulation of 155 genes; and comparing MS and DS revealed up-regulation of 53 genes and down-regulation of 26 genes. Comparisons between samples confirmed that the greatest differential was observed between PSM and any of the somite samples, followed by the number of differentially expressed genes between the most recently formed epithelial somites and the most differentiated somites (ES versus DS) (Supplementary Fig.

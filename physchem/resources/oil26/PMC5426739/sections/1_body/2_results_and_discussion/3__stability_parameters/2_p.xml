In this study, all samples showed a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in PV, after 3 months storage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). As expected, oil samples kept at room temperature had higher PV than the samples stored in a refrigerator. Oxidation is retarded at low temperature.</p>

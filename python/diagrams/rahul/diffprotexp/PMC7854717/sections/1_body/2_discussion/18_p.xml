<p id="Par47">An interesting finding that can explain the atrio-ventricular gene expression differences is the preferential expression of certain homebox genes such as 
 <italic>Dkk3</italic> (dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 3) and, 
 <italic>Pdlim3</italic> (PDZ and LIM domain 3) and 
 <italic>Hmgb1</italic> (high mobility group box 1) at atrial level, and 
 <italic>Pdlim1</italic> (elfin), 
 <italic>Fhl2</italic> (four and a half LIM domains 2) and 
 <italic>Hmgb3</italic> (high mobility group box 3) at ventricular level

 </sup>. The large transcriptomic differences found between the two atria and the much smaller ones between the two ventricles can be linked to the unequal cell proliferation rates along and across the primitive heart tube and changes in spatial orientations

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the differences between the atria and the ventricles go beyond the expression level. One may observe in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> that the expression synchrony of the sodium channels between the adjacent chambers is practically perfect between the ventricles and very poor between the atria.

 <caption> Cluster of functionally connected GO terms in LN and their associated genes in the comparison of treatment group 6 vs 2. Differential gene expression analysis in LN across treatment groups showed DE genes in treatment group 6 versus 2. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these genes (p&lt;0.05) was conducted and results were visualized as a map of predicted connections among significantly enriched GO terms and related genes.

0: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 2024 nt noncoding small RNAs that provide specificity to Argonaute (AGO) protein(s) to repress gene expression via transcript cleavage or DNA methylation (Bartel,  2004; Krol et al.,  2010; Wu et al.,  2010).
1: In plants, roles of miRNAs in regulating the expression of genes involved in the development, hormone biosynthesis, and signaling pathways have been analyzed during various stages of development (Reinhart et al.,  2002; Rogers & Chen,  2013; Tang & Chu,  2017).
2: In particular, miRNAs belonging to miR156, miR166, miR172, miR319, and miR396 families, were shown to play an important role during seed development (DArio et al.,  2017; Rodrigues & Miguel,  2017).
3: Recently, miR396 and miR397mediated regulation of seed size/weight determination in Arabidopsis and rice has been revealed (Debernardi et al.,  2014; Duan et al.,  2015; Li, Gao, et al.,  2016; Wang et al.,  2014; Zhang et al.,  2013).
4: Moreover, the role of a few miRNAs has been analyzed in regulating cell growth and division during seed development in legumes (Bandyopadhyay et al.,  2016; Song et al.,  2011).

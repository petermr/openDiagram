<p>To our knowledge, no publications describing a comparison between tape-derived and biopsy-derived gene expression are available in CLE. Such studies are published in AD and psoriasis. The two modalities yielded distinct yet overlapping results. Kim 
 <italic>et al</italic> showed that expression of terminal epidermal differentiation markers in tape-derived HV and AD samples correlated with expression of the same markers in adjacent biopsy.
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Dyjack 
 <italic>et al</italic> found that in non-lesional AD skin, there was more overlap between skin tape and biopsied epidermis than between either skin tape and biopsied dermis or biopsied epidermis and biopsied dermis.
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Highlighting the relevance of tape sampling for inflammatory skin disease, in an AD type 2 high endotype the most highly differentially expressed genes detected by skin tape were related to activation of T
 <sub>H</sub>2 and DC pathways.

 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> found that tape-derived transcriptomes analyses from patients with AD and psoriasis were correlated with a previously published transcriptome biopsy dataset. Interestingly, tape transcriptomes from AD non-lesional skin showed greater fold changes than biopsy specimens for both AD and psoriasis, with tape RNA showing significant upregulation of T
 <sub>H</sub>2 products (CCL17/TARC and TNFRSF4/OX40) not found in biopsy specimens.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Taken together, these data indicate that tape-derived RNA yields distinct and overlapping results relative to biopsy-derived RNA, and certain biomarkers can be assessed by tape RNA in better resolution than biopsy-derived RNA.

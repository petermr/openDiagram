<p>pUC
 <italic>r-yfp</italic> and pUC
 <italic>r-cfp</italic> were constructed as described previously, except that primers MBPD 82/83 were used for the amplification of the kanamycin resistance cassette from pACYC177 [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. pUC
 <italic>r-yfp</italic> and pUC
 <italic>r-cfp</italic> were used as templates to generate linear PCR products to generate chromosomal P
 <italic>dps-cfp</italic> and P
 <italic>dps-yfp</italic> transcriptional fusions in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain MG1655 as described previously [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The P
 <italic>dps-cfp</italic> and P
 <italic>dps-yfp</italic> fusion constructs were amplified from chromosomal DNA with primers MBP 140 and MBPD 156, digested with 
 <italic>Kpn</italic>I and cloned into pWKS30 [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], digested with 
 <italic>Fsp</italic>I and 
 <italic>Kpn</italic>I to create pPS1 (dpsP-
 <italic>cfp</italic>) and pPS2 (dpsP-
 <italic>yfp</italic>), respectively, for the differential fluorescent labeling of stationary phase 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.

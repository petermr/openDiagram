In an inorganic nitrogen-deficient environment, some vegetative cells of the cyanobacterium <italic>Anabaena</italic> differentiate into heterocysts. We assessed the photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixing capacities of heterocysts and vegetative cells, respectively, at the transcriptome level. RNA extracted from nitrogen-replete vegetative cells (NVs), nitrogen-deprived vegetative cells (NDVs), and nitrogen-deprived heterocysts (NDHs) in <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 was evaluated by transcriptome sequencing. Paired comparisons of NVs vs. NDHs, NVs vs. NDVs, and NDVs vs. NDHs revealed 2,044 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and several nitrogen metabolism-related pathways were significantly enriched. Synthesis of <italic>Gvp</italic> (Gas vesicle synthesis protein gene) in NVs was blocked by nitrogen deprivation, which may cause <italic>Anabaena</italic> cells to sink and promote nitrogen fixation under anaerobic conditions; in contrast, heterocysts may perform photosynthesis under nitrogen deprivation conditions, whereas the nitrogen fixation capability of vegetative cells was promoted by nitrogen deprivation. Immunofluorescence analysis of nitrogenase iron protein suggested that the nitrogen fixation capability of vegetative cells was promoted by nitrogen deprivation. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis in vegetative cells and heterocysts at the transcriptome level. This study provides a foundation for further functional verification of heterocyst growth, differentiation, and water bloom control.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 31670681; 3177072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Yunqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31670681; 31770723).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec022">Supporting information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec022">Supporting information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyanobacteria evolved approximately 3.5 billion years ago. As the first photosynthetic prokaryotes on earth, cyanobacteria can efficiently fix atmospheric nitrogen via a process catalyzed by nitrogenase [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nitrogenase-catalyzed substrate reduction requires the association of an iron (Fe) protein and molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein, with electron transfer occurring from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. However, nitrogenase responsible for the reduction of N<sub>2</sub> is extremely sensitive to O<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. How to avoid oxygen released during photosynthesis by nitrogenase has attracted much attention. Cyanobacteria need to segregate the timing of nitrogen fixation from oxygenic photosynthesis by restricting nitrogen fixation to the dark period of diel cycles or spatially separate these processes by restricting nitrogen fixation to heterocysts [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Under nitrogen-deprivation conditions, heterocysts differentiate from vegetative cells only in the filaments of cyanobacteria [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is well-known that vegetative cells perform photosynthetic functions, whereas heterocysts perform nitrogen fixation functions in cyanobacteria. However, whether both cell types perform photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation simultaneously remains unclear.</p><p>All aerobic nitrogen fixation occurs in heterocysts in a semiregular pattern, and nitrogen fixed in heterocysts is transported to vegetative cells in the filament; vegetative cells supply carbon and reductants to heterocysts [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The heterocyst is the site of dinitrogen fixation and provides oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase with a low-oxygen environment [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In general, heterocysts lack photosystem II activity and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, and they cannot photoreduce CO<sub>2</sub> via the reductive pentose phosphate pathway to provide carbon skeletons for assimilation of fixed nitrogen [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The heterocyst develops a special glycolipid layer that serves as a gas diffusion barrier, and the heterocyst glycolipid layer can be modified in response to the external O2 concentration [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248155.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, other studies suggested that heterocysts are not the only cells capable of nitrogen fixation in heterocystous cyanobacteria and that vegetative cells can fix molecular nitrogen using another nitrogenase encoded by a homologous gene cluster named as nif2 [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mutants of heterocystous cyanobacteria (<italic>het</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) that fail to produce heterocysts retain their nitrogen fixation ability when incubated under micro-oxic or anoxic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, studies are needed to evaluate the nitrogen fixation ability of vegetative cells and photosynthetic ability of heterocysts in cyanobacteria.</p><p>Recent genome-wide studies have focused on cell-specific metabolism in cyanobacteria by comparing gene transcript levels under different growth conditions or stage-specific gene expression signatures in response to nitrogen step-down. RNA sequencing was used to study transcript expression levels in filaments at different periods of nitrogen step-down using a mixture of heterocysts and vegetative cells [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Using samples collected during the differentiation in three developmental states, a DNA microarray containing 6,893 gene fragments were was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulating the differentiation of heterocysts, akinetes, and hormogonia in the cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, seven genes encoding transcriptional regulators that respond to nitrogen deprivation in <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 were identified by oligonucleotide microarray technology, and the results for an <italic>nrrA</italic> deletion mutant suggested that <italic>nrrA</italic> facilitates heterocyst development [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, vegetative cells in the mycelium samples were not separated from heterocysts in the filamentous cyanobacteria. Therefore, the function of vegetative cells and heterocysts may have been biased in sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Compared with vegetative cells, heterocysts cells of <italic>Anabaena</italic> have thicker walls and better resist adverse external environments, providing a theoretical basis for the separation and purification of the two types of cells. In general, two strategies are used to isolate and purify heterocysts from the mycelium: sonication treatment [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or lysozyme treatment [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Vegetative cells easily crack during these treatments, resulting in the isolation of heterocysts without vegetative cells. Heterocysts can be isolated from mycelium containing both vegetative cells and heterocysts of <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain 7120 with lysozyme for RNA-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Immunofluorescence analysis of NifH indicated that its expression in vegetative cells was low when the nitrogen supply is sufficient; moreover, nitrogen deprivation induced and promoted the expression of NifH in both vegetative cells and heterocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g007">Fig 7</xref>).

Our results show that heterocysts and vegetative cells function by coordinating activities related to photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. This direct comparison of transcript levels in NVs, NDVs, and NDHs revealed many characterized genes that are differentially regulated in the three cell types which should be further studied in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria under nitrogen deprivation conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Experimental strain and treatments</title><p><italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 is a model strain useful for performing molecular studies of cell differentiation and heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria; this strain was purchased from the Freshwater Algae Culture Collection at the Institute of Hydrobiology with accession number of FACHB-418. The initial strain was cultured in Blue-Green medium (BG11) for 3 days, and then centrifuged and used in subsequent experiments. Nitrogen-replete medium (BG11) [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and nitrogen deprivation medium (BG110) were used to culture PCC 7120 at an initial inoculation concentration OD<sub>730</sub> of 0.1. Before inoculation, the strain was centrifuged and washed three times with BG11 or BG110 for purification and enrichment. The culture period was 72 h. To maintain the relative stability of nutrient elements in the culture medium, the strains were centrifuged and replaced with fresh culture medium every 24 h. After 72 h of culture, the strain OD<sub>730</sub> in BG11 medium and BG110 medium were 0.997 and 0.621, respectively. The strain was cultured in 250-mL flasks sealed with plastic ventilating film, and the culture volume was 100 mL. PCC 7120 cultivation was carried out in a double layer shaping incubator under the following conditions: light of 300 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000b7;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 30&#x000b0;C, and shaking at a speed of 140 rpm.

After 72 h of cultivation, the formation of vegetative cells and heterocysts in the filaments was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1A1, 1A2, 1B1 and 1B2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>RNA extraction from vegetative cells and heterocysts</title><p>In total, three RNA samples (NDV, NDH, and NV) were used for extraction, each with three biological replicates. &#x0201c;NDV&#x0201d; refers to vegetative cells of PCC 7120 cultured in BG110 (N-deficient medium), &#x0201c;NDH&#x0201d; refers to heterocysts of the PCC 7120 strain cultured in BG110, and &#x0201c;NV&#x0201d; refers to vegetative cells of the PCC 7120 strain cultured in BG11 (nitrogen-replete medium).</p><p>RNA was extracted from NDVs and NVs as described by Golden et al [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with some modifications: 500 mL NDVs and NVs was sedimented at 500 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. To ensure that only vegetative cells were broken down, the concentration of lysozyme was low and enzymolysis time was short. The precipitate was resuspended in 1 mL lysozyme solution (1 mg/mL lysozyme in TE buffer) at 30&#x000b0;C for 5 min, shaking each tube for 15 s at 1-min intervals. Next, 5 mL of guanidine isothiocyanate cell lysis solution (mixed solution in the EASYspin Plus Bacteria RNA kit, Aidlab, Beijing, China) was added to terminate the reaction as quickly as possible. This solution was centrifuged to remove the precipitate, and the supernatants were used for RNA isolation according to the instructions of the EASYspin Plus Bacteria RNA kit (Aidlab). The sediment obtained after this treatment contained vegetative cells and heterocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1C1 and 1C2</xref>).</p><p>NDHs were purified and enriched using as described by Golden et al [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with some modifications: 500 mL NDHs was cultured in BG110 for 72 h and sedimented at 500 &#x000d7;g for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. To eliminate contamination by vegetative cells, NDHs were treated with a high concentration of lysozyme, Triton X-100, and long-term cell lysis to ensure that all vegetative cells were completely lysed. The precipitate was re-suspended in 50 mL lysozyme solution for 1 h at 25&#x000b0;C (5 mg/mL lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100 in TE buffer). Most vegetative cells were lysed during this period, whereas the heterocysts remained intact, as determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1D1 and 1D2</xref>). The microscopy results showed that heterocysts were mixed with impurities produced by lysed vegetative cells because of the strong adhesion of heterocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248155.g001">Fig 1D1 and 1D2</xref>). This phenomena were also observed during heterocyst isolation by Park et al [<xref rid="pone.0248155.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], who suggested that the impurities were ruptured remains of vegetative cell or heterocyst protoplasts, and heterocysts mixed with cell contents were used to extract RNA from the heterocysts.

The RNA was fragmented into 130&#x02013;170 nt by adding fragmentation buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) to the samples and incubating the samples at 70&#x000b0;C. The samples were purified again with RNAclean XP beads. Purified RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using First Strand Master Mix and Super Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The mixture was incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 50 min followed by inactivation at 70&#x000b0;C for 15 min. Using second-strand Master mix, second-strand cDNA was synthesized.

RNA index adapters were added to the adenylated 3&#x02032; end of the DNA using T4 DNA ligase. This DNA sample was used for PCR amplification, which was performed using PCR Master Mix and a PCR primer cocktail, for several rounds. The library was validated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to determine the average molecular length.

It is well known fact that in Anabaena, N-fixation occurred in heterocyst whereas authors tried to prove N-fixing ability in vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 by using transcriptome analysis, however, a simple test i.e. Acetylene Reduction Assay (ARA) and nifH-PCR could be a better option for preliminary screening which are missing in this study. Please provide these data.</p><p>2. Authors also did not prove how N-fixation occurs in vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.</p><p>3. Whether heterocysts have both PS-I and PS-II remains controversial&#x02026;justify the statements with references.</p><p>4. If PSII expressed in heterocyst then what is mechanism to prevent nitrogenase oxidation inside heterocyst.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>We would like to express our sincere thanks to the reviewers for their time and constructive suggesting. For your guidance, itemized response to reviewer&#x02019; comments is appended below. </p><p>Response to the reviewer 1:</p><p>General Comments: The manuscript entitled "Genome-wide differential expression analysis of vegetative cell and heterocyst responses to nitrogen deprivation in the Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120" is quite interesting and has a potential use of great knowledge to know the nitrogen fixing capabilities of Anabaena&#x02019;s heterocyst and vegetative cell. Though the manuscript is only based on transcriptome level analysis, as per my consideration, the current manuscript can be considered in Plos one, it satisfies all the comments. Thus, I am suggesting a major revision.</p><p>Response:</p><p>&#x0fffd; We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s positive evaluation of our work. We have revised the manuscript to incorporate your suggestions and comments. The method has been better explained and each step has been given with more detail. The tissue to which the method was applied has been described more accurately. We have improved the English writing to reduce the grammar mistakes and inaccurate description as far as possible. The data was added to make it easier to read and conclusions easier to see.</p><p>Overall feedback:</p><p> 1. Apart from the suggested comments can authors perform acetylene reduction assay or similar kind of experiment with purified NDV, NDH, and NV?? Nitrogenase functional analysis line ARA will make the manuscript much more applying and can support their preexisting experiment.</p><p>&#x0fffd; Thank you for suggestion. Nitrogenase activity was measured as acetylene reduction assay (ARA) of the cell samples in culture tubes containing 2mL BG 11 or BG110 medium capped with subha seals. The cell samples used for ARA were NDVs+NDHs in BG110, NDHs in BG110, and NVs in BG11. Acetylene at 10% of gas phase was injected followed by incubation under fluorescent light for 4 h. 50 &#x000b5;L gas phase was measured with GC-2010 Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with a DB-WAX capillary column (30 m&#x000d7;0.25 mm, 0.25 &#x003bc;m), carrier gas nitrogen 20 mL. min&#x02013;1, column temperature 100&#x000ba;C, injector temperature 130&#x000ba;C, detector temperature 230&#x000ba;C). Nitrogenase activity was expressed as nmol.2mL culture.&#x0ff08;4h&#x0ff09;&#x02013;1. The direct output of GC is as follows: </p><p>However, we can&#x02019;t obtain pure NDV cells for the nitrogenase activity analysis because the technique for the isolation of heterocysts of Anabaena cylindrica was all based on vegetable cell disruption. We didn't get the expected result about nitrogenase activity analysis, the pure NDH cells showed lower nitrogenase activity compared with the NDV+NDH (The whole filaments in BG110). We think that the nitrogenase ability of pure NDH cells should be different with NDH in filaments. Therefore, the ARA results of different cells only showed in the response letter.</p><p>2. Overall language and sentence construction of the manuscript is very poor. Some of the compound sentences are very difficult to understand and changes the meaning of the paragraphs.</p><p>Thank you for your careful review. We are very sorry for the poor language and sentence in this manuscript and inconvenience they caused in your reading. The compound sentences has been thoroughly revised and rewritten by a native English editor from Editage Company, so we hope it can meet the journal&#x02019;s standard. </p><p>3. Good quality figures should be provided</p><p>&#x0fffd; Accepted; the poor figure 4, 5 and 6 has been replaced in the revised paper.</p><p>1. ABSTRACT: line no. 16. Reframe the sentences. First two sentences staring with in sounds odd.</p><p>&#x0fffd; Accepted, the first two sentences you mentioned have been deleted.</p><p>2. line no. Reframe the sentences 53 to 56 </p><p>&#x0fffd; The sentences you mentioned haven been changed. &#x0201c;Cyanobacteria evolved approximately 3.5 billion years ago. As the first photosynthetic prokaryotes on earth, cyanobacteria can efficiently fix atmospheric nitrogen via a process catalyzed by nitrogenase [1]. Nitrogenase-catalyzed substrate reduction requires the association of an iron (Fe) protein and molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein, with electron transfer occurring from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. However, nitrogenase responsible for the reduction of N2 is extremely sensitive to O2 [2-5].&#x0201d; See line 39-44</p><p>3. line no. 56-59. Use simple sentence and avoid complex sentences.</p><p>&#x0fffd; Accepted. We have made Corresponding changes. &#x0201c;How to avoid oxygen released during photosynthesis by nitrogenase has attracted much attention.&#x0201d;See line 44-45</p><p>4. line no. 77-79. The cited statement &#x0201c;not the only cells capable of nitrogen fixation in heterocystous cyanobacteria and that vegetative cells can fix molecular nitrogen at the same rate as heterocysts&#x0201d; is from a 50 years old paper!!!

Vegetative cells may perform nitrogen fixation function under nitrogen deprivation in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 based on genome-wide differential expression analysis.</p><p>#2: The manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Genome-wide differential expression analysis of vegetative cell and heterocyst in the Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120&#x0201d; is interesting, however it has plenty of flaws, out of which I am pointing few below.</p><p>&#x0fffd; We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s positive evaluation of our work.</p><p>Technical comments</p><p>1. It is well known fact that in Anabaena, N-fixation occurred in heterocyst whereas authors tried to prove N-fixing ability in vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 by using transcriptome analysis, however, a simple test i.e. Acetylene Reduction Assay (ARA) and nifH-PCR could be a better option for preliminary screening which are missing in this study. Please provide these data.</p><p>&#x0fffd; Nitrogenase activity was measured as acetylene reduction assay (ARA) of the cell samples in culture tubes containing 2mL BG 11 or BG110 medium capped with subha seals. The cell samples used for ARA were NDVs+NDHs in BG110, NDHs in BG110, and NVs in BG11. Acetylene at 10% of gas phase was injected followed by incubation under fluorescent light for 4 h. 50 &#x000b5;L gas phase was measured with GC-2010 Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with a DB-WAX capillary column (30 m&#x000d7;0.25 mm, 0.25 &#x003bc;m), carrier gas nitrogen 20 mL. min&#x02013;1, column temperature 100&#x000ba;C, injector temperature 130&#x000ba;C, detector temperature 230&#x000ba;C). Nitrogenase activity was expressed as nmol.2mL culture.&#x0ff08;4h&#x0ff09;&#x02013;1. The direct output of GC is as follows: </p><p>However, we can&#x02019;t obtain pure NDV cells for the nitrogenase activity analysis because the technique for the isolation of heterocysts of Anabaena cylindrica was all based on vegetable cell disruption. We didn't get the expected result about nitrogenase activity analysis, the pure NDH cells showed lower nitrogenase activity compared with the NDV+NDH (The whole filaments in BG110). We think that the nitrogenase ability of pure NDH cells should be different with NDH in filaments. Therefore, the ARA results of different cells only showed in the response letter.</p><p>We think that PCR is not a good method to prove the differential expression of Nif gene. No matter whether the gene is expressed or not, the Nif gene in the genome will be amplified by PCR. We speculated that the reviewer wanted to supplement the results of qRT-PCR or RT-PCR. qRT-PCR is shown in Figure 6 of the paper. Here, we added some electrophoresis pictures of RT-PCR, which proved that the expression trend of NifH1 and NifH2 genes in vegetative cells and heterospores was similar to that of transcriptome and qRT-PCR. See figure S1.</p><p>2. Authors also did not prove how N-fixation occurs in vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.</p><p>&#x0fffd; As a result of our study, we reached the conclusion that N-fixation occurs in vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 by comparative transcriptome analysis and histological analysis. Knowledge of the nature of the heterocysts of blue-green algae has been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for investigation of the physiology and biochemistry of these puzzling structures. Some successful technique for the isolation of heterocysts of Anabaena cylindrica was all based on &#x02018;differential cell disruption&#x02019;. Therefore it is difficult for us and all related researchers to separation of NDV and NDH to acquire the intact vegetative cells to study the N-fixation function.</p><p>3. Whether heterocysts have both PS-I and PS-II remains controversial&#x02026;justify the statements with references.</p><p>&#x0fffd; The reference has been added in revised paper as the 31th reference. Ferimazova et al confirmed mature heterocysts were found to have an intact PSII in vivo at single-cell level by chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic microscopy, and the possible importance of the functional PS II in heterocysts is discussed [Ferimazova et al. Photosynthesis Research, 2013, 116(1): 79-91. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11120-013-9897-z">https://doi.org/10.1007/s11120-013-9897-z</ext-link>]. We conclude that both PS-I- and PS-II-related genes were expressed in heterospores, which is inconsistent with a previous study that reported that heterocysts lacked PS-II (Cardona et al, 2009, Tel-Or and Stewart, 1977, Thomas, 1972). Conclusively, we can say that at least PS-II inactivation or degraded did not occur at the transcription level.</p><p>4. If PSII expressed in heterocyst then what is mechanism to prevent nitrogenase oxidation inside heterocyst.</p><p>&#x0fffd; Nitrogenase oxidation is an interesting and important question, and we are also puzzled by the question. In the nonheterocystous cyanobacteria, the O2 evolved during photosynthesis and nitrogenase was confirmed to discrete in subcellular bodies identified as cyanophycin granules (Finzi-Hart et al., PNAS April 14, 2009,106 (15) 6345-6350; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0810547106">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0810547106</ext-link>). In the heterocystous cyanobacteria, we believe that they have their similar or unique oxygen suppression mechanism under nitrogen deficiency. On the other hand, we observed that the filaments tend to float in liquid medium when nitrogen supply is sufficient (Figure A); in contrast, most of the filaments tend to sink in the culture solution, whereas some small particles were found to be suspended (Figure B). Thus, the increase of whole filaments density (which sink in the culture solution) should be benefit to prevent nitrogenase oxidation under the conditions of nitrogen deprivation. Our study results are consistent with the phenomenon of water bloom under eutrophication (Ekvall et al, 2013). Because oxygen suppression mechanism under nitrogen deficiency is only our own conjecture, and there is no systematic and credible experimental evidence, we did not write the above conjecture in the discussion.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0248155.s008"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response letter-PONE2020-1-30.doc</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0248155.s008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0248155.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0248155.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Anil Kumar</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2021 Anil Kumar Singh</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2021</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Anil Kumar Singh</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0248155" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

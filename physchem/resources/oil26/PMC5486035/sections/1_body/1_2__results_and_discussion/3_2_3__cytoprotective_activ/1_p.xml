<p>The potential protective influences of the compounds present in HEO were analysed on lymphocytes treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (
 <italic>t</italic>-BOOH). A preliminary evaluation, obtained by incubating the cells with the essential oil at the concentration utilized in our work, shows no cytotoxicity effects of lymphocytes (data not shown). As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01212-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the treatment of lymphocytes with 
 <italic>t</italic>-BOOH resulted in a net increase of cell mortality (~41% fall in cell viability vs. controls). The presence of 20, 17.5, 15, and 12.5 µg/mL of essential oil significantly increased cell viability by ~1.50, 1.40, 1.20, and 1.12-fold, respectively, compared cells treated only with 
 <italic>t</italic>-BOOH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01212-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Below this concentration, the effects were almost completely absent, with results superimposable with the ones obtained with lymphocytes treated with 
 <italic>t</italic>-BOOH. The protective influences of the compounds present in the essential oil were also evident by monitoring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in cell culture medium. In fact, this enzyme is commonly utilized as a marker of cell integrity and cytotoxicity, following oxidative burden, membrane damages, activation of apoptotic, and/or necrotic events. As we expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01212-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), the incubation of lymphocytes with 
 <italic>t</italic>-BOOH resulted in a remarkable increase of LDH release into the media (~4.2-fold higher than the control). The presence of 20 µg/mL of essential oil resulted in the complete absence of LDH release, confirming the data obtained with trypan blue coloration. The presence of 17.5, 15, 12, and 10 µg/mL of essential oil decreased enzyme release by ~66%, 52%, 31%, and 6%, respectively, in comparison to the sample treated with only 
 <italic>t</italic>-BOOH, while concentrations below 10 µg/mL did not show a significant decrease of LDH release. Overall, the compounds present in the hull essential oil showed dose-response activity whereby they increased cell survival and prevented damages due to the presence of the strong antioxidant.

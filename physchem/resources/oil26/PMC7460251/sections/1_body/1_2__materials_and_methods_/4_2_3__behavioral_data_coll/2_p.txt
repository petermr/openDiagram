0: Video observations consisted of instantaneous scan sampling at one-minute intervals, all-occurrence, and continuous sampling.
1: Three 20-min observations on each aardvark occurred seven days a week for eight weeks, resulting in a total of 168 observations or 56 h for each aardvark.
2: The first observation of the night started when the animal care staff set down the last enrichment item in the aardvarks habitat, usually between 21:00 and 22:00 (PM).
3: The second and third observations of the night took place between 00:30 and 01:30 (MID), and 04:00 and 05:00 (AM).
4: At each scan, we recorded the focals behavior ( Table 3), location within the habitat, proximity to enrichment (contact, within one body length, or greater than one body length), and substrate (dirt, cement, rubber mats, shavings, plastic culvert, nest box, water, or unclear).

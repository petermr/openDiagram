<p id="Par36">Next, we investigated AS6 cytotoxicity to HUMEC and MCF7 cells at lower concentrations surrounding 0.5 μM: 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μM. Cells were treated with AS6 for 72 h, and then the viability of cells was measured with WST assay. The results showed a dose-dependent cell death in MCF7 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>C). By contrast to this, HUMEC showed a biphasic effect dependent on the concentration of AS6: AS6 up to 1 μM did not interfere with cell growth, and even seemed to stimulate it, whereas concentrations over 2 μM did interfere with growth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>C). For example, the treatment with 1 μM AS6 for 72 h increased the density of viable cells to 278% in HUMEC but decreased cell density to 27% in MCF7 cells, about a 73% reduction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>C). It should be noted that the changes in the cell growth and morphology mediated by AS6 were microscopically clear and dramatically distinct (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>C), which suggests a different susceptibility to AS6, between the HUMEC and MCF7 cells. Indeed, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values derived from the experiments were 8.8 times higher value for MCF7 cells than HUMEC, at 0.26 μM versus 2.29 μM, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This demonstrates that the malignant MCF7 cells are more susceptible to AS6 than HUMEC.

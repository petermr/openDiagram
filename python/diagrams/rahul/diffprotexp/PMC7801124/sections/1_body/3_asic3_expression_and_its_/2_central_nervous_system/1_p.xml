<p>All ASICs, including ASIC3, are widely expressed within the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS, respectively) [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In a study involving (mice and naked mole-rats), ASIC3 appears to be most abundantly expressed in the PNS (dorsal root ganglion, DRG) and represents the predominant ASIC isoform (approximately 10-fold higher expression than ASIC1-4) whilst its expression levels in the CNS (spinal cord and various brain regions) are comparable to or lower than other ASIC subunits [
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This is in contrast with the early observation showing rASIC3 expression being confined to the PNS [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, several studies now support ASIC3 CNS expression, including in the superior cervical ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem [
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and hypothalamus [
 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and recent single-cell RNA-sequencing of various mouse brain regions shows that ASIC3 is expressed in numerous brain regions, albeit higher expression being observed in sensory neurones [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Both the hypothalamus and hippocampus play a role in emotional behavior [
 <xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice showed reduced aggression and anxiety-like behavior compared to wild-type (WT) mice [
 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], i.e. CNS expression of ASIC3 is important to brain function.

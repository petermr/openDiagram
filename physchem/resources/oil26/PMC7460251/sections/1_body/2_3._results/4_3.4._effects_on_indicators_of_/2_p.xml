<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All enrichment had a nightly average behavioral diversity (H) of 1.60 &#177; 0.04 (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and the range of average behavioral diversity scores for each item ranged from 1.51 to 1.71. Behavioral diversity was not related to the stated enrichment goal (F<sub>1,174</sub> = 0.005, <italic>p</italic> = 0.943) but was related to individual enrichment items (F<sub>6,207</sub> = 2.61, <italic>p</italic> = 0.019; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-01433">Table S11</xref>). Although most pairwise comparisons for behavioral diversity between the items were not significant and are not reported here, there were a few significant pairwise comparisons. Perfumed Boomer balls<sup>&#174;</sup> had lower nightly behavioral diversity than warthog scented towels (t<sub>207</sub> = &#8722;3.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and cricket containers (t<sub>207</sub> = &#8722;2.56, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011). Warthog scented towels had higher behavioral diversity than pools (t<sub>207</sub> = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048), paper towel treat tubes (t<sub>207</sub> = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048), and rubber toys with food (t<sub>207</sub> = 2.90, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). Containers with crickets were associated with higher behavioral diversity than rubber toys with food (t<sub>207</sub> = 2.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). Finally, there was a significant decrease in behavioral diversity over the study period (F<sub>1,193</sub> = 5.89, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016, <italic>b</italic> = &#8722;0.039, 95% CI [&#8722;0.071, &#8722;0.007]).</p>

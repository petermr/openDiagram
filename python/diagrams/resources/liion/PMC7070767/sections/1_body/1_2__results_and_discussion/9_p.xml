<p>Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements show intercalation and extraction cycles which demonstrates good stability, which can undergo over 100 cycles for sample BatS1, 500 cycles for sample BatS2 and 700 cycles for sample BatS3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00891-f012">Figure 12</xref>). The efficiency of the BatS1 is quite diffuse, for sample BatS2 is slightly smaller and more stable over a longer cycle, whereas for sample BatS3 it has higher efficiency and much longer stability over many cycles. This allows us to conclude that sample S3 may indeed provide a good quality anode material.

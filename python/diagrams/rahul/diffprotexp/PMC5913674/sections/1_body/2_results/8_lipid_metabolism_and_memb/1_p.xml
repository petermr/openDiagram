<p>Multiple proteins involved in lipid metabolism in 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] were differentially expressed in at least 1 MtzR isolate. Among proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism, PI transfer protein alpha isoform (PITPα) (4197), a phospholipid-transporting ATPase IIB (gPLTATPase IIB), and a putative gPLTATPase IIB (38 104) were downregulated in 106-MtzR, while PS synthase (gPSS) (17 427) and another putative phospholipid ATPase transporter (16 592) were upregulated in 713-MtzR, with the later also upregulated in WB-MtzR along with another putative acyltransferase (15 987). PITPα was also downregulated in 106-MtzR. Furthermore, the highest upregulated kinase in WB-MtzR was the putative ethanolamine/choline kinase, implicated in phospholipid metabolism [

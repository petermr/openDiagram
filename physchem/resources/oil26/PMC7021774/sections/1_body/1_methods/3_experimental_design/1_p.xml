<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par9">All germplasm was sown into 96-well trays filled with M2 compost (Levington, Everiss). The experimental plan for each germplasm set comprised five replicates of each variety or accession, arrayed in a randomised block design using R/blocksdesign (cran.r-project.org). Seeds of the first germplasm set were grown in a growth chamber (Conviron) using a 16&#160;h light (at 20&#160;&#176;C) and 8&#160;h dark (15&#160;&#176;C) photoperiod. The AM and MAGIC populations were grown in a heated glasshouse (16&#160;h light at 20&#160;&#176;C, 8&#160;h dark at 17&#160;&#176;C) for 14&#160;days with supplementary lighting to maintain photoperiod. ToxB infiltration was undertaken 14&#160;days after sowing, following the method described by Moffat et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>). Briefly, the first leaf of seedlings at growth stage 12 (GS12, Zadoks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">1974</xref>) was infiltrated with 50&#160;&#181;l of ToxB suspension at a concentration of 200&#160;&#181;g/mL, and the extent of infiltration along the leaf marked using a non-toxic pen. Phenotyping of ToxB sensitivity was carried out a week after infiltration and scored using a 0&#8211;5 scale, as described by See et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). A score of 0&#8201;=&#8201;no visible symptoms; 1&#8201;=&#8201;slight chlorosis; 2&#8201;=&#8201;full chlorosis; 3&#8201;=&#8201;extensive chlorosis with/without slight necrosis; 4&#8201;=&#8201;chlorosis with necrosis; 5&#8201;=&#8201;full necrosis. A water control was also used to establish a symptom baseline for the evaluation of possible damage during the infiltration process.</p>

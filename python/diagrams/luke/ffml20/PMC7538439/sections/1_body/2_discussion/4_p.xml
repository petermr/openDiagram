<p id="Par36">Our HMLP potential also has shown the capability of predicting the pressure dependence of the Raman-active E2g mode, consistent with experiment and previous DFT calculations. We explain the maximum frequency of the vibron as due to competition between molecular compression and stronger intermolecular coupling. Weakening of the covalent bond is not required.</p>

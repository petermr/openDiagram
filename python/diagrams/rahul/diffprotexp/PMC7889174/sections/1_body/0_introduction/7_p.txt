0: To extend our understanding of the dynamic process of nuclear evolution beyond the NPC and lamina to the whole of the NE, we examined a set of NE and  NE-associated proteins, that we collectively term NEA, from metazoan and kinetoplastid datasets together with published work ( Figure 2).
1: We analyzed conservation of NEA proteins across eukaryotes, finding only a small contingent to be broadly conserved with the majority of the cohort being remarkably divergent; frequently, identifiable orthologs can only be found in closely related organisms.

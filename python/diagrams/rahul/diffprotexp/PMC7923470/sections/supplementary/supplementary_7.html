  <caption> Additional file 1: Figure 1. Pearson correlation between WT vs MT banana pseudostem replicates. Figure 2. Heatmap hierarchical clustering of differential expressed genes in WT vs MT banana pseudostems where abscissa indicates the sample names (WT and MT), and the ordinate indicates the differential expressed genes. Figure 3. KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in WT vs MT banana pseudostems. Figure 4. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis. Figure 5. Variable importance in projection score plot. Figure 6. Heatmap hierarchical clustering of differentially accumulated metabolites. Figure 7. Principal Component Analysis (A) differentially expressed genes and (B) differentially accumulated metabolites. Figure 8. Correlation coefficient cluster heat map of differentially expressed genes and differentially accumulated metabolites having Pearson’s correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8. Figure 9. Transcript-metabolite correlation network representing DAMs and DEGs involved in MT banana stem elongation. The KEGG pathways are given on the top of each network. The gene and metabolite IDs correspond to Additional Table  3 and Additional Table  5, respectively. </caption>

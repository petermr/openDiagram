  <p>GO and network analysis of proteins in two important pathways. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the m
   <sup>5</sup>C RNA methylation modification was analyzed 
   <italic>via</italic> DAVID. GO contains biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions. In this picture, count represents the number of genes contained in the GO term. The count and 
   <italic>P</italic> values were considered together to obtain important metabolic process. Three important metabolic processes are affected by m
   <sup>5</sup>C RNA methylation, including protein binding, cytosol, and signal transduction. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Multicenter protein–protein interaction (PPI) network between m
   <sup>5</sup>C regulatory proteins and differential proteins in the ErbB and PI3K–Akt pathways in the STRING database.

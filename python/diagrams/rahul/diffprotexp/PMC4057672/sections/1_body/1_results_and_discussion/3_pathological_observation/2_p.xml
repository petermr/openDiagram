<p>Pathological observations of lung and bronchiole tissues were shown in 
 <xref rid="f2-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. No obvious pathological change was observed in lung and bronchiole tissues of mice from both Group C (
 <xref rid="f2-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and Group E at 12 h post-exposure to aerosolized ricin (
 <xref rid="f2-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). While at 24 h post-exposure, bronchiole mucous epithelium began to desquamate, and lymphocytes and macrophages were scattered (
 <xref rid="f2-ijms-15-07281" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). At 48 h post-exposure, bronchiole mucous epithelium was damaged obviously and partially desquamated, and bronchiole wall was attached with an mixture of inflammatory exudate and necrotic epithelium, accompanied with submucosal edema, infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages (

  <p>Changes in in the processing of proinsulin-like sequences found in vertebrates. An alignment of the human (
   <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) proinsulin protein sequence with selected examples showing potentially altered proteolytic processing. The examples include the insulin proteins encoded by the 
   <italic>insab</italic> genes from two fish (
   <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) [Japanese medaka (
   <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) and Clownfish (
   <italic>Amphiprion ocellaris</italic>)], two mammals (
   <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) [little brown bat (
   <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>) and aardvark (
   <italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>)], and the Singapore grouper iridovirus viral insulin-like peptide (SGIV-VILP) (
   <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). SGIV-VILP would be produced by vertebrate cells infected by the Singapore grouper iridovirus. Protein sequences are shown in single letter code, with ↓ indicating the signal peptidase cleavage site and ⇓ the indicating the prohormone convertase processing sites for the human insulin sequence. Domains of the human proinsulin sequence are shown above the alignment. Amino acid replacements in the sequences, relative to the human sequence, which are predicted to impair proteolytic processing are shown in bold. Conserved cysteine residues involved in disulphide bridging are shown below the alignment.

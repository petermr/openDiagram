<p id="Par11">We detected differential expression between the study populations in 1760 transcripts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Greater than 70% of the differentially expressed transcripts in captive mussels were up-regulated rather than down-regulated. Of the 1251 transcripts up-regulated in translocated, captive mussels, 527 received BLAST hits and 246 were annotated. Among these, we observed a significant over-representation of GO terms associated with energy metabolism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Of the 509 transcripts down-regulated in translocated, captive mussels, 161 received BLAST hits and 41 were annotated, and there was a significant over-representation of GO terms associated with immune response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). All differentially expressed transcripts and their corresponding 
 <italic>p</italic>-values, false discovery rates, log fold changes, and functional annotations are provided in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. Kraken2 classified 0.17% of transcripts from the entire transcriptome as prokaryotic. Four of these transcripts were up-regulated in captive mussels, and were not included in our discussion.

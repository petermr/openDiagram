<p>Through microarray sequencing of 73 NFPA samples, 18,827 PCGs and 19,740 lncRNAs with expression values &gt;0 were identified. The differences in PCGs and lncRNAs between 6 cases of NFPA recurrence within 1 year after surgery and 6 cases of NFPA recurrence 5 years after surgery were analyzed using the SAM test. By selecting the threshold |fold-change| &gt;2 or adjusted P&lt;0.05, a total of 299 differentially expressed PCGs (228 upregulated and 71 downregulated PCGs) and 214 differentially expressed lncRNAs (120 upregulated and 94 downregulated lncRNAs) were identified (

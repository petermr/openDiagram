<p id="Par26">Herein, we sought to follow the expression levels of protein markers implicated in microtubule assembly, autophagic-lysosomal pathway and unfolded protein response (UPR) in 
 <italic>post-mortem</italic> samples from SNpc, hippocampus and temporal cortex from AD, PD and VD patients. The detected changes in these proteins markers enabled us to establish a time course for disease progression. Moreover, we will elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms in light of the brain area, degree and extent of the disease and challenge the prion “like” SNCA and Aβ spreading hypothesis for PD

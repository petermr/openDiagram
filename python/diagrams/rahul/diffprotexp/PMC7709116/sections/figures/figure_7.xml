  <p>Central node protein networks. OmicsNet analysis of the differentially expressed proteins in D1 and D2 nuclei was used to generate proteinâ€“protein networks based on known experimental interactors. In the center are the central interactor proteins that are connected to genes encoding known interactors. These analyses identified Hnrnpd and Hnrnpa2b1 in D1 nuclei (
   <bold>A</bold>) and Cct2 and Cct7 in D2 nuclei (
   <bold>B</bold>) as central interactors.

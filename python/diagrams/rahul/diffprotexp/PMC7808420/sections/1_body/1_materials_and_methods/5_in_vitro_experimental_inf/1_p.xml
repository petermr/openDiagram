<p>Primary mixed glia cultures were obtained by collecting the brains of newborn mice (1–2 days old). Brains were minced and digested in 0.1% w/v trypsin (Gibco) for 15 minutes under agitation. Brain homogenates were washed in DMEM twice and plated in cell culture flasks containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Mixed glial cell cultures were harvested after 9–14 days. Briefly, cell cultures were infected with SLEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h, washed in DMEM and incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 until sample collection (24–120 h post-infection). Collected samples included cell culture supernatants for measurement of cytokine levels and viral load.</p>

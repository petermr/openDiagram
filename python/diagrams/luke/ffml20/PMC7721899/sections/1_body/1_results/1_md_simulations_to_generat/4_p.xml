 </sup>. To evaluate such a trend in this study, the connectivity in the structure is calculated by computing the degree of polymerization which is taken as the ratio of the number of BO (bridging oxygen) with respect to the number of tetrahedral networks (T). The ternary plot of the degree of polymerization with the composition of C–S–H is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. A higher degree of polymerization is observed when the concentration of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> increases which is expected since Si serves as a network former in C–S–H. Conversely, a lower degree of polymerization is observed when water concentration is increased and SiO
 <sub>2</sub> molar fraction is decreased. However, the trend reverses when the water content increases and CaO content decreases. This infers the existence of coupled effect in composition-structure properties in C–S–H, which is also observed for elastic moduli. Maximum network connectivity is observed when the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> molar fraction is greater than 0.4 and the H
 <sub>2</sub>O molar fraction is below 0.1. But maximum elastic moduli are observed in the range between 0.2 and 0.4 molar fraction for both SiO
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O. This indicates that the network connectivity alone is not sufficient enough to predict the elastic constants which makes it challenging to develop a robust physics-based predictive model.

0: The specimens were transversely cut from the as-cast rods and from the upper central part (the lowest cooling rate) of the 100 g or 150 g ingots for the characterization by means of X-ray diffraction (Philips PW1050, Cu-K), scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss Supra 55) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Oxford) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Netzsch 204F1) at a constant heating rate of 20 K min 1.
1: The liquidus temperatures of BT0 and BT100 were measured claorimetrically (Netzsch 404).
2: The DSC isothermal time before crystallization was obtained by heating at rates of 60 K min 1 to and then holding at different temperatures between 610 K and 640 K using a Netzsch 204F1.
3: The elemental mapping of the 20 mm rod of BT48 was carried out by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ION-TOF, SIMS5).
4: The composition of the constituent phases in BT48 samples cooled at different rates were quantitatively acquired by an electron probe micro analyzer (Shimadzu 1610) with a wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS).
5: The microstructure of the 6 mm rod of BT48, the 10 mm rods of BT15 and BT20 were investigated in a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai F20) with an electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) system attached.
6: The TEM samples were prepared by ion-milling with the cooling of liquid nitrogen using a Gatan 691.

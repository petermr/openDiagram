 <italic>ob</italic> mice, as well as in the blood, suggested higher oxidative stress in the 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. In skeletal muscle, we identified anserine and carnosine, which are dipeptides composed of beta-alanine and histidine, as decreased DEMs in skeletal muscle of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. Anserine and carnosine are antioxidant factors involved in the degradation of lipid peroxide and are abundant in skeletal muscle (

 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice suggested that lipid peroxide may accumulate in skeletal muscle cells of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice. In addition, both glutathione (GSH) and GSSG increased in the liver, and GSSG increased in the blood of 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice, which may reflect the oxidative stress associated with higher energy production in

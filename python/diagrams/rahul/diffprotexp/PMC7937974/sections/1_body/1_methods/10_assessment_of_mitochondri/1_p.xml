<p>Mitochondrial complex I activity detection assay kit (Solarbio) was used to measure the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I activity. The absorbance was measured at 340 nm with a microplate reader. Record absorbance A1 at 10 s, reaction at 37°C for 2 min, record absorbance A2 at 2 min, calculate ΔA = A1–A2. Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo) was used for protein quantification. Complex I activity (U/mg prot) = [Δ

 <p>We previously reported that disruption of the 
  <italic>yjbI</italic> gene reduced virulence of 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. In this study, we found virulence in both silkworms and mice was restored by introducing the 
  <italic>yjbH</italic> gene but not the 
  <italic>yjbI</italic> gene to both 
  <italic>yjbI</italic> and 
  <italic>yjbH</italic> genes-disrupted mutants, suggesting that 
  <italic>yjbH</italic>, the gene downstream to the 
  <italic>yjbI</italic> gene in a two-gene operon-
  <italic>yjbIH</italic>, is responsible for this phenomenon. We further observed a decrease in various surface-associated proteins and changes in cell envelope glycostructures in the mutants. RNA-seq analysis revealed that disruption of the 
  <italic>yjbI</italic> and the 
  <italic>yjbH</italic> genes resulted in differential expression of a broad range of genes, notably, significant downregulation of genes involved in virulence and oxidative stress. Administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a free-radical scavenger, restored the virulence in both the mutants. Our findings suggested that YjbH plays a role in staphylococcal pathogenicity by regulating virulence gene expression, affecting the bacterial surface structure, and conferring resistance to oxidative stress in a host.

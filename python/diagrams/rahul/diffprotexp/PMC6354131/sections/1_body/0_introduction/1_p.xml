<p id="p0010">Urosepsis is defined as sepsis caused by a urogenital tract infection. Urogenital tract infections are considered to be responsible for about 30% sepsis cases, with a mortality of 20%â€“40%. As the population ages, the incidence of urosepsis is likely to rise.

 </xref> This has prompted studies to identify methods for sepsis diagnosis in the early-stages, where treatment outcomes are more favorable. Indeed, the prognosis of urosepsis must be assessed as early as possible. Recently, proteomic technologies have been used to detect new biomarkers. A large number of differentially expressed proteins have been reported as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of several diseases. In this study, two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) was applied to assess protein profiles in uroseptic patients with different prognoses, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers.

<p id="p0080">The existence of the cobalt element and its chemical state is crucial to the deposition rate of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode material. The presence of the Co was revealed by Co 2p peaks (2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> at 795.5 eV and 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> at 780.7 eV) in the spectra of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The quantity of cobalt element was further evaluated with inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), which gave a Co/Mn atomic ratio of 0.063:1 after cobalt modification (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). A similar result of Co/Mn ratio (0.052:1) was also obtained by the compositional analysis of the XPS survey spectra (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). These results from both bulk-sensitive ICP and surface-sensitive XPS indicate that Co element is evenly decorated on the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. Evidence from the Co L-edge NEXAFS spectra (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C) suggests that Co species on the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> has a valent state between +2 and +3. This indicates that during the modification process, Co
 <sup>2+</sup> in the CoCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution was partially oxidized by the high-valent-state (+4) Mn cations in the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, the valent state of Mn cation was decreased, as evidenced by the Mn L-edge NEXAFS spectra (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Owing to the presence of Mn-site defects, cobalt-containing species (e.g., Co(II) and Co(III)) can be incorporated in δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets (as illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD, 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED, 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) patterns of the material show no other well-defined crystalline phase. Detailed observation of the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images did not reveal the existence of any amorphous phase other than the layer-structured manganese oxide. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F indicates that cobalt element is well dispersed on the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> with no significant agglomeration. In short, after cobalt modification, cobalt cations with valent states +2 and +3 in the form of cobalt-containing species is incorporated in the highly defective δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets. A similar conclusion was also drawn by Wang et al. based on analysis of the quick extended X-ray absorption fine structure data (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

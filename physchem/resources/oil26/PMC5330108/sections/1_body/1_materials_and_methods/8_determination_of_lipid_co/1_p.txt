0: Total lipid content of  F. sporotrichioides cells with the MPE at various concentrations (control, MIC, and MFC) was determined using phosphovanillin method.
1: [ 4445] The 2-day-old mycelia from 50 mL PDB were collected and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min.
2: Then, the samples are lyophilized.
3: About 0.1 g of dry mycelia were homogenized with liquid nitrogen and extracted with 4.0 mL of methanol: chloroform: water mixture (2:1:0.8, v/v/v) with vigorous shaking for 30 min.
4: The resulting sample was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min.
5: The lower phase containing lipids was mixed with 0.2 mL saline solution and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min.
6: To the lipid mixture add 0.2 mL chloroform and 0.5 mL of H 2 SO 4 and warm in a boiling water bath for 10 min.
7: After that, 3 mL phosphovanillin was added and shaken vigorously, and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min.
8: The absorbance was measured at 520 nm.
9: Cholesterol was used as a standard.

<p>Based on uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) technology, 19 cell clusters were generated (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B), and several cell clusters were at least partially displayed in a dependent manner for the developmental stage or DEHP treatment. To determine the ovarian cell composition at an investigated period, marker genes were identified in cell clusters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S1</xref>); the top five marker genes in each cluster are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>C. According to their transcription characteristics, cell clusters were divided into six cell types, and the representative genes in each cell type are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C. In addition, the cell-type-specific genes are presented in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>D; six main cell types were identified (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E). Moreover, germ cells and granulosa cells were examined as the major participants of PF assembly using immunohistochemistry; STAT3 for germ cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>A) and AMHR2 for granulosa cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>B), respectively.

<p>As discussed above, the cell voltage for FeNCN originates from the potential difference between the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/Fe
 <sup>0</sup> and Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li
 <sup>0</sup> (Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Na
 <sup>0</sup>) redox couples in a LIB (NIB). An ideal voltage profile displays a flat plateau with a theoretical voltage of 1.6 V (1.1 V) in a LIB (NIB), as tabulated in Table S2. The actual profile, however, exhibits a monotonous decrease in voltage upon lithiation (sodiation) both experimentally and theoretically. We rationalize this decreasing character from a monotonous decrease in the atomic charge of Fe, expressed as

 <xref rid="anie201914760-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> b also demonstrates a more negative ICOHP progression for the Fe−N bonds, but now upon sodiation in a NIB. This indicates an almost continuous increase in covalency for the Fe−N bonds in the energetically low‐lying intermediate ternaries, another confirmation of a smaller amount of electron density transferred from Fe to N and, thus, a decrease in the charge of Fe.

The interlayer expansion of 0.045 nm corresponds to the intercalation of no more than a single monolayer (1 W), as will be confirmed further by the simulations of the last section of this paper. These results also revealed a population of intercalated water resilient to outgassing below âˆ¼40% RH. The population responsible for the microgravimetrically measured hysteresis above this value must therefore arise from the surface and interparticle water as the

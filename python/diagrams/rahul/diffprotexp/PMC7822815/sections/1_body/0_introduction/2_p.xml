 </sup>. Histone modifications and DNA methylation can affect exon usage by controlling the elongation speed of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and, consequently, the choice of splice sites. Furthermore, they may affect the recruitment of splicing factors to chromatin through adapters such as CHD1. Moreover, chromatin modifications have been found to regulate the activity of alternative or cryptic transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in the genome

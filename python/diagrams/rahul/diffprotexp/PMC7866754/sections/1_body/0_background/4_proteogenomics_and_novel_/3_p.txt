0: Here, proteogenomic analysis was performed using the transcriptomic and proteomic data obtained from the oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites of  P. falciparum used by a previous study [ 37].
1: nORFs were detected in both life cycle stages.
2: Bioinformatics analyses suggest that these nORFs may be of functional importance with interesting properties and are, therefore, worth further experimental investigation.

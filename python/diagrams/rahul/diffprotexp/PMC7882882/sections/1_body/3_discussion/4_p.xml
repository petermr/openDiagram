<p>First, the DEGLs based on NFPA recurrence at &lt;1 year and &gt;5 years were obtained. According to GSEA, these DEGs were enriched in the ‘regulation of cell death’ and ‘cell adhesion’. The present results are consistent with those of previous studies, which have shown that intercellular adhesion and adhesion molecules play a crucial role in tumor recurrence and proliferation (

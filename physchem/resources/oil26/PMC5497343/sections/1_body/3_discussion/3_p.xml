<p id="Par31">For the assumed antioxidant strength of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower, we used a mono-cation (ABTS radical) and one specific type of specie, the lipid peroxyl radical. The antioxidant activities of the EO of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower and vitamin C were concentrations dependent as observed in DPPH Test. However, a lower radical scavenging effect of 70% was displayed by EO on ABTS radical at highest concentration (0.50 mg/mL) while vitamin C had higher effect of 80% compared to the DPPH experiment as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.76 mg/mL and 1.14 mg/mL for EO flower of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> and vitamin C were obtained from the linear regression equation from the graph. Percentage lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity of the EO was higher than that of vitamin C (standard drug) and the inhibitory effects was dose dependent. The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower exhibited the highest lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of 71% ± 0.001 at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.23 mg/mL while vitamin C displayed lower percentage lipid peroxidation inhibitory effects of 54% ± 0.004 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.19 mg/mL as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The result implies that the EO of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower possess higher lipid peroxidation properties than vitamin C. Antiradical scavenging action of the essential oils may be credited to the substitution of hydroxyl groups of the aromatic ring systems of the phenolic compounds due to their hydrogen giving capacity [

 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower to scavenge three different radicals suggesting it usefulness as a good antioxidant agent for further investigation.

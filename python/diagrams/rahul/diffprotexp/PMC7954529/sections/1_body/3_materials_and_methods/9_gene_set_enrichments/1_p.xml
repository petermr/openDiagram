<p>We performed Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) in R (minSize = 15, maxSize = 500, nperm = 100,000) to identify enriched gene ontology (GO) terms enriched within the genes differentially expressed with at least one PAS differentially used between species. We downloaded the C5: GO terms from MSigDB. Significant GO terms can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. To identify enriched GO terms in the remaining analyses, we used the GOrilla setting for two unranked lists of genes. To test for GO terms associated with species-specific PAS, we input the genes with a species-specific PAS as the target list and all genes with at least one identified PAS as the background set. For the differentially translated and differential protein-level background sets, we tested genes with at least one differentially used PAS as the target. We identified no significant GO terms in tdifferential protein-level analysis. Finally, among genes with at least one differentially used PAS, we tested for enriched GO terms for the genes differentially expressed in protein but not mRNA. Significant terms for each set can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

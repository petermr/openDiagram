<p>The two samples of MAH 104 in exponential and stationary growth phases showed a relatively similar fractionation pattern on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained SDS-PAGE gels with a characteristic variation in the intensity of some bands (

For better resolution, we utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) with isoelectric focusing of isoelectric non-linear (pI 3â€“10) as the first dimension. Duplicate 2-DE images of silver-stained gels for proteins extracted from exponential and stationary growth phases are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00305-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The proteome patterns generated from each phase represent well-resolved protein spots.

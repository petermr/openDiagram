 <italic>RPS27A</italic> gene was reported to be over-expressed in breast fibroadenomas, colorectal, renal cancers, chronic myeloid leukemia and acute leukemia [

 <italic>UBA52</italic> and 
 <italic>RPS27A</italic> genes code for a single copy of ubiquitin fused to the ribosomal proteins L40 and S27a, respectively. Knock-down of ubiquitin increased the radiosensitivity in H1299 cells, thus 
 <italic>RPS27A</italic> may contribute to radioresistance of tumor cells [

<p id="Par37">Upregulated expression of ALDH1A2 in astrocytes in the immediate neighborhood of cerebral AVM nidus structures is an interesting finding of our study. This observation prompted us to analyze the nature of the astrocytes surrounding the AVM, and we observed that the astrocytes of the AVM nidus had high expression of Vimentin and GFAP, which suggest the abnormal nature of these astrocytes. There was an increased expression of Vimentin, GFAP, and ALDH1A2 in cerebral AVM-associated astrocytes. It is known that astrocytes of the normal adult brain have very less or undetectable levels of ALDH1A2, whereas astrocytic gliomas and in proliferative states of astrocytes contain elevated levels of ALDH1A2 [

<p>Alike aprotic Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> cell, NaOH is the only discharge product reported to date in hybrid Na–air cell, which is a soluble discharge product. Though, there does not exist any direct study in literature on discharge product of cell, post analysis scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of discharged electrode showed no sign of any residue related to discharge product as the case for aprotic Na–O
 <sub>2</sub> cell.

 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> However, ex situ XRD of discharge electrode after performing 1000 h charge–discharge displayed diffraction peak related to NaOH·H
 <sub>2</sub>O.

0: Differentiated and undifferentiated MEFs were washed with 1 ml of 1X PBS (Corning) once before fixing for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature.
1: After fixation, MEFs were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and once with 60% isopropanol and were completely air-dried.
2: MEFs were then stained with Oil Red O (ORO) [6 ORO:4 ddH 2O ratio] (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature.
3: Excess stain residue was removed with four ddH 2O washes.
4: Approximately 1 ml of PBS was then added for microscopic visualization.
5: Images were processed at 460x magnification using a 20x objective lens, with transmitted bright-field light (EVOS FLoid Cell Imaging Station).
6: For quantification, ORO stain particles were eluted with 100% isopropanol and analysed using Thermo ScientificTM Varioskan Flash for spectrophotometry readings at 514 nm.

 <italic>M. hominis</italic> surface-localized lipoprotein OppA, the substrate-binding domain of the oligopeptide permease, has been characterized as an ecto-ATPase [
 <xref rid="cit0102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0244" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. OppA induces ATP-release from HeLa cells; subsequently, the discharged ATP is hydrolyzed by its intrinsic ATPase activity that ultimately results in apoptosis of the host cells [
 <xref rid="cit0245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. Moreover, the cytadhesion of 
 <italic>M. hominis</italic> also depends on the ecto-ATPase activity of OppA [
 <xref rid="cit0246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. These results demonstrate that OppA affects not only nutrition uptake but also the host-pathogen interactions of 
 <italic>M. hominis</italic>. Two OppA-coding genes were also identified in the genome of Mccp strain 87,001, but their functions remain unidentified [
 <xref rid="cit0232" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> possesses the 
 <italic>MGA_0220</italic> gene that encodes a putative ATP-binding protein (OppD), which is involved in amino acid, dipeptide, and oligopeptide transport. OppD is required for pathogenesis as the mutant strain has been shown to have a reduced capacity to induce respiratory tract lesions and persist in the respiratory tract, but its ATPase activity remains to be investigated [

<p>Following spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury, severe energy supply disorder can occur due to an imbalance of the energy metabolic pathway. This can inhibit cytoskeletal protein conformation, cause formation of abnormal intracellular structures, and block substance and information transfer, which contribute to the pathological progression of ischemia/reperfusion. The mechanism of delayed neurological impairment following spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury requires further study.</p>

0: Pieces (weighing approximately 100 mg) of gray matter tissue from Brodmann area 10 (BA10) as PFC and NAc were isolated from frozen brain.
1: For PFC, gray matter tissue was dissected from the frontal pole.
2: NAc was identified on the frozen coronal slabs corresponding to the anterior one-third of the inferior temporal cortex.
3: These frozen brain tissues were suspended in the 2% SDS solution, incubated for 20 min, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and sonicated for 10 min.
4: Then, the samples were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2HPO 4, 1.76 mM KH 2PO 4) so that the final concentration of SDS was below 0.2%.
5: The expression of proteins was determined by using commercial ELISA kits (SEB323Hu for Calcineurin, and SEE017Hu for DARPP-32, Cloud Clone Corp, Houston, TX).
6: The analysis was performed according to the manufacturers protocols.
7: The expression levels of each protein were normalized against the total protein concentration.

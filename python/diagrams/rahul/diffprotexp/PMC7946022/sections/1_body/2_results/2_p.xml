 <bold>Scanning electron microscopy and microbial recovery reveals formation of robust mixed biofilms within implanted catheters</bold>. In order to determine optimal 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm growth period, initially, small groups of animals with implanted catheters were euthanized two, three, four, and six days post-implantation and catheters were evaluated for microbial recovery. Based on CFU counts, significantly less 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> were recovered from mixed-species catheters after 2 days (***, p &lt; 0.001 and **, p &lt; 0.01; respectively), compared to from single-species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2c</xref>) and for both species CFU were equivalent in single and mixed biofilms by day 3. Based on the kinetics study, CFU recovery 3 days post-implantation was determined to be optimal time-point, after which growth of both species reached a plateau. SEM representative images of lumens of explanted catheters revealed the presence of mature mixed biofilms after 8 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2b</xref>). Comparatively, single-species 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms had less biomass than 
 <italic>C. albicans-S. aureus</italic> mixed biofilms, whereas the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms consisting primarily of hyphae were comparable between 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> single and mixed biofilms (

<p>Our outputs were examined against the 
 <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> 104 UniProt KB database (Proteome ID UP000001574) with concatenated decoy database using Mascot search engine (version 2.4, Matrix Science, London, UK). If the peptides swept the identity and homology thresholds of the Mascot algorithm, it takes up with FDR &lt;1%. Gene Ontology annotations were explored from the UniProt database (

0: The full-length coding sequences (CDS) of  ACPT gene were extracted from the OrthoMaM v10b ( http://orthomam1.mbb.univ-montp2.fr:8080/OrthoMaM_v10b5/), ENSEMBL ( http://www.ensembl.org/index.html?redirect=no) and NCBI ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases ( Table S1).
1: ACPT of some whales were extracted from their Genome and SRA database of NCBI ( Tables S2 and  S3).
2: To further ensure the sites of inactivating mutation of toothless/enamel-less lineages, we used the CDSs of some representative placental species with well-annotated genomes ( Homo sapiens (human),  Canis lupus familiaris (Dog),  Bos taurus (Cow),  Echinops telfairi (Lesser hedgehog tenrec)) as queries including 50 bp of flanking sequence on each exon.
3: These sequences were used as queries to BLAST against toothless/enamel-less mammals to confirm the related inactivating mutation among baleen whales.

<p>For the other key genes, RHOG has already been linked to sepsis through its participation in inflammatory processes.
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> The amount of LAT on the cell surface may determine the extent of T cell activation.
 <xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Systemic inflammation in patients with acute sepsis causes persistent T cell dysfunction, which leads to immunosuppression.
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> PRKACB is differentially expressed in neonatal sepsis, and it may influence disease progression via the MAPK signaling pathway.
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> ITK has been found to regulate thermal homeostasis during sepsis via its effects on mast cells.
 <xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> Previous work has found that IL2RB is down-regulated in sepsis, which is consistent with our study,
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> and that IL2RB is negatively correlates with organ failure and mortality in sepsis.
 <xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Our results reveal UBE2Q2 as a potential key gene for sepsis diagnosis, and we are unaware of previous studies showing an association between UBE2Q2 and sepsis.

0: LMH cells transfected with KPNA3 or KPNA4, and KPNA3-KO or KPNA4-KO LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4 or FA4_Del at 0.01 MOI, respectively.
1: And then the viruses were harvested at indicated time points post-infection and stored at 80C before use.
2: The TCID 50 of the harvested viruses was determined in 96-well plates by serially dilution from 10 1 to 10 8, and calculated by Reed-Muench method.

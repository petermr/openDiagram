<p id="Par11">In order to investigate the putative involvement of carrot lncRNAs in the regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis in different carrot root tissues, we predicted the potential targets of lncRNAs in 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory relationship, particularly those classified as natural antisense transcripts (lncNATs). The selection of such lncRNAs was based on three assumptions: (1) both, the lncRNA and the putative target were differentially expressed between purple and orange tissues (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>); (2) the lncRNAs were antisense of the target genes; and (3) the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the expression levels of these genes were ≥ 0.70 or ≤  −0.70, and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01.

<p>The morphology of the obtained materials was studied by transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM 1010) (Tokyo, Japan). XRD measurements were taken in a step-scan mode using an ItalStructures diffractometer APD2000 (Riva del Garda, Italy) with monochromatized CuKα radiation (graphite monochromator). XRD patterns were scanned in 0.05° steps (2
 <italic>Ѳ</italic>), in the 2
 <italic>Ѳ</italic> range from 10° to 80°, with a fixed counting time (15 s). In cases where more than one crystalline phase coexists in the sample, we provided a quantitative analysis using Rietveld refinements of powder diffraction patterns [

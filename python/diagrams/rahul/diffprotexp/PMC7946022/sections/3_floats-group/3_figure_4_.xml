   <bold>Efficacy of vancomycin therapy in mice with catheters with single or mixed-species infection</bold>. (a) 
   <bold>Timeline of infection and treatment</bold>. Vancomycin was administered (55 mg/kg) 3 days post-catheter implantation twice daily for five days and microbial recovery from explanted catheters was evaluated. (b) Following explantation, catheters were sonicated to disrupt biofilms, and cell suspensions were diluted and plated on species-specific chromogenic media for assessment of microbial recovery. Based on CFU counts, vancomycin treatment resulted in significant decrease in 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> recovery from catheters infected only with 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic>, whereas vancomycin had no effect on 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> from catheters co-infected with 
   <italic>C. albicans</italic>. ****, p &lt; 0.0001; ns, not significant

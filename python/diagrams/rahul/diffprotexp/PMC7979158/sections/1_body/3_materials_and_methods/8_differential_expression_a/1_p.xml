<p>Raw count data for all samples were used as input along with sample information for differential expression analysis using edgeR (

 <underline>k</underline>ilobase per

For time-point differential expression analysis genes with count per million (CPM) &gt;0.1 in at least two samples were considered, resulting in E12.5, 16,396; E14.5, 16,658; E17.5, 16,229; P0, 16,613 genes in differential expression analyses. Principal component analysis indicated that the strongest driver of variance across samples was developmental age. Tagwise dispersion estimates were generated, and differential expression analysis was performed with edgeR using a generalized linear model, separately for each developmental time-point, including sex, sequencing run factor, and treatment as the variable for testing. Normalized expression levels were generated using the edgeR rpkm function. Normalized log
 <sub>2</sub> RPKM values were used for plotting of summary heatmaps and of expression data for individual genes.

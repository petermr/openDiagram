<p>AAF/IV also appeared phenotypically distinct on HEp-2 cells when compared to the adherence phenotype of EAEC strain 55989

This head-to-tail like bacterial interaction was apparently not dependent on contact with eukaryotic cells, as it could be also observed for AAF/IV-expressing EAEC strain 55,989

 </italic> in the mixed autoaggregation assay (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>, AAF/IV in combination with negative control). This suggests that AAF/IV may differ functionally from the other AAF subtypes and may have a function outside of the human host. AAF/IV was also referred to as Hda (
 <underline>H</underline>US-associated 
 <underline>d</underline>iffusely 
 <underline>a</underline>dherent) originating from the plasmid pO86A1 of clinical isolate DIJ1 (GenBank accession no. AB255435.1). Although this chain-like adherence phenotype of some EAEC variants, especially in correlation with AAF/IV expression, has been reported before [
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the exact phenotype mediated by this particular subtype of AAF still deserves further investigation. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note, that in a study on the impact of EAEC infection on childhood malnutrition and inflammation the presence of the AAF/IV, in contrast to the other AAF subtypes, was significantly associated with nourished children [

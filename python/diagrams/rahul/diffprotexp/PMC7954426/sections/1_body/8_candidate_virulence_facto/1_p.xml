<p>Christie-Atkins-Munch-Peterson (CAMP)-like factor is a candidate virulence factor for some mycoplasmas. 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (group B streptococci [GBS]) can produce CAMP factor, which can enhance the activity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> Î²-hemolysin to lyse erythrocytes, thereby increasing the hemolytic power at the junction of the two bacteria (CAMP phenomenon) [
 <xref rid="cit0301" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>]. Kornspan et al. has found that certain mycoplasmas, such as 
 <italic>M. fermentans, M. hominis</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> can enhance the hemolysis caused by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (positive CAMP phenomenon), while 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> had a negative CAMP phenomenon. In contrast, 
 <italic>M. capricolum, M. hyorhinis</italic> and Mmm displayed an antagonistic hemolysis with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (reverse CAMP phenomenon). Interestingly, 
 <italic>M. penetrans</italic> showed a positive and reverse CAMP phenomenon [
 <xref rid="cit0237" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. Although an association between the CAMP cohemolysin and virulence has been reported in 
 <italic>Riemerella anatipestifer</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0302" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>], the mycoplasmal putative CAMP-like factor remains elusive and merits further investigation.

<p id="Par24">Because of the non-uniqueness of the MFVS method, it is not a general evaluation if we consider only one MFVS result. Therefore, we calculated a set of random MFVSs by applying the WMFVS method with randomly shuffled gene weights. First, we planned to compute 1000 random MFVSs for analysis. However, since the Gurobi optimizer (version 8.1.0) does not always output a real optimal solution (e.g., even when we restrict the size of the output to be exactly 463, which is the size of the MFVS, sometimes the sizes of the output are smaller than 463), we filtered the obviously incorrect results and verified all the other outputs as MFVSs. Finally, we obtained 875 approved random MFVSs (since some MFVSs may be lost in the 
 <italic>ignore_w</italic> operation and the MFVSs are not distributed uniformly, not all possible MFVSs have the same possibility of random selection).

 <p>Wheat, being sensitive to terminal heat, causes drastic reduction in grain quality and yield. MAPK cascade regulates the network of defense mechanism operated inside plant system. Here, we have identified 21 novel MAPKs through gel-based proteomics and RNA-seq data analysis. Based on digital gene expression, two transcripts (transcript_2834 and transcript_8242) showing homology with MAPK were cloned and characterized from wheat (acc. nos. MK854806 and KT835664). Transcript_2834 was cloned in pET28a vector and recombinant MAPK protein of âˆ¼40.3 kDa was isolated and characterized to have very high

<p>Based on the correlation analysis, DEGs were identified for intermediate (MEFD3plu/MEFD3min) and terminal timepoints (MEFD5plu/MEFD5min). DEGs were genes that showed a statistically significant change in expression (
 <italic>p</italic>-adj&lt;0.05) between treatments. Using volcano plots, a total of 9186 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2e</xref>) and 8226 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">figure 2f</xref>) DEGs were identified for MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min, respectively. Differences in numbers of DEGs may reflect a series of synergetic processes, such as genes response to signalling molecules (i.e. cellular dynamics) or nuclear changes (i.e. methylation/acetylation events) during adipogenesis. Such processes may be involved in specifying cell fate or enhancing adipogenic features. DEGs from both timepoints were further analysed via log scaled variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) to generate a heatmap of hierarchal clustering. Expression of selected DEGs lists in each timepoint was analysed across all conditions (MEFD0, MEFD3min, MEFD3plu, MEFD5min, and MEFD5plu) and their corresponding replicates. Variable expression patterns were observed across conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2c</xref> and D), which may reflect potency of the differentiation treatment. However, between both timepoints, there were no significant changes in the expression patterns and number of DEGs list isolated from MEFD3plu/MEFD3min and MEFD5plu/MEFD5min.

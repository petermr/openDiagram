<p>Before metabolomic sequencing, the sample was reconstituted with 10 μl of double-distilled water (HPLC grade). Then metabolites were separated by reverse-phase LC (HP1100, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) using a reversed-phase XBridge C18 column (1.7 μm particle size, 1 × 150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, United States) and 2 μl of each sample was injected on the C18 column for analysis with a 0.4-ml/min flow rate. A quality control sample was run first followed by 10 test samples. Mobile phase A consisted of H
 <sub>2</sub>O/0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid which was followed by a program: 1% B at 0–1 min, 15% B at 3 min, 70% B at 5 min, 85% at 9 min, 100% at 10–12 min, and subsequently return to the initial conditions with 2 min for equilibration. Furthermore, the MS program was conducted on a 6545 Quadrupole-Time of Flight system (all devices from Agilent Technologies, Santa Clare, CA, United States) as follows: both positive and negative ion modes with drying gas 300
 <sup>°</sup>C flow 6 L/min, sheath gas 340
 <sup>°</sup>C flow 11 L/min, nebulizer gas 35 psig, capillary voltage 4,000 V, and fragmental voltage 135 V. The data collection (MS: 100–3,200

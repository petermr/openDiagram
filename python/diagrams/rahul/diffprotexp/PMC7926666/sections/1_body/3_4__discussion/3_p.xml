<p>DIP clusters were used for diagnostic and prognostic analyses for each subtype. Despite the improvements in the state of the art treatment technologies, the overall prognosis is still poor in RCCs and more than 50% of RCCs are diagnosed incidentally [
 <xref rid="B28-jpm-11-00158" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Even the detection of the early asymptomatic stage during routine examination could have a profound impact on clinical outcome. Therefore, an effective, clinically useful test for early detection of RCC subtypes should be measurable in readily accessible body fluids, such as plasma, serum, urine, or saliva. For this purpose, we filtered DIPs by considering whether they are expressed in those body fluids at the protein level and defined the s-DIP concept here for the first time in literature. s-DIP clusters characterize patients well in terms of the diagnostic group (subtype) to which they belong. Hence, we offer that s-DIPs might be used for the diagnosis of candidate RCC patients after further experimental and clinical validations.

<p>To further analyze the subcellular localization of STCH, we performed more co-localization studies using Golgi markers GM130 and giantin and the lysosomal marker LAMP2. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C (
 <bold>upper left panel</bold>), STCH intensively colocalized again with the ER marker calnexin clearly indicating that the main site of STCH expression is the ER. Interestingly, some STCH proteins appear to co-localize also with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, 
 <bold>upper right panel</bold>) and to a lesser degree with the cis/medial Golgi marker giantin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, 
 <bold>lower left panel</bold>), opening therefore the possibility of an additional interaction between NKCC2 and STCH at the cis-Golgi network. Importantly, STCH staining did not colocalize with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, 
 <bold>lower right panel</bold>), which clearly indicates that although some STCH exits the ER apparatus and then become Man-6-phosphorylated in the transitional elements/cis-Golgi apparatus, they are not delivered to the lysosomes. Collectively, these findings provide additional evidence that STCH interaction with NKCC2 takes place mainly at the ER. Moreover, they also suggest that this interaction may additionally occur at the cis-Golgi compartment.

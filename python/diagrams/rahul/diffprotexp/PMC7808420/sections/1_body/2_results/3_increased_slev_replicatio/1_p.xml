<p>To further characterize the mechanisms of ABR-/- mice susceptibility to experimental SLEV infection we evaluated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. WT and ABR-/- mice were infected with SLEV and euthanized for sample collection on day 3 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>). Brain samples were processed and assessed for SLEV accumulation by RT-qPCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>) and for the levels of cytokines IL-1β, CCL5, CXCL1 and IFNγ by ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b-e</xref>). These data confirmed previous results on SLEV replication in mouse brains, as we observed higher levels of SLEV genome copies in brain samples of ABR-/- mice in comparison to WT (SV129) mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>). Levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, CCL5 and CXCL1 were detected at basal levels in uninfected control mice and in SLEV-infected WT brains, in contrast to elevated levels observed in infected ABR-/- brains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b-d</xref>). IFNγ levels were not increased by SLEV infection at the evaluated timepoint (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3e</xref>). We also assessed SLEV genome copies and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the spleen, to find that SLEV disseminates to other organs and induces the expression of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines in ABR-/- mice, but not in WT mice (Supplementary. Fig.A1).

0: VYR assays were conducted as previously described [ 53] with minor modifications.
1: Viruses were first replicated in the presence of different concentrations of BLF.
2: Supernatant was harvested 2 dpi from each concentration of test compound and the viral yield was determined by plaque reduction assay.
3: The EC 50 values were calculated from best-fit dose response curves with variable slope in Prism 8.

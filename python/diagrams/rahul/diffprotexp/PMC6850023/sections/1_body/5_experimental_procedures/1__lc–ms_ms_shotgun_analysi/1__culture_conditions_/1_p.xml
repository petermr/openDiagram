 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub>, pristane or pyruvate that were in the exponential growth phase, i.e., the first measurable day of growth by OD). Cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker (16°C, 60 rpm). Growth curves were highly similar on all three substrates, and cells were harvested for protein extraction after 4 days, which represented cells in early exponential growth phase (determined by growth curves measured by OD at 600 nm, that showed a two day lag phase, followed by exponential growth measurable by an increase in OD from day 3, with cells entering stationary phase after 14 days).

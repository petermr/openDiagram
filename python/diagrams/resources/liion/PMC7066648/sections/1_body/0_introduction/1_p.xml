 </sup> Furthermore, a wearable battery in a seamlessly integrated fabric can be obtained when combining the yarn-shaped battery with mature textile manufacturing technology. Thus, the fabrication of the yarn-shaped battery is the key to effectively solve the bottleneck problem for the energy supply of wearable devices.

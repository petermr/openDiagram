<p>A comparison between the measured (lines) and experimentally obtained flow stresses (dots) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f012">Figure 12</xref>. The values and courses of stresses are highly dependent on the deformation temperature. A comparison of the curves shows that increasing strain rate or decreasing temperature causes an increase in flow stress. In other words, softening due to dynamic recrystallization and dynamic recovery is prevented and causes the material to exhibit strain hardening. The higher strain rate and lower temperature provide a shorter time for energy accumulation and lower mobility at the grain boundaries, which also leads to the growth of dynamically recrystallized grains and the partial removal of dislocations.

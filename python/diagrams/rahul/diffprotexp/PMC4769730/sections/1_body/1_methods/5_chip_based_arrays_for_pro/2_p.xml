<p>For hybridization, an equal amount of protein extracts (350 ng/mL in Lysis Buffer) was applied to each sub-array (70 µL/subarray). Both POAG (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25 POAG) and control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13) extracts were processed in parallel. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the array slides were washed and exposed to a biotinylated antibody mixture followed by a cy3-streptAvidin labeling solution. All steps were performed under orbital shaking (CertomaxII, Sartorius AG) and all the hybridization/washing solutions were provided by the kit. As a final point, the glass-slides were washed once with MilliQ water, spin-dried and acquired with a GenePix 4400 Microarray scanner (Molecular Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, Silicon Valley, CA). To obtain appropriate Cy5 (background signal) and Cy3 (specific signal) images, the slides were scanned over previously validated acquisition parameters and the images/arrays (blocks) were uniformly adjusted for size, brightness and contrast at the moment of acquisition. Using the SPOT tool, the specific area (corresponding to each cytokine on the array) was manually spotted and automatically adjusted, according to prefixed acquisition parameters applied to all glass-slides of the study. The fluorescent intensity data (FI) of each spot was calculated by the GenePix Pro 6.0 pro software (Molecular Devices), that provide background-subtracted FI data (F532-B532, N factor) as of a value for spot volume representing the product of the area and the highest pixel value contained in that area.

<p>While a few hundred PAS are species-specific, the majority of PAS (98.5%) were identified in both species. We thus sought to characterize quantitative differences in APA patterns between human and chimpanzee by estimating the difference in theÂ usage of individual PAS in each species. To do so, we used the leafcutter differential splicing tool (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>), which allowed us to test for differences in normalized PAS usage fractions while accounting for gene structure (see 'Materials and methods'). Using this approach, at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% we identified 2342 PAS (in 1705 genes) whose usage differs by 20% or more between the species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We applied an arbitrary effect size cutoff to focus on larger inter-species differences, which are more likely to have functional consequences. The list of all PAS whose usage differs between the species, regardless of the effect size, is available in

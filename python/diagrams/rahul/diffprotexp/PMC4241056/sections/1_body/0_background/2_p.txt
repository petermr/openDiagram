0: Although Se is an essential element, its margin between the lowest acceptable level of intake and toxicity is very narrow.
1: According to a previous study, sodium selenite stimulated Caco-2 cell proliferation at low concentrations (10 to 100 nM) but inhibited growth at higher doses (>1 M) in serum-free medium [ 6].
2: The toxicity and bioavailability of Se depend on the chemical form, physiological state, different absorption characteristics, and metabolic pathways [ 7, 8].
3: In nature and organisms, Se presents as organic (such as selenomethionine (Se-Met) and selenocysteine (Sec)) and inorganic forms (selenide (Se 2-), selenate (SeO 42-), selenite (SeO 32-), and Se) [ 9- 14].
4: Selenium nanoparticles (nano-Se) is referred to as red or elemental Se, existing as nano-sized particles which usually between 20 and 100 nm [ 15].
5: It has been reported previously that nano-Se has high biological activities and low toxicity [ 16] when compared with other forms of Se.
6: As one of the nanoparticles, nano-Se would have some special physiochemical and biological properties [ 17].
7: Therefore, the differences of bioactivity and metabolism of different forms of Se deserve investigation.

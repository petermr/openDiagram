<p id="p0235">It is interesting to note that there was only Carr's index capable to distinguish the SCU@CD-MOF from the free CD-MOF among the conventional measurements, and the space configurations of SCU in CD-MOF had significantly different surface stabilities. Since the size was not enlarged in microscopic observations, it is hypothesized that the enhanced laryngeal depositions are not generated by the conventional particle size growth or particle agglomerations. The SCU loading may greatly change the interaction of SCU@CD-MOF and the surface of the throat of the NGI instrument. Yet there are technical and ethical challenges to directly observe the laryngeal depositions 
 <italic>inÂ vivo</italic>, the enhanced anchoring of SCU@CD-MOF suggests potential applications.

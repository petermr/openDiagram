<p>As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f077">Figure 77</xref>, quench-induced precipitation in the Al alloys investigated here generally falls into different temperature and time (cooling rate) intervals. For most alloys, two or three main reaction intervals can be identified [

 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. However, there are several hints of the superposition of multiple reactions beneath the main reaction intervals [

 <xref rid="B133-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. In addition, a cooling rate that is fast in terms of precipitation for a certain lean alloy may be relatively slow in terms of precipitation for an alloy of higher concentration, and the same holds for the temperature ranges. For instance, the LTR for Al0.72Si (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f077">Figure 77</xref>A) occurs at a temperature range of about 420 to 300 Â°C [
 <xref rid="B117-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], which is almost the same temperature range as for the MTRs of 7150 [

 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>] (at least at certain cooling rates).

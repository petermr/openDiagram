<p>To determine whether a specific secretion pathway was used by 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> secreted proteins, a secretion path mapping was performed with two computational tools widely used for this purpose, SignalP and SecretomeP. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009104.g005">Fig 5</xref>, 57% of conserved ESPs follow the nonclassical secretion route. Interestingly, 60% of differential ESPs follow the nonclassical pathway as well. This suggests that 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> proteins are preferentially secreted through the nonclassical pathway. This could be associated to the production of pathogenic factors.

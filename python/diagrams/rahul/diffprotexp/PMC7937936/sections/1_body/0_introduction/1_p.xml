<p>The most common pathologic type of tumor occurring in the head and neck region is mucosal squamous cell carcinoma, which mainly affects the oral mucosa, palate, tongue, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and other parts (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The global incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has risen significantly and is estimated to increase by 30% until 2030 (1.08 million new cases annually) (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The 5-year survival rate for patients with HNSCC is less than 50% before 2014 (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), primarily because approximately 80% to 90% of patients with advanced HNSCC develop local recurrence or distant metastasis (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Besides, patients with HNSCC have the second-highest suicide rate, less than patients with pancreatic cancer, which may be attributed to excessive stress and low life quality (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Treatment strategies for HNSCC vary depending on the site of disease, disease stage, etc., and mainly include surgery (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), local radiotherapy (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and systemic chemotherapy (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, have also shown encouraging results in the advanced tumor (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, for advanced squamous cell carcinoma, the currently existing therapies were of limited benefit.

<p>However, we canâ€™t obtain pure NDV cells for the nitrogenase activity analysis because the technique for the isolation of heterocysts of Anabaena cylindrica was all based on vegetable cell disruption. We didn't get the expected result about nitrogenase activity analysis, the pure NDH cells showed lower nitrogenase activity compared with the NDV+NDH (The whole filaments in BG110). We think that the nitrogenase ability of pure NDH cells should be different with NDH in filaments. Therefore, the ARA results of different cells only showed in the response letter.</p>

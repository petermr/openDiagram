<p>In cells exposed to L-Tyr, enrichment revealed a total of 269 KEGG pathways, 2641 hits, and 1458 nodes; of which, 36 routes with 828 hits passed the hypergeometric test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). In cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU, 256 KEGG pathways, 1560 hits, and 962 nodes; 11 routes and 169 hits with statistical significance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01591-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). Of these pathways, the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, survival, and pathways associated with cellular metabolism related to the phenotype induced by exposure to L-Tyr; while the p53, FoxO, apoptosis, Jak-STAT, and altered transcriptional regulation in cancer pathways related to the phenotype caused by exposure to 5-Brd-2′-dU.

<p>The innate immune response during 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection triggers the development of an acquired immune response inducing the development of diverse CD4 T-cell responses that include T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells. In this sense, our results suggest an impaired immune response characterized by diminished recruitment of T-cells (CD3, CD4, and CD8) and B-cells (CD19) to the lungs of

0: An independent transfection experiment was carried out for qPCR validation as described above.
1: RNA was extracted with Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (#R2052, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) following manufacturers protocol.
2: High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (#4368814, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to reverse transcribe 1 g RNA.
3: mRNA expression was quantified by q-RT-PCR amplification of cDNA using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (#4309155, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a Bio-Rad CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System.
4: Q-RT-PCR was performed with primer assays from Sigma (#KSPQ12012G) and Qiagen (#330001) targeting the genes  TGFB1,  TGFB2,  ZYX,  NFKBIA,  SDC4,  COL4A2,  BAZ2A,  SMARCA4, and  HSPG2.
5: Primer assay efficiencies were guaranteed by the manufacturer.
6: Target gene expression was normalized on GAPDH and ACTIN expression.

0: Cy3 labeling for preparative gels: A total of 250 g of protein (31.25 g/ sample) from samples represented in analytical gels were pooled, speed vacuum-dried, resuspended in 250 l of cell lysis buffer and treated with TCEP for 1 h at 37C.
1: Protein (250 g) was labeled with Cy3 saturation dye for 30 min at 37C.
2: To stop the reaction, sample buffer was added to a final volume of 450 l.

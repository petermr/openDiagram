<p>The 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> measurements discussed above are insufficient to address the issue of the structure of the active catalyst and to elucidate the nature of the active sites. Because of the expected structural and chemical transformations under reaction conditions, 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> studies are necessary. Using 
 <italic>in situ</italic> XAS, Leonard et al. demonstrated that the oxidation state of Fe in Fe-based TMNC is predominantly 3+, but under reaction conditions, a reduction of the Fe species was observed through the shift in the edge position. Moreover, while for the as-prepared samples the EXAFS analysis suggested that the Fe–N
 <sub>4</sub> structure motif fits well the experimental data, under reaction conditions the reduction of the Fe–N coordination number was observed. The changes in the catalyst structure coincided with an increase in the selectivity toward methane production.

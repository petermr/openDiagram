<p>LncRNAs are involved in many post-transcriptional regulation processes, where some anti-sense lncRNAs may regulate gene silencing, transcription, and mRNA stability. In order to reveal the interactions between antisense lncRNAs and mRNAs, RNAplex software (

One of functions of lncRNAs is the cis-regulation of neighboring genes on the same allele. The up-stream lncRNAs that intersect with the promoter or other cis-elements may regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. The downstream or 3ʹUTR region lncRNAs may have other regulatory functions. For lncRNA cis-regulation analysis, the lncRNAs that had been annotated previously as “unknown region” were annotated again. LncRNAs found less than 100 kb up- or down-stream of a gene were likely to be cis-regulators. The cis target genes were then subjected to enrichment analysis of GO functions and KEGG pathways. For lncRNA trans-regulation of co-expressed gene analysis, which is another function of lncRNAs, the correlation of expression between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes was analyzed to identify the target genes of lncRNAs. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for samples ≥6 and protein-coding genes with absolute correlation &gt;0.9 were then subjected to enrichment analysis of GO functions and KEGG pathways. The enrichment analysis of the GO functions and KEGG pathways were then conducted in protein-coding genes in the network.

<p>Many methods have been developed to separate the active material from the current collector and binder. Some researchers prefer decomposing the binder to allow the detachment of the current collector and liberation of active material. This can be achieved thermally or chemically using solvents. Other scholars would rather only remove the Al sheet via either chemical dissolution or mechanical delamination, which would cause the active material to remain entrapped in the binder. Lastly, some scientists perform selective leaching of the entire cathode and remove Al and the binder at the end of the process [

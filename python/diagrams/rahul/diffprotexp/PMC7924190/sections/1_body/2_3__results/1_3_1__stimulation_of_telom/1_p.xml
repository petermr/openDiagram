<p>No differences in the morphology of the telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line (hTCEpi) were observed during stimulation with AC EFs for 24 h. The distribution of the applied EF strength during AC EF stimulation is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00299">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. In addition, EF-stimulated cells maintained a healthy spindle-shaped epithelial morphology and showed growth rate characteristics similar to untreated control cells. Further, no deleterious effects on epithelial cells were observed during AC EF stimulations (

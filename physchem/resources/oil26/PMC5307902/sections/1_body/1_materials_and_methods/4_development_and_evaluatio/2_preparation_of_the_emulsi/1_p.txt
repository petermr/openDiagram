0: The emulsions were obtained by the phase inversion temperature method.
1: [ 19] The preparation of W/O emulsions by the PIT method is a widely used technique in obtaining emulsified systems, in particular, emulsions containing the essential oil.
2: [ 202122232425] According to studies presented by Esquena, Sankar,[ 26] the PIT method requires the system whose phase inversion temperature is above the freezing point of water, and below the temperature where degradation of substances occurs.
3: This can be achieved by choosing the surfactant with the nonionic appropriate HLB value for the system.
4: The oil in water emulsion composition was 5% (w/w) of PaEO, 2% (w/w) of surfactants, and 93% (w/w) of water.
5: Initially, the continuous phase was prepared by dispersing the required Tween 20  in distilled water.
6: The dispersed phase was obtained by adding Span 80  into the essential oil.
7: Both phases were heated separately to 70C and one phase dispersed within the other.
8: The studies report the use of up to 70C to obtain emulsions containing essential oil.
9: [ 1119212227282930] The final emulsions were obtained after homogenization using an Ultra-Turrax [IKA, model T-18, Frankfurt, Germany] at 15,500 rpm for 10 min.
10: Two batches of 14 emulsions with varying HLB values [ Table 1] were obtained and stored at 25  2C and 5  1C in tube assay to evaluate the IC.
11: Furthermore, 14 flasks of 50ml each, were stored at room temperature to complete the pH and conductivity tests.

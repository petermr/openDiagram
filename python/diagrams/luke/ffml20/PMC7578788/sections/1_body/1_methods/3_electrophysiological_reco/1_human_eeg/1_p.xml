<p id="Par17">The experiments were preformed within a purpose-built Faraday cage. EEG signals were captured using 32 active electrodes (ActiCAP, BrainProducts) arranged according to the extended international 10/20 system. Electrode preparation proceeded as per the manufacturers guidance and impedances were reduced to &lt; 5 kΩ with conductive gel (SuperVisc, BrainProducts). Data were recorded at 2500 Hz using a BrainAmp DC amplifier and BrainVision Recorder Software (BrainProducts).</p>

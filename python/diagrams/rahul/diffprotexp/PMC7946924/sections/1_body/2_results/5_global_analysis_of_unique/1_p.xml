<p id="Par29">Differential gene expression analysis for miRNAs in 12 samples of Group1 (SR-159) and Group2 (SR-157) were performed where Log
 <sub>2</sub> fold of 1 was used as cut-off. In all these conditions, miRNAs expression were either “UP-regulated” or “DOWN-regulated” in comparison to NEUTRAL-miRNA as represented in scatter plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) and heat map (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). After removing number of targets and duplicates, more than 170 miRNA unique to SR-159 genotype were identified during different stages of grain development of the apical and basal spikelets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). In comparison, less numbers of miRNAs unique to the cultivar were identified for the corresponding spikelets of cultivar SR-157. The targets for the unique miRNAs were searched in the psRNA target server. After removing the number of targets, the number of unique miRNAs found in SR-159 and SR-157 were arranged separately in apical and basal spikelets at different stages of grain filling. The number increased temporally in the first 5 days of anthesis in both apical and basal spikelets of the cultivars and declined thereafter in the following 5 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Between the cultivars the miRNAs showed an overall increase in number in the 10 days period of observation in SR-159, but no corresponding increase of number was recorded for SR-157 during the same period. In SR-159, the number of miRNAs was consistently higher in basal compared to the apical spikelet, but this difference between spikelet types was not exactly discernible in SR-157.

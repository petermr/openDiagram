 <caption> Expression of Cxcl15 in control, I.P. and I.T. LPS challenged mice. ( A) Western blotting of lung tissue extracts. *, p &lt; 0.05; ***, p &lt; 0.001. Please note that protein samples from I.P. LPS group were placed next to the control group (I.T. saline) to better illustrate the down-regulation of Cxcl15 by I.P. LPS compared to the controls; ( B) Immunostaining of Cxcl15 on lung tissue sections. Cxcl15 was expressed by both the bronchial and type II alveolar epithelial cells (brown staining). The identity of the type II alveolar epithelial cells was confirmed by immunostaining with pro-surfactant protein C, a type II cell marker, on consecutive lung tissue sections (not shown); ( C) Expression of Cxcl15 in BALF and lung tissues following I.P. saline (48 h) and I.P. LPS treatment at different time points (24, 48 and 72 h) by Western blotting. </caption>

0: In addition to cattle, BVDV can also infect sheep, pigs, deer, and other wild animals [ 1416].
1: Although there is currently no effective cure for the disease caused by CP biotype BVDV infection in animals, existing BVDV vaccines contribute to effectively preventing the disease epidemic [ 17].
2: However, vaccinated and naturally infected animals cannot be effectively distinguished by serological methods.
3: The identification and elimination of PI livestock to prevent the spread of BVDV is the most widely used strategy today.
4: However, this inevitably results in important economic losses for the farms due to the need to detect and remove PI animals, and underdeveloped countries and regions cannot bear such heavy costs.
5: Thus, the elucidation of the mechanism of BVDV infection and host immune responses is crucial to characterize the pathogenesis of BVDV and to develop vaccines with which to control BVDV infection.

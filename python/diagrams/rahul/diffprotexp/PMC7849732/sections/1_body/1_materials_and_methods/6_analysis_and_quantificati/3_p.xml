<p>In all of our experiments, we selected either the right or the left side of the dorsal horn for quantification. The selection criteria were based primarily on the integrity and quality of the fixed spinal cord tissue section. When the integrity of the section was equal for both the left and right dorsal horn, we randomly selected one of them before GluN2 staining was analyzed.</p>

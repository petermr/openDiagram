<p>In conclusion, 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> MIL-1, an important OHCB that can dominate microbial communities following marine oil spills, possess an ability to degrade a wide-range of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes including both medium and long chain lengths. This study has expanded the known substrate range of 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> to include longer 
 <italic>n-</italic>alkanes up to 
 <italic>n</italic>-C32. This study has also significantly enhanced our understanding of the fundamental physiology of 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> MIL-1 by identifying key enzymes involved in both the terminal oxidation of medium-chain alkanes and subterminal oxidation of long-chain alkanes and proteins involved in chemotaxis and transport across the cell membrane of long-chain alkanes. In particular, a potentially novel BVMO system is upregulated for the subterminal oxidation of long-chain alkanes, highlighting an alternative pathway to the currently known AlmA and LadA terminal monooxygenase pathways. Given the homology of the BVMO enzyme TOL_0709 to proteins present in other ubiquitous marine OHCB (e.g., 
 <italic>Oleibacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Oleispira</italic>), this pathway may be widespread in the marine environment.

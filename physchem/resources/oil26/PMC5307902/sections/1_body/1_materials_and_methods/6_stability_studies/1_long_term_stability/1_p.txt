0: The macroscopic aspect, CI, pH, and conductivity were evaluated on storage days 1, 3, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.
1: The samples were stored at room temperature (25  2C) and at a low temperature (5  1C).
2: These parameters enabled the evaluation of the emulsion system stability and therefore the prediction of the chemical stability of the components of the emulsion.

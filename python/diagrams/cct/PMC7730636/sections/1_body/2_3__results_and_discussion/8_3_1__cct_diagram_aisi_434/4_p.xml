<p>We can also observe in the diagram that the hardness declined due to the decreasing cooling rate. This result is associated with the formation of the microstructure after cooling the samples. The highest Vickers hardness 850 was reached at the highest cooling rate of 100 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The hardness results differed only slightly, where the microstructure was formed only by martensite. We observe that the hardness began to decrease after the beginning of the formation of a heterogeneous structure (bainite + martensite). Significant decrease in hardness occurred during the formation of ferrite. Final Vickers hardness of 423 was measured in the last dilatation curve, which was cooled at a rate of 0.01 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. This represents an almost 50% decrease compared to the highest cooling rate of 100 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The arrangement of the ferrite atomic lattice is of the bcc type, while the martensitic structure creates a bct atomic lattice, which by its structure supports the increase of the material hardness [

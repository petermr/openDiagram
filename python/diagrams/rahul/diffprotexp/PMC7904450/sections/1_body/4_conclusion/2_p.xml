<p id="p0100">Increased IL6 signal transduction causes cytokine storm which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution is underway but immediate life-saving drug treatments are necessary to decrease case-fatality rates. NF-kappaB plays a pivotal role in cytokine storms through transcriptional activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines 
 <italic>IL6</italic> and 
 <italic>IL6ST</italic>. This study provides further evidence supporting the use of fluoxetine to decrease NF-kappaB signaling and thereby decrease the IL6ST signal transduction pathway driving cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using fluoxetine to disrupt this NF-kappaB/IL6ST axis and mitigate the resultant cytokine storm may increase survival and decrease rates of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients.

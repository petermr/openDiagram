0: We used a series of generalised linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) to determine the effects of environmental variables on aardvark body temperature patterns.
1: We used each 24-h period as a sampling unit in the GLMMs, and added a first order autocorrelation structure to account for temporal autocorrelation.
2: We included aardvark identity as a random factor.
3: The dependent variable was minimum or maximum or amplitude of the 24-h body temperature rhythm.
4: Independent variables included photoperiod, minimum or maximum or range of 24-h air temperature, and vegetation greenness as a proxy of resource abundance for aardvark prey.
5: This vegetation greenness index consisted of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometry (MODIS)-derived time-series enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data for the Gordonia duneveld vegetation ( Tokura, 2016).
6: EVI was measured every 16 days and averaged per month.
7: We previously have shown that EVI as an index for aardvark preys food availability correlated with aardvark body condition ( Weyer, 2018).
8: We tested for multicollinearity of independent variables within each model using variance inflation factors (VIF) and ensured that all VIF<2, based on a conservative cutoff ( Zuur et al., 2010).

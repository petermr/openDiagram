<p id="Par71">Interestingly, G-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) were upregulated in mature MNs (D28). Genes encoding for excitatory (
 <italic>CHRM3</italic>) and inhibitory (
 <italic>CHRM2</italic>) mAChRs were specifically activated in late stage MN maturation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, D18-D28). The excitatory mAChRs stimulate PLC, triggering IP3 and diacylglycerol signaling pathways (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Since mAChRs are present on parasympathetic neurons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], our data suggest that the iPSC-induced MNs bear the excitatory characteristics of parasympathetic neurons.

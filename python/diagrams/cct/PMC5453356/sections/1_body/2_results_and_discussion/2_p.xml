<p>The recorded and evaluated heat flow curves are shown in 
 <xref rid="f9-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A–D</xref>. In order to ensure readability, the curves are separated into four temperature ranges. All diagrams are scaled in the same way to enable the reader to see the differences in the signal intensity directly, which are dependent on temperature and time. The heat flow shows one peak in each case. This peak shifts in time, and its peak height changes. Three maxima of the heat flow values, within a certain temperature range, were detected. The first temperature area ranges from 450 to 430 °C; the second from 430 °C to 300 °C; and the third from 300 °C to 250 °C. Additionally, the heat flow curves of the second temperature range were separated into two diagrams (
 <xref rid="f9-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B,C</xref>) following the order of increasing or decreasing intensity, respectively. Within these diagrams, increasing peak values are shown by different solid lines until the maximum peak value is reached. The maximum is highlighted with a solid fat red line. The heat flow curves, where the peak value decreases, are plotted as dashed lines.

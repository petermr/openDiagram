0: All dilatometers utilize measurement of dimensions (length and/or diameter) and temperatures during heating and cooling.
1: Each material consists of millions of atoms that are interconnected, and due to the increase in temperature, these atoms begin to move (oscillate).
2: The total volume of material begins to change, which is associated with a change in the length of the material.
3: The thermal expansion of all crystalline substances is directly related to the action of internal atomic forces in the crystal lattice [ 21].

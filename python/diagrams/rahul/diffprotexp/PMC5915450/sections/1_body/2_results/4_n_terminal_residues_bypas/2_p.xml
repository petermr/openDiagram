<p id="Par18">We hypothesized that structurally, the largest forces in the force profiles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) are generated when the peptides are passing through the constricted space formed between ERY and the exit tunnel wall. To test this, we determined the average distance between the center of mass (COM) of each nascent chain residue and ERY (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) when 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> occurred in the individual trajectories. We find that for both peptides the N-terminal residue is closest to ERY at 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>, and the C-terminal residues are increasingly further away. Thus, for both peptides, the largest forces arise as the N-terminal residues attempt to bypass ERY.

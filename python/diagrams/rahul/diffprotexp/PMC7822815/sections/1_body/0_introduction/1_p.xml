<p id="Par3">Alternative splicing increases the transcriptomic and proteomic complexity by generating distinct RNA isoforms with different roles and functions from a single gene

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Dysregulation can take place on the level of alternative promoter choice leading the transcripts with altered 5’-termini, choice of alternative polyadenylation, and within transcript bodies by changes in splice site selection affecting exon composition or intron retention. Mis-splicing of genes has been found in multiple malignancies including carcinomas, neuroblastoma, chronic lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

<p>Compared to untreated control cells, insulin-treated cells differentially expressed 40 proteins (with |log

 <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.05), of which 9 proteins were exclusively changed by the pancreatic hormone and not metformin (

 <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.05) in the insulin resistance model and thus were significantly differential expressed in comparison to untreated control samples (

Additionally, 16 out of 40 proteins were differentially expressed due to insulin supplementation when compared to metformin-treated HEC-1A cells (ACVRL1, AMFR, CDH5, CEACAM8, CTGF, EGF, EZR, IL4, MPP3, PLCG2, SELE, SIGLEC5, SORL1, TM9SF2, VEGFA, WNT2B) (

<p>We further analyzed proteins that were altered upon m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulator mutation (mutation, amplification, and deep deletion). Since data were not found in liver cancer, subsequent analysis was done in other four types of GI cancer. Proteins that showed significant changes (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) were shown in the volcano map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). All the differential proteins were summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. In order to know which pathway the differential proteins are enriched, we used DAVID for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) proteins enrichment. According to the downstream gene count and 
 <italic>P</italic> value, bubble plots were constructed in different types of GI cancer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The 
 <italic>P</italic> value and the number of genes are shown in this figure. More detailed data can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Tables S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS4">S4</xref>. In addition, a heat map was constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) considering P values of different pathways. Among 34 pathways, we found some major pathways affected by m
 <sup>5</sup>C regulators: ErbB, PI3K–Akt, HIF-1, and mTOR signaling pathways. Combining the bubble plots and heat map results, we conclude that the ErbB signaling pathway and PI3K–Akt signaling pathway are the most important downstream pathways of m
 <sup>5</sup>C RNA methylation modification.

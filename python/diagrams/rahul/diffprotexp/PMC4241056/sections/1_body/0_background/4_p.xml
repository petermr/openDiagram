<p>In the present study, the Caco-2 cell model, treated with Se in different chemical forms, was established to investigate the corresponding differentially expressed proteins using basal proteomics methods including two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Therefore, the same concentration of Se at 100 nmol L
 <sup>-1</sup> were used in the present study to evaluate and determine the differential protein expressions in the Caco-2 cells treated with sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se.

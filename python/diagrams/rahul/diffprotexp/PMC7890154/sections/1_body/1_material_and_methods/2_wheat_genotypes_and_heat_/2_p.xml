 <italic>cvs</italic>. HD3086 (thermotolerant) and BT-Schomburgk (thermosusceptible) were selected for the present investigation. The seeds of both the 
 <italic>cvs</italic>. were pre-treated with Bavistin @ 0.25% before sowing in 30 pots (15 pots per cultivar) having equal ratio of perlite, sand and farmyard manure (FYM). Pots were kept inside glass house with regulated growth conditions [22 ± 2 °C (day-time) and 18 ± 2 °C (night-time), RH of 80%, PAR of 250 μmol m
 <sup>−1</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> with 8 h light and dark period] at Mini Phytotron Facility, IARI, New Delhi. The plants were irrigated at regular interval. The plants (in group) were treated with differential HS (T
 <sub>1</sub> - 32°C, 2 h and T
 <sub>2</sub> - 38°C for 2 h) at flowering and grain development stages, decided based on the Feekes scale [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Microprocessor-regulated chambers were used to expose the plants to HS with an increment of 1 °C per 10 min, till it attains the specific temperature for HS. We have collected flag leaf and spikes in triplicates for further downstream applications.

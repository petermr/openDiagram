<p>In conclusion, we profiled the changes in expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs in BVDV-infected MDBK cells. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was used to identify all the DE mRNAs and lncRNAs. The analysis of BVDV-infected MDBK cells with comprehensive molecular data provided an insight into the roles of lncRNAs in BVDV infection and host immune responses involved in hostâ€“virus interaction. Moreover, further research is under way to investigate the functions of the DE lncRNAs to explore the mechanisms of BVDV infection and its pathogenesis.</p>

0: Two-dimensional electrophoresis through isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the first dimension with an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) was performed as follows.
1: A specific amount of protein was accurately aspirated (150 g of protein loaded for silver-stained samples and 1.0 mg for Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained samples), and rehydration buffer was added to a final volume of 350 L. After thorough mixing, the samples were loaded into the IPG gel wells between the positive and negative electrodes.
2: The protective membrane of the pre-made IPG gel strip (18 cm, pH 3~10, NL) (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) was then removed, and the samples in the gel well were covered with the strip, with the gel side facing downward.
3: The gel strip was slowly pressed down to avoid bubbles.
4: The top of the gel strip was then evenly sealed with 1 ml of cover oil.
5: The cover was secured, and IEF was performed in an IPG-IEF apparatus (BioRad).
6: After the IEF step was completed, the IPG gel strip was balanced.
7: Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 12%), as the second dimension in 2-DE, was then performed vertically on the PH-balanced IPG gel strip.
8: The settings of the electrophoresis parameters were as follows: 20 mA/gel and electrophoresis at a constant current for 40 min, followed by 30 mA/gel electrophoresis at a constant current until bromophenol blue reached the end of the gel.
9: The gel was then stained with silver nitrate or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (BioRad).

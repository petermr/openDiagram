<p>The immune system of a snail consists of both humoral and cellular arms. The hemolymph, composed of plasma and hemocytes, not only serves as a source of metabolites and nutrients for parasite development, but also plays a key role in the snail’s response to infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While plasma contains numerous proteins, which may act to directly eliminate pathogens, the hemocytes represent the main immune effectors, playing a major role in the recognition and killing of invading pathogens by different methods such as phagocytosis, encapsulation, and cytotoxic reactions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The processes involved in the snail defense mechanisms have been extensively studied in 
 <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> spp. snails [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For instance, infections with the trematode 
 <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> have been shown to alter the protein levels in both the hemolymph and body of the snail [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Several proteins whose concentrations change in hemolymph have been identified [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Different lectins such as selectin, galectin, C-type lectin, and fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) were over-expressed after infection and are considered to play an important role in pathogen recognition mechanisms capable of agglutination and binding to intruders [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, aldolase and myosin have been identified as proteins that regulate hemocyte migration and can be implicated in pathogen killing by a cytotoxic reaction and phagocytosis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent studies on 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>siamensis goniomphalos</italic> have used different “omics” approaches to study the alterations that occur within defined snail tissues after 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>viverrini</italic> infection, such as body and head-foot [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], including high-throughput sequencing technologies and protein expression analysis, however molecular changes of the immune effectors of

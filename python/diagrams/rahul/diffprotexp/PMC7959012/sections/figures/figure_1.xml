 <caption>
  <p>The first 30 pathways of the enrichment of KEGG in the model group vs. the control group. Each point in the figure represented a KEGG path, and the path name was shown in the left coordinate axis. The horizontal ordinate was the Enrichment Factor, which represented the ratio of the proportion of differentially expressed proteins annotated to the pathway to that of the species. The higher the enrichment factor, the more significant the enrichment of the differential proteins in the pathway</p>

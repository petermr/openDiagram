<p>A lncRNA library was constructed using 3 µg of total RNA per sample. The Ribo-Zero™ Gold kit (Illumina, Inc.) was used to remove the rRNA from the sample and select the different index tags to build the library according to the manufacturer's instructions. The NEB Next Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs, Inc.) was used to construct a sequencing library using rRNA-depleted RNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

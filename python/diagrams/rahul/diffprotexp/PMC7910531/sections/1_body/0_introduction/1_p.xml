<p id="Par3">Osteoarthritis is a severe, debilitating disease that affects the whole joint organ and is hallmarked by cartilage degeneration and synovial hypertrophy. As of 2019, osteoarthritis is estimated to affect 528 Million people worldwide and be the 15th leading cause of years lived with disability

 </sup>, and is on an upward trajectory commensurate with rises in obesity and the ageing population. Between 2010 and 2019, the global prevalence of osteoarthritis and the resulting years lived with disability have both risen by 27.5%

 </sup>. Disease management focusses on alleviating pain, and in end-stage disease the only treatment is joint replacement surgery, emphasising the clear and urgent need to develop new therapies. To achieve this, we need to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular pathophysiology.

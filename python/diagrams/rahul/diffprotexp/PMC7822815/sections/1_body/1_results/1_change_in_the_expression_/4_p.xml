<p id="Par11">Using our pipeline, we developed a list of non-overlapping genomic fragments by analyzing 511,363 non-overlapping bins of human canonical exons annotated in Ensembl
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. This exonic list was extended by 3540 non-overlapping bins of retained introns detected in 2401 genes of the Kasumi-1 cells, of which 25% were differentially retained between 
 <italic>RUNX1/RUNX1T1</italic> knockdown and control cells (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Of note, knockdown affected intron retention in both ways: 419 introns were exclusively detected in RUNX1/RUNX1T1-depleted cells, while 469 introns were only retained in control cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c, d</xref>). These condition-specific retained introns show a small but noticeable difference in expression (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e–i</xref>).

 <caption> (a) Cu K-edge XAS data for an as-prepared Cu nanocatalyst used for CO2RR (from ref ( 25)). Schematics of the photoelectron scattering process, and pre-edge at the Cu K-edge are shown in the insets. (b) Cu K-edge EXAFS data extracted from the XAS spectrum shown in panel a. (c) Fourier-transformed (FT) Cu K-edge EXAFS spectrum for bulk Cu(II) oxide, its fit with the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method (see Section 4.4 ), and the contributions of the 11 most important photoelectron scattering paths, whose geometries are shown on the right. (d) Cu–O and Cu–Cu partial radial distribution functions in bulk CuO as obtained from RMC-EXAFS analysis. The structure model, optimized in RMC simulations is shown in the inset. The vertical dashed lines in panels c and d show the R-value corresponding to an average nearest neighbor Cu–O distance. See ref ( 25) for RMC details. </caption>

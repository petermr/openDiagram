0: It should be mentioned that in reality, the ACE2 receptors of some animals may not bind to S-RBD.
1: However, to quantitatively compare the capability of different ACE2 receptors to bind to S-RBD, we first constructed initial ACE2/S-RBD complex models through homology modeling, assuming that all the ACE2 receptors could bind to S-RBD, and then computed the binding energies between the two partners.

<p id="p0015">Ginseng (
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> Meyer, Araliaceous) is an important medicinal herb that has long been used to treat various diseases in Asian countries (i.e., Korea, China, and Japan) 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Among several kinds of 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> products, red ginseng, produced by steaming and drying fresh ginseng, is a main active ginseng. During this process, ginsenosides undergo chemical changes that have the potential to create special physiologic activities

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This is known to have various physiological activities, including—but not limited to—antioxidant, anticancer, tonic, and antiaging effects. Red ginseng improved learning and memory of the mice

 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, there is very limited information on the proteomic mechanisms underlying the antiaging effect and life span extension of red ginseng on 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or other animal models, because existing studies have primarily focused on pharmacology and/or pharmacodynamics association studies

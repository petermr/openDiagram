0: The sample preparation and metabolite extraction procedures were as follows: 100  1 mg of 34-stage anther was put in a 2 mL EP tube, and 0.6 mL extraction buffer (V methanol: V dH2O = 3:1) was added, followed by 20 L of adonitol (1 mg/mL stock in dH 2O) as per the internal standard.
1: The column used was Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18 (1.8 m, 2.1 mm  100 mm.
2: The mobile phase used was as follows: Phase A, ultrapure water (containing 0.04% acetic acid); Phase B, acetonitrile (containing 0.04% acetic acid).
3: The elution gradient program was as follows: 0.0010.00 min 0% B; 10.0011.00 min 95% B; 11.0011.10 min, 5% B; 11.1014 min, maintained at 5% B.
4: At 10.00 min, Bs ratio increased linearly to 95% and remained at 95% for 1 min.
5: From 11.00 to 11.10 min, Bs ratio decreased to 5% and maintained till 14 min.
6: The elution conditions were as follows: The flow rate is 0.35 mL/min; the column temperature is 40 C; the injection volume is 4 L. The mass spectrometry conditions are as follows: the electrospray ionization temperature is 550 C; the electrospray ionization temperature is 550 C. Mass spectrometer voltage, 5500 V; curtain gas 30 psi; collision induced dissociation parameters [ 58].
7: Each ion pair is scanned based on the best intersecting potential and collision energy in the triple quadrupole for detection.
8: Metabolic profiling is performed using a broad range of targeted metabolomic approaches at Wuhan Metware Biotechnology [ 59].

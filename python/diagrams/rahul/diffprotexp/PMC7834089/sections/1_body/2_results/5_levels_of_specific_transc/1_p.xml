<p>T-bet, Gata3, Ror-γ, and Foxp3 are specific transcription factors found in Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells, respectively. IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 are specific cytokines for Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, respectively [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hence, we observed the proportion variations on Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells with changes in expressions of specific transcription factors and cytokines. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4a</xref> and b, blocking CAP with vagotomy significantly reduced protein expression of Th2 cell-associated Gata3 and IL-4 as well as Treg cell-associated Foxp3 in the heart and elevated levels of Th17 cell-related Ror-γ and IL-17 as well as Th1 cell-related T-bet and IFN-γ in VMC mice on d 7 (

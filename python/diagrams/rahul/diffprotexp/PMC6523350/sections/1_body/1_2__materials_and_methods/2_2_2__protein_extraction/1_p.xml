<p>Total protein was extracted from rice grain samples. 5 g of grains powder was dissolved using 200 μL of TEAB dissolution buffer. The dissolution process was boosted up by 15 min ultrasonication (WD-9415B, LiuYi Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The dissolved mixture was then centrifuged (12,000 r/min, 20 min, at 4 °C) and the supernatant was subsided by adding 4-volume dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 mM) in cold acetone for 2 h. The suspension was centrifuged (12,000 r/min, 20 min, at 4 °C). The precipitate was collected and mixed with cold acetone (800 μL, at 56 °C) to break the proteins’ disulfide bond. The mixture was then centrifuged again (12,000 r/min, 20 min, at 4 °C) and the pellet dried. Finally, the dried pellet was collected and dissolved in dissolution buffer (100 μL Triethylamine borane) and stored at −80 °C for later use.</p>

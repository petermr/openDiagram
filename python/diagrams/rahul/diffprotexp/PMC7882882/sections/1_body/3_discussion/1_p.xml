<p>NFPAs are pituitary adenomas without clinical evidence of hormonal hypersecretion, and they have a prevalence of 7 to 41.34 cases/100,000 and an annual incidence of 0.65 to 2.34 cases/100,000, in epidemiological data from global between 1955 and 2014 (

However, compared with that in functioning pituitary adenoma, monitoring of the tumor recurrence of NFPA through specific serum hormone alterations is difficult. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a new predictive signature that could be used as a prognostic prediction model to identify early recurrence. The main purpose of the study was to divide patients into high-risk or low-risk groups so that the most effective and timely treatment can be performed for NFPA.

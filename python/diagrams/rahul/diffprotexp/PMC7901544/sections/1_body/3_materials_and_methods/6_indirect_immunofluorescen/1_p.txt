0: The LMH cells infected with viruses were fixed with pre-chilled acetone: ethanol (3:2 v/v) mixture for 5 minutes at RT and washed with PBS.
1: The cells were stained with the diluted mAb 3B5 against Fiber-1 for 45 min at 37C.
2: After washed three times with PBS, the cells were stained with the diluted second antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC) for another 45 min at 37 C. Again, after three washes with PBS, the cells were observed by invert fluorescence microscopy.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The human insulin gene (<italic>INS</italic>) is a small gene of 1,425 base pairs located on chromosome 11 and is composed of 3 exons separated by two introns (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The first exon of this gene is composed entirely of 5&#8217; untranslated sequence, with all of the coding region, which encodes the 110 amino acid long proinsulin precursor protein, distributed across exons 2 and 3 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The N-terminal portion of the proinsulin precursor protein sequence is a signal peptide that allows secretion from pancreatic beta cells and is removed by signal peptidase to yield proinsulin (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Further processing by prohormone convertase enzymes releases the internal C-peptide to produce the two-chain insulin hormone, composed of A- and B-chains linked by disulphide bridges (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The proteolytic processing of proinsulin to yield a two-chain insulin hormone contrasts with that of the insulin-like growth factors, where both are single chain peptides that retain the C-peptide-like sequences (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Insulin genes from diverse species representing multiple classes of vertebrates, including fish, frogs, and birds, have been characterized that share with the human gene a similar three exon (two coding) gene structure, and encode homologous protein sequences (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In most vertebrates only a single insulin gene has been found, however, multiple copies of this gene, including some with differing gene structures, have been found in some species.</p>

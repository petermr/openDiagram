 <caption> Grand mean spectrogram of human participant contralateral beta signal, aligned to target presentation at time zero ( A). Vertical dashed black lines from left to right denote mean reaction time and end of reach respectively. Bar charts indicate group mean beta power in each adaptation epoch for contralateral ( B) and ipsilateral ( C) motor cortex, controlling for effects of reaction time and reach duration. Datapoints linked by dashed lines represent individual participant means. ***Bonferroni corrected pairwise significance (p &lt; 0.0005) to each other epoch. *Bonferroni corrected pairwise significance (p &lt; 0.05) for comparison to baseline epoch. Baseline baseline epoch, EA early adaptation epoch, LA late adaptation epoch, EAft early aftereffect epoch, LAft late aftereffect epoch. </caption>

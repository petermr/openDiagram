0: The -Carotene bleaching test of AcEO was determined based on the standard procedure [ 41].
1: A volume of 1 ml of chloroform solution of -carotene (0.1 mg/ml) was added to a round flask containing 20 mg of acid linoleic and 200 mg of Tween 40.
2: Chloroform was completely removed at 40 C under vacuum, and 50 ml of distilled water was slowly added and vigorously shaken.
3: Three doses of AcEO and the reference standard Ascorbic acid (0.1; 1 and 2 mg/ml) were dissolved in methanol.
4: Aliquots (200 l) of AcEO and ascorbic acid were added to 5 ml of -carotene/linoleic acid emulsion.
5: A control preparation was obtained by adding 200 l of methanol to 5 ml of -carotene/linoleic acid emulsion.
6: Absorbance of the preparations was measured at 490 nm before and after 2 h of incubation in a water bath at 50 C. All trials were performed in triplicate.
7: Antioxidative activity (AA %) in percentages was calculated using the following formula: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathrm{AA}\%=\left[\frac{\left(\mathrm{As}120-\mathrm{Ac}120\right)}{\left(\mathrm{Ac}0-\mathrm{Ac}120\right)}\right] \times 100 $$\end{document}AA%=As120Ac120Ac0Ac120100

<p id="Par42">Here, we carried out a novel and complementary transcriptomic investigation overexpressing FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> in HGrC1 with its essential partner, SMAD3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] to better understand its regulation and also avoiding other inevitable pleiotropic actions of the TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1–4). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on the 717 DEGs (FOXL2
 <sup>wt</sup> vs. FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup>) revealed a clear engagement of pathways and genes related to tumorigenesis: Tissue Morphogenesis and Proliferation (MKI67, MYH9, FLNA), Regulation of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and Proteoglycans in Cancer (HSPG2, FLNC, COL4A2, COL5A1), Chromatin Remodeling with the Peptidyl-Lysine modification (SMARCA4, EP400, BAZ2A), downregulation of apoptotic pathway (ATF3, ATF4, CDKN2D, CXCL8), and PI3K/AKT pathway (AMIGO2, XBP1) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S5). Although MKI67, SMARCA4 and NF-kappaB pathway components have been described in aGCTs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] they have not previously been associated with FOXL2
 <sup>C134W</sup> or implicated as potential direct targets.

0: T. oleivorans MIL-1 (DSM 14913) was grown in sterile 160 ml Nunc Cell Culture Treated Flasks containing 100 ml of ONR7a media ( Dyksterhouse et al., 1995).
1: Cultures were enriched separately with the medium-chain alkane  n-Tetradecane ( n-C 14), or the long-chain alkane  n-Octacosane ( n-C 28), or the non-hydrocarbon control Tween 80 (0.1% w/v) ( n = 4).
2: Cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker (16C, 60 rpm) and cells were harvested in early exponential growth phase for protein extraction after 4 days.

0: DNA methylation is involved in the replication and mismatch repair, the control in gene expression, tissue-specific gene expression, transcript synthesis, signaling to host-pathogen interaction, virus resistance, gene imprinting, and epigenetic memory [ 5].
1: DNA methylation is a highly stable epigenetic mark, due to it can be maintained during the mitotic and meiotic cell division processes, such that these changes provide a mark plausible for the inheritance of metastable epigenetic traits [ 9, 10, 11].
2: In plants, DNA methylation alterations occurs as part of the response to stress factors as drought [ 12], salinity [ 7, 13], cold-stress [ 14], heat-stress, presence of heavy metals [ 15], nutriment deficit [ 16, 17], wounding [ 18], viral infection [ 19] pathogen attack [ 20] and even spaceflight [ 21].
3: Similarly, the priming with some compounds alters the DNA methylation behavior of the plant.
4: -Aminobutyric acid (BABA) [ 22] and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) [ 23] induce DNA hypermethylation, and it is suggested that it may be associated with the development of memory to enhance stress tolerance.
5: Due to this nature of the epigenetic changes, they are a potential strategy for plant breeding to obtain more adaptable crops to stress.
6: Further, it is necessary to elucidate what kind and doses of stress factors can induce an epigenomic response in the plant genome.

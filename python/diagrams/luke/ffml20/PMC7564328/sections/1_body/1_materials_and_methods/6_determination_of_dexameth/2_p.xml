<p id="p0090">DEX was determined using HPLC‒MS/MS, which consisted of an Agilent 1260 liquid chromatograph and an Agilent 6460 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). The detection by the Acquisition software (Agilent Technologies) was as follows: ESI, positive-ion mode, capillary voltage 3500 V; gas temperature 300 °C, gas flow 8 L/min; sheath gas temperature 35 °C, flow 10 L/min; Nebulizer 35 psi. The optimized precursor to product ion transition monitored for DEX was

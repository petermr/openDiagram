<p>Two main secretion pathways have been described, the classical pathway, which requires a signal peptide to be attached to the secreted protein, and the ER/Golgi-independent protein secretion pathway, also termed as non-classical secretion pathway. The latter is the preferred mechanism to translocate angiogenic growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, extracellular matrix components that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, viral proteins, and parasitic surface proteins, presumably involved in host infection [

0: Proteinprotein interaction enrichment and network generation for E12.5 DE (FDR < 0.05) gene sets was performed using STRING ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019), version 11, considering only experimentally and text mining interactions, with at least medium interaction confidence score.
1: Disconnected nodes were removed from the network.

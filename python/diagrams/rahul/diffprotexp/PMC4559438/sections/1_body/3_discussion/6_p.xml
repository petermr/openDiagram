<p>Although several markers indirectly suggest pathogenic mechanisms of congenital cholesteatoma, our study has two main limitations. First, proteomics studies have inherent limitations. The amount of expression was determined only by image analysis, which could have differed if a more delicate experimental method was used. Therefore, there could be more abundant proteins that exclusively exist in congenital cholesteatoma. In addition, we only investigated the 10 most abundant spots identified in 2-DE analysis. However, there could be more important proteins that play a larger role in congenital cholesteatoma pathogenesis. We were only able to theorize congenital cholesteatoma pathogenic mechanisms using exclusive protein expression found by proteomic analysis. However, no information was gained on the role or importance of identified proteins in pathogenesis, which require animal models and/or in vitro cell culture systems. Second, limitations arose from working with harvested tissue. Congenital cholesteatoma tissue forms a cystic pearl, which was properly washed. Therefore, there should have been little contamination from surrounding tissue. However, sample contamination by middle ear mucosa cannot be completely excluded in acquired cholesteatoma because acquired cholesteatomas are located in retraction pockets and strongly adhere to middle ear mucosa. There also could have been contamination with blood even though surface blood was removed by extensive tissue washing (5â€“6 times in normal saline until blood no longer visible).</p>

0: While genomic and transcriptomic data have yielded a lot of information, the actual functional molecules have not been clearly elucidated.
1: Proteomic study could determine functional protein networks that exist in the cell.
2: Most previous studies of  M. avium proteome was used to detect protein expression patterns in response to a specific stimulus like antibiotic usage [ 12], different environmental conditions [ 12], or under conditions mimic the infectious stages [ 13].
3: Comparative gene expression in-between strains or even in a single strain grown under different circumstances has confirmed its usefulness in recognizing mycobacterial growth and its pathogenicity determinants [ 14].
4: These studies were mainly focused on the identification and characterization of the cell wall associated proteins of  M. avium [ 15] or their secreted proteome [ 13].
5: To our knowledge, investigation of the whole proteome of  M. avium under different growth phases has not been elucidated yet.
6: It is almost established from former studies on model organisms such as  Escherichia coli and  Bacillus subtilis that the transition from the exponential phase to the stationary phase is associated with changes in the expression patterns of proteins [ 16, 17, 18].

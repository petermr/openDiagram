<p>KNG1 and SERPINC1 are located in a coagulation-associated network. To the best of our knowledge, the direct genetic interactions of KNG1 with histidine-proline rich glycoprotein (HRG) and coagulation factor XII have never been reported in previous KD studies. However, some studies have indicated that they may interact with each other in the coagulation pathway. KNG1 and HRG have similar structures and are adjacent to each other on chromosome 3, which suggests that these proteins may exhibit similar functions (

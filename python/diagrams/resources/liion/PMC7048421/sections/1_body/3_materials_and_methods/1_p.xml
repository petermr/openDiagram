<p>We fabricated 2.8-Ah pouch cells using LiNi
 <sub>0.6</sub>Co
 <sub>0.2</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (Umicore) for cathodes and graphite (Nippon Carbon) for anodes. The capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode, or NP ratio, was designed at 1.2. The 2.8-Ah pouch cell contains a stack of 20 anode and 19 cathode layers. A Celgard-2325 separator of 25 Î¼m in thickness was used. The loadings of NMC622 on the positive electrode and graphite on the negative electrode were 10.5 and 6.6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively.

<p>We seeded an average of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> B16F1 cells in complete DMEM in a sterile Petri dish (Falcon 3003). Between 10 to 12 h after sowing, we changed by fresh medium supplemented with 5-Brd-2′-dU (Sigma-Aldrich) or L-Tyr (Biomedical Inc, Clinton Township, MI, USA) at a final concentration of 2.5 µg/mL and 5 mM, respectively, and incubate for 72 h without medium change. Furthermore, we followed every 48 h for cell monitoring assay until 240 h, where 5.0 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> cells were seeded to determine population doubling times. The photomicrographs were captured under a 20x inverted light microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Kobe, Japan) using the NIS-Elements-Nikon program. The cells treated with 5-Brd-2′-dU, protected from light, were resuspended in complete medium, and the exclusion of Trypan Blue assessed the viability. Additionally, the cells from the culture supernatants recovered by centrifugation, and their viability was determined using propidium iodide (I.P.) incorporation assay in Tali™ Image-based Cytometer following the manufacturer’s specifications.

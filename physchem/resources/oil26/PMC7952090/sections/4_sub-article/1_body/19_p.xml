<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">One caveat to our decision to implement a cut-off of 80% when assigning ancestral copy numbers is the fact that a gene may be missing from ancient genomes due to coverage and assembly errors, and be called as &#8220;independently-duplicated&#8221; in Manatees and Elephants. While these events would underestimate the number of gene duplications that occurred in the Tethytherian stem lineage, they would ultimately not affect our conclusions that these tumor suppressors duplicated during an increase in body size in these two separate lineages. We address this in more depth in Point 6.</p>

0: Eukaryotes are estimated to have arisen over one and a half billion years ago  an event considered to be one of the major evolutionary transitions [ 13].
1: A consensus model is emerging [ 2], with the first eukaryotes likely evolving from within the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota (TACK) superphylum [ 4].
2: Advances in environmental sampling and sequencing have superseded earlier rRNA-based models, which proposed three domains of eukaryotic life [ 5], to firmly place eukaryotes as emerging from within the Archaea and, hence, supporting a two domain paradigm [ 2].
3: At some point following the divergence from the archaeal lineage, the protoeukaryote began to acquire features typical of eukaryotic cells, including a tubulin-based flagellum, an endomembrane system, a cytoskeleton and the mitochondrion.
4: Remarkably, this period of evolution produced a complex Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) that possessed a large diversity of compartments exceeding the complement of many extant unicellular organisms.

0: Quinoa ( Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)
1: is a pseudocereal crop with high nutritional value [ 1,  2].
2: Quinoa varieties are classified as bitter or sweet depending upon saponin content of the seed.
3: Although saponins in quinoa are highly accumulated in the seed pericarp, they are also present in lower concentrations in leaves.
4: Saponin biosynthesis in quinoa is regulated by the triterpene saponin biosynthesis activating regulator-like1 (TSARL1) gene [ 3 5].
5: Mechanical abrasion or water rinsing is typically used to remove saponin from the seed of bitter varieties [ 6,  7].
6: Because these methods are costly and reduce nutritional value of the seeds [ 6,  8], quinoa cultivars with low seed saponin content (sweet cultivars) are desired [ 9].
7: Saponins from quinoa are active against several plant pathogens including viruses and are pre-existing defense factors in other pathosystems [ 10 14].

0: In the present study, we used label-free quantitative proteomics to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in the cochlear sensory epithelium of the mouse between three different ages.
1: We collected protein samples from the cochlear sensory epithelia of P3, P14, and P30 mice, performed multi-digestion procedures, separated peptides using SCX chromatography and analyzed peptides with nano RP-LC-MS/MS.
2: Differential protein expression was determined using spectral counting and an ANOVA was used to determine significant differences in protein expression.
3: Functions for differentially expressed proteins and putative protein partners for select biomarkers were explored using bioinformatics.
4: For verification, select proteins that were differentially expressed were analyzed using immunoblotting and putative partners, determined via bioinformatics, were verified using coIP.
5: This is the first study to identify regulated proteins from the mouse cochlear sensory epithelia before, during, and after the onset of hearing.

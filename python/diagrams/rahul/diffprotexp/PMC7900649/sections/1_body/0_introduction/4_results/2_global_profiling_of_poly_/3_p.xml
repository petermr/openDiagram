<p id="Par22">We arranged the annotated 3′ UTR APA sites in tandem APA based on the stop codon and combined these data with poly(A) site profiling as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All 10,971 genes were identified to have at least one tandem poly(A) sites, among which 8,080 genes (73.65%) had two or more (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The average distance between single poly(A) sites and stop codon was about 527 bp (median: 312 bp). The median values of the distance from the stop codon to the proximal or distal poly(A) sites were 259 bp (average: 417 bp) and 1283 bp (average: 1604 bp), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). The poly(A) signals (PAS) are six-nucleotide 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements important in 3′ end processing that are located 10–30 nt upstream of the cleavage sites. To date, 12 variants of PAS have been identified, and the canonical types were AAUAAA and its main variant AUUAAA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. According to our database, the frequency of canonical PAS was around 46%. About 22% PAS were not identified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). These results reveal the detailed landscape of poly(A) site usage in IPEC-J2 cells.

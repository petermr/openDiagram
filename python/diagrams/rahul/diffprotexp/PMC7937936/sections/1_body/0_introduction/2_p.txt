0: Tumor microenvironment (TME) is the internal environment for the production and growth of tumor cells, which provides conditions for the initiation, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of the tumor.
1: It is closely related to the survival of tumor cells ( 13,  14).
2: These immune cells and related stromal components, recruited and activated by tumor cells, form a tumor-suppressive inflammatory microenvironment in the early stages of tumor colonization or growth, thereby impeding tumor progression.
3: However, after continuous tumor antigen stimulation and immune activation, the relevant effector cells in the microenvironment are in a state of depletion or remodeling.
4: They cannot perform their normal functions or even promote tumors malignant manifestation, resulting in an immunosuppressive microenvironment ( 15).
5: According to most previous studies, multiple immune cells and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment are closely associated with tumor prognosis ( 16).
6: Currently, immunotherapy has achieved great success and long-term clinical benefits in treating various types of cancer.
7: However, a significant proportion of patients still have limited or no response to immunotherapy.
8: Strong immunosuppressive TME will cause tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells exhausted and lose their ability to eliminate cancer cells, thus reducing the effect of immunotherapy ( 15).

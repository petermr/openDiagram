 </sup> with slight modifications. For the analysis of Aβ and SNCA oligomers, samples were loaded under non-reducing and non-denaturating conditions. For the analysis of the remaining proteins, the samples were resuspended in 6 × sample buffer (4 × Tris–Cl/SDS, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.6 M DTT, 0.012% bromophenol blue) under reducing conditions. Depending on the protein molecular weight, samples were loaded onto accordingly % SDS-PAGE gels. After transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), the membranes were incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered solution (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% BSA, followed by an overnight incubation with the respective primary antibodies at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The primary antibodies used were the following: 1:1,000 polyclonal anti-alpha-SNCA, oligomer specific Syn-33 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: ABN2265); 1:1,000 polyclonal anti-LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 3868); 1:16,000 monoclonal anti-acetylated α-tubulin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: T7451); 1:1,000 monoclonal anti-synaptophysin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: S5768); 1:1,000 anti-PSD95 (postsynaptic density protein 95) antibody from Abcam (Cambridge; UK) (cat number: ab18258); 1:1,000 anti-Lamp2A (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A) from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA) (cat number: ab37024); 1:750 anti-Tau Acetyl K280 from AnaSpec (Fremont, CA, USA) (cat number: AS-56077); 1:1,000 anti-Beclin1 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 3738); 1:1,000 anti-p62 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: P0067); 1:1,000 anti-Lamp1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 3243); 1:750 anti-phospho-Tau Ser396 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) (cat number: sc-101815); 1:1,000 anti-Aβ from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 8243); 1:1,000 anti-cathepsin D (CatD) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) (cat number: sc-377124); 1:1,000 anti-Hsp60 from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA, USA) (cat number: 611563); 1:1,000 monoclonal anti-Tau, clone Tau46 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: T9450); 1:1,000 anti-BiP/GRP78 (78-kDa Glucose-regulated protein) from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA, USA) (cat number: 610979); 1:1,000 anti-ATF4 (Activating transcription factor 4) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) (cat number: 97038). Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (1:10,000) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (cat number: T 6199) was used for loading control. Human brain alpha-synuclein was recognized by mass spectrometric detection. Membranes were washed with TBS containing 0.1% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween three times (each time for 10 min), and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation. After three washes, specific bands of interest were detected by developing with an alkaline phosphatase enhanced chemical fluorescence reagent (ECF from GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Fluorescence signals were detected using a Biorad Versa-Doc Imager, and band densities were determined using Quantity One Software. Membranes were revealed using Biorad Versa-Doc Imager. Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using Quantity One Software and expressed relative to alpha-tubulin. Full length blots are presented in Supplementary Information.

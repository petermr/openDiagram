<p>The present study has identified several key genes (
 <italic>CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, FYN, GRAP2</italic> and 
 <italic>ITK</italic>) which might be considered as novel and potential biomarkers of TNBC. Survival analysis and qRT-PCR validation supported the strong and robust association between the hub genes and TNBC. These results may provide a novel understanding of TNBC tumorigenesis, and further study is urgently needed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.

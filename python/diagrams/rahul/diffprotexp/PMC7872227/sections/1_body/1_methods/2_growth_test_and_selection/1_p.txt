0: In order to select suitable culture periods for transcriptome sequencing, the bacteria were cultured for 48 hours in three different medium conditions: (1) control group B (yeast extract 20 g/L); (2) ammonium group N (yeast extract 20 g/L, ammonium chloride 10 g/L); (3) urea group U (yeast extract 20 g/L, urea 5.62 g/L).
1: The urea group and the ammonium group had the same nitrogen contents.
2: The pH of the medium was adjusted to 8.8 using 1mol/L NaOH solution, which is the optimum pH for  S.  pasteurii, and the concentration of sodium ion was adjusted using 1mol/L NaCl stock solution to ensure that they were the same in the three groups.
3: Three kinds of 300mL media mentioned above were prepared and stored in 1L conical flasks, after sterilization for 20 minutes under 121C for subsequent culture usages.
4: The ammonium group and urea group should be prepared by adding solutions of urea or ammonium chloride with filtration-sterilization in advance to the sterilized medium.
5: When culturing, 3mL cell culture (from NH 4-YE medium) which had an OD 600 of 1 was centrifuged and inoculated into three different media groups respectively.
6: The OD 600 of three groups were detected every six hours with UVmini-1240 Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
7: When the OD 600 of a medium sample was greater than 0.8, it was diluted to ensure its OD 600 was between 0.2 and 0.8, and the actual OD 600 of original medium was the reading multiplied by the dilution factor.
8: It was found that both the ammonium group and the urea group showed exponential growth within 24 hours, whereas the control group had limited growth due to lack of nutrients.
9: So the sampling point at 12 hours was chosen, when the growth rate of the bacteria was fastest in the exponential growth stage.
10: Three replicates for each culture condition were sampled.

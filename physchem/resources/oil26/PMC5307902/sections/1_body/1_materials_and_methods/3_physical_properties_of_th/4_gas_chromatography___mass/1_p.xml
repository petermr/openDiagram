<p>The identification of the PaEO components was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection in Ultra GC-MS (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The autosampler was an AOC-20 series injector (Shimadzu), the gas chromatograph was a GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu), the mass spectrometer was a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu) and ion trap detector (MS, model 4000) (Shimadzu), with electron ionization-mass spectrometry (EI-MS 70 eV). The analysis was developed in a Rtx
 <sup>®</sup>-5MS (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) capillary column (Shimadzu), 30 m long, with a 0.25 mm thickness and 0.25 mm i.d. with Helium at 1 ml/min as carrier gas. Temperature program: injector at 250ºC with a column-oven from 60 to 240 ºC at 3 ºC /min. The retention index (RI) was calculated for all the volatile constituents using an n-alkane homologous series, ranging from C8 to C40, using a linear temperature programmed equation.[
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The individual components were identified by comparing the mass spectra and GC retention data with those of authentic compounds previously analyzed and stored in the database from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The interpretation of RI values was assisted by the FFNSC (Flavor and Fragrance Natural and Synthetic Compounds) Library.[

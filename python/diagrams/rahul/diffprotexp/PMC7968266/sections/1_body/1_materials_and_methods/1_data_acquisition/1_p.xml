GSE9899 included 18 ovarian LMP tumors and 267 EOC samples, GSE27651 included 8 LMP tumors and 22 EOC samples, GSE12172 comprised 30 LMP tumors and 60 EOC samples, and GSE57477 included 6 LMP tumors and 46 serous ovarian adenocarcinomas. The gene expression data of GSE9899, GSE27651 and GSE12172 were download from the platform of GPL570 (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array), whereas GSE57477’ gene expression data was download from the platform of GPL10558 (Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip).

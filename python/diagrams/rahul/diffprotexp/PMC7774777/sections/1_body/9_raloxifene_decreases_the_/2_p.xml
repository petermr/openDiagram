<p>In order to identify the factors that differ between raloxifene treated females from estrogen treated males, we compared the gene set that was upregulated by estrogen in males with the gene set upregulated by raloxifene in females. We found that 2039 genes are upregulated by raloxifene in females but not by estrogen in males (

Therefore, to validate the proteasome assembly process identified computationally, we performed native gels, which allows the catalytic particle alone to be distinguished from the assembled regulatory coreâ€“catalytic core complex. We found that raloxifene significantly stimulated the assembly of active 26S proteasome in females (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>), while estrogen in males did not (

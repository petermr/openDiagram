<p id="Par15">Through GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses, related differential mRNAs were selected for protein–protein interaction network analysis. The network was constructed using the STRING database

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. This gives an idea on the probable functional network of mRNAs that regulate ovarian growth and development. Key genes such as FSHR, CDK2, EGFR, CCNA2, CYP11A1, GDF5, STAR were detected to be hub-genes (genes with high correlation in candidate modules, thus, those with high connectivity ranked at top 10%) in the protein–protein interaction for H1 vs H3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). At the same time, STAR, INHB, INHA, CDC20 and GDF9 were the key hub-genes in H3 vs H8 protein–protein interaction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). These genes have previously been reported to play significant roles in regulating ovary growth and development
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Most of the hub-genes identified were down-regulated in the ovaries sampled.

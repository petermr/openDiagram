0: Total RNA from apical and basal spikelets of rice genotypes SR-157 and SR-159 at 0 and 5 days post-anthesis was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and was treated with DNase I (Promega) to get rid of genomic DNA contamination which was confirmed by RT PCR (treated RNA used as template, actin primer set).
1: The genomic DNA-free RNA isolated as above was reverse transcribed using QantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
2: The c-DNA prepared was used as template for qRT-PCR analysis by QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast).
3: Each gene and 18S rRNA as reference control was amplified using gene specific primers designed through Primer Blast.
4: Fold change in gene expression was calculated using 2 Ct31.
5: The data presented are mean of three replicates (n = 3).
6: The primer sequence of different ethylene and auxin related genes are given in Supplementary Table  S2.

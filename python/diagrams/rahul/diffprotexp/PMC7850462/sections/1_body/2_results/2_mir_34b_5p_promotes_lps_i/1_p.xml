<p>miR-34b-5p was up-regulated in the LPS group compared to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). After transfection of miR-34b-5p inhibitor or miR-34b-5p mimic, miR-34b-5p was successfully inhibited or overexpressed in LPS-induced HK-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). TUNEL staining showed that LPS increased the apoptosis in HK-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(C)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, vs the control group). The apoptosis rate was decreased in the LPS + inhibitor group while increased in the LPS + mimic group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(C)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, vs the LPS + inhibitor NC group and LPS + mimic NC group respectively). The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3) in HK-2 cells were detected by Western blotting. Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were increased while Bcl-2 was decreased in the LPS group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(D)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, vs the control group). The expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were down-regulated in the LPS + inhibitor group while up-regulated in the LPS + mimic group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(D)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, vs the LPS + inhibitor NC group and LPS + mimic NC group, respectively). In contrast, Bcl-2 was increased in the LPS + inhibitor group while decreased in the LPS + mimic group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(D)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, vs the LPS + inhibitor NC group and LPS + mimic NC group, respectively). TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were increased in the LPS group in comparison with the Control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(E–G)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were down-regulated in the LPS + inhibitor group while up-regulated in the LPS + mimic group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(E–G)</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, vs the LPS + inhibitor NC group and LPS + mimic NC group, respectively). The above experiment results reveal that miR-34b-5p promotes LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response in HK-2 cells.

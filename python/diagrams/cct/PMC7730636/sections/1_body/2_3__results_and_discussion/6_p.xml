<p>Lastly, we examined the dilatation curve at cooling of 0.01 °C∙s
 <sup>−1</sup>, which can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-05585-f007">Figure 7</xref>a. Up to three phase transformations occurred in this resulting structure, namely, ferritic, bainitic and martensitic. The ferritic began at 700 °C. Subsequently, a bainitic transformation began at temperature of 476 °C. The start of the martensitic transition did not occur until 158 °C. Final microstructure comprised bainite matrix with polygonal ferrite and a very small amount of martensite (

<p>Electrochemical tests were carried out in CR 2032 coin cells with lithium metal as the reference and counter electrode. Seventy percent active materials, 20% carbon black and 10 % PVDF were evenly mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to form the cathode slurry. The active material loading was controlled at about 2 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (V
 <sub>eth</sub>: V
 <sub>die</sub> 1:1) was used as electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were performed by using a multichannel battery tester (Neware BTS-610) in a voltage window of 0–3.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry curves (CV) were carried out on a PARSTAT 4,000 electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> in the range of 3.0–0.01 V(vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested in the frequency range of 100 kHz−0.01 Hz.

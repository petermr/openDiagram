<p>The distribution of the spot maps on the principal component analysis (PCA) plot given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-14-04912">Figure 3a</xref> shows that the most important differences were found between the samples of 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> and Désirée (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-14-04912">Figure 3a</xref>; the X axis differentiates the species), irrespective of the treatment. In order to better consider differences among different treatments, the spot maps from each species were processed separately. PCA analysis of the spot maps from 
 <italic>S. commersonii</italic> resulted in the separation of three groups: Control, Cold and Sucrose plus Sorbitol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-14-04912">Figure 3b</xref>). The spot maps corresponding to Désirée can be separated into two clear groups: control and the stress treatments (

0: Procedure for nascent RNA isolation, preparation of RNA-Seq libraries, and massively parallel sequencing was previously described 66.
1: Briefly, 10 8 Kasumi-1 cells were treated with 500 M 4-thiouridine for 1 h. Cells were lysed using TRI Reagent  (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) and RNA was purified according to the manufacturers instruction.
2: Next, 4-thiouridine-incorporated RNA was biotinylated by labeling with 1 mg/ml Biotin-HPDP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 90 min at room temperature.
3: Following chloroform extraction, labeled RNA was separated using magnetic streptavidin beads, beads were washed, and RNA was eluted in two rounds of elution with 100 l 100 mM DTT.
4: Finally, RNA was purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq TM 2000 paired-end sequencing.

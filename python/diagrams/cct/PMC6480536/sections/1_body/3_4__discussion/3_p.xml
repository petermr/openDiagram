 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01070-f008">Figure 8</xref> indicates that the diffusion capacity of Mn is promoted significantly with the increase in temperature. Mn diffusion distance within 3 min increased from 0.27 μm to 4.2 μm as the temperature rose from 1000 °C to 1200 °C. However, the diffusion distance reached up to 4.5 μm in just 10 s at 1400 °C. Improvement in the Mn diffusion capacity contributed to the development of MDZ of higher degrees and increased the AF nucleation ability [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-01070" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. At low austenitizing temperatures under 1000 °C, Mn diffusion and MDZ formation were difficult, while austenite grains were much finer. This caused the grain boundaries to act as active nucleating sites while inclusions were ineffective. With high austenitizing temperatures above 1250 °C, the coarse austenite grain size and MDZ formation together promoted AF transformation. Meanwhile, Shim et al. also reported that Ti

 <sub>3</sub> particles do not become effective nucleation sites for acicular ferrite at low austenitization temperatures [

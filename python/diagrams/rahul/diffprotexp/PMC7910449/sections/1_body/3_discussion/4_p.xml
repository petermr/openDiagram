 </sup>. CircFoxo3 interacts with p21 and CDK2 protein, promoting p21-induced CDK2 suppression and hence suppressing the progression of cell cycle in the G1 phase

 </sup>. CircRNA cia-cGAS maintains host homeostasis by interacting with nuclear cGAS and blocking its enzymatic activity

 </sup>. This study showed that circRAB11FIP1 promoted DSC1-dependent autophagy. Desmocollin-1 was involved in mediating cellâ€“cell adhesion. Its expression increased in breast cancer and was associated with breast cancer cell migration and metastasis

 </sup>. This study was novel in reporting that DSC1 was related to autophagy. The study demonstrated that ATG101 played an important role in autophagy initiation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. It was found that circRAB11FIP1 was bound to DSC1 to facilitate its interaction with ATG101. The data indicated that circRAB11FIP1 promoted autophagy dependent on DSC1 and ATG101.

<p>To reduce the complexity of single-cell transcriptomics analyses using a combination of specific computational tools for scRNA-seq analysis, we developed DIscBIO as a step-wise approach. It is available as an R package, Jupyter notebook and Binder cloud version. This makes it a convenient tool for a variety of researchers to facilitate the exploration of their scRNA-seq data. The open, versatile and dynamic structure of DIscBIO enables users with programming skills to fully edit the pipeline and extend it to include other methods. Furthermore, and due to its sequential narrative design and explanatory structure, DIscBIO can be used for teaching and training purposes. Using DIscBIO we were able to identify the CTCs with highly aggressive characteristics of invasion and metastasis in breast cancer and also gain insights about the link between the alterations of the Golgi apparatus and cancer progression. Furthermore, DIscBIO enabled us to identify a small subset of cells with possible aggressive and stem-like properties in myxoid liposarcoma.</p>

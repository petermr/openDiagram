<p>The proteome array was performed on customized chip-based arrays provided on glass-slides, according to the manufacturers’ procedures with minor modifications (RayBio technology; Norcross, CA). Each glass-slide (array) comprised 14 identical subarrays containing 60 biomarkers assembled on demand. The scheme of each chip is reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a. Inter-assay normalization was conducted by including multiple positive markers and negative controls for each sub-array. The minimum sensitivity range for detection of each protein varied, ranging from 3.8 to 56 pg/mL.

<p>Tumor tissues and control tissues were fixed with formalin, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 5-μm-thick continuous sections. After dewaxing and hydration, the sections were infiltrated with closed permeabilization solution for 30 min, washed three times with 0.01 mol/L PBS for 3 min each time, blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h, and treated with anti-
 <italic>CCR8</italic> antibody (ZENBIO, No. 860154) or anti-
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> antibody (Bioss, Bs-15356R) (diluted to 1:250) in 4°C overnight incubation. After a brief wash with PBS, the antibody was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500) for 2 h, and the staining was then developed with 0.003% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.03% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in 0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl. The staining was observed, the dye was poured off, and the color development time was controlled for about 3 to 10 min. The neutral resin was used to seal the slices and then observed and photographed under the microscope. For the quantification, 10 non-overlapping cortical section at a magnification of 400× (high power field, HPF) were counted using Image-pro plus software. Multiple t-test was used to evaluate the difference between tumor and normal samples. The statistical threshold was set at 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05.

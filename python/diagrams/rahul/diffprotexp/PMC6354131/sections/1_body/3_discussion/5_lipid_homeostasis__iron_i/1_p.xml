<p id="p0115">APOL1 (apolipoprotein L1) plays a role in lipid exchange and transport throughout the body, and it is involved in reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral cells to the liver. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.

 <italic>C</italic>-reactive protein (CRP) levels was reported as well as a positive association of apoptotic neutrophil count with ApoL1 and 2 mRNA levels. The degree of neutrophil apoptosis in critically ill patients is therefore correlated with modified expression levels of ApoLs.

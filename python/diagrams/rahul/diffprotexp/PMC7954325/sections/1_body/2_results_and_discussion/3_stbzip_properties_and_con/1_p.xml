<p>Analysis of structure and divergence using the MEME tool led to the identification of a total of 10 motifs in all the 90 StbZIPs (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247864.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The basic leucine zipper domain of motif 1 is commonly present in all the StbZIP proteins. Besides group D, motif 1 to 6 is present in all the groups. Groups A, B, C, F, G, and I share motifs 1, 7, 8, and 9. Present results show that StbZIPs share similar sequences and are clustered in the same group. Prior studies reported that monocots usually have more bZIP and motifs than the others [

 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, in potato, these bZIPs were grouped into ten groups (lacking less members in group U) based on functional annotation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247864.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The StbZIP proteins from a similar group had the same motifs arranged in the same order (

<p id="p0195">We measured multiple omic data—transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic—in liver and skeletal muscle of WT and 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice during a fasting state and identified differentially expressed molecules that significantly changed in 
 <italic>ob</italic>/
 <italic>ob</italic> mice relative to WT in each omic layer and connected these layers with differential regulations. From this large set of data, we extracted differentially expressed molecules and differential regulations that are involved in metabolic reactions and constructed a trans-omic network for liver and a network for skeletal muscle of the differentially regulated metabolic reactions. By integrating the trans-omic networks in liver and skeletal muscle with metabolomic data from blood, we explored the potential mechanisms of dysfunction of three inter-organ metabolic cycles: glucose-alanine, glucose-lactate, and ketone bodies.

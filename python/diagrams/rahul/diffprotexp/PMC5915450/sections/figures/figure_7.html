 <caption> Force decomposition into electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the nascent chains and ERY or the ribosome in the simulations in which non-bonded interactions are turned on as residues enter the exit tunnel. ( A) Non-bonded interaction force at F max between ErmCL’s residues ERY or the ribosome. ( B) Non-bonded interaction force at F max between H-NS’s residues and ERY or the ribosome. Above each data point the ‘+/−’ signs indicate, on average, whether the force was attractive or repulsive, respectively. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. </caption>

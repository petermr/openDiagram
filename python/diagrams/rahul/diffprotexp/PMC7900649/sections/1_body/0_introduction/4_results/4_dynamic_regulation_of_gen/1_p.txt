0: In addition to measuring tandem 3 UTR APA variety, SAPAS method could also be used for digital gene expression analysis [ 19].
1: We identified 912, 260, 786, 568, 58, 244 and 163 differentially expressed genes at 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 hpi, respectively (Fig.
2: 4a), among which 638 genes were up-regulated, 311 genes were down-regulated and 728 genes were dynamically regulated at different time points (Fig.
3: 4b).
4: These DEGs were clustered into cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus and other biological process, few genes were involved in immune system process (Fig.
5: 4c).
6: After the pathway enrichment, metabolic pathways, RNA transport, ribosome, biosynthesis of antibiotics, cell cycle and protein processing in ER pathways were enriched with highly significant  p values (Fig.
7: 4d).
8: Furthermore, we found that some noteworthy pathways among these DEGs, such as TGF-beta signaling pathway, RNA transport and degradation, p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle and adherens junction (Fig.
9: 4d).

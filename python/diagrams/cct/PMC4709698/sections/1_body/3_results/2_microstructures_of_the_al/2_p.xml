 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a–e</xref> proves that the morphology of the dendrites changes with cooling rate. The faster the cooling, the finer the dendrites become. In the case of the ingot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>) the dendrite arms are almost circular in the cross-sectional cut. Based on these micrographs we analyzed the particle size and crystalline volume fraction as a function of cooling rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). In this work, “particle size” refers to the diameters of the secondary dendrite arms as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> to facilitate the comparison. The average particle sizes gradually increases from 1.6 ± 0.7 μm (ϕ2 mm) to 3 ± 0.9 μm (ϕ6 mm) to 5 ± 0.9 μm (ϕ10 mm) to 8.5 ± 1.3 μm (ϕ20 mm) and eventually to 15 ± 1.5 μm in the case of the 100 g ingot. The volume fractions (for the conversion please see Methods) of β-Ti in the ϕ2 mm and ϕ6 mm rods are about 41.7 ± 1.5% and 48.5 ± 1.5%, respectively. While the crystalline volume fraction initially increases it remains constant within the experimental uncertainty for the rods with a diameter of 10 mm and 20 mm as well as for the 100 g ingot (52.5 ± 0.9 vol.%). This suggests that only coarsening of the β-Ti dendrites occurs above a critical cooling rate.

<p>H9C2 were cultured under different conditions, digested by trypsin and resuspended. 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded into the 6-well plate, respectively. After 24 h of cell culture, the medium was replaced with DMEM medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for further culture for 24 h. The diameters of cardiomyocytes were measured by eyepiece microscale. 6 cardiomyocytes with clear morphology were randomly selected from each group to measure the cell diameter by two experimenters independently. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

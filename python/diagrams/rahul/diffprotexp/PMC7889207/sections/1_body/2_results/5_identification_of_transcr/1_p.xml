<p>To explore the functional significance of the investigated CpG sites, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis was conducted to identify potential transcription factors that bind these regions. Transcription factor binding site prediction identified putative binding sites for NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2-1), E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F-1), Wilmsâ€™ tumour protein 1 (WT1 I) and GC-Rich Sequence DNA-Binding Factor (GCF) (

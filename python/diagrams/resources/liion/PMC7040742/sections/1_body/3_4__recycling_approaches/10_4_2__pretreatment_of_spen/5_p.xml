<p>After pretreatment, the active material could take different forms according to the degree of liberation achieved. This is indicated in the “Leach Feed” columns in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Tables S1, S3, S5, S7, and S9</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Supplementary Materials</xref>). Therefore, we propose the following scenarios depending on the state of the leach feed material:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Combination of anode and cathode; the feed material comprises Cu and Al current collectors, graphite from the anode, carbon from the cathode, PVDF (or other plastic binder), and cathodic active material;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Cathode only; the feed material includes Al, C, PVDF, and active material;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Black mass; Al and Cu are removed mechanically or manually up-stream or dissolved in strong alkaline media, but PVDF and conductive carbon remain in the black mass. Generally, the anode is first separated from the cathode;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Active material; either the binder material (mostly PVDF) is dissolved in solvent or is thermally degraded prior to leaching. In the latter case, the temperature of the thermal treatment determines the degree of degradation of PVDF and conductive carbon;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Calcined black mass; active material has been subjected to high temperature in oxidizing environment, and consequently the binder and carbon burned, and the inorganic compounds were oxidized.</p>
  </list-item>

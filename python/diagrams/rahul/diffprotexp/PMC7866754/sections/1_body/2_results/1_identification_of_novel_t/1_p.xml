<p id="Par35">Using the HISAT2-StringTie [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] workflow to align the RNA-seq reads to reference genome and assemble into full length transcripts, a total of unique 7844 transcripts were detected, with 4727 and 4431 canonical transcripts identified in oocyst sporozoite (oo-spz) and salivary gland sporozoite (sg-spz) stages, respectively, which are comparable with the results reported by Lindner et al. (3535 and 3575). The log transformed fold changes of the canonical transcripts also correlate reasonably well with their data (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4a), with a correlation coefficient of − 0.533, where the negative correlation is caused by the stages being compared (oo-spz:sg-spz vs sg-spz:oo-spz). An addition of 2045 transcripts were also identified, which are assembled from reads that could not be explained by canonical transcripts (with “MSTRG” transcript prefix). These potentially novel transcripts were then classified into different categories based on their comparison with the overlapped reference genes as described in “
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). From the MSTRG transcripts, 780 and 790 transcripts were predicted to contain 3′ and 5′ UTR regions that are unseen in canonical transcripts along with 326 transcripts with retained introns. In addition, 41 antisense transcripts and 427 intergenic transcripts were detected. Identification of AltORFs requires translational evidence and are, therefore, not applicable. The high abundance of transcripts from the UTR and intergenic regions agrees with a recent study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] that reported nearly 90% of the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome is being actively transcribed. Together, these results demonstrated the possibility of identifying nORFs in untranslated regions that could not have been possible using traditional methods, which might have biological functions given their transcriptional potential. The gene boundaries also need to be re-defined to take the regions outside coding sequence into consideration.

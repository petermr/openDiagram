<p id="Par21">To compare the effects of DCVC across time (6 vs. 12 h), dose (10 µM vs. 20 µM DCVC), or model system (villous explants vs. HTR-8/SVneo), differential gene expression patterns were tested for correlation. Across all genes tested, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated and linear regression models were fitted. Comparisons were tested within each time point between non-treated controls and 10 or 20 µM DCVC using logFC values for 12,855 genes. Likewise, comparisons were tested between non-treated controls and each DCVC concentration for 6 or 12 h of exposure, also using log FC values for 12,855 genes. Lastly, comparisons were tested between placental villous explants and HTR-8/SVneo cells each exposed to 20 µM DCVC for 12 h using logFC values for 11,912 commonly expressed genes.</p>

<p>To elucidate the roles of the N-terminal 1–40aa in Fiber-2 interacted with KPNA3/4 in viral replication and pathogenesis of FAdV-4, a 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAdV-4 virus-carrying Fiber-2 without N-terminal 7–40aa, designated as FAV4_Del, was rescued by the co-transfection of two sgRNAs targeting the EGFP and 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>, and the donor plasmid into LMH cells followed by the infection of FAdV4-EGFP as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4a</xref>. The rescued FAV4_Del was then purified by several limiting dilution and plaque assay. The purified FAV4_Del was confirmed by PCR, sequencing and western blot. As described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4b</xref>, the single and specific band for FAV4_Del could be amplified from the purified FAV4_Del whereas two bands (the small band for FAV4_Del and the large band for FAdV4-EGFP) could be amplified in the unpurified FAV4_Del. Sequencing further confirmed that the 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAV4_Del was exactly the same as designed (Data not shown) which carrying the deletion of N-terminal 7–40aa in its Fiber-2. Western blot assay also showed that the molecular weight of Fiber-2 expressed in LMH cells infected with FAV4_Del was slightly smaller than that of the full-length Fiber-2 expressed in LMH cells infected with the wild type FAdV-4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4c</xref>). All these data clearly demonstrate that the 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAV4_Del with the deletion of 7–40aa in Fiber-2 is efficiently generated and purified. To further evaluate whether the KPNA3/4 could interact with FAV4-Del through the truncated Fiber-2, LMH cells infected with FAdV-4 and FAV4-Del, respectively, were lysed and immunoprecipitated by antibodies against KPNA3 or KPNA4, respectively, and then detected with mAb 1 C9 against Fiber-2. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>, only the Fiber-2 in the cells infected with FAdV-4, but not in cells infected with FAV4-Del could be efficiently immunoprecipitated by antibodies against KPNA3 or KPNA4, highlighting that KPNA3/4 can not interact with the 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAV4-Del through the truncated Fiber-2.

<p>Transcriptome sequencing aims at the set of all transcripts, including mRNAs, rRNA, tRNA, and other noncoding RNAs, produced in one or a population of cells in a specific developmental stage or physiological condition [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study, using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we screened a number of differential genes in the small intestinal tissue of Kazakh sheep after infection with 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>. In terms of their functions, we concluded that innate immune response plays the first defense role in CE resistance in sheep. In addition, adaptive immune response played an important role in defense against 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infection. Moreover, our study revealed that metabolic changes contribute to defense against 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infection. These findings laid the foundation for a discussion of the molecular mechanism of Kazakh sheep resistance to 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic>.

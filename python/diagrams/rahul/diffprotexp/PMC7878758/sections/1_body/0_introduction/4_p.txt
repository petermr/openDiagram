0: In this research, we sought to study the molecular mechanisms of lost tail regeneration process during wound healing and initiation of repair mechanism stage (0-dpa, 1-dpa, 2-dpa, and 5-dpa).
1: The 15-dpa stage would shed light on involvement of genes or proteins during wound healing and initiation of proliferation/activation of multiple cells initiating blastema formation which eventually leads to the regeneration of tail.
2: The initial stages (i.e.
3: wound healing) are responsible for wound epithelium and initiating apical epidermal cap (AEC) in amphibians which regulates blastema formation 4 whereas in lizards- similar to AEC an uncertain apical epidermal PEG(AEP) 33 forms.
4: Though, during the initial stages, the activity of the molecules regulating the regeneration process is not known which is crucial to instigate the replacement of the lost tissue.
5: The study of prelude stages of regeneration has been carried out in zebrafish caudal fin 34; other species 35 and shown changes in the regulation of genes or proteins.
6: However, this stage-specific study has not been carried out in this species- and it is necessary for deciphering the crucial molecules which kick starts the regenerative mechanism in these amniotes.
7: Here, we list out the involvement of crucial genes or proteins and their differential expression associated with the molecular processes in tail regeneration through transcriptome and proteome approaches.

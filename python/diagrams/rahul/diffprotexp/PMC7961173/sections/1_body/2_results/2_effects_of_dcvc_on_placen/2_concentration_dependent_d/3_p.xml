<p id="Par32">Genes differentially expressed by 6-h DCVC treatment were also enriched in pathways, as identified by GSEA. Although 6 h DCVC treatment yielded no pathways that were upregulated with 10 µM DCVC, two pathways were downregulated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). Treatment with 20 µM DCVC upregulated one pathway and downregulated six pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). Of the six downregulated pathways, four were involved in embryonic development, the most common category. Representative pathways in this category include epithelial-mesenchymal transition (NES = − 1.97, FDR = 0.001) and myogenesis (NES = − 1.79, FDR = 0.004). Other categories represented among downregulated pathways included immune response (2) proliferation (1) and cellular organization (1). The overall pattern of pathways affected by DCVC treatment for 6 h consisted primarily of the downregulation of pathways associated with embryonic development.

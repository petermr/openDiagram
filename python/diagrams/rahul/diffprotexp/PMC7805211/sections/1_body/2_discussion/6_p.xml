<p id="Par17">Our work extends these important findings by identifying alternative exon utilization as a potential epigenetic regulatory mechanism for the MKK3/ p38 signaling axis. MKK3/p38 is a critical pathway that couples RAS-mediated growth and proliferation with inflammation (e.g., EGR1) and chromatin remodeling (e.g., SWI-SNF). More broadly, these data strongly point towards epigenetic control of RAS signaling fates downstream of NF1. We propose a schema where p38 activation in response to cellular stress and cytokine signaling inputs is reinforced in CNFs, whereas PNFs appear to signal predominantly through RAS/MEK/ERK leading to growth and proliferation (Fig.

It is important to note, however, that crosstalk between the MKK3/p38 and RAS/MAPK signaling pathways has not been extensively studied. Prior work suggests a potential inhibitory role for RAS/ERK in mitigating p38-mediated inflammation [

Interestingly, p38 is not typically activated in response to mitogenic stimuli, but we observed a high degree of correlation between phospho-p38 and phospho-ERK expression. These results suggest that differential methylation may enhance crosstalk between MKK3/p38 and RAS/ERK leading to mixed signaling effects in the context of NF1 deficiency.

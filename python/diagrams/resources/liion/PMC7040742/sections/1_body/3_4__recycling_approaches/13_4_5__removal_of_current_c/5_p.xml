<p>For the direct recycling method, the thermal treatment is performed under inert atmosphere to avoid the oxidation of the active material. Gaabour studied the decomposition of PVDF and poly (ethylene oxide) mixed with carbon nanotubes under N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere and demonstrated that PVDF underwent carbonization from 300 to 500 Â°C [

 <xref rid="B98-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. According to Kim et al., the carbonization of the binder during the thermal treatment of LFP black mass in N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere increased the electrical conductivity of the active material and enhanced its electrochemical performance [

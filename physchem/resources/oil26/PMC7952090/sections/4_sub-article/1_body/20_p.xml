<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We acknowledge that there may be &#8220;ghost&#8221; duplication events, ie., genes that duplicated in, for example, the Tethytherian stem-lineage that are maintained in the Stellar&#8217;s sea cow genome and lost in the manatee genome; This will be reconstructed as a Proboscidean-specific gene duplication. Without genomes from multiple extinct Sirenian and Hyracoidea lineages we are not able to differentiate these alternate duplication histories. We have added a note to our Materials and methods section &#8220;Reconstruction of Ancestral Copy Numbers&#8221; to ensure this limitation of the method is clear.</p>

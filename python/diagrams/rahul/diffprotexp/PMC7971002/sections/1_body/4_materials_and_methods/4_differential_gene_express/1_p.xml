<p id="Par33">A correlation analysis was also performed between miRNAs and mRNAs. If the correlation between any two pair is &gt; 0.9 between candidate miRNAs and the putative targets, the gene was considered as the correct target of the miRNA. These links between novel miRNAs and mRNAs were further illustrated by the functional networks of the miRNA-mRNA pairs. Functional enrichment analyses were performed using the Gene Ontology (GO)

 </sup> databases. In the GO analysis, genes and gene products covered by three domains are described in a controlled vocabulary: molecular function, cell component and biological process. In this study, GO categories were applied to understand the potential roles of DEGs and miRNA target genes

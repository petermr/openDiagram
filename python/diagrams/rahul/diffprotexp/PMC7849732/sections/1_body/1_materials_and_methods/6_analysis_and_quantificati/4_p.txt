0: To measure the GluN2 subunit distribution across the mediolateral axis, we placed oval-shaped selections (40 x 100m) along the most marginal edge of the CGRP+ region in the medial, central, and lateral regions of either the left or right dorsal horn.
1: The medial and lateral ovals were positioned approximately at the corners where the dorsal horn curves medially and laterally, whereas the central oval was positioned at the midline of the SDH mediolateral axis.

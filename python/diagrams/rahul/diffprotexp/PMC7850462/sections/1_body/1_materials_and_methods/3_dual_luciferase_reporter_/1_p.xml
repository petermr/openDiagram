<p>The binding site between miR-34b-5p and AQP2 was predicted by the online software Jefferson (

Wild and mutated sequences of the binding site on AQP2 (mut-AQP2 and wt-AQP2) were designed and synthesized according to the prediction. The sequences were inserted into vectors (pGL3-Basic, Promega, MADISON, WI, USA) and then co-transfected with miR-34b-5p mimic or the corresponding negative control into HEK293T cells. Luciferase intensity in the cells was tested using a dual-luciferase reporter kit (Promega) for determining the binding between miR-34b-5p and AQP2. The HEK293T cells were divided into mimic + mut-AQP2 group, mimic + wt-AQP2 group, mimic NC + mut-AQP2 group, and mimic NC + wt-AQP2 group. The assay was performed in triplicate.

 <italic>solium</italic> cysticerci. To achieve this, the supernatants of five cysticercus cultures were analyzed by two-dimensional gels. While similar protein patterns were observed in all cultures, the number and distribution of spots was different for each cysticercus culture.

 <italic>solium</italic> is known to release proteins to manipulate the environment in its host, promoting survival, immunomodulation, and pathogenesis. Secreted proteins can be different, depending on the environmental conditions faced by each cyst [

0: Transcriptome diversity and their connections with critical biological processes have been investigated in multiple cancer types, among which non-coding RNAs took a large part ( Kahles et al., 2018;  Hua et al., 2019;  Li et al., 2019).
1: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are >200 nt RNA molecules with limited protein-coding capability, which have been once considered as transcriptional noises ( Du et al., 2013;  Cech and Steitz, 2014;  Iyer et al., 2015).
2: Studies have shown that lncRNAs exert their biological functions through various ways, including miRNA sponges ( Hansen et al., 2013;  Yuan et al., 2014;  Marchese et al., 2017), decoys to bind proteins ( Carpenter et al., 2013;  Qian et al., 2016), scaffolds or guides to regulate protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions ( Engreitz et al., 2013;  Lee et al., 2016).
3: LncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in human cancers ( Iyer et al., 2015;  Niknafs et al., 2016;  Li S. et al., 2018;  Li Z. et al., 2018), including prostate cancer ( Hua et al., 2018,  2019).
4: In particular, down-regulation of UCA1 (urothelial carcinoma associated 1) inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cells by modulating MYO6 through sponging miR-143 ( Yu et al., 2020).
5: Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is among the key factors impacting the treatment response, especially immunotherapy ( Fridman et al., 2017;  Mouw et al., 2017;  Thorsson et al., 2018).
6: The infiltrated abundance of cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes within tumor microenvironment has shown prognostic and clinical implications in multiple cancer types ( Fridman et al., 2017).
7: A variety of immunogenomic features have been shown to contribute to influencing TIME, including tumor mutation burden and DNA damage repair defects ( Bryant et al., 2017;  Vitkin et al., 2019).
8: Among genitourinary malignancies, prostate cancer shows unique TIME profiles with different features of infiltrated immune cell populations and immunogenomic features ( Dallos and Drake, 2018;  Vitkin et al., 2019).
9: Through integrated analysis of lncRNA and immune features across 33 different cancer types,  Li Y. et al.
10: (2020) demonstrated that lncRNAs were closely interacted with immune-related pathways and infiltrated immune cells in cancer.
11: However, the landscape of aberrant lncRNAs and their interactions with immune features in prostate cancer have not been characterized.

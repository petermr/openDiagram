This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use &amp; Welfare Committee of Institute of Basic Medical Sciences (Permit Number: ACUC-A02-2011-046). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

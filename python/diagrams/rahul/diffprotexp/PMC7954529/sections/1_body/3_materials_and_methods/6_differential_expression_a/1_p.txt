0: We generated unstranded RNA-seq libraries using the Illumina TruSeq Total RNA kit according to the manufacturers instructions using the total mRNA collected from all 12 individuals (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
1: We sequenced RNA-seq libraries at the University of Chicago Genomics Core facility using the single-end 50 bp protocol on one lane of the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine.
2: RNA quality and concentration at the time of library prep and number of sequenced reads per library are available in  Supplementary file 5.
3: We mapped the human libraries to GRhg38 ( Schneider et al., 2017) and chimpanzee libraries to panTro6 ( Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005) and quantified reads mapping to orthologous exons.

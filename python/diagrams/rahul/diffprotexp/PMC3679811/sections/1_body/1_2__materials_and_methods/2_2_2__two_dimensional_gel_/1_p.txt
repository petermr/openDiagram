0: The protein in the peritoneal dialysates (containing 120  g protein) was precipitated with 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in acetone.
1: The precipitates were washed with acetone three times and dissolved in an isoelectric focusing (IEF) rehydration buffer for 2DE analysis.
2: IEF strips (pH 310, IPGphor, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) were developed through a stepwise incremental voltage program: 30 V for 16 hr, 500 V for 1 hr, 1000 V for 1 hr, and 8000 V for 4 hr, with a total power of 34 kV hr.
3: Then the strips were subjected to a two-step equilibration in buffers: the first step containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) with 1% w/v dithiothreitol (DTT, Affymetrix/USB, 15395) and for the second step, with 2.5% w/v iodoacetamide (IAA, Amersham Biosciences, RPN6302V).
4: The strips were then transferred onto the second-dimensional SDS-PAGE equipment and developed on 1.0 mm thick gradient (816%) polyacrylamide gels at 10C.

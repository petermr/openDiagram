 <caption> Immunofluorescence analysis of nitrogenase iron protein (NifH) in filaments of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 under nitrogen deprivation and nitrogen-replete condition. (A1-A4) Filaments only consisting of vegetative cells under nitrogen-replete condition. A1, vegetative cells under white light; A2 and A3, vegetative cells was excited at 365 nm (DAPI excitation wavelength) and 488 nm (FITC excitation wavelength) respectively; A4, merged imagine of A2 and A3. (B1-B4) Filaments consisting of vegetative cells and heterocysts under nitrogen deprivation condition. B1, vegetative cells and heterocysts under white light; B2 and B3, vegetative cells and heterocysts were excited at 365 nm and 488 nm respectively; B4, merged imagine of B2 and B3. Double fluorescent labeling were used in the experiment. DAPI was used to visualize the DNA, and FITC was used to visualize NifH. DAPI, 4â€™, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FITC, fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate. In B1-B4, arrows show locations of heterocysts; the large square frame is an enlarged view of the small square frame. </caption>

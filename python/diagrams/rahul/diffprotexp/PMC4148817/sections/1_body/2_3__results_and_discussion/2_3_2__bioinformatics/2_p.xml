<p>Due to the remarkable overlap of protein expression changes between MWCNT and SWCNT afterthe 100 ng/mL exposure, the predicted canonical pathways, upstream regulators, and biological functions were nearly identical. Within identical or similar functions, Venn Diagrams were used to demonstrate the overlap between MWCNT and SWCNT exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-01-00219-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Some functions had different annotations assigned by the software, but they were in similar categories, so they were also compared. For example, in the only category with increased function, cell death, 40 of the 44 proteins mapped to “cell death of tumor cell lines” after exposure to MWCNT. These proteins were also part of the 87 proteins mapped to “cell death” after exposure to SWCNT. Regarding decreased function, all the five proteins in the category “quantity of intercellular junctions” were significantly decreased after exposure to either of the CNTs. Because there was so much overlap between biological activities resulting from Calu-3 cell exposure to MWCNT and SWCNT, we focused on those proteins that were differentially expressed in both exposures. IPA analysis of these 231 proteins was used to assign canonical pathways and upstream regulators significantly associated with them.

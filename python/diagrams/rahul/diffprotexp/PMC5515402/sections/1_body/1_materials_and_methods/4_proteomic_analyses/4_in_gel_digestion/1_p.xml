<p>Spots picked from 2D-DIGE preparative gel were washed at RT with 200 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution for 1 h. Gel pieces were dried and then incubated with trypsin overnight digestion at 37°C. Resulting peptides were extracted using a mixture of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Samples were dried and resuspended in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. All samples were desalted and purified using C18 ZipTips (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations and resuspended in 2% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid prior to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.</p>

<p id="Par42">The up-regulation of genes for photosynthetic enzymes, MAPK pathway, transcription factors, transporter proteins, antioxidative enzymes, cell membrane proteins and enzymes for synthesis of compatible solutes with increasing levels of salinity suggested the reasons for salt tolerance ability of halophyte 
 <italic>Urochondra</italic>. This study will be instrumental in understanding the putative role of genes involved in salt stress response in other grasses. Future investigation using functional validation tools will aid to identify the individual role of these genes, their mechanisms, pathways involved and application in the field for developing salt tolerant genotypes. The de novo transcriptome generated in this study will provide a useful source of reference sequence. The information generated here will additionally contribute to the biology of halophytes and expand the corresponding knowledge within the plant kingdom. Additionally, this work identifies potential genes involved in salt tolerance in STGs which can be used as donors for other halophytes or grasses such as cereal crops.

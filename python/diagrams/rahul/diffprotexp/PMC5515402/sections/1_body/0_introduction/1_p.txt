0: The anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are synthetic derivatives of testosterone, created to provide anabolic potency and low androgenic effect [ 1].
1: While most users abuse AAS to improve physical performance, nearly all of them are unaware of the numerous side effects that can be associated with androgen misuse [ 2].
2: Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, liver dysfunction and psychiatric disorders are some of those well- documented problems [ 2, 3].
3: Similarly, under the influence of AAS, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is one of the most affected body systems [ 4, 5].
4: The neural control of this axis resides within the hypothalamus, which is characterized by the expression of high levels of androgen and estrogen receptors (AR and ER) [ 6].
5: The medial preoptic area (mPOA) is a steroid-sensitive hypothalamic region, that is populated by neurons expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) [ 7].
6: Indeed, GnRH neurons respond to fluctuations of gonadal steroids, which result in neuroplasticity changes leading to pulsatile secretion of this peptide.
7: In vivo and  in vitro studies have shown that exposure to steroids is associated with alterations on GnRH expression and secretion.
8: For instance, studies in rodents [ 8], and cells [ 9, 10] showed that exposure to either androgens or estrogens reduced GnRH transcripts.

<p>Group C (34 proteins) includes several proteins associated with lipid biosynthetic processes (e.g., sphingolipid, fatty acid biosynthesis) and proteins targeting to the ER; however, majority of proteins in this group are annotated as hypothetical or putative gene products. Several proteins are trypanosome-specific, represented by 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> in our analysis, including a putative 
 <italic>trans</italic>-sialidase (Tb927.5.440), a SUMO-interacting motif containing protein (Tb927.8.1290) and three hypothetical proteins (Tb927.3.5350, Tb927.8.6380 and Tb927.10.8160 with experimental evidence of localization to the NE and ER [

 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Overall, the frequency of Euglenozoa-specific proteins is comparable to the results of searches using metazoan NEA protein queries.

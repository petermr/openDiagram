<p>In the present study, we observe that TNFα stimulus certainly affects a spectrum of protein expression in human HCC cell line HepG2, which may contribute to potential cellular responses involving in the resistance of cell death and the promotion of cell migration and survival. To diminish the biological and experimental variation, we use consecutive passages of HepG2 cells and confirm the protein profiles of each extraction prior to the protein identification and quantitation using MS/MS analysis. By using GO and KEGG pathway analysis, we also explore the cellular network in which the identified proteins with significant expression change involve. We determine several protein expression levels by immunoblotting and find that the protein expression quantitation by MS/MS spectra counting and by immunoblotting is compatible. Furthermore, we demonstrate that upregulation of HSP70 expression plays an important role in the TNFα-enhanced migratory ability and TNFα-suppressed apoptosis of human HCC cell line HepG2. Collectively, we not only establish a quantitative proteomic approach that could be useful and helpful for the exploration of cellular protein expression but also provide a differential protein expression profile of and demonstrate the role of HSP70 in HepG2 cell in response to TNFα treatment.</p>

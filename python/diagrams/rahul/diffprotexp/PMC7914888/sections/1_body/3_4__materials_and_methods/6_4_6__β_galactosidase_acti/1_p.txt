0: To quantify S.A. -gal activity, we used a previously reported chromogenic assay [ 111].
1: In brief, we fixed B16F1 cells with a 0.2% ( m/ v) paraformaldehyde solution (Merck) and 0.2% ( v/ v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 4 C. We incubated for 18 h at 37 C without CO 2 with the substrate and chromogenic solution containing: 1 mg/mL of X-gal reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 61 mM citric acid/sodium phosphate (pH 4.0, pH 6.0 and pH 7.5; as appropriate), 5 mM K 3Fe [CN] 6 (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM K 4Fe [CN] 6 (Sigma-Aldrich), 150 mM NaCl (Merck) and 2 mM MgCl 2 (Merck).
2: We documented the changes through a photographic record and spectrophotometric quantification.
3: The staining solution was removed and washed with PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature and protected from light.
4: We dissolved the -galactosidase product with 200 L of 99% DMSO by 5 h and then quantified at 600 nm in the Glomax spectrophotometer.
5: Data were expressed as the average of four independent trials  standard deviation and analyzed by unpaired  t-test with Welch correction and a 95% confidence interval.

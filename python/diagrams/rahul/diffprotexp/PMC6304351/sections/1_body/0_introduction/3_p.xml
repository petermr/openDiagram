<p>Given the importance of 
 <italic>Thalassolituus</italic> in the attenuation of marine oil pollution, the type strain (
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> MIL-1 DSM 14913
 <sup>T</sup>) was genome sequenced (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Golyshin et al., 2013</xref>). 
 <italic>T. oleivorans</italic> has a strong biotechnological potential to be used for bioremediation of marine oil spills due to its high affinity for alkanes, autochthonous marine origin, and critical role in natural cleansing of marine systems. Compared to some physicochemical methods currently used, bioremediation is considered a safer, more efficient and cost-effective alternative for the removal of oil contaminants in the environment (

<p>In this paper, the open-circuit voltage of the LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/Li half-cell at different discharge states and different temperatures is measured. As temperature increases, the open-circuit voltage decreases linearly in turn. The d
 <italic>E</italic>/d
 <italic>T</italic>–SOD relation curves are fitted by the least square method, and the entropy change values of different SODs are calculated based on the fitted values. The Δ
 <italic>S</italic> values do not change much in 0% to 80% SOD but change dramatically when the SOD is over 80%. Further, the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy change in different SODs are obtained. The electrode reaction of LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> was discussed by the entropy change in different SODs. According to the evolution trend of Δ
 <italic>S</italic>, the lithium intercalation reaction of LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> may be a single-phase solid solution reaction rather than a two-phase reaction. In this system, the reversible heat generation shows cooling and heating effect in the charging and discharging process, respectively.

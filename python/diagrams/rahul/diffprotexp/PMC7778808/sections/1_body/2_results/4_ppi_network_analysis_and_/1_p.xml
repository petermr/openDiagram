<p id="Par34">The 88 DEGs were input into the STRING database, and the obtained data were imported into Cytoscape to construct PPI network(Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) and to find the top 10 hub genes, which were RPS29, RPL9, RPL27, RPS15A, RPS17, RPS27, RPS24, RPL30, RPL34 and RPL35 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The expression differences of these 10 hub genes in the VTE group and the normal control group are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c.

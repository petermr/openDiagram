<p id="Par14">The different generations of PAMAM dendrimers dissolved in solvents with varied solubility parameters were employed for the determination of solubility. The dissolvability of polymers is subjugated by internal energy interactions. The relative solvency of particular solvent, consequential of the solvent's cohesive energy density delineates the solubility parameter. Solubility reflects the degree of change in polymer composition. The studies were evaluated under steady and tumbling conditions. However, it was observed that even after tumbling for 36 h dendrimer solvency have significant effect by solvents with solubility parameter greater than 26.6 (MPa)
 <sup>1/2</sup>. Whereas, in both conditions negligible effect on solvency was observed on admixture of solvents with solubility parameter between 15.8–24.6 (MPa)
 <sup>1/2</sup>. The results in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> clearly show the significant solubility with the incremental solubility parameter of solvents.

 <caption> Increased CPSF1 in HCC correlates with unfavorable patient outcome. (A) CPSF1 expression was evaluated in TCGA LIHC samples according to different tumor grades. Two-way ANOVA tests showed statistically significant difference between groups ( P &lt; 2.2e-16). Significant differences between groups were indicated by Student’s t-test in Normal vs. Grade 1 ( P &lt; 0.01), Grade 1 vs. Grade 2 ( P = 0.011), Grade 2 vs. Grade 3 ( P = 0.033), but not in Grade 3 vs. Grade 4 ( P = 0.92). (B) Representative images of IHC staining of CPSF1 in tumor (T), and non-tumor (N) tissues. The IHC score for each case is shown on the right. (C,D) Correlation between CPSF1 expression and overall survival as well as disease-free survival was determined in the TCGA (C), and SYSUCC cohorts (D) by Kaplan–Meier analysis. The high and low CPSF1 groups were separated based on median mRNA level in TCGA and median IHC score in SYSUCC cohorts. P-values in (C) and (D) were calculated by log-rank tests. ** P &lt; 0.01 and * P &lt; 0.05. </caption>

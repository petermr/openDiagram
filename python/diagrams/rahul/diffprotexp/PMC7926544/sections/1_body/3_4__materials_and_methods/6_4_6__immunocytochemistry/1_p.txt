0: 2448 h post-transfection, confluent cells were washed twice with PBS ++ (pH 8, 1 mM MgCl 2, and 0.1 mM CaCl 2).
1: Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, incubated with 50 mM NH 4Cl, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min and incubated with DAKO (antibody diluent with background-reducing components) for 30 min to block no specific antibody binding.
2: Fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies at appropriate dilution in DAKO.
3: Mouse anti-Myc was visualized with Texas Red-coupled or Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paris, France).
4: Rabbit anti-calnexin (Abcam, Paris, France) was visualized with FITC-coupled antibodies (Themo Fisher Scientifc).
5: Anti-Giantin (Abcam), anti-GM130 (Abcam), and LAMP2 (Abcam) were with Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
6: Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield.

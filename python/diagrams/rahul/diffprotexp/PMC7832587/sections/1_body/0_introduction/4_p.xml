<p>ATP2 and the rest of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-encoded P4-ATPases still remain as putative transporters waiting for functional annotation. In addition, and despite the importance of the P4-ATPase/Cdc50 association, to date, the identity of the Cdc50-interacting partners of ATP2 have not been revealed, neither in the parasite nor 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using recombinant proteins. Moreover, the biological role of such possible association is still unknown. Here, using recombinantly-produced proteins, we demonstrate that the 
 <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> ATP2 (PcATP2) forms heterodimers with two of the three 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-encoded Cdc50 proteins: PcCdc50B and PcCdc50A. Moreover, PcATP2/PcCdc50B displayed lipid-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of two putative phospholipid substrates, and this activity was slighly upregulated by the presence of PI4P. We provide the first study of the function and structural organization of a 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lipid flippase, an emerging antimalarial target candidate.

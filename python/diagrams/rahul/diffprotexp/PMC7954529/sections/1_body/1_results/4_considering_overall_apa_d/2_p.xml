<p>Using Simpson’s D values calculated for each gene in each individual, we identified (at 5% FDR) 881 genes with significant differences in isoform diversity between species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see 'Materials and methods'). Of these, 426 are genes for which we did not previously detect an inter-species difference in PAS usage, indicating that Simpson’s D is capturing an additional dimension of, or is more sensitive to, APA variation between species (

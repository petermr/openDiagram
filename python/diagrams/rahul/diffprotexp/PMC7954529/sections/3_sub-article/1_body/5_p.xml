<p>1) Throughout the Results sections the authors present a myriad of lists of gene and PAS usage sites that result from different ways of cutting the data and connecting PAS usage to isoform and protein expression. Can these lists be explored in more detail, perhaps through functional gene set enrichment analyses and/or the use of the GREAT? Analyzing the sets in at least this manner might help to connect PAS usage differences to actual biology between humans/chimpanzees as well as within each species.</p>

<p>Finally, 77 targeted differential proteins were screened-out in accordance with the expression level, molecular function, and metabolic pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00130-f007">Figure 7</xref>). These proteins were further categorized according to their function as oxidoreductases, transferases, isomerases, heat shock proteins, lyases, hydrolases, ligases, synthetases, tubulins and actins. The number of proteins present in each class was: 27, 12, 7, 5, 4, 12, 2, 5, 2 and 1, respectively. The comparison of each class indicated that the number of proteins expressed in Se-enriched rice was more for most of the classes. The protein number for hydrolases and ligases were more in the non-Se-enriched rice. The proteins expressed for lyases function were the same in both rice types.

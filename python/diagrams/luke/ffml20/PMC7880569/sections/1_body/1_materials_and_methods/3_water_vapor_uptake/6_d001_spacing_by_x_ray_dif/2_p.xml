<p>Interlayer expansion and collapse, respectively, resulting from the intercalation and withdrawal of water, were monitored by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). AcidBir and δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> powders were first heated to 105 °C for 3 h under a dry N
 <sub>2</sub>(g) flow to remove all interlayer water. This was confirmed by the resulting XRD-derived 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing. After cooling to 25 °C under the same dry N
 <sub>2</sub>(g) flow, humidity was then incrementally increased to 98% during an adsorption leg and then incrementally decreased during the desorption leg. The samples were allowed to equilibrate at each preselected RH value for 30 min prior to collecting the diffractograms. The data were acquired using a PANalytical X’Pert

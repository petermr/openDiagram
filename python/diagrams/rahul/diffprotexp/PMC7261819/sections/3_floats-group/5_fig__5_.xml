   <italic>B</italic>, Output from in total 153 different comparisons between breast cancer cell lines in data set D5. Left figure indicate for each comparison the method that identified the highest number of DEPs. Right figure indicate for each comparison the method that identified the highest proportion of DEPs with low (

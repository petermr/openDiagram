<p>As for lamins, they are important structural components of the nuclear lamina and play a role in nuclear architecture, DNA replication, and gene expression. The lamin-B1 mutant mice provide evidence for a broad and nonredundant function of lamin-B1 in mammalian development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In the present study, the downregulated lamin-B1 was observed in Caco-2 cells treated with Se. In addition, nano-Se and Se-Met also had the similar levels of lamin-B1, and there was no significant difference. It might be related to the metabolic pathway of these two forms Se in Caco-2 cells and the interaction between both nano-Se and Se-Met and lamin-B1 was similar.

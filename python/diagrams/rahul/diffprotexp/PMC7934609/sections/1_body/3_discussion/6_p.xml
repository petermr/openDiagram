<p>In addition, we found that the expression level of HSP90 protein presented no difference between the samples of the oncosphere and adults, while the expression was higher in adults than the protoscolex, reaching a significant level of difference (

Since adults parasitize primarily in the intestinal tissues of intermediate hosts, and protoscoleces parasitize primarily in liver tissues of definitive hosts, it is speculated that the differential expression of HSP90 may be related to the tissue specificity of parasitism.

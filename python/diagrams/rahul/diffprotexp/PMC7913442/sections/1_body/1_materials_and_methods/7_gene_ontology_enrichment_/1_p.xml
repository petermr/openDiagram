<p id="Par27">For Gene Ontology Enrichment (GO) analyses, we used Metascape [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] with default parameters. To reduce the confounding effect on gene expression derived from variable overexpression of the proteins from the plasmids across samples, we removed the terms that were associated with the expression of FOXL2 and/or SMAD3. In order to do so, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and identified gene ontology terms significantly associated with FOXL2 and/or SMAD3. In detail, the GSEA tool (

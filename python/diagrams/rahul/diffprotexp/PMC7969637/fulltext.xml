Over the past few decades, numerous medical studies have proposed several definitions for sepsis, such as septicemia, sepsis, toxemia, bacteremia, endotoxemia, and so on (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Sepsis is characterized by a general pro-inflammatory cascade that causes extensive tissue damages, which includes severe clinical spectrums, such as septic shock as well as multiple organ failures (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Sepsis can be initiated by bacteria, fungi, as well as viruses, without specific treatment (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In this case, the diagnosis of sepsis is particularly difficult because these patients have multiple comorbidities and underlying diseases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Sepsis is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide, which is estimated as 60% for children under 5 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A US cohort study indicated a significant increase for the annual incidence of severe pediatric sepsis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decades, the management for pediatric sepsis has improved gradually (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The current therapies in clinic include resuscitation, prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, accurate fluid balance, blood glucose, as well as source control (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, we still lack a specific molecular therapy for this condition, except for antimicrobial therapy. Numerous trials of potential biological agents targeting different mediators of sepsis have failed (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite advances in intensive care and supportive technology, the mortality rate of sepsis in children still stay in a high position without going down (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The current recommendation for identifying sepsis is the SOFA score, which refers to Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment. SOFA is a simple system, which uses accessible parameters in daily clinical practice to identify dysfunction or failure of the key organs as a result of sepsis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The European Medicines Agency has accepted that a change in the SOFA score of 2 or more is an acceptable surrogate marker for sepsis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Unfortunately, the criteria still cannot confirm or refute the diagnosis of sepsis completely given the complexity of the sepsis response. Moreover, sepsis is a time critical emergency, as the disease may progress rapidly to organ failure, shock, and death, which require a prompt recognition.</p><p>Based on inflated misdiagnosis rate and poor accuracy of diagnosis, pediatric sepsis has brought great difficulty to clinical treatment. To this end, a more comprehensive approach to predict pediatric sepsis based on the specific target gene differential expression is required. To address these issues, in this study, we used a combination of bioinformatics and machine learning to screen out the potential biomarkers in the pathogenesis of pediatric sepsis specimens and then constructed a diagnosis model. All of these promising outcomes enriched the diagnosis of the disease, which provide tremendous help for pediatric sepsis study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Data Source</title><p>This study utilized the mRNA chip data in the GEO database, and the samples were from data sets numbered GSE26440, GSE26378, and GSE66099. GSE26440 included 98 whole blood samples of septic children and 32 whole blood samples of healthy children; GSE26378 included 82 whole blood samples of septic children and 21 whole blood samples of healthy children; GSE66099 included 229 whole blood samples of septic children and 47 whole blood samples of healthy children.

Firstly, the samples were divided into two groups: normal control group and pediatric sepsis group. The GLM function in R language was used as a continuous variable, and the sample type was used as a binary response.

In order to use as few variables as possible to build a strong interpretation model, we performed a stepwise regression method to further identify 5 primary genes from these 50 genes, which were TLR2, MMP9, TLR8, MPO, and CCL5. Logistic regression model 2 was constructed by incorporating these 5 genes into the model as variables. An OR value &#x0003e;1 indicated that the expression of this factor was positively correlated with the onset of disease, while &#x0003c;1 was negatively correlated. At the same time, we found that the <italic>p</italic>-values of these 2 genes, MMP9 and MPO, were &#x0003c;0.05, indicating that they contribute greatly to the model while others (TLR2, TLR8, as well as CCL5 with <italic>p</italic>-value more than 0.05) were not used for model 3 construction and subsequent analysis. Furthermore, we reconstructed logistic regression model 3 with these 2 genes as the final model and found that this logistic regression model had no extreme point affecting the accuracy of the model. The red dashed line in the figure indicated the COOK distance. Generally, the point where the COOK distance &#x0003e;0.5 was a very &#x0201c;influential&#x0201d; point, which affected the reliability of the model.

The prominent problem for pediatric sepsis is the inflated misdiagnosis as well as the lack of a gold standard. Epidemiologic research has provided evidence that sepsis is more or less similar to over 50 systemic diseases in children (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For instance, in the case of fever: immunosuppressed children do not always develop fever, so the infection is hard to detect. In contrast, critically ill children have a certain degree of hyperthermia but may not present infection (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). All of these may lead to the disease being ignored or misdiagnosed in the first place. Whenever symptoms are present, sepsis in children becomes more severe. All of these are all in dire need of effective forecasting targets or biomarkers for pediatric sepsis. To this end, it is beneficial to develop a comprehensive specific expression profile of genes in pediatric sepsis patients for potential candidates. Here, compared with control specimens, a total of 708 differentially expressed genes in pediatric sepsis were screened out, including 507 up-regulated genes and 201 down-regulated genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> for details).</p><p>We further studied the biological process related to these genes using GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. We found that these target genes were significantly enriched in biological processes (BP) related to immune cells such as neutrophil activation, neutrophil degranulation, hematopoietic cell lineage, and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for details). Previously, a multicohort analysis by Sweeney et al. suggested that neutrophil activation, neutrophil degranulation, monocytes, as well as T cell-associated process had been involved in sepsis development and formation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). They utilized data sets containing cohorts of children and adults, men and women, with a mix of community- and hospital-acquired sepsis, while we focused on pediatric sepsis; this may support the fact that these processes are common for all-age sepsis. This host response in septic progression involves many defense mechanisms with strong cellular activation, including neutrophil activation. In this process, neutrophil cells are key to innate immunity through their complex interactions with vascular cells, and their activation may be involved in systemic tissue damage. Their activation also leads to the release of neutrophil traps, which are involved in pathogen containment and phagocytosis, as well as coagulation activation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Several reports have demonstrated that neutrophils generally have a relatively high expression in sepsis patients (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Previously, a study using high-throughput technologies has been able to identify differentially expressed pediatric septic shock biomarkers using gene expression data to predict long-term outcomes (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In this study, highly expressed genes in pediatric sepsis are enriched in multiple KEGG pathways and GO terms, which are related to neutrophils. Therefore, high expression of related genes may be one of the potential causes of increased neutrophil content in pediatric sepsis. On other hand, sepsis can be induced by viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc. The enrichment of neutrophils in the study might be due to the high infection rate of bacteria in children's specimen. Previously, it was suggested that sepsis was closely associated with hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion and hematopoietic cell lineage, which was processed through a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related mechanism (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> is now the most common cause of bacteremia and infective endocarditis in industrialized nations worldwide and is associated with excess mortality when compared to other pathogens. It has been suggested that <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the primary cause of pediatric sepsis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Overall, these pathways are related to pediatric sepsis on some levels, and they provide a significant research starting point.</p><p>Due to complexity of pathogenesis in pediatric sepsis, it is impossible to study each potential single gene individually. To this end, an alternative method combining bioinformatics and machine learning is required for our study. Here, we used Cytoscape software and the MNC algorithm to identify the top 50 genes according to their scores in the model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> for details). Using the 50 genes, we generated a logistic regression prediction model. With further reconstruction, two primary genes including MMP9 and MPO had been screened out. Matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) is a zinc-dependent gelatinase, which could decrease the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and influence the metastatic behavior of immune cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). MMPs are secreted as pro-MMPs, which are regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) as well as by &#x003b1;-macroglobulins (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Previously, MMP-9, TIMP-1 levels, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio have been suggested as biomarkers in adult severe sepsis and septic shock (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A study by Alqahtani et al. demonstrated that the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios can also serve as a biomarker for the identification of sepsis in pediatric patients (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This is consistent with our integrated study. However, we did not find a significant difference for TIMP-1. This may be due to the fact that they used febrile controls in addition to a healthy control group as was often used in studies of biomarkers in sepsis, or the constant comparison in our report did not fluctuate time-dependent analysis as they performed. All of these deserve further investigation.</p><p>On the other hand, it is interesting to further explore the function of MPO in the pediatric sepsis study. The neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) is mainly shown to promote oxidative stress by the production of active chlorinated molecules (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It was rarely reported to be associated with pediatric sepsis, yet a small sample size study suggested a lower MPO level in pediatric sepsis compared with the control group (91.24 vs. 116.55 U/L; <italic>p</italic> value = 0.023) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). These evidences highlighted the importance of understanding the relation between the MPO gene family pathway and pediatric sepsis, which initiated a tremendous starting point for the following study. Importantly, a recent study using two feature selection methods including Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI) and Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (MRMR) also provided multiple differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways for pediatric sepsis. Within these, MPO was also a primary candidate (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Using two potential target genes (MMP9 and MPO), we established a logistic regression model aiming for pediatric sepsis prediction. The accuracy of the model prediction was evaluated and approved by clinical data outcomes (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which demonstrated the tendency of two biomarkers' change for different levels of pediatric sepsis patients.</p><p>To conclude, in light of the fact that there remains no gold standard diagnosis and no reliable disease-specific prediction for pediatric sepsis, we summarized the differential expression profile of genes in the disease. Several target genes established a specific expression manner, which initiated new insights into the management of pediatric sepsis therapeutic biomarkers discovery and provided a very valuable data reference for future clinical research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, China.

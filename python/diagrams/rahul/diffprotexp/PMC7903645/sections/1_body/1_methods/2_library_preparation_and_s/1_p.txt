0: For RNA-Seq profiling, 5 mL of blood was collected into EDTA tubes.
1: Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagents (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and stored at  80 C. The concentration and quality of RNA products were determined on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2: mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared with total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol.
3: The quality and size of the libraries were assessed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer DNA kit.
4: All libraries were quantified by qPCR using the CFX96 Real Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and sequenced on the NextSeq500 system (Illumina) with a paired-end 75 base pair plus single 8 base pair index run.

<p>Bone marrow MSCs appeared as fibroblastic and spindle-shaped (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The cultured MSCs were positive for the presence of surface markers CD44 and CD29 but not CD45 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, B, C). However, the ACs exhibited an amoeboid and squamous-shaped cells in the monolayer culture (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D) with only type-II collagen and proteoglycan expression (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D, E, F). MSCs and ACs displayed spherical-shaped morphology in 3D culture. Upon reaching 21 days of culture in chondrogenic medium, MSC and AC-alginate beads expressed proteoglycan and type-II collagen as observed from the histological analysis.

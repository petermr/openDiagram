<p>In the present study, we identified three hub genes (
 <italic>CCR4</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR8</italic>, and 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic>) that are significantly associated with TME and prognosis. We found that these genes are essential in building a microenvironment that stimulates anti-tumor immune responses and thus inhibits tumor growth and migration. These findings may shed new light on future anti-tumor therapies that target TME status.

   <bold>Application of DEqMS in real world MS proteomics data.</bold> a. Overlap of significant findings in the analysis of miR-372 mimic treated U1810 cells using different methods. Indicated in the figure is the number of significantly regulated proteins (DEPs) as identified by DEqMS only, Limma only, by both methods or by ROTS. Also indicated in piecharts for different sets of DEPs is the support of the corresponding mRNAs as miRNA targets. Support (yellow) indicates proportion of proteins where the corresponding mRNA was downregulated as evaluated by RNA-seq analysis, as well as predicted as being miR-372 targets by microRNA target prediction algorithms. For comparison, the overall background support in the entire data set is also shown.

<p>The study couples careful phylogenetic work with genomics to demonstrate that all Afrotherians are equal, but some (those with large body sizes) are more equal than others with respect to genetic mechanisms that reduce cancer risk. This is a significant advance in our understanding of the genetic evolution of cancer risk with body size, and in so doing it considerably lengthens the list of candidate genes that contribute to tumor suppression in Afrotherian mammals.</p>

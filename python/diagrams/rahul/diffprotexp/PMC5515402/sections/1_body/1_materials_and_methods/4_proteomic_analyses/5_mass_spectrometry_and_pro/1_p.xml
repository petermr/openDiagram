<p>Tryptic peptides were reconstituted in 40 μL of 0.1% TFA (v/v) in water: acetonitrile (95:5) and 4 μL was directly loaded at 4 μL/min for 7 min onto a custom-made trap column (100 μm I.D. fused silica with Kasil frit) containing 2 cm of 200Å, 5 μm Magic C18AQ particles (Bruker-Michrom, Auburn, CA). Peptides were eluted using a custom-made analytical column (75 μm I.D. fused silica) with gravity-pulled tip and packed with 25 cm 100Å, 5 μm Magic C18AQ particles (Bruker-Michrom, Auburn, CA). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 100% solvent A (0.1% formic acid:acetonitrile [95:05]) to 35% solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid) in 30 min at 300 nL/min, using a Proxeon Easy nanoLC system directly coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Data were acquired using a data-dependent acquisition routine of acquiring one mass spectrum from 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 350–2000 in the Orbitrap (resolution 60,000) followed by tandem mass spectrometry scans in the LTQ linear ion trap of the 10 most abundant precursor ions found in the mass spectrum. Charge state rejection of singly charged ions and dynamic exclusion was utilized to minimize data redundancy and maximize peptide identification. The raw data files were processed into peak lists for database searching.

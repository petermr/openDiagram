We filtered data using a gene expression cutoff = 10, isoform expression cutoff = 3, differential isoform fraction (dIF) cutoff = 0.05 and removed single isoform genes. Although DEXSeq is recommended to test differential isoform usage, it does not work efficiently for large datasets (more than 100 samples)

 <italic>isoformSwitchAnalysisPart1</italic> function using DRIMSeq

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup> to test differential transcript usage. Using part1 fasta files, all external analysis was performed and used as input to 
 <italic>isoformSwitchAnalysisPart2</italic> function. We used CPC2, Pfam, SignalIP and Netsurfp2 as indicated in the pipeline. Next, we performed a confirmation stage using stageR

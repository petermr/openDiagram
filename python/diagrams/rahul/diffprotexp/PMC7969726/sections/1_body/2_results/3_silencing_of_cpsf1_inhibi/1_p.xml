<p>To explore the biological function of CPSF1 in HCC cells, we depleted CPSF1 expression by transfecting two mixed siRNAs into HepG2.2.15 and HCCLM3 cell lines (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C,E</xref>). In contrast to CPSF1 silencing, transfection of a CPSF1 ectopic-expression vector into HepG2.2.15 and HCCLM3 cells increased cell growth (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). In cell cycle assays, silencing of CPSF1 increased G0/G1 and reduced G2/M cell proportion, whereas CPSF1 overexpression increased the proportion of G2/M cells in HepG2.2.15 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). To further demonstrate that CPSF1 can potentially trigger tumorigenesis in a non-transformed setting, we silenced or overexpressed CPSF1 in the normal liver epithelial cell line, QSG7701. The results indicated that overexpression of CPSF1 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation, whereas knockdown of CPSF1 reduced cell growth in QSG-7701 cells (

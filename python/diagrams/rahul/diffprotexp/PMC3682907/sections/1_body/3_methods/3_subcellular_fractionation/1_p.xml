<p>Two tissue homogenization methods were tested. In the first method (M1), 60 μm tissue slices (approximately 250 mg) were cut and a Brinkmann blender was employed to homogenize the tissue. In the second method (M2), small blocks (approximately 250 mg) of brain tissue were cut and homogenized with a Teflon® pestle homogenizer. For both homogenization methods, frozen brain tissue was suspended in whole cell homogenization buffer (20 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.9 0.5% NP-40, 5% glycerol, with protease inhibitors (P2714, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and stored at -80°C as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet containing the mitochondrially enriched fraction was washed twice in 20 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. The mitochondria were then lysed in mitochondrial lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 7M urea, 3% CHAPS with protease inhibitors) for 20 minutes at room temperature. The mitochondrial lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. A modified Lowry protein assay was used to determine the protein concentration. All samples were stored at -80°C until further analysis.

<p>We report here CNTN1 upregulation in LNCaP cell-derived xenografts produced in castrated mice compared to the xenografts generated in intact mice. Ectopic expression of CNTN1 in LNCaP cells enhances cell proliferation. RNA-sequencing analysis of LNCaP empty vector (EV) cells and LNCaP CNTN1 cells identified an enrichment of the CREIGHTON_ENDOCRINE_THERAPY_RESISTANCE_3 gene set in LNCaP CNTN1 cells. The 10 leading-edge genes of this enrichment are novel to PC; they display differential expression in PC compared to normal prostate tissue, PCs with 
 <italic>TMPRSS2-ERG</italic> fusion compared to those without the fusion, and mPCs compared to primary PC. Furthermore, this 10-gene panel robustly predicts PC relapse in two independent cohorts, the TCGA PanCancer (
 <italic>n</italic> = 492) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 140), as well as poor overall survival (OS) in another urogenital cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Collectively, we observed a novel aspect of CNTN1-associated genes; this research is promising not only in our understanding of PC but also in improving the clinical management of PC patients.

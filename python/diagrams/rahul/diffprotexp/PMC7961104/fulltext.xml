Various metabolites produced by these organs are released into the circulation and affect the metabolism of other organs. Especially, during the fasting period, glucose and ketone bodies generated in the liver serve as essential energy sources for extrahepatic organs (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lehninger et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, lactate and alanine from the extrahepatic organs, like the skeletal muscle, work as substrates of glucose generation (gluconeogenesis) in the liver, which are known as Cori's cycle and glucose-alanine cycle, respectively (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cori and Cori, 1929</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Felig, 1973</xref>). However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms controlling these inter-organ metabolic cycles are not fully understood.</p><p id="p0030">Obesity impairs metabolic regulation of multiple organs, including the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to the dysfunction of the inter-organ metabolic cycle and subsequently to metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gancheva et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Samuel and Shulman, 2016</xref>). Obesity perturbs metabolic regulation through changes in hormones, metabolites, and metabolic enzymes in the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to systemic metabolic dysfunction. Insulin resistance that is associated with obesity represents a well-characterized factor contributing to metabolic dysfunction (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kahn et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Roden and Shulman, 2019</xref>); however, the effect of obesity on inter-organ metabolic cycles&#x02014;the glucose-alanine cycle, the glucose-lactate cycle, and ketone body metabolism&#x02014;have yet to be explored.</p><p id="p0035">The metabolic network is complex, involving many diverse substrates, products, and intermediates in the chemical reactions of metabolism, denoted here as metabolic reactions, and the metabolic enzymes that mediate the reactions. Many metabolic enzymes are regulated not only through availability of substrates but also through feedback regulation by the products or through allosteric mechanisms. In addition, metabolic enzymes are regulated at the level of gene expression and through posttranslational modifications. Thus, obesity-associated dysregulation of metabolic networks in various organs is due to changes in complex networks with many forms of regulation (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lusis et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Muoio and Newgard, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Roden and Shulman, 2019</xref>). Hence, to comprehensively evaluate the effects of obesity on intracellular regulatory mechanisms requires investigation and integration of omic data of multiple types (transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) and from multiple organs. Few, if any, studies have taken such an integrated, multi-organ approach.</p><p id="p0040">To effectively model regulation of metabolism requires not only integration of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data but also using bioinformatics to link these datasets together through regulation. Transcriptional changes need to be connected to transcription factors (TFs) and posttranslational changes need to be connected to the enzymes mediating those modifications, such as connecting kinases to phosphorylation events. Metabolite regulation of metabolic enzymes requires linking such metabolites to relevant enzymes. Hence, metabolic reactions are regulated by an integrated network consisting of metabolites as substrates and products as well as allosteric regulators and their activation status, metabolic enzymes and their activation status, TFs and their activation status, and signaling molecules, such as kinases. Previously, we investigated the regulatory network controlling metabolic reactions by integrating simultaneous measurements of the amounts of metabolites, the expression of and the activation status of metabolic enzymes, and the amount and the activation status of signaling molecules into a multi-layered trans-omic network that also includes inferred TFs and metabolite-mediated regulation of metabolic reactions (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kawata et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kokaji et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yugi and Kuroda, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Yugi et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). To date, we have used analysis of trans-omic network to establish a regulatory network of metabolic reactions changed by insulin stimulation in cultured cells and that of metabolic reactions responded to glucose administration in the livers of healthy and obese mice (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kokaji et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Soltis et&#x000a0;al. reported a molecular interaction network from molecules changed by high-fat-diet-associated obesity in multiple omic data but only of the liver (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Soltis et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the available studies have only evaluated either cultured cells or a single organ.</p><p id="p0045">Because obesity impairs metabolic homeostasis in various organs, such as the liver and skeletal muscle, and inter-organ metabolic cycles between them through the blood, it is necessary to generate a trans-omic network that includes multi-omic data from the relevant organs and data from blood samples. The leptin-deficient obese (<italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic>) mice are a widely used model of obesity and insulin resistance, because these mice become profoundly obese by overeating because of deficiency of the anorexigenic hormone leptin (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ingalls et&#x000a0;al., 1950</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lindstr&#x000f6;m, 2007</xref>). Here, we constructed trans-omic networks for the liver and skeletal muscle by comparing data obtained from fasted wild-type (WT) and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice. Using these trans-omic networks, we provided potential mechanisms of the dysfunctions of the glucose-alanine, glucose-lactate, and ketone body cycles between the liver and skeletal muscle, which characterize the dysfunctional systemic metabolism in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Overview of the approach for constructing trans-omic networks from WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice</title><p id="p0050">We constructed trans-omic networks for differentially regulated metabolic reactions in liver and skeletal muscle between WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice. We measured the amount and phosphorylation status of signaling molecules, global gene expression, global protein expression, and the amounts of metabolites and lipids in liver and skeletal muscle, along with the amounts of metabolites in the blood, of WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice. We then selected the data relevant to metabolic reactions from the transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. By integrating these data, we constructed trans-omic networks for differentially regulated metabolic reactions in liver and skeletal muscle of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Overview of the approach for constructing trans-omic networks from WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice</p><p>We used WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice and collected the liver, skeletal muscle, and the blood from 16-h-fasted mice. We measured signaling molecules, genes, proteins, metabolites, and lipids in the liver and skeletal muscle and identified differentially expressed molecules that significantly increased or decreased in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice in each omic layer (Step 1). We also measured metabolites in the blood. We identified the regulations connecting regulating differentially expressed molecules with regulated differentially expressed molecules using bioinformatic methods and multiple databases and defined those as &#x0201c;differential regulations&#x0201d; (Step 2). The differential regulations are classified into either activating regulation in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice (red arrow) or inhibiting regulation in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice (blue arrow). By integrating differentially expressed molecules and differential regulations that are involved in &#x0201c;metabolic reactions,&#x0201d; we constructed the trans-omic network for differentially regulated metabolic reactions in the liver and skeletal muscle (Step 3). Together with the blood metabolomic data, we examined dysfunction of inter-organ metabolic cycles and their dysregulation in the trans-omic network in the liver and skeletal muscle of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice (Step 4). We used the following number of mouse replicates for each analysis: n&#x000a0;= 5 both in WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice for the identification of phosphorylated molecules, n&#x000a0;= 11 (WT mice) and n&#x000a0;= 12 (<italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice) for transcriptomics, n&#x000a0;= 5 both in WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice for proteomics, n&#x000a0;= 5 both in WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice for metabolomics, and n&#x000a0;= 3 both in WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice for lipidomics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0055">We used 10-week-old WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice that had fasted for 16 h. We collected liver, skeletal (gastrocnemius) muscle, and blood from the mice. Some of the liver and blood data were those reported in our previous study (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kokaji et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). The skeletal muscle data were obtained in this study and were from the same mice that were used to obtain the liver and blood data (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kokaji et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in the blood of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice were significantly higher than those of WT mice, indicating that <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice exhibit the expected hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>).</p><p id="p0060">To identify molecules (phosphorylated proteins, transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and lipids) that were differentially abundant between WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, we set the FDR-adjusted p value (q value) of less than 0.1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>: Step1). We classified the differentially expressed molecules as either increased or decreased in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice relative to their abundance in WT mice. We identified the regulatory connections for differentially expressed molecules using multiple databases and defined those as &#x0201c;differential regulations&#x0201d; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>: Step2). We classified the differential regulations as either activating or inhibiting in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice compared with WT mice. By integrating the differentially expressed molecules and the differential regulations that are involved in &#x0201c;metabolic reaction,&#x0201d; we constructed a liver trans-omic network and a skeletal muscle trans-omic network for differentially regulated metabolic reactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>: Step3). We grouped differentially expressed molecules from each type of data into layers connected by the differential regulations. The top layer represented signaling input from insulin (Insulin Signal) connected to a TF layer connected to layer representing the differentially expressed genes encoding metabolic enzymes (Enzyme mRNA) connected to layer representing the differentially expressed metabolic enzymes (Enzyme Protein) connected to a metabolic reactions layer (Metabolic Reaction). The Metabolic Reaction layer included regulatory input from both the Enzyme Protein layer and a metabolites (Metabolite) layer through allosteric regulation by metabolites and by changes in the amounts of substrates or products.

Liver provides gluconeogenesis activity, whereas skeletal muscle consumes glucose through glycolysis. These processes are linked through two cycles (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dashty, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sarabhai and Roden, 2019</xref>). Alanine is transported to the liver and converted into glucose, which is then released into the circulation and taken up by skeletal muscle. This cycle is the glucose-alanine cycle (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Felig, 1973</xref>). Skeletal muscle converts glucose to lactate, which is then transported to the liver for conversion to glucose. This cycle is called the glucose-lactate cycle (Cori's cycle) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cori and Cori, 1929</xref>). When glucose is limiting, ketone bodies provide a source of energy from fatty acid degradation (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cahill et&#x000a0;al., 1966</xref>).

Most of the intermediate metabolites in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway in the liver, such as G6P, F6P, F1,6P, 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), and PEP, were the increased DEMs in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice except dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). Many metabolic enzymes were increased DEMEs in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice (17 proteins: 94% of total 18 DEMEs), whereas the only decreased DEME was Pck1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>A).

Taken together, these results suggest that both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways are activated by the DEMEs in liver of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice.

Despite these limited changes in alanine in the organs, alanine decreased in the blood of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, suggesting either decreased release from skeletal muscle or increased uptake by liver. We found increased expression of the alanine transporter genes <italic>Asct1</italic> and <italic>Asct2</italic> in both liver and skeletal muscle, suggesting enhanced uptake in liver. The limited increase in alanine in liver was consistent with increased Gpt and Gpt2, which catalyzes at the conversion of alanine to pyruvate. In the glucose-lactate cycle, lactate was unchanged in skeletal muscle and the blood of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice.

Given that As160 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases and its phosphorylation inhibits its GTPase activity, resulting in promoting Glut4 translocation into the plasma membrane via Rab GTPases, and consequently enhancing glucose transport (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Czech, 2007</xref>), this result suggested the enhancement of glucose transport through Glut4 translocation.

The two facts that increased blood glucose and phosphorylation of As160 and that decreased downstream glycolytic metabolites (G6P to PEP) are contradictory, implying an existence of dysregulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle.

Despite this increased capacity to produce and release the ketone body 3-OH butyrate by the liver and the decreased use of this ketone body by skeletal muscle from <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, blood concentrations of 3-OH butyrate were unchanged from WT mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0195">We measured multiple omic data&#x02014;transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic&#x02014;in liver and skeletal muscle of WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice during a fasting state and identified differentially expressed molecules that significantly changed in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice relative to WT in each omic layer and connected these layers with differential regulations. From this large set of data, we extracted differentially expressed molecules and differential regulations that are involved in metabolic reactions and constructed a trans-omic network for liver and a network for skeletal muscle of the differentially regulated metabolic reactions. By integrating the trans-omic networks in liver and skeletal muscle with metabolomic data from blood, we explored the potential mechanisms of dysfunction of three inter-organ metabolic cycles: glucose-alanine, glucose-lactate, and ketone bodies.</p><p id="p0200">We provided the potential mechanisms of obesity-associated dysfunctions and dysregulations of inter-organ metabolic cycles of glucose-alanine and glucose-lactate: (1) activation of the gluconeogenesis pathway both from alanine and lactate by increased enzyme expression in the liver and (2) impaired glycolysis by decreased enzyme expression in skeletal muscle. In the activation of gluconeogenesis pathway in liver of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, expression of <italic>Gpt2</italic> and <italic>Ldha</italic>, encoding enzymes that catalyze alanine and lactate to pyruvate, respectively, and of <italic>Asct2</italic>, encoding an alanine transporter, were upregulated by the common DRTF, <italic>Pparg</italic>, suggesting a mechanism for coordinated activation of these dysregulated processes in liver. Taken together, the data suggested that dysregulations of the glucose-alanine and glucose-lactate cycles involve activation of gluconeogenesis in liver and inhibition of glycolysis in skeletal muscle, which may contribute to hyperglycemia of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice. However, further studies are required to elucidate the causal relationship between obesity-associated changes of the activation status of pathways and dysregulation of the inter-organ metabolic cycles. Moreover, we found that blood glucose and phosphorylation of As160 in skeletal muscle increased, whereas downstream glycolytic metabolites (G6P to PEP) decreased, suggesting that Glut4 translocation to plasma membrane, which is downstream of As160, may be impaired in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice.

In addition, the expression of the gene encoding the 3-OH butyrate transporter in skeletal muscle of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice decreased. However, the amount of 3-OH butyrate in the blood was similar between WT and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, suggesting that organs other than skeletal muscle take up this ketone body, preventing its accumulation in the blood despite increased production and release by the liver. In skeletal muscle of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, the expression of ketone body transporter and metabolic enzyme and the amount of 3-OH butyrate decreased, despite activation of enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation in skeletal muscle. These results suggest that fatty acids instead of ketone bodies were metabolized to produce acetyl-CoA in skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle from <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, 5 of the 8 increased DEMEs involved in fatty acid degradation were not upregulated at the transcript level (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B), suggesting that the increased abundance of these enzymes may be controlled by the modulation of protein turnover.</p><p id="p0210">The increased DRTF <italic>Klf4</italic> regulated the expression of the increased DEGs encoding metabolic enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation (<italic>Ascl5</italic>, <italic>Acadm</italic>, <italic>Echs1</italic>, and <italic>Acaa1b</italic>) and of <italic>Hmgcl</italic> (encoding HMG-CoA lyase involved in ketone body synthesis) in liver of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice.

In the expression of genes, the increased DEGs in both obese mice were enriched in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and steroid synthesis, whereas the decreased DEGs in both obese mice were enriched in 4 amino acid metabolic pathways such as Ala, Asp, and Glu metabolism and Gly, Ser, and Thr metabolism (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kokaji et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Soltis et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Besides, we compared our DETFs with TFs in liver of high-fat diet-induced obese mice (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Soltis et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13</xref>).

Limitations of our study include that we evaluated only liver and skeletal muscle and only at a single time point of fasting. More detailed investigation of the effects of obesity on metabolite exchange across each organ will require the acquisition of metabolite time series data using isotope tracers (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Garc&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), along with acquisition of transcriptomic and proteomic data at multiple time points. The sample size of lipidome (n&#x000a0;= 3) is relatively small compared with other omic analyses, and the statistical power is low for lipidomic analysis. For this reason, we did not include the lipidomic data in the trans-omic networks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). In addition, we focused on metabolic reactions. However, perturbations in liver and skeletal muscle of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice are not limited to metabolism. These mice also exhibit increased chronic inflammation or disrupted organ architecture (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). We need to analyze other perturbed cellular functions than metabolism for comprehensive understanding of systemic changes in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice. For example, skeletal muscle is primarily a contractile organ. Thus, these cells may adapt to obesity through changes in non-metabolic cellular functions, such as muscle contraction. Indeed, we found pathways involved in contractile function, such as the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, from pathway enrichment analysis in DEGs in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>) and identified increased DEPs associated with muscle contraction, such as Myh2 and Myh7 (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). There are two types of regulation of TFs: regulation by expression change and regulation by posttranslational modifications including, phosphorylation (differentially phosphorylated TFs (DPTFs)). In this study, we identified DETFs using RNA-seq and included only pFoxo1 as a DPTF based on the literature. In the future, the phosphoproteomic measurement will allow us to comprehensively identify DPTFs according to our methods (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Yugi et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kawata et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Identification of both DETFs and DPTFs will enable us to examine how much of gene expression is controlled by DETFs and DPTFs in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice. Thus, large-scale measurements of phosphorylation levels of metabolic molecules by the phosphoproteomics are required (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Yugi et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kawata et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Humphrey et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).

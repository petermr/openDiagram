0: Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Sigma).
1: RNA purity and concentration were determined by measuring the absorbances at 260 and 280 nm, respectively.
2: PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (TaKaRa) was used to obtain complementary DNA (cDNA).
3: The total genomic DNA was extracted with the animal tissue/cell genomic DNA extraction Kit (Solarbio).
4: qPCR reactions in the presence of SYBR Green were performed on CFX 96TM Real-Time System (BIO-RAD).
5: The primer sequences for qPCR were as follows: sele-For:  5   GCCTGCAATGTGGTTGAGTG  3 and sele-Rev:  5   GCACCTCACAGAGCCATTCT  3 ; GAPDH-For:  5   GTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCG  3 and GAPDH-Rev:  ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAA-3 ; mtDNA-For:  5   GGGGAAGCAGATTTGGGTAC  3 and mtDNA-Rev:  5   AGGGTGGGTAGGTTTGTTGG  3 ; 18SRNA-For:  5   CAGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAG  3 and 18SRNA-Rev:  5   CGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC  3.
6: The relative expression was calculated using the 2 Ct method.

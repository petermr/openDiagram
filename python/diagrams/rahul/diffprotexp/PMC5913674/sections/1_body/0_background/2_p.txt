0: Giardia duodenalis (syn.
1: G. lamblia, G. intestinalis) is a parasitic protist responsible for between 200 and 300 million cases of diarrheal disease (giardiasis) annually [ 5].
2: This microaerophile exhibits fermentative glycolysis coupled to an antioxidant system that maintains an electron-rich (i.e., highly reduced) intracellular environment.
3: Chemotherapeutic treatments for giardiasis are limited but remain the primary treatment option, targeting the trophozoite, which is the infective life stage that attaches to the gastro-epithelial lining of the proximal small intestine [ 6].
4: Nitroheterocyclics, in particular Mtz, remain the predominant class against these parasites.
5: However, the efficacy of frontline Mtz treatment ranges from 73 to 100% in  Giardia [ 7], with clinical resistance confirmed [ 7,  8] and increasing in incidence [ 9].

 </sup> The concept of catalysts being dynamic systems that actively transform and respond to the reaction conditions, rather than just a static arrangement of atoms, is almost commonplace now. However, this shift of paradigm results in an even more pressing need for experimental tools that would allow one to probe the composition, structure, and dynamics of catalysts under realistic reaction conditions. An additional challenge here is that catalysts are commonly complex, heterogeneous, disordered systems with multiple species coexisting. In many cases, the nature of the actual active site is still a matter of heated debate, and cooperative effects involving multiple-sites for different reaction steps might also have to be considered.

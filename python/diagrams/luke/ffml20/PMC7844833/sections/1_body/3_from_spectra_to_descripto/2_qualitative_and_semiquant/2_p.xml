<p>Spectral features in the XANES region of the absorption spectra are a result of transitions of photoelectrons excited by X-rays to unoccupied localized and delocalized states and are sensitive to both the materials atomic and electronic structure. However, due to the multitude of different possible transitions and the sensitivity of XANES to the details of the atomic bonding and density of on vacant states, the interpretation of XANES features is often nontrivial.

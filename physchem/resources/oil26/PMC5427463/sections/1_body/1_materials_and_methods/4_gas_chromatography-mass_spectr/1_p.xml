<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The identification of SoEO compounds was performed using a Hewlett Packard 5890 II GC, equipped with a HP 5972 mass selective detector and a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m &#215; 0.25 mm, <italic>i.d.,</italic> 0.25 &#956;m film thickness). For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system, with a scan time of 1.5 s, a mass range 40-300 amu (atomic mass unit) and ionization energy of 70 eV, was applied. As a carrier gas, helium was used at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 &#176;C and 280 &#176;C, respectively. The same oven program temperature of GC analysis was used. One micro-liter of diluted samples in hexane was injected manually in the splitless mode. The identification of the compounds was performed by computer matching of mass spectra using library search system HP-5890 (Hewlett-Packard) and consulting data bases of Wiley 275 and NBS 75K libraries (McLafferty, 1989[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) and NIST 05 (Stein, 1990[<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). Some of the compounds from essential oil were confirmed by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standard substances and with data as reported by Adams (2001[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]).</p>

<p>To examine the functionality of TREM1 in the context of IPA, we investigated whether SNPs in TREM1 could differentially regulate sTREM1 levels in BAL samples from patients with IPA and matched controls. We studied the rs2234237 SNP, a nonsynonymous variation (Ser25Thr) located in exon-2 that may influence the biologic function of TREM1 [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the rs2234246 SNP, located at gene promoter and described to regulate TREM1 expression levels that results in differential plasma levels of proteins such as L-selectin [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

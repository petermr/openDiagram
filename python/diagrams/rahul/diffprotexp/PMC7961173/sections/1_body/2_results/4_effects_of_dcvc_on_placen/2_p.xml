<p id="Par44">Despite no gene-specific expression levels meeting the FDR criterion, gene set enrichment analysis identified enriched biological and molecular signaling pathways (FDR &lt; 0.05). Five pathways were upregulated and each of these involves a cellular response to stress stimuli (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>b, FDR &lt; 0.05). Representative pathways included: TNFα signaling via NFKB (NES = 2.60, FDR &lt; 0.0001), p53 pathway (NES = 1.93, FDR = 0.002) and unfolded protein response (NES = 1.91, FDR = 0.002). Furthermore, similar to HTR-8/SVneo cells, 8–31% of individual genes enriched within each pathway gene set are specifically regulated by ATF4 (Suppl. Table 6). Despite the lack of significant differential expression for individual genes (FDR &lt; 0.05), these results reflect a collective transcriptional response to DCVC exposure.

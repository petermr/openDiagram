0: The pROC function was utilized to evaluate the performance of target gene in distinction of HD and non-dementia.
1: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves exhibit the performance of dichotomies with sequential output, showing the sensitivity and specificity as output thresholds move into the range of all possible values [ 44].
2: ROC analysis is widely used in medical diagnostics, in which the performance of a classifier is measured by the area under the curve (AUC) [ 45].
3: An AUC value of 100% indicated complete prediction and 50% represented random selection.
4: All P values were bilateral and statistical significance was set to the threshold less than 0.05.

0: Tyrosinase inhibition colorimetric assay was carried out according to the method, as described [ 15,  16].
1: Each essential oil was dissolved in DMSO to obtain concentration of 20 mg/mL.
2: These stock solutions were diluted to 600 g/mL concentration in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5).
3: Arbutin acid was prepared in similar way and used as positive control.
4: 700 L of each sample solution or positive control were combined with 300 L of mushroom tyrosinase (333 Unit per mL in phosphate buffer, pH 6.5).
5: After incubation at 2022 C for 5 min, 1100 L tyrosine (2 mM) were added to each well.
6: Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 492 nm using the spectrophotometer Genesys 10S UVvis (Thermo Scientific, USA).
7: Percent inhibition of tyrosinase activity was calculated according to the formula: inhibition (%) = 100-(W sample/W blank)  100, where W is absorbance at 492 nm.
8: W blank is absorbance of control reaction (containing all reagents without test compound).

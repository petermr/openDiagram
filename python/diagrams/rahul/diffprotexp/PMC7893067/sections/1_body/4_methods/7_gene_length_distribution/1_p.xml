<p id="Par31">Genes expressed in all fetal and adult tissues (base mean expression ≥ 10) were sorted by length. We then employed a sliding window of 200 genes in steps of 40 genes. The log2-fold-change values for the 200 genes within each length bin were averaged and standard errors (SE) for a bin were calculated by propagating the SE determined from the bin’s log2-fold-change values and the mean SE of the individual genes reflecting their sample variability. Similarly, we computed the relationship of transcript and UTRs length, and gene length with expression (RPKM).</p>

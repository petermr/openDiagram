 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f003">Figure 3</xref>a shows the color overlaid image membrane; consequently, the blue and green colors indicate the pores and surface of membrane, respectively. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, pores could be clearly observed in the surface of the membrane at magnification 300×. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f003">Figure 3</xref>c exhibits the average pore size of 0.7 µm for the prepared PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membrane. Therefore, this higher porosity of the membrane leads a pathway to greater ionic conductivity in the matrix [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The thickness of separator membrane was found as 105 µm that is clearly seen through cross-sectional morphological view (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). Moreover, there was no aggregation of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> particles existed in the PVdF polymer membrane, evincing that the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> particles are evenly dispersed into PVdF matrix during the stirring process.

0: Figure 3a) A rechargeable roomtemperature sodium superoxide (NaO   2) battery.
1: b) Different possible pathways for energy storage in nonaqueous NaO   2 and LiO   2 battery.
2: In both metalO   2 battery formed discharge intermediate (O   2) reacts with Li   + ion and Na   + ion.
3: In both cases, metal superoxide is formed but in case of Li, LiO   2 is unstable and further reacts to form Li   2O   2 whereas, NaO   2 is thermodynamically more stable.
4: Other possible reactions are shown in gray color.

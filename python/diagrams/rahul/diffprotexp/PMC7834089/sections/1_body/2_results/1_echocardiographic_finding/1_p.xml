<p>After vagotomy, all mice were infected with CVB3 except for the Control group. pnu282987 was given to VMC mice for consecutive 14 d, starting 24 h after viral inoculation. On d 7 and 14, echocardiography was performed on more than 8 mice in each group. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a</xref>, M-mode images from VMC, VMC+Sham, VMC+Vag, and VMC+V+P groups showed that left ventricular movements were weaker than that in control and VMC+Pnu groups. LVEF and FS of VMC, VMC+Sham, VMC+Vag, VMC+V+P, and VMC+Pnu groups were significantly decreased compared to the control group, but LVESd was slightly elevated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1b</xref>). By d 14, mice that had undergone vagotomy exhibited decreased LVEF and FS, but increased LVESd in the VMC+Vag group compared with the VMC group (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). The damage from vagotomy in the VMC+Vag group was attenuated when pnu282987 was administered to that group (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). And pnu282987 administration significantly improved LVEF and LVFS, but reduced LVESd in the VMC+Pnu group compared to the VMC group (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). LVEDd, LVESd, LVEF, and FS measurements were similar between VMC and VMC+Sham groups (
 <italic>p</italic>&gt; 0.05).

<p>Protein samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) followed by heating at 70°C for 10 minutes. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris mini gels (Invitogen) run at 200 V for 30 minutes, and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper at 45 V for 1 hour. The blot was blocked with 5% non-fat milk dissolved in 0.1% Tween-TBS buffer, and then incubated with antibody against Myelin Basic Protein overnight at 4°C. The blot was washed with 0.1% Tween-TBS buffer and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 hour. The blot was washed with 0.1% Tween-TBS buffer and visualized using chemiluminescence reagent (sc2048, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Images were made by exposing X-ray film (Fuji Super RX) to the blots. The images were analyzed using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).</p>

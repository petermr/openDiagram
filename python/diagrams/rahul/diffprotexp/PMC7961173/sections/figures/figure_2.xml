  <p>Top logFC expression levels for comparisons between treated versus control samples. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0 (control), 10 or 20 µM DCVC for 6 or 12 h. Heatmap depicts expression levels for the 40 genes with the largest magnitude logFC (up and downregulated) from each of the following comparisons: control vs. 10 µM DCVC (6 h), control vs. 20 µM DCVC (6 h), control vs. 10 µM DCVC (12 h) and control vs. 20 µM DCVC (12 h)</p>

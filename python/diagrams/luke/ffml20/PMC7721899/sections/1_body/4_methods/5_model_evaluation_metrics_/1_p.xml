<p id="Par48">In this regression problem, the MSE is majorly selected for the quantification of the model performance on the given data set. The coefficient of determination can be used to quantify the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. In this study, to further assist the model selection in this multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) regression problem, the Pearson correlation coefficient

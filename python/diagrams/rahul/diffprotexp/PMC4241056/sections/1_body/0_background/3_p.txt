0: It is well known that the small intestine is the main region for absorption of Se [ 18] and thus it becomes the target organ for Se research.
1: In the intestine of mice, the Sec-containing metabolite is produced by the reaction between Sec and GSH after oral administration of Sec [ 19].
2: The Caco-2 cell, differentiated human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, is usually used to mimic human intestine as the cell model.
3: This cell is considered to present morphological and enzymatic characteristics of small intestinal cells and has been generally well accepted for estimating human absorption of various drug and nutrient compounds [ 20].

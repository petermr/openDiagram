<p>Supplementary Figure S3: Proportional Venn diagrams showing the number of differentially expressed proteins relative to protein identifications across the three TMT experiments to compare MtzS and MtzR isolates. Proportional Venn diagrams demonstrate that the low overlap between differentially expressed proteins between lines (Fig.Â 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>), is not due to discrepancies in identifications between experiments.

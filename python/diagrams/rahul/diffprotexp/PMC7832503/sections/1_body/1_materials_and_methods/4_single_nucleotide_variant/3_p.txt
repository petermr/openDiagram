0: For rare functional variants analysis, we defined rare SNVs as minor allele frequency<1% in East Asian population from multiple public databases, including 1000 Genomes Project (release in 2013 May), Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC r0.3.1) and Genome Aggregation Database (exome samples data).
1: Then, we classified those coding rare SNVs based on their functional annotation: loss of function (LOF, including start loss, stop loss and splicing site) and missense SNVs.
2: From these annotations, we created two rare variants sets for single gene testing: (1) all functional SNVs (both LOF and missense), (2) only LOF SNVs.
3: Both analyses mentioned above were used optimal sequencing kernel association test (SKAT-O, with parameter: number permutation = 10,000, alpha = 0.05, beta1 = 1, beta2 = 20) in KGGseq software (v1.0) [ 31].
4: We defined the genes with  P < 0.05 statistically significance as candidate loci.
5: In order to identify most potential risk loci, we used influenza A pathway genes from KEGG database (hsa05164) as training gene set and performed a further ranking analysis of all the candidate genes using the ToppGene software [ 32].
6: ToppGene is a one-stop portal for gene list enrichment analysis and candidate gene prioritization based on their functional annotations and protein interactions network.
7: In addition, we used STRING software (v 11.0,  https://string-db.org/) [ 33] to build the protein interaction networks (combined sore > 0.4) of these candidate genes.
8: Then, Cytoscape (v3.5.1) software [ 34] was used to visualize the largest network diagram and speculate the hub genes through the cytoHubba plug-in.

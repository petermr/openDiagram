<p>Sixty-four out of the 285 ACE2 proteins were found to have one or more interface glycosylation sites, including 22 fish, one amphibian, 27 birds, seven mammals, and 7 reptiles (

Interestingly, none of the effective ACE2 receptors in

 <italic>Echinops telfairi</italic>), western European hedgehog (
 <italic>Erinaceus europaeus</italic>), aardvark (
 <italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>), big brown bat (
 <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic>), star-nosed mole (
 <italic>Condylura cristata</italic>), and greater horseshoe bat (
 <italic>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</italic>), where their binding energies were −40.97, −44.99, −38.67, −48.79, −46.46, −45.56, and −44.47 EEU, respectively. Following the binding energy criterion, aardvark’s ACE2 was predicted to be an effective receptor, but it may be ineffective due to glycosylation. The shrew had two interface glycosylation sites, N23 and N41, which form hydrogen bonds with N487 and Y449, respectively (

 </xref>b). Since these asparagine residues could form direct contact with S-RBD, their glycosylation may hinder the binding of the two proteins (i.e., ACE2 and Spike).

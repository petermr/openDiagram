0: Based on our interest in motor preparation, we computed the mean spectral power during the reaction time between target presentation and movement initiation.
1: In the case of the cats, as we had access to electromyographic (EMG) data from the Cleidobrachialis Flexor, responsible for lifting the forelimb, we were able to determine a suitable location for the window from the trial averaged EMG traces.
2: The flexor muscle is consistently quiescent when the animal is sitting quietly but has a robust ramping activity during reaching that onsets prior to the timestamp of the paw lift (Fig.
3: 1C).
4: Thus, a 200 ms window was positioned immediately prior to this ramping activity (Cats B and G: 400200 ms prior to paw lift.
5: Cat S: 100300 ms prior to paw lift).
6: As we did not have access to the equivalent EMG data for human participants, the full reaction time period was used.

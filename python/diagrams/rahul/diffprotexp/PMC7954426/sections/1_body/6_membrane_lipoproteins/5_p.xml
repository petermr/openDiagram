<p>With the continuous exploration of mycoplasma virulence molecules, the predominant role of lipoproteins in the proinflammatoryproinflammatory response of mycoplasmas is increasingly fluctuated. The most significant evidence is that the normal flora, which are parasitic in the oral cavity and other parts, also have lipoproteins with a conserved diacylglyceryl structure but usually does not lead to inflammation. In addition, even the same mycoplasma-derived lipoproteins (with the same S-diacylglyceryl-cysteine moiety but different amino acid sequences) display different proinflammatory effects [

Future studies remain warranted to understand the pleotropic effects of mycoplasma lipoproteins on the inflammatory response, characterize the potentially active molecule responsible for pathogenic mycoplasmas, demonstrate how the pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway mediates the mycoplasma-associated immune response, and develop new therapeutic strategies against mycoplasma infection.

0: The subcellular expression patterns of lncRNA have also been the focus of several studies during the last years.
1: Although a large number of lncRNAs have been identified, the biological relevance for the majority of lncRNAs is still elusive 19,  20.
2: Using microarrays, RNA-seq and imaging technologies, several reports have demonstrated that although lncRNA are mostly localized in the nucleus, cytoplasmic lncRNAs also exist 19,  21  25.
3: In fact, lncRNA subcellular localization was divided into three categories: (1) exclusively expressed in the nucleus, (2) mainly enriched in the nucleus and, (3) mainly enriched in the cytoplasm 26.

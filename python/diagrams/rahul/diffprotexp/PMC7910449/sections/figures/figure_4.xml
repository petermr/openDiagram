  <title>CircRAB11FIP1 sponged miR-129.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold> LV2-1, LV2-2, or LV2-NC was transfected into SKOV3 cells. Later, qPCR was performed to detect miRNA expression. 
   <bold>B</bold> LV6 or LV6-NC was transfected into A2780 cells. Later, qPCR was conducted to detect miRNA expression. 
   <bold>C</bold> miR-129 together with circRAB11FIP1 positions in SKOV3 cells was determined by the FISH assay. 
   <bold>D</bold> CircRAB11FIP1 expression decreased in SKOV3 cell lysate, which was enriched by the circRAB11FIP1 probe, as examined using qPCR. 
   <bold>E</bold> miR-129 expression decreased, which was enriched by the circRAB11FIP1 probe, as verified through qPCR. 
   <bold>F</bold> Prediction of possible binding sites in circRAB11FIP1 for miR-129. SKOV3 cells were transfected with miR-129 mimic or NC (NC) RNA together with pMIR-circRAB11FIP1 or pMIR-circRAB11FIP1m, respectively. Thereafter, the luciferase activities were examined. Error bar stands for standard error.

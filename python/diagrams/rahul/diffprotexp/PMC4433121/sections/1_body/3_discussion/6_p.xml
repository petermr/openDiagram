<p>CMBL is a bioactivating hydrolase with high expression in the human liver and kidney [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We identified significantly different protein levels of CMBL in cyst fluid of cPTCs as compared to benign lesions by LC-MS/MS, however, IHC and WB showed similar expression patterns. It is worth to note that little is known about the biological role of CMBL in normal cells, while carboxymethylenebutenolidase recently was demonstrated in connection to hepatocellular carcinoma [

The ash content is found very high in the current study, indicating the high quality of essential minerals which is comparable with an acceptable ash range of legumes (2.4&#8211;5.0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Acid insoluble ash is an indicator of silicate impurity and water soluble ash is indicated the highly soluble mineral contents in the root sample.</p>

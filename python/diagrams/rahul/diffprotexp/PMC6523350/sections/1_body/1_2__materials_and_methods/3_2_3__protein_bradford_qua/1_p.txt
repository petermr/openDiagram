0: Total protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method [ 22].
1: Eleven Eppendorf (EP) tubes were separately labelled, and the protein standard solution BSA (1 mg mL 1) was accurately weighed into volumes: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 L. Corresponding to the EP tube, the test sample was taken as 1 L. Each tube was then added with the corresponding double volume of deionized water and 180 L working fluid ( Table 1).
2: The mixture was then vortexed for 20 s, mixed, centrifuged and reacted at 60 C for 1 h. The absorbance was measured at 575 nm.
3: A standard curve was prepared: y = 0.3927x  0.0048,  R2 = 0.9914; the quantitative results are shown in  Table 2.

 <caption> MD simulation results showing the basal spacing dependence ( d 001) on (a) the coordination environment of K +, (b) hydrogen bond populations, and (c) diffusion coefficients of water. (a) First-shell coordination of K + to oxygens, belonging to either water (O-water, red) or birnessite (O-BIR, blue).The coordination numbers were calculated from the radial distribution functions up to the minima of the first coordination shell at 0.35 nm ( Figure S9). (b) Number of hydrogen bonds between water and birnessite. (c) Diffusion coefficients of water (red) and K + (blue). Dashed vertical lines indicate ideal 1 W and 2 W hydration states. </caption>

<p id="Par2">The food supply for increasing human population is rapidly declining with scarcity of land and fresh water for agriculture. This problem is further exacerbated by climate change that increases the incidence of various abiotic stress factors. Thousands of species of naturally stress-resistant plants have evolved with time, some of which have already been domesticated by humans and are considered minor crops. Broader cultivation of these minor crops will diversify plant agriculture and human diet and will, therefore, help in improving global food security. More research is, therefore, required for understanding and utilizing these naturally stress-resistant plants. Technologies are now available to rapidly improve plant genetics, with the goal of increasing productivity while retaining stress resistance and nutritional value

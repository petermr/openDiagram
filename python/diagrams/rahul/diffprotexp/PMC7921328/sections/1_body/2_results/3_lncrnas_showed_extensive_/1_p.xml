<p>It is observed that a considerable portion of significantly enriched lncRNA-hallmark pairs were related to immune hallmarks, we next examined the associations between lncRNAs and immunogenomic signatures. Relative activities of 26 tumor immunogenomic signatures were retrieved from a previous study (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Thorsson et al., 2018</xref>), which were utilized to assess the associations between lncRNAs and immunogenomic signatures in prostate cancer (see section “Materials and Methods”). The majority (21 in 26) of immunogenomic signatures have significantly associated lncRNAs, wherein most lncRNAs were positively associated with corresponding immunogenomic signatures (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). “TGF-β response,” “stromal fraction,” “leukocyte fraction,” and “lymphocyte infiltration signature score” have larger number of associated lncRNAs (more than 300 lncRNAs). Besides some differential lncRNAs that were shared among distinct immunogenomic signatures, considerable proportions of lncRNAs were exclusively associated with individual immunogenomic signatures. In particular, almost half of “TGF-β response”-associated lncRNAs were specifically positive associated with “TGF-β response” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, a subset of differential lncRNAs were exclusively negative associated with “wound healing” activity. Specifically, “TGF-β response” showed much higher activity in RP11-166D19.1-high PRAD samples than those in RP11-166D19.1-low PRAD samples (

 <italic>P</italic> = 2.7E-12, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In collection, our analysis suggested lncRNAs as markers of activity levels of immunogenomic signatures in prostate cancer.

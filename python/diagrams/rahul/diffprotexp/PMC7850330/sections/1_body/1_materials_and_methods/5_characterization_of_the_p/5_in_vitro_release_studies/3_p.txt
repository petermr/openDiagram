0: To define the release mechanism of loratadine and sulpiride from the selected nanoemulsions (F2, F3), data was fitted into different kinetic models: Zero order     R=    K0    t (Sood & Panchagnula,     1998)   First order: R=1ek1t (Carbinatto et al.,     2014)   Higuchi diffusion model: Q=KHt1/2 (Higuchi,     1963)   BakerLonsdale model:  32[1(1MtM) 23]MtM)= K3t (Baker & Lonsdale,     1974)   HixsonCrowell cube root law: UR1/3=k4t (Chawla et al.,     2000)

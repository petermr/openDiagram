<p id="Par56">In addition to using low concentrations, we also investigated the effects of DCVC on placental cells for short exposure durations. Although longer exposures may more accurately reflect real-life exposures in vivo, this approach enabled us to evaluate the cellsâ€™ initial response to DCVC exposure, otherwise lost, and elucidate compensatory mechanisms used by the cells during the process of stress-driven compensation. Nevertheless, studies exploring longer DCVC exposure durations on the placenta should also be undertaken to understand the full range of effects on the cells.</p>

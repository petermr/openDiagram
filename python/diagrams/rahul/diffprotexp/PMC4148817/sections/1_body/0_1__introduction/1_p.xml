<p>Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at atomic and molecular scales from 1 to 100 nanometers and the creation of new materials with wide ranging applications in medicine, electronics, biomaterials and energy production. The special properties of nanoparticles include unique surface area/volume ratios, refractive indices, and biological and chemical reactivity. These properties help to extend their applications, but raise concerns about their toxicity and environmental impact [

Likewise, research into the rational delivery and targeting of nanomedicines has yielded promising results, but clearance and toxicity are poorly understood and adverse effects on human health remain a potential problem [

<p id="Par47">Given the importance of immune checkpoints (ICPs) and immunogenic cell death (ICD) modulators in cancer immunity, we next analyzed their expression levels in the different subtypes. Forty-seven ICPs-related genes were detected in both cohorts, of which 41 (87%) genes in ICGC cohort

 <bold>)</bold> were differentially expressed between the immune subtypes. For instance, ADORA2A, BTLA, CD160, CD27, CD40LG, CD48, CTLA4, ICOS, ICOSLG, IDO2, LAG3, LAIR1, NRP1, PDCD1, PDCD1LG2, TIGIT, TNFRSF14, TNFRSF25, TNFRSF4, TNFRSF8, TNFSF14, TNFSF15, TNFSF18, and VSIR were significantly upregulated in IS1 tumors in the ICGC cohort, while ADORA2A, BTLA, CD200, CD200R1, CD244, CD27, CD28, CD40, CD40LG, CD48, CD80, CD86, CTLA4, HAVCR2, ICOS, IDO1, IDO2, LAG3, LAIR1, PDCD1, PDCD1LG2, TIGIT, TMIGD2, TNFRSF18, TNFRSF25, TNFRSF4, TNFRSF8, TNFRSF9, and VSIR were overexpressed in the IS2 tumors in TCGA cohort. Furthermore, the overall expression level of ICPs in the ICGC cohort was higher than that in TCGA cohort. Twenty-eight ICD genes were detected in the ICGC cohort, of which 22 (78.6%) were differentially expressed among the immune subtypes

 <bold>)</bold>. For instance, CALR, IFNB1, MET, EIF2AK4 and P2RY2 were significantly upregulated in IS4 tumors in ICGC cohort, while MET, LRP1, EIF2A, ANXA1 and PANX1 showed significantly higher expression levels in IS5 tumors in TCGA cohort. Therefore, immunotyping can reflect the expression levels of ICPs and ICD modulators and be treated as potential therapeutic biomarkers for mRNA vaccines.

 <caption> Volcano plots of all proteins identified and quantified, illustrating their magnitude, significance, and direction of differential expression observed after 24 h exposure to CNTs (SWCNT, MWCNT) at two different concentrations, 10 Î¼g/mL, 100 ng/mL. The horizontal red line in each graph signifies Pairwise Multiple Comparisons p-value &lt; 0.05 compared to proteins in control cultures grown in parallel. </caption>

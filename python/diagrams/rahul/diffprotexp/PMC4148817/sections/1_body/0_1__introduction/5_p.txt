0: The serous cells also play a role in maintaining airway hydration by selective absorption or secretion of electrolytes which is accompanied by compensatory water flux.
1: Our previous studies showed that CNT exposure over a wide range of concentrations decreases a secretory Cl  flux that is stimulated in response to epinephrine [ 9].
2: Since a compensatory water flux will accompany the Cl  secretion, these results indicate a potential for CNT-induced alterations in airway hydration.

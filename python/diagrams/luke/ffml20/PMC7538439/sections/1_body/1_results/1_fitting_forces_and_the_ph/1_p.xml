<p id="Par10">A particular challenge for hydrogen comes from the hierarchy of energies. The covalent bond is much stronger than the van der Waals attraction between molecules, which is turn is much stronger than the EQQ interactions which determine molecular orientations. To address this our potential combines a hierarchical fitting strategy alongside machine-learning (HMLP) described below.</p>

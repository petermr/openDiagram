<p>To reveal the interaction between antisense lncRNAs and mRNAs, RNAplex software that calculates the minimum base pairing energy based on its thermodynamic structure was used to predict the optimal base-pairing relationship for short interactions between two long-chain RNAs, as well as to predict complementary binding between antisense lncRNA and mRNA. Our data showed that there were 568 predicted interactions between 304 antisense lncRNAs and 289 mRNAs. We found that 43 GO terms were significantly enriched (P &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(a</xref>)) and 174 candidate antisense target genes were enriched in 110 KEGG pathways, including Phagosome, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and RNA transport, which were included in the top 20 enriched terms (

Based on these data, we further obtained other metabolic-related genes enriched in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, oxidative phosphorylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis and other pathways. These results indicated that one of the principal roles of lncRNAs might be the transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

0: The binding site between miR-34b-5p and AQP2 was predicted by the online software Jefferson ( https://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/Precomputed/OptionController?species=HomoSapiens&type=mRNA&version=MB21E78v2).
1: Wild and mutated sequences of the binding site on AQP2 (mut-AQP2 and wt-AQP2) were designed and synthesized according to the prediction.
2: The sequences were inserted into vectors (pGL3-Basic, Promega, MADISON, WI, USA) and then co-transfected with miR-34b-5p mimic or the corresponding negative control into HEK293T cells.
3: Luciferase intensity in the cells was tested using a dual-luciferase reporter kit (Promega) for determining the binding between miR-34b-5p and AQP2.
4: The HEK293T cells were divided into mimic + mut-AQP2 group, mimic + wt-AQP2 group, mimic NC + mut-AQP2 group, and mimic NC + wt-AQP2 group.
5: The assay was performed in triplicate.

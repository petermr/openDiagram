<p>Rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) and rat cardiomyocyte cells (H9C2) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM/F12), cultured with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, NRK-52E cells were cultured in FBS-free medium for another 16 h, then incubated with or without recombined human transforming growth factor β1 (rhTGF-β1) (R&amp;D Systems, MN) at a dose of 5 ng/mL [

To generate conditioned medium, rhTGF-β1-free medium was collected and sequentially centrifuged at 300, 1,200 and 10,000 g for 5, 20 and 30 min, respectively. The control medium was generated in the same way but without exposing to rhTGF-β1 in the first 48 h. Then the recipient cardiomyocytes were incubated with control or conditioned medium and collected for further characterization.

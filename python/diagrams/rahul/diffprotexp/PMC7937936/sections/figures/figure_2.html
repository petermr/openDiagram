 <caption> Correlation of tumor microenvironment (TME) with survival and clinical characteristics. (Aâ€“C) According to the median value of the immune score, stromal score, or estimate score, 502 patients were stratified into the high- or low-score group. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for survival analyses between different score groups in the TCGA-HNSC data set. (D) Females have a worse prognosis than male patients with an OS&lt;5 years ( P&lt;0.05). (E) There was a significant correlation between immune score and T stage ( P&lt;0.05). (F) Immune scores of tumor tissues were significantly lower in male patients than in female patients ( P&lt;0.05). </caption>

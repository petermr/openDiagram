<p>Nine LC–MS/MS runs were performed consisting of three independent biological replicates of three treatments (linear alkane (
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub>), branched chain alkane (pristane), non‐hydrocarbon control (pyruvate)) resulting in 112,095 spectral counts that were assigned to 1309 proteins, representing 48% of the total protein‐coding genes on the 
 <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> SK2
 <sup>T</sup> genome (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="emi14620-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Over half (52%) of the spectral counts were assigned to the 100 most abundantly detected proteins, and 90% were assigned to the 500 most abundant proteins. The remaining 809 proteins (representing 7% of the total normalized spectral counts) were detected with only a very low number of spectral counts.

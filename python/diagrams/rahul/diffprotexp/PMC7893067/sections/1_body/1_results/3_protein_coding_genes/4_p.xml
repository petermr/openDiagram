<p id="Par12">One explanation for the increased abundance of a group of transcripts in the cytosol could be an increased mRNA half-life. To examine if the preferential cytosolic localization of NEMPs was due to long half-life, we used published mRNA half-life data

 </sup> and inquired whether these transcripts have a longer half-life than the rest of protein-coding transcripts. We found that NEMPs displayed significantly longer half-life compared to other protein-coding transcripts (p = 7.1 × 10e−12, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D), which could explain the preferential enrichment of NEMPs in the cytosol. An analysis of the half-life of all protein-coding transcripts significantly associated with the cytosolic or nuclear compartments showed a significant difference in half-life, with a longer half-life for transcripts enriched in the cytosol (p = 1.6 × 10e−21, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E).

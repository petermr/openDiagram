0: Environmental constraints, like drought or low temperatures, can have adverse effects on plants and, as a consequence, can induce stress responses at the molecular and physiological level [ 4] that often leads to yield loss.
1: Furthermore, if such exposure is extended in time, stress causes major alterations in the plant metabolism that ultimately leads to cell death [ 5].
2: Most of the crop plants necessitate optimal growth conditions to maintain a stable production.
3: However, despite extensive research and the use of sophisticated and intensive crop-protection measures, losses due to dehydration stress amount to the billions of dollars annually.

0: The following  P. notatum genotypes were used for this study:  i) Q4117, a tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40) natural obligate apomictic accession originated from Southern Brazil [ 83], and ii) C4-4x, an artificially generated completely sexual induced autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 40) genotype, obtained after chromosome duplication of a sexual diploid plant by colchicine treatment [ 84].
1: Vegetative replicates of these plants are being maintained in experimental plots at Instituto de Botanica del Nordeste (IBONE), CONICET-UNNE, (Corrientes, Argentina) and Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Agrarias de Rosario (IICAR), CONICET-UNR (Rosario, Argentina).
2: Q4117 and C4-4x flowering periods overlap (Q4117: November to April; C4-4x: January to April).
3: Flowering conditions are the same for both genotypes.
4: Voucher specimens of this material are kept at the Herbarium CTES-IBONE (publicly available), under deposition numbers: C4-4X (Quarin, C. L. 4260, barcode CTES0541627, cardboard No.
5: 330064); Q4117 (Quarin, C. L. 4117, barcode CTES0541626, cardboard No.
6: 233851).

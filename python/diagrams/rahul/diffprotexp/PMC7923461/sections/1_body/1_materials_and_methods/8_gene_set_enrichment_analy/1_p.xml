<p id="Par44">Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the normalized RNA-Seq data, which was obtained from TCGA database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The gene ontology (GO) terms and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were used to investigate the possible biological functions of TUBA1C. A false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.050 and a nominal P &lt; 0.050 were considered to be statistically significant.

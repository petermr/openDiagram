<p>The crystal structures of B-SFO@C were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, DX-2700, Cu 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>α</sub> radiation, 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.542 Å). The carbon content in the B-SFO@C was examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Bulid 193). The carbon chemical bonding in B-SFO@C was analyzed by Raman spectra on a LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) using laser excitation at 632.8 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-7500F, Tokyo, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) were performed to observe the microstructure of the samples. The surface electron state of B-SFO@C was identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, AXIS Ultra DLD, Kratos, Manchester, UK). The nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests were performed using a NOVA 1000e analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL, USA).

<p>The pulmonary 
 <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> complex (MAC) disease is the most common in NTM diseases, responsible for over 80% of NTM diseases [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The pulmonary MAC disease is generated due to either 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hominissuis</italic> (MAH) or 
 <italic>M. intracellulare</italic> and their prevalence differ from country to country. The prevalence of pulmonary MAC disease due to MAH is seven times more than that due to 
 <italic>M. intracellulare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The establishment of MAC diseases is associated with many factors; one of these factors is the bacterium themselves. To elucidate the mechanism of pathogenicity related to these bacterial factors that affect the establishment of MAC disease, many genomic and transcriptomic studies have been done. The complete genome of 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> different subspecies and strains has been sequenced: MAH [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the RNA sequencing for 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> was performed for the transcriptome profiling [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, microarray was used in functional genomic research of 
 <italic>M. avium,</italic> enabling a deeper analysis of their genomic diversity and an accurate measuring of most of their gene expressions [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00305" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

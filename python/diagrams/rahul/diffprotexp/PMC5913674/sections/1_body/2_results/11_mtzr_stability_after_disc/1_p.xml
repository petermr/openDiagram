<p>Drug exposure was discontinued in 713- and 106-MtzR lines to observe effects on Mtz resistance (this was not undertaken in the WB-MtzR line due to impracticalities owing to its slow growth rate and lower adherence and confluence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig.Â S8</xref>). MtzR lines were recovered and cultured for 1 week with Mtz drug selection, followed by 12 weeks of routine twice weekly passage (24 passages in total) without drug selection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). Both MtzR isolates had lower confluence levels during original drug selection (week 1, P0; approximately 45%), which improved upon discontinuation of drug selection. In order to achieve higher confluence for routine passage twice a week, higher seed volumes were required between passages for both isolates compared to MtzS lines, an effect that diminished over time as gains in growth were observed (

As both WB-MtzR and 713-MtzR have reduced abundance of beta-giardin and SALP-1 (4410) proteins of the ventral disc [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>) due to changes in the structure of the ventral disc and, therefore, lower confluence and slower division.

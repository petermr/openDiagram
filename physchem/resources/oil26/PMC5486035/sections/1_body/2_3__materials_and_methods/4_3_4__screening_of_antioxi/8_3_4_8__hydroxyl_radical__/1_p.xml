<p>The hydroxyl radical scavenging assay was performed as described by Tellone et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This assay is based on quantification of the degradation product of 2-deoxyribose by condensation with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). The reaction mixture contained the following in the final volume of 1.0 mL: 2.8 mM 2-deoxy-2-ribose, 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 25 µM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 100 µM EDTA, 2.8 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 µM ascorbic acid and sample solution in order to obtain the final concentration range of 15–0.92 µg/mL. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 ± 0.5 °C in a water bath. Then 1.0 mL of 1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) TBA was added to each mixture followed by the addition of 1 mL of 2.8% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The solutions were heated in a water bath at 100 °C for 15 min to develop the pink coloured malondialdehyde–thiobarbituric acid adduct. After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm against an appropriate blank solution. The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).

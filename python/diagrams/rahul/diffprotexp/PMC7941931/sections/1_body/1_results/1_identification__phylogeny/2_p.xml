<p id="Par29">RNA-seq data were further used to investigate the expression profiles of the 26 identified genes in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and during seed development. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, most 
 <italic>RDR</italic> genes (6) had lower expression in all tissues. In contrast, 4 genes (
 <italic>FtAGO1</italic>, 
 <italic>FtAGO2</italic>, 
 <italic>FtAGO6</italic>, and 
 <italic>FtSE1</italic>) had constitutive high expression in all tissues. The remaining 16 genes were expressed at a moderate level. Among them, 4 genes (
 <italic>FtHYL1</italic>, 
 <italic>FtHST2</italic>, 
 <italic>FtAGO4</italic>, and 
 <italic>FtAGO8</italic>) exhibited specifically high expression in seeds. Furthermore, 6 genes (
 <italic>FtDCL1</italic>, 
 <italic>FtDCL3</italic>, 
 <italic>FtDCL4</italic>, 
 <italic>FtAGO2</italic>, 
 <italic>FtAGO3,</italic> and 
 <italic>FtRDR4</italic>) showed significant differential expression (|log2(fold change)| &gt; 1 and FDR value &lt; 0.05) during seed development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The 6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed three expression patterns in the developing Tartary buckwheat seed (1) 
 <italic>FtAGO2</italic> and 
 <italic>FtAGO3</italic> were down-regulated only at the initial maturity stage (S3), (2) 
 <italic>FtDCL1</italic> and 
 <italic>FtRDR4</italic> showed a sustained decrease during seed development, and (3) 
 <italic>FtDCL3</italic> and 
 <italic>FtDCL4</italic> were up-regulated at the peak filling stage (S2) and down-regulated at the initial maturity stage (S3) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

<p>Tedaniophorbasin A (
 <bold>1</bold>) was isolated as fluorescent yellow needles as its TFA salt. Positive HRESIMS measurement of the MH
 <sup>+</sup> peak (at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 265.0863 (Δ −1.2 ppm)) established a molecular formula of C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>N
 <sub>6</sub>OS for 
 <bold>1</bold>, inferring that it contained eight degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum of 
 <bold>1</bold> had absorption bands at 1712 and 1679 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, suggesting that it contained amide and aromatic groups. The UV spectrum had absorption maxima at 223, 280, 296, and 419 nm, indicating that 
 <bold>1</bold> contained an extended aromatic chromophore. Excitation at the absorption maxima at 280 and 419 nm led to intense fluorescence at 490 nm (

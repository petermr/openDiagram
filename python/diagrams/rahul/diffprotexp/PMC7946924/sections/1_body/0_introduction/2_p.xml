  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, investigations have progressed into molecular biology of ethylene signal transduction for elucidation of transcriptome dynamics underplaying synthesis of the protein factors involved in the process
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. It is now known that higher concentration of ethylene synthesized in the poorly developed inferior basal spikelets at early grain filling stage elicits over-expression of ethylene receptor and signal transducer proteins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> which underscores expression of genes encoding endosperm starch synthesizing enzymes and cell cycle regulators

 </sup>. In contrast, superior spikelets located on the apical part of panicle are not subservient to ethylene action and produce high density well filled grains
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. At anthesis neither they produce ethylene profusely nor there is over expression of genes encoding proteins for ethylene signal transduction
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. It is surmised that spikelet specific ethylene production/action could be a factor sub-ordinate to IAA for the apical dominance in grain filling. Our earlier work has shown that IAA primarily promotes grain filling of apical spikelets of rice panicle
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup> and ethylene functions as a second messenger to transmit IAA signal slackening grain filling of basal spikelets

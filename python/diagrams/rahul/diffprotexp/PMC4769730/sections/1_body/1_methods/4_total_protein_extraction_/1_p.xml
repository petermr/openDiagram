<p>Enzymatic pre-digestion was used to extract protein from each specimen (
 <italic>n</italic> = 35 POAG and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 18 post-mortem samples). Briefly, TM specimens were treated with dispaseII (2 µg/mL in HBSS without Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>) for 15 min at 37 °C, diluted 1:1 (v/v) with 2× Lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF and 1 mM PMSF; pH 7.5), homogenized with a Polytron (25 s/0 °C at 21500 rev./min; Ultra Turrax T25 basic; IkaWerke, Staufen, Germany) and briefly sonicated to shear DNA/RNA (VibraCell, Sonics, Newtown, CT, USA). Tissue lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein amount/quality was analyzed using the Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (A1000; Celbio, Milan, Italy). Protein amounts were detected with the A280-Nanodrop option by means of common internal standards, after “blank” options against water and extraction buffer. Data (µg/µL) were used to normalize protein extracts before loading in the specific assay.

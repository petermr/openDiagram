<p>Here, the synthesis, characterizations, as well as barrier and thermal properties of 2,7-CPI were reported. Additionally, the barrier performances of 2,7-CPI are compared with those of a typical polyimide (Kapton) based on diamine 4,4â€²-oxydianiline (ODA) and PMDA and our previous reported structural analogue 2,7-CPPI. Molecular simulation is an increasingly vital tool to provide detailed insights into the structural characteristics and gas transport performances of polymers at a microscopic level, which is hard to obtain by experiments [

In order to elucidate the effect of different diamine structures on the barrier properties of PIs, molecular simulations, WAXD and PALS were utilized to study the chains packing, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, free volume, chains mobility, penetrant trajectories, diffusivities, and sorption behavior of PIs. This will be helpful in revealing the barrier mechanism and developing high-barrier polymer membranes.

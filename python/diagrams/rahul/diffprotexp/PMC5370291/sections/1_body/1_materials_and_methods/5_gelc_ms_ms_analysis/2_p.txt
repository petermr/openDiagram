0: Extracted peptides were separated using an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Dionex LC-Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with a 20 cm x 75 m i.d.
1: fused silica column custom packed with 3 m 120 A ReproSil Pur C18 aqua (Dr. Maisch, GMBH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany).
2: After injection, peptides were trapped at 30 L/min on a 5 mm x 300 m i.d.
3: Pepmap C18 cartridge (Dionex-LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at 2% buffer B (buffer A, 0.05% formic acid in distilled water); buffer B, 80% ACN and 0.05% formic acid in MQ) and separated at 300 nL/min in a 10-40% buffer B gradient in 60 min.
4: Eluting peptides were ionized at 1.7 kV in a Nano made Triversa Chip-based nanospray source using a Triversa LC coupler (Advion, Ithaca, NJ).
5: Intact peptide mass spectra and fragmentation spectra were acquired on an LTQ FT hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany).
6: Intact masses were measured at a resolution of 50,000 in the ICR cell using a target value of 1 x 10 6 charges.
7: In parallel, following an FT prescan, the top 5 peptide signals (charge-states 2+ and higher) were submitted to MS/MS in the linear ion trap (3 amu isolation width, 30-millisecond activation, 35% normalized activation energy, Q-value of 0.25 and a threshold of 5000 counts).
8: Dynamic exclusion was applied to a repeat count of 1 and an exclusion time of 30 sec.

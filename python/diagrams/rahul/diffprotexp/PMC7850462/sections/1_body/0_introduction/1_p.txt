0: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction induced by a disordered host response to infection [ 1].
1: Sepsis is identified in up to 39% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 26% ICU patients [ 2].
2: A normal host response to infection involves activation of phagocytic cells and production of inflammatory mediators, and contributes to the repair of injured tissue.
3: Uncontrolled generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which exceeds the boundary of local infected environment and leads to a more generalized response, will give rise to the initiation of sepsis [ 3].
4: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common disorder which gives rise to approximately 1.7 million deaths and affects about over 13 million people annually, among which patients living in developing countries account for the majority [ 4].
5: AKI is associated with considerable morbidity and high costs since patients who have survived though are likely to suffer from long-term impacts of AKI such as development of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease [ 5].
6: Septic AKI is a commonly diagnosed AKI syndrome which occurs in nearly half of all AKI cases and is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality [ 6].
7: The pathogenic mechanisms of septic AKI involve the direct interaction of resident renal cells with circulating pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators, and apoptosis is one major cellular injury induced during sepsis [ 7].
8: Although there are consensus definitions of sepsis and AKI, the molecular mechanisms for the pathogenesis of septic AKI remain largely undiscovered.

 <italic>solium</italic> secretome, obtained directly from the genome of the helminth; in total, 838 proteins were identified and characterized by their function and antigenicity [

The increasing availability complete genome sequences, that allowed us to systematically examine genetic data and provided us with a complete list of promising biological markers instead of a limited set of candidates, demonstrating the validity of bioinformatics-based approaches to predict a secretome [

<p id="Par57">The regulatory networks of MIR4435-2HG and ELFN1-AS1 are considered to be closely associated with CRC prognosis. Although further functional experiments are required, our findings contribute to the development of MIR4435-2HG and ELFN1-AS1 as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CRC.</p>

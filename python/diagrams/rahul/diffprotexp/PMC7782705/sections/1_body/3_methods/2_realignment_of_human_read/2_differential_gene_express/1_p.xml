 <italic>DESeqDataSetFromTximport</italic>, a DESeq2 object was created and filtered using rows with sum of all counts bigger than 10. Next, 
 <italic>DESeq</italic> function was used with default values. Using the 
 <italic>results</italic> function, we selected all genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01 and fold change (FC) &gt; 1.3. We also used RIN and PMI as covariates (linear regression).

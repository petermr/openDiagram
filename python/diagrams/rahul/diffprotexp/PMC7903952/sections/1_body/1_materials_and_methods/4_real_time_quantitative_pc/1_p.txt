0: TRIzol reagent (Takara bio, Otsu, Japan) was used to extract total RNA from cells or human tissue following the standard process.
1: All-in-One First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA) was used to synthesized cDNA.
2: qRT-PCR was performed on ABI 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems, USA).
3: LncRNA and mRNA levels were detected by using the Sybr Green PCR Master Mix and miRNA levels were detected by using Miscript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany).
4: LINC00466, PPP1R14B and miR-137 were normalized to GAPDH and U6, respectively.
5: Supplement Table 3 listed the primers which were used in this study.
6: 2 Ct method was used to analyze the results.
7: The research was performed three times.

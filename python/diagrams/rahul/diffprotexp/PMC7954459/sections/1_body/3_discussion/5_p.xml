<p>Genes associated with QTLs are known to govern agronomic traits. We investigated the miRNAs and their target genes located within known QTLs associated with seed size/weight. We identified several known genes involved in seed development processes, such as 
 <italic>SPL</italic>, 
 <italic>MYB</italic>, and 
 <italic>ARF</italic> (Rodrigues &amp; Miguel, 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) originated from the known QTLs and targeted by miR156, miR159, and miR160, respectively. Interestingly, many miRNAs that targeted known seed size regulators genes were also found to be originated from these QTLs. Moreover, we detected few target genes encoding TPR domain protein, LRR repeat protein, cysteine proteinases, and early nodulin‐like protein 2, originated from QTLs that are involved in various biosynthetic processes, transport, and signaling pathways. These genes were targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs that originated from the QTLs. These target genes along with conserved seed size regulators represent important candidate genes involved in miRNA‐mediated seed size/weight determination in chickpea. These miRNAs and targets need to be investigated further for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying seed size/weight determination process.

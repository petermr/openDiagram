<p>2,7-CDN (2.572 g, 10 mmol) and absolute ethanol (450 mL) were added into a three-necked flask with stirring for 0.5 h at room temperature under argon atmosphere to remove oxygen. Then, the mixture was heated to 80 °C, and Pd/C (0.02 g) and hydrazine hydrate (5 mL) were added with stirring at 80 °C for 24 h under argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the Pd/C was removed by filtration and the grey white diamine (2,7-CDA) was obtained by lower temperature crystallization. Yield: 93 % (1.834 g). IR (KBr,

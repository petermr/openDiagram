0: If the baseline measurement is also performed with two inert reference samples, the value of the excess specific heat capacity results after data evaluation [ 27].
1: This evaluation usually includes normalizing the heat flow values by the scanning rate and sample mass to the value of the specific heat capacity.
2: This allows the comparison of different experiments with varying scanning rates.
3: In this work, it was not possible to normalize the heat flow by the scanning rate, as the scan rate of the soaking step equals zero.
4: Therefore, the isothermally measured heat flow after scanning an alloyed sample  versus a pure aluminum reference sample was used for evaluation.
5: The heat flow curve obtained from the same temperature time profile for two pure aluminum samples was subtracted as a baseline measurement.
6: This baseline subtraction is necessary to distinguish the sample heat flow from instrumental artefacts.
7: Due to small asymmetries between the baseline and sample measurement (e.g., due to different sample or lid positions [ 36]), this does not necessarily result in a zero value in reaction-free time ranges.
8: However, one basic assumption for the evaluation is that heat flow equals zero as long as no reactions are occurring in the sample.
9: Therefore, the heat flow curves were vertically shifted with respect to time ranges where no reactions are expected ( Figure 2).

 </sup>. Different carbons are chosen and modified with different morphologies. In order to reinforce the mechanical strength of the self-standing film, VGCF carbon fibers with a fiber length of ~10–20 µm are employed to form a carbon current collector with cellulose fibers. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) and spherical Denka carbon are also modified. These two types of carbon are employed to form the cathode and anode on the as-prepared current collector. Graphite is also modified but is only used as an active material.

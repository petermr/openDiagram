<p id="Par29">Lamins, evolutionarily conserved nuclear envelope proteins, are important for maintaining normal cell functions, including DNA replication, gene expression, chromatin organization, mitosis regulation, nuclear stability, and signal transduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lamins, existing in the form of dimers, include three types type A, type B, and type C. In the lamin family, lamins A and C are encoded by the LMNA gene originated from the same transcription by alternative splicing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mutations of LMNA gene can cause a wide array of heart diseases, such as atrial arrhythmia, atrioventricular block, sinus bradycardia, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM is a severe cardiac heterogeneous pathology characterized by ventricular dilatation and systolic impairment, which is accompanied by thromboembolism, arrhythmia, and even sudden death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. DCM is also a leading cause of heart failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. LMNA mutations can cause autosomal dominant inheritable cardiomyopathy, accounting for 10% of DCM. In comparison with other etiologies of DCM, LMNA mutation-associated DCM not only has high incidences and faster progress, but also is more malignant even when the ventricular impairment is mild [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At present, there are certain insights into the pathogenesis of LMNA mutation-associated DCM. However, due to the complexity of LMNA mutations, patients with the same mutation have different clinical characteristics. The phenotype-genotype correlation also increases the difficulty of LMNA mutation-associated DCM understanding. Therefore, our knowledge about the DCM mechanisms caused by LMNA mutation is vague and incomplete.

0: Most P4-ATPases form heterodimeric complexes with members of the Cdc50/LEM3 protein family, and this association is essential for trafficking of the P4-ATPase/Cdc50 complex [ 21], and for activity [ 22].
1: The recent Cryo-EM structures of four P4-ATPases in complex with their respective Cdc50 subunits have revealed the structural basis of P4-ATPase/Cdc50 association [ 2328]  P. falciparum encodes three putative Cdc50 proteins (annotated as Cdc50A, Cdc50B and Cdc50C) also well conserved in  Plasmodium species.
2: Gene-disruption of either of these putative Cdc50 proteins affects parasites progression in the blod stages [ 6].
3: A recent study in  P. yoelii has shown that Cdc50A interacts and stabilizes the GC/Cdc50A complex, mandatory for the gliding motility and midgut traversal of the ookinetes in the mosquito vector and, consequently, for parasites transmission [ 29].
4: Also, its related Cdc50A homolog in  Toxoplasma gondii is mandatory for bringing its GC partner to the plasma membrane prior cellular egression [ 30].

0: In this study, we aimed to explore the differential protein expression in response to TNF by using a label-free quantitative proteomic approach, combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and spectra counting, to identify and semi-quantitate the changes of protein expression in HCC cell HepG2.
1: The identified proteins with significant change were subjected to gene ontology (GO), KEGG annotation analysis, and biological evaluation of the understanding of specific pathways and subcellular processes induced by TNF.

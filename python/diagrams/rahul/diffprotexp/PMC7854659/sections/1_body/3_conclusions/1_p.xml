<p id="Par34">Our approach identified the complex gene network on day 50 of gestation that underlies cross-tissue communication in response to maternal nutritional restriction. We identified major regulators driving gene expression and found differences in the regulatory mechanisms involved with developmental programming between fetuses gestated in nutrient restricted and control dams. In particular, moderate dam nutrient restriction led to differential regulation of myogenic factors by the 
 <italic>ZBTB33</italic> and 
 <italic>ZNF131</italic> TFs that may negatively affect myogenesis. In addition to tissue-specific pathways, the over-representation of nutrient-sensing signaling pathways across tissues, such as mTOR, PI3K/Akt, and insulin, shed light on their role in fetal programming. Further research is still needed to determine the role of epigenetics and chromatin remodeling in developmental programming, their interplay with nutrition, and their impact on animal health and performance.

<p id="Par12">In addition to differentially retained introns, we identified 395 differentially used exons (diffUEs) in the Kasumi-1 transcriptome following 
 <italic>RUNX1/RUNX1T1</italic> knockdown (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1j</xref>; Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The list of the identified diffUEs included 387 canonical exons and 8 retained introns affecting 275 genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g, h</xref>). Interestingly, while these diffUEs were uniformly distributed across non-coding RNAs, in protein-coding transcripts they were significantly enriched for 5’-UTR exons and depleted for CDS, 3’-UTR and multi-type exons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>).

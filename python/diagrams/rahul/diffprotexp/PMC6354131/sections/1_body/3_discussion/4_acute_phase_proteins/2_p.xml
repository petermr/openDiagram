<p id="p0110">HP (haptoglobin) binds free plasma hemoglobin, allowing degrading enzymes to reach hemoglobin, while preventing iron loss through the kidneys, which are therefore protected from hemoglobin induced damage. In critically ill patients with sepsis, elevated plasma levels of haptoglobin are associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality, independently of confounders. Increased haptoglobin amounts may play a protective role in sepsis patients with elevated levels of circulating cell-free hemoglobin, beyond its previously described function of acute phase reactant.

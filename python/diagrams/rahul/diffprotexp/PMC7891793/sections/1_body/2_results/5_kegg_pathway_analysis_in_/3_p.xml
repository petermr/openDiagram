<p>Interestingly, most of the complex immunopathology pathways or response to pathogen pathways were enriched in group 6 and often in both LL and LN, for example: asthma, allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease. Among all pathways, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection was the most common enriched pathway for most groups (groups 1, 2, 6 –in LL and 1 and 6 –in LN). Measles pathway enrichment was also common among most of the treatment groups, but only in LN.

<p id="Par49">We used GSEA analysis to predict the enriched KEGG pathways between high and low expressions of genes in a subnetwork. PLAU, encoding a secreted serine protease, was positively correlated with “extracellular matrix”, “angiogenesis”, and “serine hydrolase activity”. LOX was significantly enriched in “extracellular matrix”, “cell adhesion molecule binding”, and “angiogenesis”. VCAN belongs to the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family, which was positively correlated with “extracellular matrix component”, “cell adhesion molecule binding”, and “proteoglycan metabolic process”. COL5A2 encodes one alpha chain of fibrillar collagen trimers. The high expression of COL5A2 was correlated with “extracellular matrix”, “collagen trimer”, and “collagen fibril organization”, whereas E2F1 was negatively correlated with “biological adhesion”, “regulation of cell adhesion”, and “cell motility” (Fig.

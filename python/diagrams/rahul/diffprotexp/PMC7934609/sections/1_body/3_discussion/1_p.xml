 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> is an important parasite that causes cystic echinococcosis in domestic animals and humans. Although the research on genomic analysis of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> has provided significant insights into the occurrence and development, immunobiology [
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], evolution and mechanisms, there are also reports that there are still outstanding deficiencies in the available genomic resources [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similar to other reports [
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], identification and characterization of the proteins expressed by the main stages of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> might help to understand the complexity of the parasites and their interactions with the host [
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is also helpful to identifying new candidates for immunodiagnosis and vaccine development.

 <caption> Visualizing Rad-6 with Kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA). a kPCA based on an intensive kernel. b kPCA based on an extensive kernel. Points are colored according to the DFT atomization energy per atom in ( a) and total atomization energy in ( b). The arrows provide a qualitative interpretation of the principal component (PC) axes and small black dots indicate the FPS-selected training configurations for a ML model with 1000 training molecules and using the corresponding distance criterion ( D int ( a), D ext ( b)), see text. </caption>

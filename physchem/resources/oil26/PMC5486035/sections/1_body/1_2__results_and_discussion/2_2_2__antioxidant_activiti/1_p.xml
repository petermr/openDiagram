<p>Reactive oxygen species are involved in the pathological development of many important human diseases, thus antioxidants play a crucial role in human health due to their unquestionable beneficial effects on living organisms that enable them to overcome oxidative injuries, and modulate biological pathways and membrane functionality [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this article, the authors conducted the analysis of antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of HEO by using several antioxidant assays (hydrogen atom transfer and electron transfer-based methods) in order to check their behaviour under different reaction environments and mechanism typologies. This aspect is often overlooked but is critical in order to establish the structure-scavenging activity relationship of the major components of the phytocomplex investigated [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01212-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the antioxidant and free radical-scavenging potential of HEO towards Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-TPTZ (A), ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> (B), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
 <sup>•</sup> (C) as well as its iron chelating capacity (D). Moreover, the antiradical properties of HEO against two of the most common and dangerous reactive oxygen species produced in the organisms, superoxide anion (O

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01212-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the HEO showed a remarkable dose-dependent antioxidant and free-radical scavenging activity towards all assays performed, with the following order of potency, expressed as the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC

 <sup>•</sup>OH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.003 mg/mL) &gt; Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP; IC

 <sub>50</sub> 0.128 mg/mL) &gt; DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.878 mg/mL) as well as having showed a strong iron chelating capacity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.017 mg/mL). The strong antioxidant activity was also confirmed by Folin-Ciocalteu assay results (1278.44 ± 41.79 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g of HEO).

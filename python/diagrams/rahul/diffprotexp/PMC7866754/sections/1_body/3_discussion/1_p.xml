<p id="Par56">Despite years of research efforts, malaria continues to be one of the most severe global health problems and affects millions of pregnant women and children in the African Regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This can be attributed to several factors including the rise of resistance to anti-malarial drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] and the lack of a vaccine that has high efficacy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is, therefore, of great interest to discover new vaccine candidates and novel drug targets. Additionally, the genome annotation of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> remains relatively incomplete where a large portion of genes remains functionally unannotated and regulatory elements outside coding sequences are not included [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As an attempt to address these issues, proteogenomics analysis was performed to discover novel open reading frames that would not have been identified using conventional approaches and could enhance the current understanding in the parasite biology. The datasets analysed are the total transcriptomes and proteomes of oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which correspond to the life-cycle stages that are mosquito-infectious and human-infectious, respectively, and the identified nORFs could, therefore, contribute to the understanding of the development of infectivity.

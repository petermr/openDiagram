<p>The interactions between lipoproteins and TLRs have attracted significant attention. Mycoplasma lipoproteins are primarily recognized by TLR2 in cooperation with TLR6. Although some studies have indicated that TLR1 is also involved in this process [
 <xref rid="cit0276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>], TLR4 is not involved in lipoprotein recognition. However, Santos-Junior et al. have demonstrated that 
 <italic>U. diversum</italic> lipoproteins interact with TLR4, and then induce higher inflammatory cytokine expression via the NF-кB signaling pathway to evoke an inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="cit0277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that TLR4 serves as the receptor for 
 <italic>U. diversum</italic>-derived lipoproteins. The endotoxin level in the obtained lipoproteins was not mentioned in their experiment, although an extremely low dose of endotoxin contamination may cause false positive results. At the same time, if any lipids were mingled with the lipoprotein during the extraction procedure, that may also affect the results. Thirdly, there are several factors that affect TLR recognition, including but not limited to the spatial structure or amino acid sequence of some lipoproteins [
 <xref rid="cit0276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>]. Santos-Junior’s study was further supported by Shio et al. Both TLR2 and TLR4 interact with HLA-DR and increase the binding and presentation of antigens to T cells following infection with 
 <italic>M. arthritidis</italic> in macrophages [
 <xref rid="cit0278" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. The Peltier group also confirmed that the lipid-associated membrane proteins of 
 <italic>U. urealyticum</italic> can interact with TLR2 and TLR4 to cause inflammation [
 <xref rid="cit0279" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction of ureaplasma with TLR4 warrants further investigation.

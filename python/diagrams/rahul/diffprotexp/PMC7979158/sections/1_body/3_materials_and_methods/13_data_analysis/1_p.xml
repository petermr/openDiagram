<p>For all experiments, data was collected from at least two (usually three, and sometimes more, as indicated in each analysis) experiments and is presented as the mean ± SEM. Protein validation data were analyzed by Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA, followed where appropriate by Tukey’s honestly significant difference 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> test (Graphpad Prism v.7). Significance was defined as: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001. Samples for RNA-seq were randomly collected across litters and processed blind to experimental condition. For differential gene expression analysis using edgeR, differences were considered statistically significant at high stringency for FDR &lt; 0.05, or with reduced stringency for p values &lt; 0.05.

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> produced by SOD and other metabolic pathway associated reactions in crop plants. Here, CAT activity was higher in HD3086 under HS during grain-filling stage. MAPK influences the ROS level by affecting the catalase activity in plant under HS. Similar findings have been reported by Sinha et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The accumulation of osmolyte is one of the important defence mechanisms of plants under multiple stresses. The accumulation of proline showed significant increase under HS. Qaseem et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported similar findings in wheat. Osmotic stress activates the MAPKs as reported in 
 <italic>Medicago</italic> and Tobacco [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. MAPK-based signaling under stress condition activates the proline biosynthetic enzyme (P5CS and P5CR) and induces higher accumulation of proline [

<p>A typical system consists of a lipid bilayer surrounded by water and one of the compounds (

 </sup> The so-called “Berger lipids” can be combined with the GROMOS representation of the compounds.

 </sup> Hence, the GROMOS54a7 force-field was used to model the 26 compounds. Moreover, the CHARMM36

 </sup> in the case of the CHARMM36 force-field. In general, the ATB server combines a knowledge-based approach with quantum mechanical calculations. First, the ligand was optimized using the HF/STO-3G theory and then reoptimized at a more advanced level B3LYP/6-31G*.

 </sup> To estimate the point charges of compound atoms, the electrostatic potential was fitted using the Kollman–Singh procedure.

<p id="par0080">For the heterologous expression of the candidate MAPK gene, we designed gene-specific forward and reverse primers with restriction site of 
 <italic>Hin</italic>dIII at 5′ end and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I at 3′ end using Genefisher2 software (Table S2). Oligo Analyzer (Integrated DNA Technologies, USA) was used for analyzing the quality of the oligo’s. An amplicon of 1100 bp (coding region) containing 
 <italic>Hin</italic>dIII and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I restriction sites were amplified using HiFi 
 <italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase (Thermo Scientific, USA). The amplicon was double digested with 
 <italic>Hin</italic>dIII and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I and again gel purified to be used for the ligation. The expression vector (
 <italic>pET28a</italic>) was linearized by double digestion with 
 <italic>Hin</italic>dIII and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I followed by gel purification. The gel eluted MAPK gene was ligated with the linearized vector by incubating it at 16 °C for 16 h. The recombinant 
 <italic>pET28a_</italic>MAPK plasmid was mobilized into 
 <italic>BL-21 (DE3)</italic> strain of 
 <italic>E.coli.</italic> Colony PCR and RE analysis was used for analyzing the positive transformants and other steps for the standardization of IPTG concentration, induction and purification of recombinant protein were followed as explained in Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. SDS-PAGE of induced (0.9 mM IPTG) and un-induced 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells harboring the 
 <italic>pET28a_</italic>MAPK was carried out on 12% resolving gel. The homogeneity and purity of the recombinant protein was analyzed by resolving it on the SDS-PAGE [

<p>Because the influence of gravity, it shows that the casting speed of vertical type twin-roll casting (VTRC) is higher than horizontal-type twin-roll casting (HTRC), and the heat transmission of the former is more effective [

 <xref rid="B26-materials-10-00420" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, based on the VTRC process, thermal history experienced by metallic materials during casting process was computed, and the cooling rate was also calculated. In order to make a judgment on the process cooling ability in producing metallic glasses, a continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram was proposed. The influences of casting parameters on glass forming were discussed. As Al-rich metallic glasses are interesting lightweight alloys with a high specific strength (compressive fracture strength exceeded 1000 MPa) which make them a potential material for aerospace applications [

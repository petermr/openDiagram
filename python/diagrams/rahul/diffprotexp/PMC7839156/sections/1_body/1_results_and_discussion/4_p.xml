<p>The SARSCOVIDB comprises data from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geographic regions (

 </xref>D). However, studies have still given little importance to the impact that the mutations suffered by strains in different regions may have on disease dynamics and virulence, as occurred with ZIKV for instance.

 </sup> Interestingly, almost 50% of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates or clinical samples studied are from China, followed by America (around 16%) and Europe (around 16%). It is important to highlight that depending on the origin, viral isolates of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to different pathological impacts and mortality rates, as previously suggested.

 </sup> The most recent example of a virus that had a differential clinical impact, depending on the origin, was ZIKV, where Brazilian isolates were strongly associated with severe neurological data.

 </sup> Thus, the SARSCOVIDB contributes to the study of the pathology on the origin of the virus, once it is possible to promptly cross-reference expression data in similar models using viruses from different sources.

<p>Alterations in the expression levels of proteins were validated by western blotting using CAD and CAA samples, and normal samples for comparison. Five proteins (CFH, MBL2, KNG1, FN1 and SERPINC1) were validated in 12 groups of samples (each including 1 control, 1 CAD and 1 CAA sample); the results for 5 of 12 validated groups are presented in 
 <xref rid="f5-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. The protein expression results for the 5 proteins exhibited high specificity and were consistent with the proteomics results observed in the iTRAQ. In particular, MBL2 and CFH exhibited reduced expression levels within the CAD samples, and the opposite results were obtained for KNG and SERPINC1, in which the expression levels were downregulated within CAA samples. The expression levels of FN1 were downregulated in the CAD and CAA samples when compared with the control samples.

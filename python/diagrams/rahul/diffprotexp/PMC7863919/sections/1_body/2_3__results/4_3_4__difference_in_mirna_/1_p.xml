<p>The difference in gene expression profiles between 
 <italic>USP8</italic>mut and 
 <italic>USP8</italic>wt tumors was determined using sequencing data for 24 tumor samples, which were also included in miRNA–mRNA correlation analysis. The results of differential analysis indicated 1648 DEGs that met the criterion of adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. In order to identify DEGs with expression differences resulting from distinct miRNA profile in corticotroph tumors, stratified according to 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutation status, we compared the results of three analyses: differential gene expression analysis, differential miRNA expression analysis, and identification of putative miRNA–mRNA interaction. DEGs with a direction of expression fold change that is concordant with the sign of correlation and the expression change of the corresponding miRNA were considered relevant. In case of genes with a negative miRNA–mRNA correlation, we looked for genes with opposite fold change signs, while in the case of genes with positive correlation, we looked for genes with the same fold change signs.

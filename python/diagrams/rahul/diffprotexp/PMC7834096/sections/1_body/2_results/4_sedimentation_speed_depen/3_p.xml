<p>To test if antibodies raised against the different AAF variants inhibit the sedimentation phenotype, we added suspensions of purified antibodies raised against the different AAF subtypes to EAEC strain 55989

 <sup>−</sup> expressing AAF/V, the sedimentation was not affected upon addition of the α-AAF/V antibody. However, as the antibody for AAF/V was also requiring substantially more time for the detection of the AAF/V signal in the Western blot analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2d</xref>) we assume that the concentration of the antibody stock solution was in this case too low for a complete block. In summary, the different heterologously expressed AAF variants promote bacterial aggregation and sedimentation to varying degrees. If the interaction of the AAF among each other is disturbed, e.g. by adding AAF-specific antibodies, sedimentation is inhibited.

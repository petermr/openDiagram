0: Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) analysis of vancomycin diffusion through single and mixed-species biofilms with and without DNAse treatment.
1: To visualize the effect of eDNA enzymatic digestion on vancomycin diffusion through single and mixed biofilms, confocal scanning laser microscopy was performed as we previously described [ 29], with modifications.
2: Single-species  S. aureus or mixed-species  C. albicans-S. aureus biofilms were grown on glass coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek Co., Ashland, MA), as described above, for 24 hrs.
3: Following incubation, biofilms were treated with DNAse I (0.625 mg/ml) or fresh RPMI (control) and fluorescent vancomycin conjugated to BODYPI FL (1 g/ml; 488/650) was added to both control and treated biofilms, and the system was incubated for 1 hr at 37C.
4: S. aureus cells were stained with concanavalin A (ConA) conjugated to Alexa 657 (50 g/ml; 650/668 nm) and  C. albicans with calcofluor-white (0.05%; 433/355).
5: Biofilms were gently washed and immediately observed in an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon T2i).
6: At least three random fields were visualized for each sample, and representative images of the reconstructed Z-stacks are presented.

<p>The transcriptome data of GI cancer were integrated, and tumor samples were divided into the high and low expression groups according to the median level of the 
 <italic>GSK3B</italic> gene expression. In total, 2,071 significantly up-regulated and 695 significantly down-regulated genes were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). In order to find the probable drug targeting the 
 <italic>GSK3B</italic> gene 
 <italic>via</italic> the CMap database, we screened the first 150 genes in the up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. Streptozotocin was the highest score in the prediction. Next, the PubChem database was applied to obtain the 3D structure of streptozotocin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>). Next, 280 target genes were gained through the PharmMapper database. Then, we chose the common genes between 274 drug targets and 2,766 differential genes of the 
 <italic>GSK3B</italic> gene, and finally, 29 genes were used for PPI network with this compound on streptozotocin, including

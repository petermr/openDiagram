 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/</ext-link>) (with options ktrim = r, k = 23, mink = 11, tpe, tbo, qtrim = rl. trimq = 15, maq = 20, minlen = 70). Only reads with an average Phred quality score of 20 and a minimum length of 70 bp were used in downstream analyses. De novo assembly of trimmed reads was performed using Trinity (version 2.6.6)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> using default parameters. The assembly was filtered using TransRate (version 1.0.3)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> and redundant transcripts (with a minimum similarity of 95%) were removed using cd-hit-est (version 4.7)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. To assess the quality of the final transcriptome assembly, the percentage of raw reads represented in the assembly was estimated by mapping with Bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup> and assembly completeness according to conserved metazoan ortholog content was assessed using BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs, version 3.0.1)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Transcript abundance was determined using Salmon (version 0.9.1)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup> and differential expression analysis was performed using the Bioconductor software package edgeR (version 3.16)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. Differentially expressed transcripts between captive and wild mussels were defined as those with a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 
 <italic>0.05</italic> and a minimum fold-change of 2.

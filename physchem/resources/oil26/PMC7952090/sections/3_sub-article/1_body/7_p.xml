<p>This study addresses the question of whether duplication of tumor suppressor genes occurred coincidently with the enlarged body size of Afrotherian mammals. By reconstructing ancestral body sizes, cancer risks and gene duplication events across the Afrotherian phylogeny, the study shows that both increased body sizes and reduced cancer risks evolved gradually. Reactome pathway enrichment analysis for gene duplicates showed that gene duplicates in both lineages with or without major increases in body size / lifespan / decreases in cancer risk are enriched in many cancer related pathways. However, the authors found that 157 genes duplicated in Proboscidean stem-lineage, in which extremely large species evolved, were uniquely enriched in 12 cancer pathways. These genes might facilitate the further body enlargement and cancer resistance evolution in Proboscideans. Most interestingly, the authors found that several genes both upstream and downstream of a famous tumor suppressor TP53 have also been duplicated, either before or after initial TP53 duplication. These genes are involved in transcriptional regulation of TP53 and may have facilitated re-functionalization of TP53 retroduplicates. Overall, this is an important and interesting study that can help us understand the evolution of body size, lifespan and cancer risk in mammals more deeply.</p>

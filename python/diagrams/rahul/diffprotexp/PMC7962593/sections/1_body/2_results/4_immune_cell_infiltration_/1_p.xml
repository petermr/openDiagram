<p>In the enrichment results, we found that a large number of immune-related biological functions were significantly down-regulated in sepsis samples. Therefore, we assessed immune cell infiltration in sepsis patients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5A</xref>). Unsurprisingly, sepsis was associated with significantly reduced infiltration by most types of immune cells, except that infiltration by macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils was elevated. Cytotoxic T cell types were defined based on gene markers, and CD8+ T cells were treated as one subtype of T cells with different gene markers than other subtypes.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The ssGSEA scores for these different subtypes were used to generate immune cell interaction networks. We grouped the differentially infiltrated immune cells into four clusters (

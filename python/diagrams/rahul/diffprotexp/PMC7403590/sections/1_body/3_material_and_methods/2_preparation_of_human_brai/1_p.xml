<p id="Par35">Brain tissue was preserved at − 80 °C, and a small fraction of tissue (1 mg) was homogenized in a glass homogenizer in 1% Triton X-100 containing hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, and a 1:1,000 dilution of a protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Tissue suspensions were then frozen three times in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 20,000×

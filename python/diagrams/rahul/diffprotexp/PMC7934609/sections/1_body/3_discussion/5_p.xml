<p>In the present study, we found that the expression levels of HSP60 and HSP70 proteins in the samples of the oncosphere were significantly higher than that of the samples of adults and the protoscolex of 
 <italic>E. granulosus,</italic> reaching a significant level of difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). We speculate that the reason for this difference in expression may be due to the fact that, under natural conditions, the eggs of the 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> enter the digestive tract of the body after being swallowed by the host from the external environment, and they are stimulated by digestive juices to shed their shells and hatch into oncospheres. In this process, with the loss of the eggshell protection, the change of environmental temperature and physicochemical conditions, as well as the killing effect of the host immune response, put the oncosphere under stress, which leads to the high expression of HSP60 and HSP70 proteins to enhance virulence and immune evasion. Subsequently, the oncosphere develops into recalcitrant parasites such as the adult and protoscolex in intermediate and definitive hosts; the living environment is relatively stable, the stress state gradually subsides, and the expression levels of the two proteins decrease. As a result of this change in expression, it is speculated that HSP60 and HSP70 can be used as a prognostic indicator to detect the early stage infections of intermediate and definitive hosts [

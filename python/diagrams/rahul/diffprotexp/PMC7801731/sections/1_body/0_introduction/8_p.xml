<p id="Par9">We have now applied RNA-seq technology to the analysis of intestinal regeneration in our model system, the sea cucumber 
 <italic>Holothuria glaberrima.</italic> More importantly, to narrow down the genes involved in the early steps of the regenerative process we made two critical modifications in our experimental strategy. First, we focused on tissues at day 1 and day 3 of regeneration, stages that take place prior to, or concomitant with, the first observed cellular events. Second, regenerating tissues were compared to normal, uneviscerated mesentery. By using this approach, we obtained a real view concerning temporal differential gene expression during early stages of intestinal regeneration. Moreover, we were able to obtain a considerable amount of information regarding novel transcripts that appear to be activated during regeneration.

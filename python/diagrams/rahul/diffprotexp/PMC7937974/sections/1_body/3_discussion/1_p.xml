<p>The main finding of this study is that the upregulation of E-selectin was related to the endotheliaâ€“monocyte interaction in KD sera-treated HCAECs, which may be one of the mechanisms of CAL formation. The upregulation of ATP production and mitochondrial OXPHOS may be the underlying mechanism.</p>

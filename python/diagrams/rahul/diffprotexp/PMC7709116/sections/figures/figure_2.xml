  <p>Fluorescence-activated sorting of nuclei from Drd1a:EGFP-L10a or Drd2:EGFP-L10a transgenic mice. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry gating strategies for sorting of D1 or D2 nuclei from wild-type (WT) mouse and Drd1a:EGFP-L10a or Drd2:EGFP-L10a transgenic mice. The double positive-isolated nuclei fraction is shown in the dot-plot of GFP fluorescence versus DyeCycle Ruby (DCR) fluorescence. DyeCycle Ruby binds to the DNA and aids the identification of singlets versus aggregated nuclei. The data from WT mice were used to set a threshold for the GFP signal background. FSC-A: Forward scatter area, SSC-A: Side scatter area, FSC-H: Forward scatter height. (
   <bold>B</bold>) After sorting, nuclei were verified by fluorescence microscopy and (
   <bold>C</bold>) Western blot (See

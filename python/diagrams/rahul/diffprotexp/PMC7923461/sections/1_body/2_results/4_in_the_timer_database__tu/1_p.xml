<p id="Par49">In this study, TIICs played a decisive role in the prognosis and survival of LUAD patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, we used TIMER database to further explore the relationship between the prognosis and survival of infiltrating immune cells and TUBA1C expression in LUAD tissues. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b negative correlation exists between TUBA1C expression levels and the infiltrating level of B cells (r =  − 0.331, P = 8.22e−14) and CD4+ T cells (r =  − 0.2, P = 9.64e−06). In LUAD tissues, TUBA1C expression was associated with poor prognosis and high immune infiltration. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, the infiltrating level of B cell and TUBA1C expression were the factors related to the cumulative survival rate of LUAD.

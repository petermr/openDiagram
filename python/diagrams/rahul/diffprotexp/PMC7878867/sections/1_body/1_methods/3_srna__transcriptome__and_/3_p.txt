0: The degradome libraries (Supplementary Table  S2) were prepared and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 at LC-Bio as previously described 28.
1: Bioinformatics analysis of degradome-seq was performed using the CleaveLand package and the ACGT101-DEG program as previously described 28.
2: Degradome-seq signatures were analysed to determine mRNA targets that were post-transcriptionally regulated by durum miRNAs.
3: For details, see Methods  S1.
4: Normalised reads abundance of target genes were expressed in TPB (transcripts per billion).

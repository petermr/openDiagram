<p>Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) represent about 10–20% of all intracranial neoplasms in adults. They may arise from various kinds of secretory cells of pituitary gland, including corticotroph cells, which produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Corticotroph PitNETs commonly cause ACTH-dependent Cushing’s disease (CD); however, a notable proportion of tumors originated from corticotropic pituitary cells are endocrinologically non-functioning and classified as silent corticotroph tumors commonly referred to as silent corticotroph adenomas (SCA). Both active and silent corticotroph PitNETs share a similar molecular profile [

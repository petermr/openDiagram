<p>We subsequently analyzed the associations of LE genes with PC relapse or biochemical recurrence (BCR) following curative therapies. The TCGA PanCancer and MSKCC datasets within cBioPortal were extracted and analyzed. Among the LE genes, upregulations of TMEM45B and FBXO6 as well as downregulations of NANS and ARFGEF3 are associated with PC relapse in the TCGA cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 492) and MSKCC cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 140) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00257-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Collectively, data from multiple independent cohorts supports the biomarker values of TMEM45B, FBXO6, NANS, and ARFGEF3 in predicting PC recurrence.

0: HK-2 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and in 70% cold ethanol for 15 min.
1: The cells were incubated in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min and then stained in TUNEL solution (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) in dark at 37 C for 60 min.
2: After three PBS washes, the cells were mounted with antifluorescence quenching sealing solution and observed under a fluorescence microscope.
3: Cell nuclei were dyed with DAPI.
4: Apoptosis rate = (TUNEL-positive cell number/total cell number)  100%.

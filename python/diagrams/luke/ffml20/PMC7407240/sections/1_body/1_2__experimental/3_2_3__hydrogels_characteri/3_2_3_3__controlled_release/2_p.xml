<p>At predetermined release periods, aliquots were extracted from the release media and analyzed spectrophotometrically (Spekol 11 spectrophotometer, Carl Zeiss, Jena, 0.995 cm glass cuvettes) to determine the amount of released antibiotic (

 <sub>rel</sub>) at different wavelengths, specific to the determination method for each type of drug, based on prior-constructed calibration curves and taking into account the volume of the release medium, i.e., 100 mL. Tetracycline hydrochloride was determined based on absorbance values measured at λ
 <sub>max</sub> = 356 nm [

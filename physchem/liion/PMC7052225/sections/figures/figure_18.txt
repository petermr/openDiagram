0: Figure 18 ( a ) Initial charges ( and   ) and discharges (  and ) obtained at a constant current of C/24 between 1.5 and 3.5 V versus graphite of two prelithiated PTCDA/graphite batteries.
1: A paper Kodoshi separator is used, and an excess anode capacity is employed.
2: ( b ) Corresponding long cycling experiments are performed at a C/10 rate.
3: The occurrence of a rapid formation is observed at 5 C. Full and empty characters represent charges and discharges, respectively.

<p id="Par40">Bladder cancer (BLCA) is the most common malignancy in the urinary system, ranking 4th among men and 18th among women [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The 5-year survival rates have remained generally flat since the 1990s due to late diagnosis and limited therapeutics. Patients with ‘non-muscle-invasive’ tumours are easier to treat and have lower mortality rate compared to those in patients with tumours that have grown into the muscle wall or beyond [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently, BLCA screening heavily relies on cystoscopy, upper urography, urine cytology, and computed tomography (CT) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cystoscopy is an invasive examination method that is also expensive and uncomfortable for patients. However, urine cytology is less sensitive. The measurement of circulating biomarkers is a promising diagnostic method owing to their relative availability in serum and plasma [

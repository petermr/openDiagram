 <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
 <p>Mittleman and colleagues have used 3' RNA-seq to study change in polyadenylation site usage between humans and chimpanzees. The results I suspect will be of greatest interest are that PAS change is associated with change in both RNA and protein level gene expression. This was a very interesting study, and something I hadn't considered before. The data collected seems to be a perfect fit for their study and the general analysis approach is solid.</p>
 <p>1) I had one major concern with the manuscript as it's written-throughout the results, effect sizes were consistently weak to moderate at best (1-1.5X enrichment, weak correlations, etc.). This in itself is fine. I strongly believe there is often too much emphasis on results with large effect sizes. That said, the Discussion makes some strong claims about their data without tempering their language to account for the effect size. Some additional background information contrasting their results with other aspects of the transcription process would likely help place the role of PAS change in gene expression divergence between species. For example, how strongly does change in ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq/DNase-seq signal associate with DE genes between species. Basically, statements like "We showed that, across species, increased intronic PAS usage is associated with increased mRNA expression levels, while increased 3' UTR PAS usage is correlated with a decrease in mRNA expression" could use some additional context to highlight the relative significance of this result.</p>

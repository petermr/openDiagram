<p>The “EGF-like” gene set was enriched among DEPs for all 3 MtzR isolates (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, panel A). This set included an abundance of VSPs, with high cysteine membrane proteins (HCMPs) as the second most pronounced group, particularly in 106-MtzR. The gene set also included EGF-like tenascin/notch-like proteins in WB-MtzR and 106-MtzR, which may be involved in signaling and have been observed to increase during

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several other EGF-like proteins were also present, including membrane-associated cysteine-rich endopeptidases in 106-MtzR and 713-MtzR. Although EGF-like proteins, particularly cysteine-rich families, were consistently differentially expressed in all MtzR isolates, only a few DEPs were common to the 3 MtzR lines (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, panel B), with WB-MtzR and 713-MtzR most separated.

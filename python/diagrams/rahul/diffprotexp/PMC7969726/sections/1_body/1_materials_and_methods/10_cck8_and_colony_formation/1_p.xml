<p>For Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays, HCC cells were plated in 96-well plates and pretreated by transfection with CPSF1 plasmids or siRNAs. The cells were quantified on five consecutive days by incubating with the CCK8 detection reagent for 2 h at 37Â°C followed by colorimetric reading of absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader. For the colony formation assay, single-cell suspensions were plated in six-well plates. The culture medium was replaced every 72 h. After 14 days, the cells were fixed in methanol for 10 min, stained with crystal violet, and washed twice in PBS. Images were captured using a digital scanner to count the colonies.</p>

<p id="Par43">KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that DEGs are mainly involved in ribosomes, oxidative phosphorylation, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, myocardial contraction and other processes. In addition, the 10 hub genes RPS29, RPL9, RPL27, RPS15A, RPS17, RPS27, RPS24, RPL30, RPL34 and RPL35 screened from DEGs all belong to the ribosomal protein family, and they are all highly expressed in VTE. Studies have shown that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are important risk factors for VTE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and ribosomes can be used as targets for cardiovascular diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, it can be speculated that there is a certain connection between them. In addition, scholars have found that ribosomes play an important role in the translation of platelet proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and platelets can promote the formation of NETs, which in turn promotes the formation of deep vein thrombosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This conclusion supports our speculation. However, there is little direct evidence of ribosomal protein family genes associated with thrombosis.

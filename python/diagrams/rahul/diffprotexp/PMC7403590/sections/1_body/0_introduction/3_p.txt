0: Herein, we sought to follow the expression levels of protein markers implicated in microtubule assembly, autophagic-lysosomal pathway and unfolded protein response (UPR) in  post-mortem samples from SNpc, hippocampus and temporal cortex from AD, PD and VD patients.
1: The detected changes in these proteins markers enabled us to establish a time course for disease progression.
2: Moreover, we will elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms in light of the brain area, degree and extent of the disease and challenge the prion like SNCA and A spreading hypothesis for PD 14,  15 and AD pathogenesis 16.

<p id="Par20">Galvanostatic cycling and long cycling experiments. The charge/discharge cycling procedure is performed in a galvanostatic mode at different current density ranges of 2.0–4.0 V, 1.2–2.5 V, 1.5–3.5 V, and 0–1.5 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> for the LFP, LTO, PTCDA, and graphite electrodes, respectively. For each cycling rate ranging from C/10 to 5 C, five cycles are subsequently recorded. The experiments are automatically started with two formation cycles at C/24.

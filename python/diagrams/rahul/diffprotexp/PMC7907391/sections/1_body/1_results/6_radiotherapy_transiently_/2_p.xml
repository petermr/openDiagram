<p id="Par14">The impact of radiotherapy on mucosal immunity was further explored using the aforementioned GSE103412 dataset. During radiotherapy, type I IFN antiviral gene expression transiently declined, but promptly recovered after radiotherapy. This is shown with 
 <italic>SAMHD1</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which is involved in suppression of viral replication (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). There was a similar pattern of response with 
 <italic>IFITM3;</italic> however, changes in 
 <italic>IFITM3, MX1</italic>, and 
 <italic>TRIM25</italic> were not significant.

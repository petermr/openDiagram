<p>In this study, we sought to analyze the role of miRNAs in seed development and seed size/weight determination using a small‐seeded (Himchana 1) and a large‐seeded (JGK 3) chickpea cultivar. Small RNAs (smRNAs) from seven successive stages of seed development and leaf tissue were sequenced from both the cultivars. Several known and novel miRNAs were identified and their differential expression at different stage(s) of seed development within and between the cultivars was determined. To understand the influence of miRNAs on gene regulation, the correlation between expression and/or differential expression of miRNAs with their target genes was analyzed. The sets of co‐expressed miRNAs and their functional relevance in seed size/weight determination were also interrogated. Further, we investigated the role of miRNAs in regulating sets of genes encoding transcription factors and genes located within known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed size/weight determination. Overall, we provide a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs and revealed their roles in seed development and seed size/weight determination in chickpea.</p>

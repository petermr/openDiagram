0: The fossil record is poor for this early period of evolution and preservation of cellular structure is of insufficient quality to draw unequivocal conclusions concerning the internal morphologies of early eukaryotic cells [ 6].
1: Consequently, molecular reconstruction of the evolutionary history of protein families is the major strategy employed to identify and, where possible, to order events during eukaryogenesis.
2: The mitochondrion and the chloroplast are derived from endosymbiotic events and hence represent a distinctive evolutionary path [ 2, 7].
3: The remaining structures/organelles in eukaryotic cells, including the nucleus, are considered to be endogenously-derived, i.e.
4: arising through evolution and expansion in the gene complement of the proto-eukaryote; hence, the proteins defining various organelles have clear vertical descent from an archaeal ancestor.
5: Reconstruction of the evolution of endogenously-derived organelles thus relies on the identification and analysis of marker genes/proteins that define specific organelles and their sub-structures.

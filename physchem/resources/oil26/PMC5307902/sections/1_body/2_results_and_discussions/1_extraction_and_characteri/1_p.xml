<p>The essential oils extraction conditions are important as they are one of the main physical and chemical parameters which are directly related to the quality of the essential oil. A rapid distillation can lead to a product containing predominantly volatile constituents with better organoleptic and chemical characteristics. However, a prolonged extraction of the product makes the process more expensive and can also increase the amount of less desirable compounds.[

0: During virus infection, the regulation of host gene expression is dynamic.
1: The regulation at transcription and post-transcription levels plays an essential role, which involves cellular transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, alternative splicing and microRNAs, etc.
2: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a common regulation mechanism that generates transcript isoforms with alternative 3 ends.
3: More than half of mammalian genes are characterized by alternative polyadenylation of their transcripts [ 12,  13].
4: Various biological effects associated with tandem APA were investigated, including cancer transformation, embryonic development, immune responses, neuronal activity [ 12,  14] as well as virushost interaction [ 15 17].
5: In this study, we used in vitro transcription sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (IVT-SAPAS) method to profile differential APA site switching events and differentially expressed genes in IPEC-J2 cells during the infection of PEDV variant strain GDS01.
6: A comprehensive analysis of the APA switching genes and DEGs (differentially expressed genes) was carried out to understand regulation mechanisms during PEDV infection.

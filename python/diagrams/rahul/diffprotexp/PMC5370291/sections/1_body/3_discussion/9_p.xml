<p>HMGB1 is a widely expressed and highly abundant protein and plays multiple roles in physiological and pathological processes. Thus, HMGB1 is implicated in human health and diseases 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Loss of HMGB1 has been reported that leads to a serial of abnormalities in the nuclear structure and function, such as genomic instability 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, abnormal gene transcription 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, and impaired DNA damage response 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. Comparing to HMGB1, our analysis showed that level of HMGB1 was reduced in HepG2 cells with exposure to TNFα, suggesting that lowered HMGB1 may involve in carcinogenesis promoted by TNFα.

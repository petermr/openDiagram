<p>To validate the association between identified hub genes expression and patients’ clinical outcomes, 135 TNBC samples from TCGA database were derived into high- and low-expression groups according to the median expression level of each hub gene, respectively. The online tool GEPIA2 was employed to conduct the survival analysis. Among the six hub genes,

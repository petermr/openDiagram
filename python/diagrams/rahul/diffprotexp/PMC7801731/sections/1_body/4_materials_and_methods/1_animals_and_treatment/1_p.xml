 </sup>. Evisceration was carried out by an intracoelomic injection of 0.35 M KCl. Subsequently, the organisms were left in salt-water aquaria for 1 and 3 dpe to undergo regeneration. Uneviscerated animals kept under the same conditions and for the same lengths of time as the eviscerated animals were used as controls. Prior to dissection, animals were anesthetized by immersion in ice-cold water for 45 min. A dorsal incision was made to expose the internal cavity of the organism and allow dissection of the mesentery separated from the body wall and intestine. In the case of non-eviscerated organisms, the intestine was separated from the mesentery that remained attached to the body wall and removed using small surgical scissors. The mesentery was obtained throughout its length from the anterior end of the animal (next to the esophagus) to the posterior end (next to the cloaca). Dissected tissues were placed in RNAlater (Sigma, USA) solution and stored at 4ºC until the RNA extraction was performed.

<p>As the hub RBPs-based risk score has shown the predictive ability in both TCGA and GEO-retrieve tongue patients, we assessed and compared the prognostic significance of different clinical characteristics in tongue patients by performing COX regression analysis. In TCGA datasets, the results showed that tumor grade, stage, and risk score was correlated with OS of tongue cancer (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) in univariate analysis (

 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (

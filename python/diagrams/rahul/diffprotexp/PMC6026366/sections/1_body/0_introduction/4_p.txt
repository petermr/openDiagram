0: In this study,  D. melanogaster, an internationally recognized model for studying life span that is widely used in antiaging medical research, was used to elucidate this issue  in vivo.
1: A proteomic approach of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to investigate changes in age-related specific indicators and relative abundance of proteins in expression caused by feeding with red ginseng extract (RGE).
2: Our findings could be helpful in revealing the mechanisms and addressing biological questions underlying the effects of red ginseng on life span and antiaging.

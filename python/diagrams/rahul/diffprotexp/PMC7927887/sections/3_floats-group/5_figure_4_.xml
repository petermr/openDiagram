    <italic>MZB1</italic>, an important prognostic gene in multiple myeloma, was significantly alternative spliced in 
    <italic>SF3B1</italic>-mutated patient samples.
   </bold> (A) Screenshot from JunctionSeq identifying two significant novel splice junction usage in addition to a known splice junction and three differentially used exons in the 
   <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutants. (B) Sashimi plot showing differential exon and splice junction usage between a 
   <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutated and control sample. (Note that all 
   <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutated samples displayed the same differential splicing pattern.) (C) Box plots of 
   <italic>MZB1</italic> transcript expression levels. Two transcripts showed a significant switch in level of expression between the two groups.

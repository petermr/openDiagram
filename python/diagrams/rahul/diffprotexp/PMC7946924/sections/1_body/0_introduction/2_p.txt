0: Ever since ethylene being identified first time as the causal agent for poor grain development 11, investigations have progressed into molecular biology of ethylene signal transduction for elucidation of transcriptome dynamics underplaying synthesis of the protein factors involved in the process 12.
1: It is now known that higher concentration of ethylene synthesized in the poorly developed inferior basal spikelets at early grain filling stage elicits over-expression of ethylene receptor and signal transducer proteins 13,  18 which underscores expression of genes encoding endosperm starch synthesizing enzymes and cell cycle regulators 10,  14.
2: In contrast, superior spikelets located on the apical part of panicle are not subservient to ethylene action and produce high density well filled grains 15.
3: At anthesis neither they produce ethylene profusely nor there is over expression of genes encoding proteins for ethylene signal transduction 16.
4: It is surmised that spikelet specific ethylene production/action could be a factor sub-ordinate to IAA for the apical dominance in grain filling.
5: Our earlier work has shown that IAA primarily promotes grain filling of apical spikelets of rice panicle 17 and ethylene functions as a second messenger to transmit IAA signal slackening grain filling of basal spikelets 13.

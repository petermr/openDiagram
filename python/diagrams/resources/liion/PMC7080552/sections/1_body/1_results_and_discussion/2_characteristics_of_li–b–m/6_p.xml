<p>The Li–B–Mg composite anode which has been charged to several specific stages (B, D, and F in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) is chosen to study its morphology changes and the corresponding results are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d. One can clearly observe the appearance of large pores among the LiB fibers during the Li electrochemical dissolution under the voltage of 0.1 V (B panel in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). With almost all available Li in Li(Mg) solid solution dissolved (D panel in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d), the pores among the LiB fibers became larger. The surface morphology and the cross‐sectional SEM images of the Li–B–Mg composite anode after Li in the LiB compound has been partially dissolved are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d (F panel) and Figure S3c (Supporting Information). Moreover, one can clearly observe the fragmentation of the Li–B–Mg composite anode after the voltage has increased to 1 V, as shown in Figure S3d (Supporting Information; H point in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). The unambiguous observation provides supporting evidence that the structure of the obtained 3D Li–B–Mg composite could be significantly damaged after the stripping of Li in LiB skeleton.
 <xref rid="advs1513-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> On the basis of the measurements, the capacity below 0.1 V (D point) is defined as the available free Li capacity (≈1832 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and the cut‐off voltage of the following electrochemical measurement of the battery is set to be 0.4 V to avoid the destruction of LiB skeleton.

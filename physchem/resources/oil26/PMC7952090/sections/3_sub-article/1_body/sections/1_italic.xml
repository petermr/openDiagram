<italic>titanohyrax</italic>) independent transitions to large-body sizes. But with only the modern or nearly modern genomes to work with, we are not sure that the duplication inference procedures and their coupling to the body size analysis statistically represent more than a single observation (e.g., a default of a single transition to large size along the tethytheria branch).

Many enrichment evaluations aim to assess differences in goal behaviors or activity budgets compared to a baseline. These evaluations can range from keepers providing quick, sometimes more anecdotal, assessments to more formal observational research. In addition, data collected on enrichment use over multiple sessions, such as habituation data, can help observers determine motivation to perform specific goal behaviors [<xref rid="B14-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. </p>

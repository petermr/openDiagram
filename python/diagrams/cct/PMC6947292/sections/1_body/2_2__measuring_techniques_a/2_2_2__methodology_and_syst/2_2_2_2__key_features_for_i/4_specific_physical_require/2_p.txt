0: Aside from the determination of the critical cooling rates, a further aspect can only be understood if almost the full range of cooling rates is considered.
1: As discussed later, it has been shown that for any age-hardening alloy, quench-induced precipitation during slow cooling predominantly occurs at alloy-specific high temperatures (compare e.g., [ 117, 121, 133]).
2: At faster rates, the high-temperature reactions will be suppressed to a certain extent, and maybe even suppressed completely, and quench-induced precipitation will then probably take place via a medium- or low-temperature reaction [ 119, 133].
3: An example is shown in  Figure 9 for the pure binary alloy Al0.72Si.
4: At a high cooling rate of 0.1 K/s (which may be a relatively slow cooling rate for higher concentrated alloys), quench-induced precipitation only occurs in a low-temperature reaction (400300 C).
5: In contrast, during slow cooling at 0.001 K/s, the vast majority of quench-induced precipitation occurs at high temperatures (470350 C).
6: At medium rates, both types of reactions overlap.

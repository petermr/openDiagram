<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We implanted two data loggers and one tracking transmitter into each aardvark (total mass of implanted equipment &#8764;300 g, &lt;1% of aardvark body mass; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> for dimensions of all implanted devices). Transmitters and data loggers were covered with inert wax (Sasolwax 1276, Sasol Ltd., South Africa) and sterilised in formaldehyde vapour before implantation. The tracking transmitter (Africa Wildlife Tracking, South Africa) allowed relocation of aardvarks in the field with a directional antenna and receiver kit (Three-Element Folding Yagi Antenna, R1000 Receiver, Sirtrack, New Zealand). A temperature-sensitive data logger recorded abdominal body temperature in each aardvark (2012&#8211;2013: DS1922L Thermochron iButton<sup>&#174;</sup>, Dallas Semiconductor/Maxim Integrated Products, United States; resolution 0.0625&#176;C; 2013&#8211;2015: DST centi-T, Star-Oddi, Iceland; resolution 0.032&#176;C). Loggers were set to record temperature at 5-min intervals. Each temperature logger was calibrated in an insulated water bath against a high accuracy thermometer (Quat 100, Heraeus, Germany) over a temperature range of 28&#8211;42&#176;C in increments of 2&#176;C before implantation. We confirmed the reliability of temperature readings by re-calibrating all loggers after their removal. After calibration, the biologgers measured body temperature to an accuracy of better than 0.1&#176;C.</p>

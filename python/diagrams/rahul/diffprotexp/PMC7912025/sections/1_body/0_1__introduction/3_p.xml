<p>The nature, timing, and magnitude of inducible epithelial cytokine responses play important roles in shaping disease and activating adaptive immunity. In the epithelium, IRF and NFÎºB crosstalk is the key regulator of type I and type III IFN gene expression [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], responsible for the expression of some 350 interferon-simulating genes (ISGs), producing antiviral protection. IFN type I/III stimulation produces a dramatic upregulation of IRF, TLR3, and RIG-I to further amplify the antiviral response. This IFN amplification loop primes neighboring epithelial cells to elicit a protective antiviral state and commitment to apoptosis [

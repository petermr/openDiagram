<p>At the wavelength of 514 nm, the graphene of Raman spectra has two characteristic peaks: G peak of graphene at 1580 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> that is unique to the carbon sp
 <sup>2</sup> structure, which can reflect the crystal integrity. D peak near 1350 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is a defect peak, reflecting the disorder of the graphene sheet. The intensity ratio (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>D</sub>/
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>G</sub>) is usually used to characterize the degree of covalent modification of graphene, and the ratio rises from 0.93 to 1.07 after nitrating as demonstrated in

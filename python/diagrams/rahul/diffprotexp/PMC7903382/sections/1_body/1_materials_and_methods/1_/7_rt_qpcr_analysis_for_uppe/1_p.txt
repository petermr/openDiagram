0: The total RNA, extracted from the upper T1-T4 segments of the spinal cord using the TRIzol  reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, was used for the generation of cDNA ( 21, 22, 36-40).
1: The primers were designed using the Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and the specific forward and reverse primer sequences are listed in  Table I. RNA samples were quantified using a spectrophotometer (BioPhotometer; Eppendorf AG) and then synthesized to cDNA by reverse transcription using the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Inc.).
2: The temperature protocol was conducted using the following protocol: 15 min at 37 C, 5 sec at 85 C and holding at 4 C cDNA was quantitated via RT-qPCR using a TB green  Premix Ex Taq (cat.
3: no.
4: RR420A; Takara Bio, Inc.).
5: The thermocycling conditions for PCR were as follows: Initial denaturation for 30 sec at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95 C, 15 sec at 60 C and 45 sec at 72 C. The threshold cycle (Cq) was used to estimate the amount of target mRNA.
6: The comparative Cq method with a formula for relative FC (2 -Cq) was used to quantify the amplified transcripts ( 32, 33, 41).
7: The relative gene expression was determined via normalization to GAPDH.
8: Experiments were evaluated in triplicate and repeated 3 times.

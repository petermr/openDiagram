  <p>Validation of topical 4-MU formulation. (A) HA levels in dorsal skin significantly reduced between control and topical 4-MU application, as well as between sham and topical 4-MU treatment, as determined by ELISA-like assay. HA in females treated with 4-MU formulation was observed to be lower than females treated with sham or no treatment. No significant difference between treatments is seen in males. (B) Serum HA levels measured by ELISA-like assay were not significantly different between treatment groups in either sex.

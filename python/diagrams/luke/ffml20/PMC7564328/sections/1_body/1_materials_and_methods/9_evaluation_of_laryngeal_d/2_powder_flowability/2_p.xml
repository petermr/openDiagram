 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. Two funnels with a diameter of 7.0 cm were taken in series on an iron stand. A watch glass with a diameter of 3.2 cm on a horizontal table was placed at a distance of 5.0 cm from the bottom of the funnel. The center of the watch glass was directly opposite the funnel outlet. An appropriate amount of SCU@CD-MOF was poured slowly into the funnel, and let it flow naturally through the two funnels under the gravity until the powders formed a cone and started to overflow from the edge of the watch glass. The height

0: The cochlear sensory epithelium contains specialized receptors known as hair cells, which are responsible for transducing incoming mechanical signals for processing by the brain [ 1].
1: Damage to hair cells can lead to hearing loss or impairment in both humans and mouse [ 2].
2: The perception and processing of sound are dependent on the expression of many proteins of which many are regulated during the onset of hearing.
3: As structural and functional development continues, hearing sensitivity increases on postnatal days 1214 (P12-P14) [ 3].
4: A number of studies have investigated gene expression in the inner ear and its age-related changes [ 4 7].
5: There have been far fewer studies of the inner ear performed at the proteome level [ 8 14], and even fewer that have explored protein pathways [ 15,  16].

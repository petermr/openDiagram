0: Experimental low carbon steel was melted in a 50 kg vacuum induction melting furnace and cast into ingots.
1: The basic chemical composition was 0.07C0.06Si1.5Mn0.2Cr0.001B0.01Ti0.001Ca0.0025N0.004O (wt.%).
2: The test steel was deoxidized with TiCa compound deoxidant.
3: The deoxidization process was deliberately controlled to avoid the detrimental effect of coarse inclusions and to get a uniform distribution of fine inclusions.
4: Boron was added to improve the inclusion-induced nucleation of intragranular acicular ferrite.

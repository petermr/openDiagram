0: The solubilities of different transition metal and rare earth oxides (NiO, CoO, Fe 2O 3, Nd 2O 3) in the [P 44414]Cl + CH 3COOH (73.0 wt.% IL, 27.0 wt.% CH 3COOH) system were experimentally determined through the addition of an excess of metal oxide to 2.0 g the mixture for 24 h at 323 K and 500 rpm.
1: The leachate was subsequently isolated by centrifugation and appropriately diluted using deionized water prior to metal concentration analysis by UVvis and TXRF.

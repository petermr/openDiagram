0: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a lethal malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of only ~ 10% [ 1 3].
1: It is the 7th leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and accounted for 4.5% of cancer deaths worldwide in 2018 [ 4].
2: Since localized pancreatic cancer is largely asymptomatic in the early stages, > 80% of the patients are typically diagnosed in the advanced or metastatic phase, rendering surgical intervention impossible [ 5 7].
3: Furthermore, the patients that undergo complete tumor resection often present with local or distant recurrence within 2 years of operation [ 7].
4: Other therapeutic strategies, such as combination chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors also have limited efficacy due to intrinsic chemo- and immune- resistance [ 8 10].
5: Recently, tumor vaccines targeting the ganglioside GD2 and CA-199/KLH have been successful in mitigating PAAD progression [ 11,  12].
6: Although these vaccines provided a survival benefit of only several months, the results are encouraging enough to explore the potential of PAAD-related vaccines.

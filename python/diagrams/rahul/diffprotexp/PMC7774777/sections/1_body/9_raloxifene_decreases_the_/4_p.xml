<p>Taken together, these results indicate that raloxifene strongly activates both proteasome assembly and widely alters transcription of DUBs in females. These effects correlate with a decrease in the accumulation of ubiquitin K48 chains even those migrating at very high molecular weight. The effects of raloxifene in female spinal cord are in contrast to estrogen in males, which shows diminished proteasome assembly and limited effects on DUB transcription.</p>

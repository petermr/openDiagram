<p>X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) is another photon-in/photon-out technique that provides information analogous to that from XAS. Here, the excitation of the core–electron is ensured not by the absorption, but by the nonresonant inelastic scattering of hard X-ray photons. Because of the high penetration depth of hard X-rays, XRS allows studies of materials at absorption edges of light elements (as well as L-edges of 3d transition metals) in strongly attenuating sample environments. The latter method has been shown useful for studies of Li-ion batteries.

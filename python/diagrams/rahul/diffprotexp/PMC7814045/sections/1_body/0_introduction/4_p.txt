0: We exploited RNA-seq data of yeast undergoing PCD when treated with acetic acid.
1: The experiment considers three different time points after exposure (45, 120, and 200 min) 31.
2: Our results show changes in the gene expression of RPGs, with differential patterns between pairs of ohnologs when compared to control conditions.
3: Moreover, snoRNA genes are also differentially expressed, revealing additional changes in contributors to ribosomal biogenesis.
4: We show also a differential expression of genes coding for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPGs).
5: A different trend, moreover, characterizes the expression of the proteins of the mitoribosome versus the ones of the cytosolic ribosome.

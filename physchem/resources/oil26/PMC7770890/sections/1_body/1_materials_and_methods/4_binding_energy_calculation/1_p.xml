<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Before binding energy calculation,
each Modeller complex model was first repacked using FASPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> to eliminate rotamer outliers and then the interface
residue side-chain conformations were thoroughly refined (both for
ACE2 and S-RBD) using the EvoEF2 force field in conjunction with a
simulated annealing Monte Carlo (SAMC) optimization procedure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> which was also utilized for anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptide design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> During the side-chain refinement process, both
the ACE2 and S-RBD sequences were kept fixed, while the different
rotameric side-chain conformations were sampled. Since a stochastic
SAMC optimization procedure was used, obtaining the global energy
minimum may not always be guaranteed. Therefore, the optimization
of the interface residues was performed five times independently to
generate five refined low-energy models. Hence, for each ACE2/S-RBD
pair, 500 final models were generated and scored using EvoEF2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> The minimum binding interaction score achieved
among all 500 complex models was regarded as the binding energy. The
error bar of binding energy was estimated using bootstrapping. Specifically,
in each step of bootstrapping, we performed a subsample with replacement
for 500 data points from the original data set of 500 binding scores,
and calculated the ensemble statistics (minimum in this case) for
the subsampled data. The bootstrap steps were repeated for 1000 times
to get 1000 minimum binding scores, and the standard deviation of
these 1000 minimum values was taken as the length of error bar.</p>

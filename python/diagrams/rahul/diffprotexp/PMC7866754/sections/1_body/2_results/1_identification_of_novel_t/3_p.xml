<p id="Par37">Furthermore, a relatively small fraction of novel transcripts has translation evidence from proteomic data, which emphasizes the need to confirm their existence experimentally. Less than 1/3 of the intergenic transcripts from the two stages have peptide spectral matches that can identify them (n = 130), although many of them are specific to either salivary gland or oocyst sporozoites (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Notably, despite many transcripts showed retained introns of canonical genes, only five of them have peptide evidence that supports the translation of these introns, indicating that the current intron–exon structures of coding sequences are likely to be accurate. Similarly, antisense peptides were detected at a very low level, with one PSM in each stage. Unlike other untranslated regions, slightly more novel peptides were detected to be translated from the 3’ and 5′ UTRs. One explanation is that they reflect the incomplete annotation of reference genes, or they could arise from stop-codon read-through [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and translation of upstream ORFs respectively, where the latter has been shown to regulate the expression of downstream canonical ORFs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, despite the sparse evidence for translation of these novel transcripts, their regulatory roles on canonical proteins may be at RNA level only, especially antisense transcripts, whose RNA molecules were shown to interact with chromatin and regulate gene expression in

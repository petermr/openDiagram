<p>Proliferation of cells was another similar function found to be decreased. As a human lung cancer cell line, Calu-3 cells have infinite division and proliferation potential. Despite the origin of this cell line, it does exhibit contact inhibition after a confluent monolayer is established. The maintenance of an electrically tight (high resistance) monolayer of cells indicates that within the 24 h time frame the proliferation of cells was not compromised. However, it should be noted that the proliferation is very low after the formation of an intact epithelium. The results indicate a decrease in proliferative capacity since the expression of proteins in this pathway was decreased by CNT exposure relative to controls. This may ultimately have deleterious effects on the ability of the cells to respond to noxious stimuli that cause cell death. Other factors involved in cell division are microtubule and actin filaments. Research shows cell proliferation is greatly reduced in SWCNT-treated cells with an increase in actin-related division defects, due to actin bundling [

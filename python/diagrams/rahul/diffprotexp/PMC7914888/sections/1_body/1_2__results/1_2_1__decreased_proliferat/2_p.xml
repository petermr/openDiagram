<p>Reduction in cell number was associated with death. The number of cells in supernatants by I.P. incorporation; in unexposed cells (Control), the value was 1.1 × 10

 <sup>3</sup>, while for L-Tyr exposure, it was 2.9 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> ± 4.8 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>. For 5-Brd-2′-dU, it was 5.1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> ± 1.1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>. The values obtained in supernatants were on average (97 X) and (45 X) lower than the differences found by trypan blue in unexposed B16F1 cells (Control) and its counterpart, cells exposed to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU. The above suggests that other mechanisms may explain the reduction of cells; therefore, we calculated the population doubling times from the MTT reductase activity assay and its corresponding calibration curve (

The population doubling times increased from 19.6 ± 3.94 h (CV, coefficient of variation of 20%) to 48.67 ± 6.25 h (CV of 13%) and 27.03 ± 3.0 h (CV of 11%) for exposure to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU, respectively. These differences indicated that reducing the number of cells at 72 h would be the consequence of variations in the cell cycle control.

0: In this study, we demonstrate the development of a skin-specific means of HA inhibition using an optimal topical delivery system of 4-MU.
1: This transdermal formulation uses a combination of propylene glycol, ethanol, and water which are routinely used components in topical drug delivery.
2: To optimize 4-MU delivery and efficacy as demonstrated by HA reduction, we employed a design of experiments (DOE) with response surface methodology (RSM) for modeling of the process parameters coupled with genetic algorithm (GA), a powerful computational tool that allows for the optimization of dose of components.
3: The optimized formulation was then successfully validated on adult mice, along with the analysis of its effect on skin histology and HA levels, HAS1-3, and HYAL1-2 and KIAA1199 expression in dorsal murine skin.

<p>The first description of the chemical profile of the essential oils from different parts (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers) showed that the oils from the aerial parts were mainly rich in 
 <italic>p‐</italic>menthadienol isomers, and the main ones are 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol, 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol. The essential oil of the roots is rather rich in sesquiterpene compounds, and aristolone, with a content of approximately 40%, is the major compound. (Silou, Loubaki, Figuérédo, &amp; Chalchat, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Studies of the essential oils of species of the genus 
 <italic>Elyonurus</italic> are very limited; however, it appears that 
 <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> is the only species of the genus that is rich in 
 <italic>p‐</italic>menthadienol isomers. However, these isomers are present at significant contents in the oils of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon giganteus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon densiflorus</italic>. Indeed, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon giganteus</italic> from the Ivory Coast is characterized by high contents of 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol (8.7% and 18,4%, respectively) and 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol (16% and 15.7%, respectively), and this oil presents antimicrobial properties (Boti et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Moreover, the antimicrobial properties were also observed on the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon giganteus</italic> from Burkina Faso (Menut et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>), Cameroon (Jirovetz, Buchbauer, Eller, Ngassoum, &amp; Maponmetsem, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), Benin (Ayedoun, Sohounhloué, Menut, Lamaty, &amp; Bessière, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>), and Mali (Sidibe, Chalchat, Garry, &amp; Hamara, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>); these species produce essential oils rich in 
 <italic>p</italic>‐menthadienol isomers. The essential oil from the flowers and leaves of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon densiflorus</italic> of Zambia is also rich in 
 <italic>p‐</italic>menthadienol isomers, and it contains 22.4% 
 <italic>trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol and 11.1% 
 <italic>cis‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol. The oil of the Brazilian plant presents a similar composition (Boelens, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Chisowa, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). The literature reports several uses of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon densiflorus</italic>: the crushed leaves are used as a treatment for rheumatism in Gabon, the flower head is smoked in a pipe as a cure for bronchial affections in Malawi, and the plant sap is used in the Congo‐Brazzaville, where it is also given as a treatment for asthma and to calm fits (Akhila, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Manifestly, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon densiflorus</italic> exhibits biological activities. The massive presence of 
 <italic>p‐</italic>menthadienol isomers in the essential oil of 
 <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> points also to possible antimicrobial properties. Aristolone is also an interesting constituent since it is likely to induce an antalgic activity (Tian‐Shung, Amooru, Damu, &amp; Kuo, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>).

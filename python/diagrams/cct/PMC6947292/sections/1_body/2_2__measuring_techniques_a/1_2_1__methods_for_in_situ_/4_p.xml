<p>Hong-Ying Li et al. demonstrated that continuous measurements of the electrical resistivity can be applied for the determination of continuous cooling transformation or precipitation diagrams [

 <xref rid="B87-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, it appears that the problem of control over the sample temperature has still not been fully solved, as this group applied several different approaches to achieve continuous cooling, including a self-made temperature control system [
 <xref rid="B59-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. They also later quenched samples in different media [

 <xref rid="B88-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and thereby achieved a considerable range of cooling rates. To the best knowledge of the authors, no commercial device is currently available that allows for the continuous measurement of electrical properties over a wide range of temperatures whilst achieving controlled cooling. In addition, the electrical conductivity is affected by several factors, making interpretations of precipitation difficult. For example, alloying elements in solution reduces the electrical conductivity [
 <xref rid="B89-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], and precipitates may also have a negative influence on the conductivity [
 <xref rid="B90-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The latter is generally lower compared to elements in solution, although the exact value depends on the size and strain field caused by the precipitates [
 <xref rid="B90-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Furthermore, the different alloying elements in solid solution impact the electrical properties by substantially different factors [
 <xref rid="B89-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. For these reasons, the measured changes in the electrical resistance or conductivity are not directly related to precipitation or the volume fraction of precipitates, and potential changes in the superimposed influencing factors cannot be directly assigned to precipitation.

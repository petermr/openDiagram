<p id="Par34">RNA FISH assays were performed using a custom-designed oligonucleotide probe set for OAT and SLC25A5, both labeled with CAL Fluor Red 610 and DesignReady Probe Sets for MALAt1 labeled with Quasar 670 Dye, and GAPDH labeled with CAL Fluor Red 610 (Stellaris, LGC Biosearch Technologies). 48 oligonucleotides were selected for OAT, MALAT1, and GAPDH, and 27 oligonucleotides for SLC25A5. All probes were designed with a minimal mismatch.</p>

<p>The MDA-MB-231 cells in logarithmic growth phase were adjusted to a concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well into 6-well plates and were inoculated in 6-well plates containing 10% FBS serum DMEM. Subsequently, the MDA-MB-231 cells were placed in a 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator and incubated until 80% confluence, and the blank DMEM medium was used to starve overnight. RSV was divided according to different treatment concentrations into 0, DMSO, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200µM groups, and the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 24 h. The cells of each group were collected in a 1.5 ml EP tube, lysed with RIPA cell lysate, and the protein concentration was measured by BCA. The experimental protein samples were then adjusted to the same concentration with RIPA. The protein samples were loaded for 1.5 h following electrophoresis and transferred to a membrane blocked with a 5% skim milk powder blocking solution for 2 h. The primary antibody was incubated overnight (4 °C), and on the next day, it was dipped in TBST for 1 h, which was then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody for 2 h. Subsequently, it was immersed in TBST for 45 min, and developed with an ECL chemiluminescence developer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China).

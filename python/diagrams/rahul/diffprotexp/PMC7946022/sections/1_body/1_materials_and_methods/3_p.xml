  <italic>In vitro S. aureus</italic> vancomycin susceptibility testing in single and mixed biofilms
 </bold>. Single- and mixed-species biofilms were grown in the wells of 96-well polystyrene flat-bottom plates as we previously performed [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell suspensions were adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI 1640-HEPES medium and 100 µl of cell suspensions were seeded in the wells individually or in combination. Plates were incubated for 90 mins at 37°C, then washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Fresh medium (100 µl) was added to each well, and biofilms were allowed to form for 24 hrs at 37°C. Following incubation, wells were gently washed with PBS to remove non-sessile cells. Vancomycin (800 µg/ml) was added to wells, and plates were incubated for 24 hrs at 37°C. Following incubation, wells were sonicated to disrupt biofilms, and cell suspensions were diluted and plated on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>-specific and 
 <italic>Candida</italic>-specific chromogenic medium (CHROMagar; DRG International, Inc.) for CFU (colony forming units) enumeration. Control wells with no vancomycin were included; vancomycin concentration used was determined based on our previously published work on mixed biofilm assays [

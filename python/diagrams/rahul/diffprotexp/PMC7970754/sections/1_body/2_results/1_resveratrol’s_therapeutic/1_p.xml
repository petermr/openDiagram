<p>Assessment of the RSV target demonstrated that the target mutation rate of RSV was low (

 </xref>), suggesting fewer mutations at the site of action of RSV are present. Circplot of RSV multiomics suggested that the target proteins of RSV may serve as potential drivers for TNBC (

 </xref>). CCK8 showed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST2">
  <bold>Table S1</bold>
 </xref>) that different concentrations of RSV could reduce the survival rate of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A. Moreover, with the increase in RSV concentration, the cell viability decreased gradually with increased concentrations of RSV. By comparing cells treated with different concentrations of RSV at 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h, a significant difference was found between the relative survival rate of TNBC cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2C</bold>
 </xref>). When the RSV concentration was 25µM, 50µM, and 100µM, the survival rate of MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-10A cells had the largest difference. However, at 25 µM concentration (36h), MDA-MB-231 cells had a higher survival rate and slower killing effect. At 100 µM concentration (36 h), the survival rate of MCF-10A cells was lower. The relative survival rate of MDA-MB-231 cells was 52.24% ± 7.03% after 36 h of treatment with 50 µM, suggesting 50 µM was the optimal treating concentration of RSV.

0: The fidelity of our HMLP is evaluated by the comparison of our ML prediction and the DFT calculations in Supplementary Fig.
1: 6.
2: The mean absolute error is of the order of the expected numerical and theoretical accuracy of the reference quantum mechanics-based calculations, indicating good performance of the present ML model.

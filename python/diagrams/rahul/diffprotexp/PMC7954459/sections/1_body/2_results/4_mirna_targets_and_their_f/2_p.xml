<p>Putative targets of miRNAs were predicted using the psRNATarget web‐server (Dai et al., 
 <xref rid="pld3299-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In total, 3,571 unique transcripts (genes hereafter) were identified as the targets of 354 miRNAs. About 96% (341) miRNAs targeted more than one gene resulting in the identification of 5,475 miRNA‐target gene pairs, whereas only 4% (13) miRNAs were found to target a single gene (Figure

 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). We analyzed the enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms among the genes targeted by miRNAs. GO terms, including embryonic/post‐embryonic development, cell morphogenesis/differentiation, tissue development, transport, and response to stimuli, were most significantly enriched among the target genes (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). KOG analysis revealed higher representation of genes involved in post‐translational modification, signal transduction, transcription, carbohydrate transport, and metabolism among the target genes (Table 
 <xref rid="pld3299-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Interestingly, at least 336 genes encoding for transcription factors were identified as targets of miRNAs, and

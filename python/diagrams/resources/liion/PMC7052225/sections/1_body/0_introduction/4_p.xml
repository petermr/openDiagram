<p id="Par5">In this work, self-standing, flexible, and resistant LFP, PTCDA, graphite, and LTO electrodes are prepared according to a new electrode fabrication method. The electrochemical performances of cathodes and anodes are examined. Long cycling experiments of full LFP/LTO and LFP/graphite batteries reveal that these cells have a remarkably good stability with high Coulombic efficiencies. An all-organic PTCDA/graphite paper battery without a transition metal is prepared and electrochemically tested. This is one of the first self-standing batteries that is composed of organic redox molecules and biodegradable components reported in literature. In the perspective of disposable device production, it is interesting to note that at the end of battery life, the electrodes can be recycled as common paper sheets.</p>

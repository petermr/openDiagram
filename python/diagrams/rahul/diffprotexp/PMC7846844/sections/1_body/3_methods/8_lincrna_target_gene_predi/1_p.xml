<p id="Par24">Consistent with previous research. Because lincRNA can regulate its potential target genes in cis. Based on this, we used Bedtools software (version 2.17.0) to search protein-coding gene in the 100Â kb upstream and downstream of the lincRNA locus, and used R to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between DEL and protein-coding genes. Finally, protein-coding gene with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 were identified as potential target genes for DEL. At the same time, if the protein-coding gene is differentially expressed in the two groups, this protein-coding gene is a potential target gene for differential expression.</p>

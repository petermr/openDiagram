<p>Zavitsas proposed a thermodynamic definition of hydration number (
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sup>TMD</sup>) based on the colligative properties of electrolyte solutions as the „dynamic average number of molecules that bind to the solute more strongly than they bind to the other waters”.

  <sup>[24]</sup>
 </xref> In this thermodynamic approach, the apparent large deviation from ideal behavior of colligative properties (freezing point, boiling point, vapor pressure, and osmotic pressure) is reduced when the hydration water molecules (

 <sup>TMD</sup>) is subtracted from the total number of solvent molecules that are used to compute the mole fraction of the solute.

 <sup>TMD</sup> corresponds to the number of water molecules binding to solute sufficiently strongly as to be removed from the „bulk” solvent. Considering the effect of ions on the dynamics of the water molecules, as originally proposed by Bockris,

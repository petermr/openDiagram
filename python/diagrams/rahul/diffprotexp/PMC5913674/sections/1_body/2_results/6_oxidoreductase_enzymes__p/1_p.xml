<p>The GO terms “electron carrier activity” (GO:0 009055) and “oxidation-reduction” (GO:00 55114) were enriched among DEPs in all 3 MtzR lines. In WB-MtzR, “iron-sulfur cluster” (GO:00 51536) and “iron ion binding” (GO:0 005506) annotation terms were also enriched. The overall expression of enzymes with oxidoreductase activity is shown in Fig.

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and others involved in electron transport and cofactor abundance (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, panel B). Overall, although oxidoreductases were significantly enriched within differentially expressed proteins in all 3 MtzR lines, MtzR lines had largely divergent expression profiles, indicative of alternative mechanisms and pathways for either reduced activation of Mtz or mitigation of oxidative damage. Among all 3 lines, NR-1 (22 766) was universally significantly downregulated.

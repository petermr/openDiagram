0: The sponge  Tedaniophorbas ceratosis (20 g, wet weight) was chopped into small pieces and exhaustively extracted with MeOH (6  200 mL) in an ultrasonic bath (20 min.
1: per extraction) to afford a yellow brown residue (0.892 g).
2: This extract was then separated by reversed phase C 18 HPLC gradient elution from H 2O to MeOH (containing 1% TFA) over 60 min.
3: and then eluted with MeOH (containing 1% TFA) for 10 min.
4: to afford 70 fractions.
5: Fractions 17 and 18 contained tedaniophorbasin A  1 and  N-methyltryptamine, which were subsequently separated by recrystallization from MeOH.
6: Tedaniophorbasin A ( 1) was crystallized from the solution to leave  N-methyltryptamine in the supernatant.
7: Fraction 20 eluting with 66% H 2O/34% MeOH yielded pure  N-methyltryptamine, and fraction 27 eluting with 55% H 2O/45% MeOH (all containing 1% TFA) yielded pure tedaniophorbasin B ( 2).

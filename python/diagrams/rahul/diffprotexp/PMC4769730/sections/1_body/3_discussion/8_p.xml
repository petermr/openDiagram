<p>Altogether the protein chip-based array indicates some new factors (IL7, MIPs, sTNFαRI) and confirm some old ones (IL10, IL6, IL5, IL12, VEGF, TGFβ
 <sub>1</sub> and NGF), all indicative of an active inflammatory process, as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Indeed, both protein and mRNA evaluations highlight the presence of an active process of tissue remodeling and angiogenesis (MMP2, MMP7, VEGF, TGFβ
 <sub>1</sub>). Current studies are underway to correlate this glaucomatous TM expression with those of some glaucomatous body fluids (aqueous, tears and blood).

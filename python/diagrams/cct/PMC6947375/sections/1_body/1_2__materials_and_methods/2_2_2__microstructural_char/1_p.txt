0: Metallographic observations were conducted by using a ZEISS ULTRA 55 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM); before observations, the samples were mechanically polished and then etched with 4% nitric acid.
1: The morphology and the chemical composition of the microstructure were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) mode using a JXA-8530F electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA).
2: The size of the carbide particles was measured using image-pro Plus and Photoshop according to the micrograph obtained by SEM.
3: The two-dimensional cross-sectional area of each carbide particle was measured on a polishing plane, which was equivalent to a circular area, and the equivalent diameter of the particle was determined.
4: At least 15 micrographs were taken with magnifications from 2000 to 6000 for each specimen.
5: The total number of particles measured ranged from approximately 300 to 900, depending on the materials and process parameters.
6: The particles larger than or equal to 700 nm were referred to as large-sized particles.
7: The microstructure of 1.0C-1.5Cr steel after different treatments was analyzed by an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) system, and the EBSD data were post-processed by HKL CHANNEL 5 software.
8: Samples for EBSD analysis were prepared by electrolytic polishing with a solution consisting of 10% perchloric acid and 90% ethanol.

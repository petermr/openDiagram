 <caption> Effects of radiotherapy on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL expression. Expression of ACE2 (left), TMPRSS2 (middle), and CTSL (right) in buccal mucosa before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT) among 8 tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma patients from the GSE103412 data set. The probe intensity for each gene was log 2 transformed and visualised for each treatment group to present normalized gene expression values. Paired t-tests were performed between adjacent time points and significant differential expression between groups was labelled. The numbers denote each of the 8 individual patient’s data points. Of note, patient #2′s data was not available for download from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. ** p &lt; 0.01 between baseline and during radiotherapy. </caption>

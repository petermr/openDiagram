0: The adsorption term ( eq   5) makes use of a fixed total binding density of  W1,ads ( eq   2), a fixed bond order (=0), and an adjustable binding constant ( Kf).
1: The condensation term ( eq   6) involves the condensable water density ( Cs), the condensation constant ( K), and the critical number of water molecules in a nanocluster needed to trigger condensation.

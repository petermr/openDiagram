0: The isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) model was first introduced by Claude Bernard in 1855.
1: It is a widely employed physiological model for studying liver functions [ 5, 6].
2: In our previous work, the IPRL model was combined with mass spectrometry to study the liver secretome at the organ level [ 3].
3: In the current study, perfusates were collected from rat livers metastasized by Walker-256 cells [ 7- 9].
4: Eighty-six differentially expressed perfusate proteins were identified and various important proteins related to liver metastasis were identified, which indicates the value of these perfusates for biomarker discovery.
5: To our knowledge, there has not been a study on differential protein expression in the perfusates from metastasized organs aimed at biomarker discovery.

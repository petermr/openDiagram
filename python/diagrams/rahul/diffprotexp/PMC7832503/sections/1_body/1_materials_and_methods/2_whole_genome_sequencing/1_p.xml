<p>Whole-blood-derived genomic DNAs were extracted from all individuals using the QIAamp DNA blood Midi Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) with standard protocols. The DNA purity was detected using NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA). The DNA quantity was assessed using the Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). Next, 1 ug of high quantity genomic DNA was fragmented. The fragments were then end repaired, poly-A tailed and adapter ligated using TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, 15026486 Rev.C), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Adapter-ligated libraries were amplified by 6 cycles of PCR. After that, libraries were assessed for sequencing using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Next, the qualified libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencer from Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.</p>

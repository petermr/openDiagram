0: The aim of this study was to discover and validate biomarkers that are associated with DAS28 response to TNFi by comparing changes in the transcriptome of peripheral blood from RA patients who were good- and non-responders to adalimumab therapy.
1: Whilst previous studies have utilised microarrays to investigate TNF treatment response in RA [ 12], to our knowledge, this is the first to utilise the human transcriptome array (HTA), which facilitates study of both gene and exon-level data.

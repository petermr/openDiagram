<p>Variation between individuals provides necessary material for natural selection when environmental conditions change. Perhaps the most extreme environmental changes the malaria parasite experiences in its life cycle are the transitions between mammalian and mosquito vector hosts. Additionally, the parasite must be able to cope with unpredictable variation within and between hosts in order to survive. 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> blood stage parasite populations can deal with this host environmental variation through rapid response to cues or alternatively through phenotypic diversification or bet-hedging independently of these cues (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Llorà-Batlle et al., 2019</xref>). There is evidence that malaria parasites use bet-hedging strategies in the blood stage forms to optimize survival in face of variation in the mammalian host immune response and potentially during conversion to the sexual transmissible stage parasites through epigenetic regulation that results in transcriptional variation within a clonal population (

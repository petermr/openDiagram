<p>It is also found that the 3D ceramic framework not only greatly augments the continuous and integrated ion‐conductive network, but also increases the mechanical strength of SCEs. Bae et al.

 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref> developed another strategy for the preparation of hybrid electrolyte membrane with a cubic LLZO interconnected network using bacteria cellulose (BC) as a template and PEO‐LiTFSI polymer. The well‐organized LLZO network also constructs long transport pathways for Li ion motion and thus enables the SCE to exhibit an elevated conductivity of 1.12 × 10

 <sup>−1</sup>. Similar alignment strategy could be employed to the SCE with 3D ion‐conductive ceramic framework as well. For example, Hu co‐workers
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">79</xref> fabricated mesoporous aligned garnet nanostructure using wood as template where the ion‐conductive PEO was cast into the aligned garnet to prepare the SCE. This SCE presents both a high ionic conductivity (1.8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at room temperature) and good mechanical flexibility.

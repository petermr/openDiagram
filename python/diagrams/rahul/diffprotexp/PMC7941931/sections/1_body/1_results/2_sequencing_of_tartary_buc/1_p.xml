<p id="Par30">To investigate the effects of miRNAs on seed development in Tartary buckwheat, we constructed and sequenced six sRNA libraries from seeds at three different developmental stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A total of 120.63 million raw reads were generated in six sRNA libraries (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). After filtration, 13.89 million, 17.09 million, 17.19 million, 14.54 million, 13.64 million, and 12.00 million clean reads were obtained for the six libraries, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). The length distribution displayed most the small RNA reads were 21–24 nt (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Among them, the 24 nt small RNA was the most abundant type and showed differential accumulation during Tartary buckwheat seed development (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). To further obtain sRNA reads containing miRNAs, non-coding RNAs (including rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs) and repeat sequences were removed by comparing the clean reads to the Silv, GtRNAdb, Rfam, and Repbase databases. After discarding the non-coding RNAs and repeat sequences, a total of 10.45 million, 14.16 million, 14.60 million, 13.05 million, 6.80 million, and 5.63 million unannotated sRNA reads containing miRNAs were obtained for the six libraries, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). Among these unannotated clean reads, a total of 61.94, 66.76, 46.98, 39.20, 37.22, and 39.42% reads were mapped to the Tartary buckwheat reference genome, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2).

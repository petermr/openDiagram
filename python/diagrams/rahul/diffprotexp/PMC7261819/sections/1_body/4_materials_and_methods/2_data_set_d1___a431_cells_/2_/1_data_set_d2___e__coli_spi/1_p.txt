0: Search results of this data (50,016 unique peptides; 6566 proteins) were downloaded from the ProteomeXchange repository (PXD000279) ( 19).
1: E. coli proteome was prepared into two conditions with 1:3 ratio (10 g  versus 30 g) in triplicates and added into equal amount of human proteome background (50 g Hela cells protein extract), see detailed sample preparation in ( 19).
2: LFQ intensities in proteinGroups.txt table, for proteins with quant values in at least two samples per condition (5022 proteins), were log2 transformed and used as input matrix for all methods.
3: To evaluate intensity-based Bayesian approach, trend = TRUE option was enabled in eBayes function provided in Limma.
4: For variance stabilization normalization analysis, original protein LFQ intensity values were normalized by  justvsn function in R package  vsn before using Limma.
5: ROC analysis was restricted to proteins unique to  E. coli or human, with higher ratios in samples spiked-in with the higher amount of  E. coli proteins.

<p>Using a maximal water population of 1.33 H
 <sub>2</sub>O/UC (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, 121 mg of H
 <sub>2</sub>O per g MnO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.17 K) for δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>) on the internal and external basal faces of birnessite, we modeled the microgravimetric data of 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref> with our 
 <italic>adsorption–condensation–intercalation model</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>). The model accounts for constant proportions of internally and externally bound water on AcidBir and δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, and this assumption is justified by the constant intensities of the 001 diffraction peaks of 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>. The model involves a single set of values to predict adsorption on external basal faces, as well as highly comparable values for the intercalation term, except for differing pore size distributions (parameter 
 <italic>i</italic> in 
 <xref rid="eq3" ref-type="disp-formula">eq 
  <xref rid="eq3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>
 </xref>) in AcidBir and δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. We must consider that the sum of the 
 <italic>intercalation</italic> (internal) and 
 <italic>adsorption</italic> (external) terms (orange line in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>a and blue line in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>b) represents the total amount of water associated to the basal faces of birnessite, regardless of whether the dry particles are stacked in such a way that a portion of the particle surface area (
 <italic>s</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>, determined by B.E.T.) is no longer accessible for direct adsorption in the water vapor binding experiments. We make this statement because our estimate of external site densities from B.E.T. values may be too high for δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, and this could explain the lowered contributions of the intercalation term. It does not, however, explain the different pore size distributions, which are obtained even by removing the adsorption term from the model. Still, the intercalation term of our model reproduces the humidity dependence of the experimentally derived 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>001</sub> values of AcidBir, when scaled as described in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>b. Additionally, the model explains the greater portion of the hysteresis of the microgravimetric data in terms of liquid water populations between particles, which we find by vibrational spectroscopy in the following section. Our model provides, as such, an insightful depiction of the distribution of water on and within birnessite particles exposed to moist air and almost up to the dew point of water.

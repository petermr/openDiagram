<p>4. line no. 77-79. The cited statement “not the only cells capable of nitrogen fixation in heterocystous cyanobacteria and that vegetative cells can fix molecular nitrogen at the same rate as heterocysts” is from a 50 years old paper!!! Authors are highly encouraged to go through recent studies based on modern techniques. In that paper (due to lack of technologies in those days), its not clear that wherever its fixed nitrogen or the transported nitrogen form the heterocysts entered the vegetative cell!!!!</p>

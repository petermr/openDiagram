<p>Evidence exists that some anti-oxidation-related proteins, such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, an enzyme with anti-oxidative effects, can reduce peroxide levels, regulate active oxygen, remove accumulated peroxide, and regulate cell signaling and cellular proliferation. In the ischemia group (at the early stage of spinal cord ischemia), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase expression was down regulated. Heat shock protein 70, a stress protein, was up regulated during spinal cord ischemia and hypoxia, similar to the ischemia group. This may occur as heat shock protein 70 protects the spinal cord under many stress conditions[

 <sub>2</sub>-induced damage to mitochondria and inhibiting the mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis pathway. Studies have demonstrated that heat shock protein 70 expression is up regulated after peripheral nerve injury and protects neurons from injury, possibly by altering the cytoskeleton during axonal regeneration. Results from this study showed that heat shock protein 70 expression was up regulated in the spinal cord during ischemia/reperfusion injury, indicating heat shock protein 70 is likely to be a key protein in the repair of spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury.

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. As a result of multiple connective tissue barriers in the larynx, a number of studies have focused on the targeting or sustained release system to reduce frequency of multiple dosing and adverse effects. The existing laryngeal deposition strategies mainly include lipids

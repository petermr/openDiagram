   <bold>IFNγ
    <sup>−/-</sup> mice present minor changes to SLEV-induced ISGs during infection
   </bold>. WT and IFNγ
   <sup>−/-</sup> mice were inoculated intracranially with 10 PFU of SLEV and euthanized on day 7 p.i. Brain samples were processed and assessed for the expression of IFNα4 (a) and ISGs (b-f) by RT-qPCR. Results are expressed as fold increase in expression relative to an uninfected control (WT Mock). Data are representative of two independent experiments (n = 6–12). *P &lt; 0.05 relative to the WT Mock group. Mock – uninfected mice inoculated with saline

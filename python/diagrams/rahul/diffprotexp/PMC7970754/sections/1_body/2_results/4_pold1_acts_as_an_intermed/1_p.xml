<p>Previous studies have suggested that POLD1 may be associated with the malignant survival of tumor cells and that POLD1 is generally highly expressed in BRCA tissues (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In this study, this result was verified in BRCA data of TCGA database [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5A(a)</bold>
 </xref>]. Moreover, we also found that POLD1 was downregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with RSV [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5A(b)</bold>
 </xref>], suggesting it may serve as an intermediary for RSV in the treatment of TNBC. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5B</bold>
 </xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST4">
  <bold>Table S3</bold>
 </xref>), after RSV treatment, protein and mRNA expression of POLD1 gradually decreased with the increase in treatment concentration. The molecular docking results of RSV and POLD1 indicated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5C</bold>
 </xref>) that the docking energy with five domains of POLD1 (6s1m, 6s1n, 6s1o, 6tny and 6tnz) was generally less than 0 kcal/mol, suggesting that POLD1 may serve as a potential target of RSV. In addition, the results of the correlation pathway map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5D</bold>
 </xref>) showed that POLD1 was related to most genes in the apoptotic pathway, suggesting that RSV may inhibit TNBC by reducing the expression of POLD1 and mediating TNBCâ€™s potential mechanisms of apoptosis. Finally, a comprehensive regulatory map of TNBC cell genes treated by RSV was constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5E</bold>
 </xref>). The network diagram illustrates that TNBC cells treated by RSV mainly affect the protein encoded by other genes through POLD1, which then affect different pathways.

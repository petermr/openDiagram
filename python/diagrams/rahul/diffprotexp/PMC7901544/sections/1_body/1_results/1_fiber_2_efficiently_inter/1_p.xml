<p>To elucidate the molecular basis of the Fiber-2 in the pathogenesis of the highly pathogenic FAdV-4, LMH cells infected with FAdV-4 for 48 hours were harvested and subjected to Co-IP with mAb 3C2 against Fiber-2. The LMH cells without infection as a control. After separated by SDS-PAGE, the immunoprecipitates were visualized by silver stain according to the manufacture’s instructions, the differential bands in the infected cells were excised from the gel and sent for mass spectrum analysis. Data from mass spectrum identified several host proteins as suspectable proteins with high reliability (unique peptide count ≥2) to interact with the Fiber-2 of FAdV-4. Among these suspectable proteins, only KPNA3 and KPNA4 proteins were denoted as characterized proteins in chicken. Moreover, KPNA3/4 plays vital roles in protein nuclear transportation and in regulating transcriptional activity, innate immune response and cell death. To confirm the interaction between KPNA3/4 and Fiber-2, the Co-IP and western blot analysis using specific antibodies against KPNA3/4 or Fiber-2 were performed. As described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1a,b</xref>, the endogenous KPNA3 and KPNA4 could be easily immunoprecipitated by mAb 3C2 against Fiber-2 in the LMH cells infected with FAdV-4, but not in the control LMH cells. Moreover, the Fiber-2 in the LMH cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-F2 could be efficiently immunoprecipitated by antibodies against either KPNA3 or KPNA4 whereas the Fiber-1 in the LMH cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-F1 could not be immunoprecipitated by antibodies against either KPNA3 or KPNA4 (

<p>It has been demonstrated that the mechanisms of host immune response to CE infection are complex. Response involves not only the innate immune system but also the adaptive immune system. In addition, we found that adaptive immune response played an important role in defense against 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> infection. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) could activate T cell response, thus the transcription of cytokines and other genes in immune response [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Besides T cells, NFAT is also expressed on many immune cells, such as B lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, we found that the expression of 
 <italic>NFATC2</italic> was higher in the CE-R group than in the CE-NR group, with a 5.38 fold change (
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 4.04E-51, FDR: 3.17E-50). Furthermore, the 
 <italic>NFAT5</italic> was upregulated in the CE-R group, with a 2.93 fold change (
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 1.84E-27, FDR: 8.91E-27). Therefore, it was speculated that the high expression of 
 <italic>NFAT-</italic>activated T cells, or expressed on B cells, induces adaptive immune response, and produces antibodies. As expected, in our study, we found that IgM and IgE were significantly more highly expressed in CE-resistant sheep than in non-resistant sheep.

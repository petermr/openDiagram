0: T98G and A172 cells in logarithmic growth stage were starved for 24 h, and the cells were digested, centrifuged and resuspended on next day.
1: The upper Chambers of the Transwell filter chamber are coated with Matrigel or not (50 L, 356234, BD, franklin lakes, NJ) per well.
2: The cells were inoculated into the apical cavity of the Transwell filter and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 hours (medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the basolateral cavity).
3: The invasive/transitional cells below the filter were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted microscopically.
4: The invasion/migration ability of each group was determined by the number of cells in the gum.

<p>In this modern era, the change in lifestyle, food habits, consumption of carcinogens, and several altered environmental factors are collectively considered as the major concerns of colorectal cancer and related deaths. The functional association amongst the various genetic and epigenetic processes are known to play a remarkable role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (

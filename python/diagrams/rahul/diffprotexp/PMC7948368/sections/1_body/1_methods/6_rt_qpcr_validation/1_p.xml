<p id="Par37">Results from the discovery analyses were ranked according to 
 <italic>p</italic> value and also fold change. The top 10 hits according to most significant 
 <italic>p</italic> value and the top 10 according to largest fold change were selected for validation. A further 84 transcripts that satisfied a fold change &gt; 1.2 and a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 were selected according to a known biological association with RA or the immune system. TaqMan™ assays were selected for a total of 104 transcripts from the initial adalimumab transcriptome study for custom design of a gene expression OpenArray™ Plate, 112 assay format. Housekeeping genes were used to normalise targets and calculate relative expression values: 
 <italic>ACTB</italic> (Hs99999903_m1), 
 <italic>B2M</italic> (Hs00187842_m1), 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> (Hs99999905_m1), and 
 <italic>HPRT1</italic> (Hs02800695_m1). Responder groups were less stringently defined than in the discovery study. That is to say good-response to adalimumab were not necessarily in clinical remission at follow-up but did show large DAS28 improvements and were in low disease activity states (change in DAS28 &gt; 2.78; mean = 3.08; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) versus poor-responders (change in DAS28 &lt; 1.04; mean = 0.83; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11). This enabled us to test whether the changes identified in the discovery cohort could be identified in patients with a less extreme response. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sample cDNA and TaqMan™ OpenArray™ Gene Expression Master Mix were loaded on OpenArray™ plates using the OpenArray™ AccuFill® software and OpenArray™ AccuFill® system (Applied Biosystems). RT-qPCR was performed on the QuantStudio™ 12 K Flex real-time qPCR system (Applied Biosystems) and analysed in the Relative Quantification Application on the Thermo Fisher Cloud (Thermo Scientific).

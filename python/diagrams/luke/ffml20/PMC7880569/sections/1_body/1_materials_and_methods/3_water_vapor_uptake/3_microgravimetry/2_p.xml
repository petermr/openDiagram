<p>Microgravimetric measurements of water vapor uptake by birnessite were obtained using a DVS Advantage ET 2 instrument (Surface Measurement Systems). A 21-point isotherm cycle occurred between 0 and 98% relative humidity (RH) at 25 °C, and we used ∼30 mg samples initially dried at 110 °C for 3 h. The equilibrium criterion for each stepwise increase in % RH was set to a change in mass of less than 0.001 wt % per minute. A complete adsorption–desorption isotherm cycle took up to ∼3 days (

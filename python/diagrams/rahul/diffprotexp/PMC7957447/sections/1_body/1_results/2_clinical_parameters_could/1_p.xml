<p id="Par10">Among the 20 laboratory parameters measured, four did not show significant differences among the three groups. In contrast, 8 parameters, such as white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), platelets (PLT), hemoglobin (Hb), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-2R, showed significant differences between the severe and critical groups. However, these differences did not exist between critical non-survivors and survivors (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Therefore, we inferred that severe and critical patients could be clearly distinguished by clinical parameters, but clinical data resolution was insufficient to clarify critical patients with different outcomes.

<p>The miRNAs are associated with melanoma’s cellular processes independently; however, we intend to relate the effect they would have together and their potential molecular targets on the phenotype induced by L-Tyr y 5-Brd-2′-dU. We constructed possible gene interaction networks using the miRNet web application with the differentially expressed miRNAs, their putative genes, and functional enrichment analysis by KEGG signaling pathways (

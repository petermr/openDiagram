<p>DRIFTS difference spectra of zeolite H-ZSM-5 with a methanol loading of 8 molecules per acidic site are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. It is evident that the spectra are dominated by hydrogen bonded methanol species that are unambiguously characterised by the triplet arising from the Fermi resonance caused by 
 <italic>ν</italic>(O–H) (of both methanol and zeolite OH groups) with 2
 <italic>δ</italic> and 2
 <italic>γ</italic> overtones, which falls between 1500 and 3500 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>.
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Within this region, the C–H stretching modes of the hydrogen bonded methanol (protonated methanol geometry and is discussed later) between 3100 and 2800 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> are evident; however, no other bands attributable to methoxy species could be distinguished. Therefore, wavenumbers below 1500 and above 3500 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> are probed for evidence of methoxy and O–H stretching modes, respectively.
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A band at 938 that contains a shoulder at 990 is present along with another band at 1180 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Typical P–Q–R bands of gas phase methanol appear at around 1008, 1032 and 1056 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>); however, these bands disappear within the first few minutes of the reaction under the N
 <sub>2</sub> flow. In the 
 <italic>ν</italic>(O–H) region, at least four negative bands appear between 3600 and 3750 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The band at 938 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is attributed to C–O stretch of the methoxy species
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> and the corresponding methyl rock band appears at 1180 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="cit65" ref-type="bibr">ref. 65</xref>) indicating the occurrence of methoxylation at RT.
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The shoulder at 990 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> could also arise from the C–O stretch of a second type of methoxy species or of the hydrogen bonded methanol.
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In line with the low frequency methoxy bands, consumption of different hydroxyls in the reaction (either in hydrogen bonding or methoxylation) is evident from negative bands above 3600 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A and C</xref>). The negative bands at 3610 and 3744 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> are due to consumption of Brønsted acidic and silanol groups, respectively.
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The band at 3665 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> was previously assigned to hydrolysed extra-framework Al(Al–OH).
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The assignment of the band at around 3725 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> is not straight forward and hence it is tentatively attributed to the involvement of differently coordinated hydroxyl groups.

0: The TCE glutathione conjugation-derived metabolite  S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)- l-cysteine (DCVC) induces cytotoxicity in HTR-8/SVneo, a placental cell line that models first-trimester extravillous trophoblasts (Elkin et al.
1: 2020a; Hassan et al.
2: 2016).
3: However, prior mechanistic studies of DCVC-induced cytotoxicity in placental cells have focused on specific molecular signaling pathways and biological responses, including reactive oxygen species generation, lipid peroxidation, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic signaling (Elkin et al.
4: 2019,  2018; Hassan et al.
5: 2016).
6: Application of comprehensive discovery approaches such as genome-wide gene expression profiling allows for the unbiased characterization of toxicity mechanisms without relying on individual pre-selected pathways and/or processes.

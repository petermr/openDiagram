0: In the present study, we aimed to characterize the role of TREM1 in IPA.
1: We assessed sTREM1 levels in clinical samples of IPA patients compared to controls and we tested for TREM1 functionality by assessing whether individual genetic variation in TREM1 had an impact on the detected levels of sTREM1 and other cytokine-driven immune responses against  A. fumigatus.
2: In addition to gain a deeper understanding of the role of TREM1, we compared the course of  A. fumigatus infections and immune responses in TREM1-deficient ( Trem1 /) and wild-type ( Trem1 +/+) mice.

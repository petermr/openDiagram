<p>Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of premature mortality worldwide (

Restoration of coronary artery perfusion is currently one of the main treatment options but it can lead to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI), which refers to a more serious myocardial injury caused by blood recanalization after a period of myocardial ischemia compared with that induced by vascular occlusion (

 <xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-09783" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). MIRI is reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, which imposes health, social and human burdens on societies worldwide, and thus is a public health issue (

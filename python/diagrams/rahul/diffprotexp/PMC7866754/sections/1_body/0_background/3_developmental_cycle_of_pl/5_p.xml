<p id="Par11">To further complicate the annotation challenge, antisense transcription events have widely been discovered in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and are thought to be important for gene expression regulation and parasite development between life cycle stages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Of particular interests are the antisense transcripts reported in the 
 <italic>var</italic> gene regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which represent a gene family that encodes for roughly 60 different variants of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1). PfEMP1 is a virulence factor that adhere to human receptors and hence enable the parasite to evade from the host immune system. To avoid recognition by antibodies, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> switches between the variant forms of PfEMP1 in a mutually exclusive manner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the tightly controlled mechanisms underlying 
 <italic>var</italic> gene transcriptional control remain largely unknown. It was recently shown that antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) derived from intronic region of 
 <italic>var</italic> can activate the corresponding 
 <italic>var</italic> gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which may shed light on 
 <italic>var</italic> gene expression control. Unravelling the regulatory roles of these noncanonical regions, such as their coding potential, will require novel approaches that are specifically tailored to them.

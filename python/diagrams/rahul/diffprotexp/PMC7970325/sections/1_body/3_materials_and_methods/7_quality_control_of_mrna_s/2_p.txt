0: Detailed annotation of RNA sequencing reads mapping statistic produced by STAR aligner [ 89] and quality control metrics produced by NCBI MAGIC software [ 79] are shown in the Supplementary file 2.
1: Minimal number of reads uniquely mapped on mRNA sequences of known genes was ~3,410 6 with the mean of ~9,210 6 (Supplementary file 2).
2: Average mapping rate, taking into account only uniquely mapped reads, was 78%.
3: Typical per base and per sequence quality scores visualized by fastQC software [ 80] demonstrated high values for individual base pairs and read sequences ( Figure 19 A, B).

<p>During cooling of the binary AlSi alloys, high and low-temperature precipitation compete for the same alloying element (i.e., Si). If cooling is carried out very slowly, precipitation will primarily result in coarse, polygonal-shaped particles being formed during the HTR. As the majority of those particles are precipitated inside the grain, homogeneous nucleation can be expected, particularly since this is promoted by the vacancies that are expected to be present at higher temperatures [

If precipitation at high temperatures is suppressed to a certain extent, a fraction of the solved Si will be precipitated at lower temperatures. From the classical theory of nucleation and growth, it is known that the morphology of precipitates is dependent on the formation temperature [

Since polygonal-shaped particles have a lower surface-to-volume ratio, precipitation of these particles is preferred at high temperatures [

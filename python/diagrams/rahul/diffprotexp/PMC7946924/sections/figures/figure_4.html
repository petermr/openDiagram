 <caption> Differential gene expression of miRNAs in 12 samples of V1 (SR-159) and V2 (SR-157) where Log 2 fold change of 1 was used as cut-off. The miRNAs expression in V1 and V2 are either “UP-regulated (green colour code)” or “DOWN-regulated (red colour code)” in comparison to NEUTRAL-miRNA (black-colour code) represented in scatter plot ( a) and heat map ( b). </caption>

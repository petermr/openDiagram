<p id="Par6">In this work, the microstructure associated with different states of a SA508Gr.4N steel is examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The mechanical properties are evaluated through tensile tests at room temperature and Charpy impact tests performed at temperatures ranging from −192 °C to 100 °C. The effect of impact toughness and temper embrittlement are discussed from the viewpoint of carbide size, block size, fraction of high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) and grain boundary characteristics.</p>

<p>iTRAQ-labelled samples were firstly diluted to 100 µl with H
 <sub>2</sub>O buffer (NH3•H
 <sub>2</sub>O, pH=10) prior to high performance liquid chromatography on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 25°C on a Gemini-NX 3u C18 110A; 150×2.00 mm Phenomenex column, and Gemini 3u C6-Phenyl 110A; 100×2.0 mm column (all from Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The flow rate used for reversed-phase column separation was 0.2 ml/min with H
 <sub>2</sub>O (mobile phase A) and 80% acetonitrile (mobile phase B) with the following gradient system parameters: 5–10% B for 0–15 min, 15–28% B for 15–48 min, 25–37% B for 48–60 min, 37–95% B for 60–65 min and 95% B for 65–70 min. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 214/280 nm and the fractions were collected every 50 sec; these were pooled for each sample and dehydrated by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 4 h at 25°C in vacuum centrifugation.

0: MBP was labeled with HiLyte Fluor 488 (Anaspec, Fremont, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: Briefly, 100 g of MBP was dialyzed overnight against 50 mM PBS, pH 7.4 at 4C.
2: Fluor was suspended in DMSO to generate 10 L of a 2 mM solution.
3: Protein labeling was conducted at a 7.5:1 ratio of fluor to protein at room temperature for 45 minutes.
4: The dye-conjugated protein was washed with 50 mM PBS, pH 7.4 and separated from unreacted dye by centrifugation in a spin column.

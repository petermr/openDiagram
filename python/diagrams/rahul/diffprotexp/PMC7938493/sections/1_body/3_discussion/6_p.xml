<p id="Par64">In summary, our study systematically analysed the expression and prognostic value of differentially expressed RBPs in BLCA using a series of bioinformatics techniques. We finally identified eight independent prognosis-associated RSPs and successfully constructed a prognostic risk score model to effectively assess the prognosis of BLCA patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop an RBP-related prognostic model for BLCA. This study provides a basis for the development of new therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers.</p>

<p>SCX chromatography using the AKTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare) was used to fractionate the iTRAQ labeled peptides. After being reconstituted and acidified with 2 mL buffer A (10 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> in 25% of ACN, pH 2.7), the peptides were loaded onto a PolySULFOETHYL 4.6 × 100 mm column (5 μm, 200 Å, PolyLC Inc., Maryland, U.S.A.). Then, the peptides were eluted at 1 ml/min with a gradient of 0–10% buffer B (500 mM KCl, 10 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> in 25% of ACN, pH 2.7) for 2 min, 10–20% buffer B for 25 min, 20–45% buffer B for 5 min, and 50–100% buffer B for 5 min. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm, and the fractions were collected after every 1 min. The collected fractions (~30 fractions) were combined into 10 pools and desalted on C18 Cartridges [Empore™ SPE Cartridges C18 (standard density), bed I.D. 7 mm, volume 3 ml, Sigma]. Each pooled fraction was concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 40 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and stored at −80°C for LC-MS/MS analysis.

<p>For small NPs and at large adsorbate coverages, the bond between the catalyst and the adsorbate can be directly observed. For example, the presence of a long Pt–O bond (ca. 2.5 Å) was tentatively associated with the presence of adsorbed 2-propanol on the surfaces of Pt NPs in an 
 <italic>in situ</italic> study of 2-propanol oxidation by Paredis et al.

 </sup> Simultaneously, the presence of a shorter Pt–O bond (ca. 2.0 Å) was attributed to chemisorbed oxygen or the formation of surface oxides.

 </sup> Pt–O bonds are commonly detected also in ORR studies with Pt catalysts, and the difference in the bond length has been used in the past to distinguish between adsorbed oxygen and −OH species, the latter having longer bond lengths of ∼2.2 Å.

 </sup> In the 
 <italic>in situ</italic> studies of CO electrooxidation, the formation of the Pt-CO bond was reported, with a corresponding bond length of ∼1.9 Å.

 </sup> Thus, by analyzing the differences in the interatomic distances revealed by XAFS, the identity of the adsorbed species can be sometimes revealed, while the comparison of the corresponding CNs can provide some estimate of the adsorbate coverages. Note here that for the determination of the expected interatomic distance for different types of absorbers, 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> simulations of adsorbates within, for example, the DFT formalism or an 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> molecular dynamics approach can be very helpful.

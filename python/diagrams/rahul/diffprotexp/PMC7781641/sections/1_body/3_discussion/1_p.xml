 <italic>Cacna1i</italic>, encoding the Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 channel, was 1 of 6 genes encoding an ion channel upregulated 10 weeks post-trigeminal nerve injury in whole TG compared to controls, while many ion channel mRNAs were downregulated at this chronic time point in our model. We also confirmed that Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 protein levels are elevated in the TG of FRICT-ION mice. We also show that the selective block of Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 is an effective strategy for alleviating neuropathic pain in both male and female mice in our model. While it may be unusual for RNA levels to not be upregulated as starkly as protein levels for Cav3.3 in the TG of FRICT-ION compared to naïve mice, it is becoming more and more well recognized that RNA expression is not the same as protein expression in biological systems and in some cases can even be inversely correlated [

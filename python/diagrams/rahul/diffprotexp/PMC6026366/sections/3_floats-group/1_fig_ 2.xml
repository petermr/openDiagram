  <p>Effects on life span, superoxide dismutase (SOD) level and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) content in 
   <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> treated with or without red ginseng extract (RGE). (A) Life span curves of male flies feed with RGE. Wild type (circles): mean survival life span, 71.67 d; maximum life span, 79.8 d; RGE-treated (squares): mean survival life span, 80.7 d; maximum life span 93.8 d. In comparison to the wild type, RGE-treated flies had a 12.60% and 11.90% increase in mean and maximum life span, respectively. Life span curve was constructed with Prism 5 software and statistical significance was determined with log-rank test. Bar graphs of average level of SOD and average content of MDA were repeated three times and analyzed by Student 
   <italic>t</italic> test. (B) Average level of SOD. (C) Average content of MDA. Data in this figure are shown as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance: **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 (RGE-treated vs. wild type).

<p>When aardvarks had low minimum 24-h body temperatures, they increased the time they spent active during daylight hours but decreased their total foraging duration. Optimal foraging theory proposes that an animal should maximise energy intake while taking into account all potential costs and benefits of foraging (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pyke, 1984</xref>), such that the animal would continue to forage as long as energetic benefits exceed the likely costs of foraging, including predation risk and energy costs (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Podolski et al., 2013</xref>), or decrease activity to conserve energy (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Oâ€™Donnell, 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Christian and Geiser, 2007</xref>). During a drought summer and resource-limited winters, when prey availability was reduced, our aardvarks did not compensate by foraging for longer, likely to avoid energetic costs incurred by foraging, and consequently lost body condition, sometimes lethally.

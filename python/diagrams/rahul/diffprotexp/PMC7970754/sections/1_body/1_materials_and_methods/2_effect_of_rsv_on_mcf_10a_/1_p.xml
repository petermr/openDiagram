<p>Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) (Dojindo, Japan) was used to detect the effect of RSV (Solarbio, China) on the survival of MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells in the logarithmic growth phase were adjusted to a concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/ml and were inoculated in 96-well plates (100 µl per well). The experiment was divided into eight groups, and each group was set up with five duplicate wells that were incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator overnight. After the cells were adhered, the medium was removed, and 100 µl of DMEM (Gibco, USA) containing RSV at concentrations of 0, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μM were added in groups. The control group had 100 µl of 0.1% DMSO in DMEM added, which was then incubated for 24 h under the same conditions. Next, 10 µl of CCK8 solution was added to each well and incubation continued for 3 h. A microplate reader was used to measure absorbance (A) at 450 nm. The survival rates of the eight groups of MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells were then compared, and the experiment was repeated six times. The concentration of RSV that produced significant differences in survival rates between the two cell lines was chosen as the optimum concentration for further experiments.

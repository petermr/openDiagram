0: To systematically characterize the expression of the three relevant GluN2-NMDAR subunits within the SDH versus DDH regions of the dorsal horn, we performed qualitative and quantitative immunohistochemistry on fixed spinal sections of male and female juvenile rats.
1: Through a combination of pepsin antigen-retrieval and signal amplification techniques, we were able to detect GluN2 subunits at synaptic, extrasynaptic, and somatic loci within the dorsal horn.
2: Finally, we examined the relative distribution of these GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D NMDAR subunits across the mediolateral axis of the SDH.

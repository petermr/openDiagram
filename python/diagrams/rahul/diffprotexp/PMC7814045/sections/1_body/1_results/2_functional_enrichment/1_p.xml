<p id="Par9">The list of pathways enriched during the three treatments is in the Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>. The pathways enriched with DEGs upregulated at 45 min correspond to cell response to stress and external stimuli. At 120 and 200 min, the enrichment of pathways related to degradation of proteins by the proteasome is evident. The pathways enriched by downregulated DEGs are amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis at 45 min, while ribosomal biosynthesis, ribosomal scanning and start codon recognition and cap-dependent translation initiation pathways are reported at 120 and 200 min (Supplemental Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

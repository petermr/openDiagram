<p>In the commonly used setup schematically shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>a, the X-ray radiation with desired energy is then selected using a monochromator, which consists of two parallel single crystals (normally Si), cut along a specific direction (e.g., (111), (220), or (311)). Alternatively, both diffraction planes can be produced from a single crystal by cutting in it a channel for the X-ray beam. By rotating the monochromator crystals, X-rays with wavelength λ are selected that fulfill the Bragg condition

 </xref>a). Higher harmonics (wavelengths corresponding to integers 
 <italic>n</italic> &gt; 1) need to be removed either by using X-ray mirrors or by detuning of the double crystal monochromator by slightly tilting the second crystal with respect to the first crystal. Such misalignment of crystals reduces the intensity of all components in the monochromatized radiation, but the intensity of higher harmonics is suppressed much more strongly.

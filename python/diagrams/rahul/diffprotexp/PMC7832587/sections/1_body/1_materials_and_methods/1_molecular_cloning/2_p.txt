0: Single expression vectors: The cDNAs encoding the three ATP2 orthologs were cloned in the pYeDP60 expression vector [ 31] between the  EcoRI and  NotI restriction sites, yielding the pYeDP60-ATP2-TEV-BAD plasmid that contains in downstream position the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage-site coding sequence followed by the biotin acceptor domain (BAD) coding sequence.
1: To obtain the N-terminal BAD tagged ATP2 constructs, pYeDP60-BAD-TEV-ATP2, we amplified by PCR the ATP2 sequences incorporating the  PmeI and  SacI restrictions sites at both, the 5 and 3 ends, and cloned into the pYeDP60 vector.
2: The PcATP2-D596N mutant was obtained using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent).
3: The nine Cdc50 subunits sequences were cloned in the pYeDP60 vector between the  EcoRI and  BamHI restriction sites.
4: The resulting pYeDP60-Cdc50-TEV-10xHis vectors contain the TEV site followed by a 10xHis tag at the C-terminal end of the proteins.

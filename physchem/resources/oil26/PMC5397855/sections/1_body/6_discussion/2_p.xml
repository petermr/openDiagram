<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Different concentrations of the garlic essential oil showed toxic effects on larva, pupa and adult of <italic>T. molitor</italic> 48&#8201;h after topical application. The dose-response bioassay confirmed toxicity against <italic>T. molitor</italic>, reaching a 90% mortality rate. Increasing concentrations of garlic essential oil in this insect have shown immediate toxic responses within 12&#8201;h of application<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Comparing the contact toxicity of garlic essential oil on developmental stages of <italic>T. molitor</italic>, the larva was significantly more susceptible followed by pupa and adult. The LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> of larva (0.77&#8211;1.36%), pupa (2.37&#8211;4.01%), and adult (2.03&#8211;4.73%) indicate that small quantities of the garlic essential oil are toxic in this insect, being more tolerant with age.</p>

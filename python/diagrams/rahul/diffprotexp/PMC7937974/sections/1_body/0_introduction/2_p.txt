0: Compared with the ICAM-1, E-selectin is a more effective molecule in slowing down leukocyte rolling  in vivo and  in vitro ( 14), which serves as the only selectin expressed by human endothelial cells during inflammatory stimulation  in vitro and plays a more significant role in recruiting inflammatory cells in humans ( 15).
1: The expression levels of E-selectin can be stimulated by a series of inflammatory molecules including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
2: Previous studies showed that E-selectin levels rose to peak after being stimulated by inflammatory cytokines for 4 h then gradually decreased  in vitro ( 16).
3: Moreover, E-selectin has been shown to be involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and atherosclerosis ( 16,  17).
4: A previous study found an increment of the soluble form of E-selectin (sE-selectin) in KD patients' sera in the acute phase ( 18), and the expression of E-selectin was also observed in the coronary arteries of KD patients with CAL ( 19), while a few studies focused on the relationship between E-selectin and inflammatory cell adhesion in CAL formation of KD and the underlying mechanism.
5: Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to examine E-selectin levels in endothelial cells treated with KD patients' sera with or without CAL and explore the underlying mechanism involved in inflammatory cell adhesion of CAL.

<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the inflammatory and immune responses that occur in the spinal cord are vital contributors to the progression of MIRI (

Based on the importance of the spinal autonomic nervous system in the pathophysiology of MIRI, there has been a notable effort in this field to study changes in the genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics in the spinal cord after MIRI, which could facilitate both existing interventions and novel therapies directed at cardiac-autonomic targets (

<p id="Par45">To examine the impact of RBFOX2 on exon 23 skipping more directly, we perturbed RBFOX2 expression using two independent siRNAs. Either siRNA achieved with 2.5-fold to 4-fold reduced 
 <italic>RBFOX2</italic> levels a similar reduction as RUNX1/RUNX1T1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>). This loss of 
 <italic>RBFOX2</italic> led to a threefold decreased exon 23 retention again similar to that achieved by depletion of the fusion protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10g</xref>, upper panel). Notably, knockdown of SRSF7 did not affect exon 23 retention (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10g</xref>, bottom panel). These combined data show that RUNX1/RUNX1T1 affects alternative splicing of PTK2 by modulating the expression of RBFOX2.

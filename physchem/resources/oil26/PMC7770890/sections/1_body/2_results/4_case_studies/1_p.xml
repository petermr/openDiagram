<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We then analyzed several ACE2 proteins
to show molecular details about why they may or may not be effectively
used by SARS-CoV-2 as an entry receptor. The first case is a New-World
monkey, marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>), which is of
extremely low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 both in vivo and in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> The marmoset achieved a high binding score of &#8722;46.81 EEU.
Compared with hACE2, there were four residue substitutions in the
marmoset ACE2, i.e., Y41H, Q42E, M82T, and G354Q (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref>). In hACE2, Y41 could form
hydrogen bonds with T500 in the RBD; Q42 could form a hydrogen bond
with the carbonyl group of G446 and another hydrogen bond with Y449
where the NE2 atom of Q42 acts as the donor and the OH atom of Y449
as the acceptor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a, left). The substitution of Y41 into histidine not only results
in a reduced van der Waals packing energy but also disrupts the favorable
hydrogen bond with T500; mutation of Q42 into glutamic acid destroys
the two hydrogen bonds with G446 and Y449; moreover, the M82T substitution
could lead to a reduced packing interaction with F486 due to the smaller
side-chain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a, right). The loss of three hydrogen bonds and the weakened van
der Waals forces result in the poor binding energy. As reported, the
double mutant H41Y/E42Q made the variant marmoset receptor more permissive
to SARS-CoV-2 infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Besides the
New-World monkeys, we found that the ACE2 proteins of four bats (i.e., <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic>, <italic>Myotis brandtii</italic>, <italic>Myotis davidii</italic>, and <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>) also
have the Y41H/Q42E substitution (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717/suppl_file/pr0c00717_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S7</ext-link>); interestingly, they were also predicted to be less
effective with a binding score of &gt; &#8722;47 EEU.</p>

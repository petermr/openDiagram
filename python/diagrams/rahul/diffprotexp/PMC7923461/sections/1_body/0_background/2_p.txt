0: Microtubule is an important component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.
1: Moreover, it is one of the most functional proteins, which play an important role in dynamic polymerization and depolymerization through cell replication and division [ 6].
2: Microtubules are uniformly assembled from highly conserved /-tubulin heterodimers [ 7].
3: Recently, several studies have reported that -tubulin is involved in the occurrence of a variety of tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer and prostatic cancer [ 8 10].
4: In addition, -tubulin is also associated with the development of astrocytoma and chemotherapeutic resistance of liver cancer [ 11].
5: Moreover, TUBA1C is a subtype of -tubulin, and its overexpression is associated with the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [ 12,  13].
6: However, no previous study has elucidated how the overexpression of TUBA1C affects LUAD patients.

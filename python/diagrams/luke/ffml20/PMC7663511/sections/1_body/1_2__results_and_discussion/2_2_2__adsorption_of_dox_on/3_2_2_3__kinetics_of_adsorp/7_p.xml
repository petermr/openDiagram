<p>The best fit was obtained for the pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models. However, the value of equilibrium sorption capacity from the pseudo-first order model (q
 <sub>e</sub> = 2290 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) was significantly higher than the experimental value of 3900 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. It indicates that this model is not appropriate for describing the investigated phenomena. Thus, the interpretation of parameter obtained from the model is useless. In contrast, the q
 <sub>e</sub> parameter calculated from the pseudo-second order equation (q
 <sub>e</sub> = 4029 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) matches the experimental value (3900 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) (

 <sup>2</sup> coefficient) provide a basis for deeper analysis of the DOX sorption mechanism. It can be said that the nature of the adsorption process can be potentially treated as chemically controlled to a large extent [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-08230" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The presented suggestion is confirmed by the high value of the Elovich constant α that is related to chemisorption. In comparison with the literature data, the value of maximal q
 <sub>e</sub> reported in this study is much higher than values obtained for SWCNTs (1700 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-21-08230" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] as well as for oxidized MWCNTs after 2 h of the adsorption process (q
 <sub>e</sub> &lt; 1000 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-08230" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Wang et al. have reported also that the increase of time contacts to 10 days for the system modified MWCNTs – DOX allowed an increase in the adsorption capacity till 8000 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-08230" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nonetheless, the ultra-long adsorption equilibrium time affects the removal rate as a consequence of the formation of stable sludge-like structure and loss of bioactivity of the drug.

<p>The flexible substrate was braided with three SSYs. The anode and cathode materials were deposited onto the SSYs by the dipping-drying method. SSYs coated with graphite is the anode, referred as SSY@G. SSYs coated with LFP is the cathode, referred as SSY@LFP. In detail, the electrode slurry was prepared by magnetically stirring LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> or graphite, PVDF, and CNTs in the NMP solvent at a mass ratio of 7.5:1.5:1 for 12 h at room temperature. Later, the well-dispersed solution was transferred to a home-made mold with SSY immersed for 10 min and vacuum-dried in an oven at 60 Â°C for 12 h.

 <caption> Variable contributions of transcriptomic regulatory layers to the definition of neuronal identity. a Heatmap showing the Pearson correlation ( R 2) between pairs of latent factor weights assigned to each sample inferred when only GE data is analyzed ( y-axis) and when only APA_AS_IR data are analyzed ( x-axis). Latent factors that are highly correlated indicate neuronal population groupings identified by GE data only, and independently by APA_AS_IR data. b Combined scatter and contour plot comparing the latent factor weights between GE-LF1 and APA_AS_IR-LF5. Both factors identify a cluster of hippocampal neurons. However, each factor distinguishes the neurons differently (see Fig.  4c for description of contour plots). c Comparison between GE-LF4 and APA_AS_IR-LF4. Both factors identify a cluster of peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons. However, GE-LF4 specifically identifies a subset of PNS neurons belonging to the olfactory system. d Multiple “layers” of coordinated transcriptomic regulatory networks collectively and differentially contribute to establishing neuronal identity throughout the nervous system.

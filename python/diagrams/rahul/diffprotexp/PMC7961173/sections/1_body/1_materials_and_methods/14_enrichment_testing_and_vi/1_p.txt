0: Because ATF4-driven transcriptional activity is a key indicator of ISR activation, ATF4 gene targets, were tested for overrepresentation among DCVC-induced differentially expressed genes.
1: Individual ATF4 gene targets were identified from a mouse model ChIP-seq analysis and included in our study (Han et al.
2: 2013).
3: Two additional ATF4 gene targets,  PMAIP1 and PSPH, were also included (Sharma et al.
4: 2018; Yang et al.
5: 2018; Zhao et al.
6: 2014).
7: Genes regulated by ATF4 ( N = 383) were tested for enrichment in DCVC-treated HTR-8/SVneo genes with significant differential expression (FDR < 0.05 + LogFC > 0.35 [FC > 1.3]).
8: ATF4 mouse target genes were converted to human homologues using the biomaRt package (Durinck et al.
9: 2005,  2009).
10: ATF4 target gene enrichment tests were performed using the phyper function (hypergeometric test) (R Core Team  2019).
11: To visualize significantly enriched individual differential gene expression for ATF4 targets from the RNA sequencing analyses, a heatmap displaying the logFC levels of treated compared to control samples, along with a hierarchical clustering diagram were generated using the heatmap.2 function in the gplots package (Warnes et al.
12: 2019).

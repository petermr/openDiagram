<p>To acquire the excess specific heat capacity (

 </italic>), the alloyed sample is placed in the sample sensor, while the reference sample is placed in the reference sensor. Since both sample and reference have very similar absolute heat capacities, this setup retains the symmetry within the differential scanning calorimeter and its entire measurement setup. This supports the basic idea of DSC, which is a steady comparison of two equal measuring systems. In an ideal system, the only remaining differences—and therefore the only remaining thermal asymmetries—are thermal effects related to reactions within the sample. The resulting signal can therefore be directly and solely related to the phase transformation of interest.

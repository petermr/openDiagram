<p>After pooling and sample clean-up by solid phase extraction (SPE strata-X-C, Phenomenex), the sample pool were subjected to peptide IEF-IPG (isoelectric focusing by immobilized pH gradient) in pI range 3–10 (350 μg). Freeze dried peptide samples were dissolved in 250 μl rehydration solution containing 8 
 <sc>m</sc> urea and 1% IPG pharmalyte pH 3–10 and allowed to adsorb to the 24 cm linear gradient IPG strip by swelling overnight. Peptides were focused on the IPG strip as described in (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). After focusing, the peptides were passively eluted into 72 contiguous fractions with MilliQ water using an in-house constructed IPG extractor robotics (GE Healthcare Bio- Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden, prototype instrument) into a 96-well plate (V-bottom, Corning, Hickory, North Carolina product #3894), which were then dried in a SpeedVac. The resulting fractions were freeze dried and kept at −20 °C.

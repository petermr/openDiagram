<p id="Par52">All the above-cited contributions have partially disclosed the nature of numerous apomixis candidates and evidenced the effects of polyploidy on gene expression. However, our knowledge on the chronological modulation of transcript levels along the sexual and the apomictic reproductive routes remained limited, since previous studies were conducted on samples collected at a particular timeframe or on mixed pools representing a group of developmental stages. Under these experimental limitations, either part of the DETs go undetected or those experimenting expression increments at different developmental stages for contrasting reproductive modes are mistakenly classified as non-differential. Moreover, the plus/minus orientation of the expressed transcripts remains globally unexplored, even when some apomixis candidates (

The lack of comprehensive data prevents researchers from grasping the true dimensions of heterochronic expression and antisense regulation affecting apomixis development as well as from inspecting their biological consequences. The objective of this work was to gain a quantitative, statistically significant, massive characterization of sense/antisense transcripts expressed across four crucial reproductive steps in sexual and apomictic

<p>It is notable that our pilot studies of different topical 4-MU formulations for optimization were performed on mice at 6–10 weeks of age, a time frame in which the baseline HA content of murine dorsal skin is variable, particularly in female mice. Whereas the more definitive studies using the optimized topical 4-MU formula were performed at 7–8 weeks of age, where the HA levels are at a natural low at 8 weeks. This may explain why HA reduction was somewhat less effective in the validation experiments – as there was not as much baseline HA in the skin, we posit the natural nadir blunted the apparent knockdown efficacy. In addition, sex differences in mouse skin may have played a role in the apparent efficacy of the topical formulation. These differences have been well described by Azzi et al. using hormone therapy and gonadectomy and appear to be sex hormone receptor-dependent (Hanley et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Azzi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). This sexual dimorphism may play a role in the difference in overall efficacy of our topical drug in that female mice have higher adiposity and thinner dermal layer, to unknown pharmacokinetic effect. The differences in efficacy between female and male could also be attributable to the differences in baseline HA levels at the time point when topical 4-MU treatments were initiated, wherein untreated female mice had higher starting HA content in their dorsal skin compared to male skin at the same location and at the same age. Further, our design of experiments did not distinguish by sex of the mouse on which the formulation was tested. It is conceivable that the inherent differences in the makeup of skin between the sexes means that there is a differing optimal topical 4-MU formulation specific to male vs. female mice.

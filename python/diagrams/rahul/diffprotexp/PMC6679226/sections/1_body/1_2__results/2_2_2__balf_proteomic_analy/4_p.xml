<p>The top 10 up- or down-regulated BALF proteins following I.T. or I.P. LPS administration compared to the controls are listed in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03401-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-03401-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Interestingly, histone H2A.Z (H2afz) was the most up-regulated BALF protein following both I.T. and I.P. LPS treatment. Extracellular histones have been shown to accumulate in BALF following ALI, and their appearance requires complement 5a receptors, neutrophils and lung macrophages [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The sources of the extracellular histones could be dead/dying tissue cells and/or inflammatory cells, and histones are known to be associated with neutrophil extracellular traps [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that, when purified histones were delivered to lung via the airways, intense inflammatory response and epithelial damage ensued [

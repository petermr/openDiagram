  <p>LE gene expressions stratify the risk of prostate cancer recurrence. The Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves for the indicated genes were produced with the R survival package using data from the TCGA PanCancer (
   <bold>A</bold>) and MSKCC (
   <bold>B</bold>) cohorts. Cutoff points for individual genes were obtained using the R Maxstat package. Statistical analyses were performed using logrank test.

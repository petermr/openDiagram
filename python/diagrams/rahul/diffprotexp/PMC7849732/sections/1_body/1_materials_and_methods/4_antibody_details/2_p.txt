0: To detect the GluN2B subunit, we used a polyclonal antibody (Alomone Labs, #AGC-003) raised in rabbit.
1: It recognizes the extracellular, N-terminus, sequence (C)NTHEKRIYQSNMLNR corresponding to the amino-acid residues 323337 of rat GluN2B.
2: This GluN2B antibody has been successfully used in immunohistochemistry and cytochemistry experiments [ 32, 35, 36] as well as in western blot studies.

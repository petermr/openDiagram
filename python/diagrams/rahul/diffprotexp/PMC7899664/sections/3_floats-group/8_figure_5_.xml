  <p>Qualitative analysis of histology in control and treated mice. (A–D) HABP stained representative 40× images of dorsal skin of baseline (top row) vs. topical 4-MU treated (bottom row) in female (left column) and male (right column) mice are shown. (A–B) Female mice have thicker epidermal layer and more adiposity at baseline, while male mice have a thicker dermal layer and less adiposity. (A–D) Treatment with topical 4-MU resulted in dermal matrix disorganization in both male and female mice compared to baseline. (E–F) Control staining of dorsal skin. (E) HABP staining following treatment with hyaluronidase. Arrows indicate areas of residual HA following hyaluronidase digestion. (F) Secondary antibody only staining without HABP.</p>

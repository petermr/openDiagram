<p id="para0011">RNA was submitted to the Genomics core facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center where Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA6000 nano assay kit VII (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) were used to determine RNA integrity. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions. mRNA was prepared from total RNA (500 ng per sample) using oligo-dT magnetic beads. Random hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase were used to synthesize first strand of cDNA. Double stranded cDNA (ds cDNA) was generated by removing the RNA template and synthesizing a replacement strand, incorporating dUTP in place of dTTP. For purifying ds cDNA from second strand, AMPure XP beads were used (Beckman Coulter). cDNAs were first blunted and then poly (A) tail was added to the 3′ends for ligation. Ligation of indexing adaptors was performed and PCR amplification was performed using 15 cycles on suitable DNA fragments.</p>

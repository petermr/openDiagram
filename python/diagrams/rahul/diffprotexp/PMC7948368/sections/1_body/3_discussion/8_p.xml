<p id="Par49">We cannot exclude the possibility that other true associations were not detected in the replication phase of the study as the sample size was small, limiting power. Nonetheless, the findings support further testing of transcripts that have been independently replicated to develop a statistical model to stratify patients according to likely treatment response. Whilst the transcriptomic response was detected at 3â€‰months, it is possible that changes in transcript levels could manifest much earlier. Furthermore, it will be important to test if these findings are specific to adalimumab response or generalise to other therapies licenced for use in RA. Future similar studies should therefore seek to collect samples at earlier time-points and from patients treated with other classes of therapy to address these important questions. Whilst the inclusion of the extremes of response phenotype in the current study maximised the power to detect associations, the inclusion of intermediate DAS28 responders in future studies will be necessary to allow an estimation of the predictive ability of the biomarker panel with DAS28 response across the full spectrum of response.</p>

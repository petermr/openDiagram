  <p>The expression of LINC00466 is highly in tissues and cell lines of glioma. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Volcano plots of the DElncRNAs in TCGA-LGG/GBM database (up-regulated genes were defined as red and down-regulated genes were defined as green); (
   <bold>B</bold>) Differential expression of LINC00466 in Tumor and Normal of TCGA-GBM/LGG; (
   <bold>C</bold>) Differential expression of LINC00466 among Normal, LGG and GBM of the data in TCGA and GTEx database; (
   <bold>D</bold>) The expression level of LINC00466 in the tissue of glioma and adjacent normal tissues was detected by qRT-PCR; (
   <bold>E</bold>) The expression of LINC00466 in glioma of WHO grade (I–II) and WHO grade (III–IV); (
   <bold>F</bold>) The expression of LINC00466 in three glioma cell lines and one astroglia cell line was detected by qRT-PCR; (
   <bold>G</bold>) The location of LINC00466 in glioma tissues was identified by FISH experiments; (
   <bold>H</bold>) the expression levels of GAPDH (cytoplasmic marker), U6 (nuclear marker) and LINC00466 after the separation of cell nucleus and cytoplasm in A172 cells were examined.

 <p>(5e) The differential development of the hippocampus should be considered. The authors should address whether the primordial hippocampus may be the prominent source of RNA difference and whether pax6 or Sox9 is elevated in that region, determining whether radial glia or newly differentiated astrocytes may be a source in this particular domain. This may reveal an interesting component of the developmental advancement, given the slightly different timing of hippocampal development relative to neocortex.</p>

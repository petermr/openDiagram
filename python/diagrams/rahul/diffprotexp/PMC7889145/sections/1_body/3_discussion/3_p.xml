<p>In this report, we serendipitously identified the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic chromosome insertion site during initial generation of an adipocyte-specific deletion model of the gene 
 <italic>Adam10</italic>. This preliminary discovery by ‘old-fashioned’ linkage analysis prompted our further investigations into the genomic and transcriptional changes introduced by the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgene. Whole-genome sequencing of the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse model revealed both the location of the transgene insertion and passenger genes that were introduced with the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> BAC. Innovation and cost-saving strategies in highly parallel sequencing continue to reduce the cost of whole-genome sequencing data generation and make this approach increasingly appropriate when characterizing new transgenic mouse models.

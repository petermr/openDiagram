 <caption> Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between FOXL2 C134W and FOXL2 WT. a Volcano plot showing in pink DEGs between FOXL2 C134W and FOXL2 WT (DESeq, q &lt; 0.05). The genes FOXL2 and SMAD3 were omitted from the plot. b, c Gene ontology enrichment analysis using up-regulated genes in FOXL2 C134W transfected cells ( b, n = 487), and down-regulated genes in FOXL2 C134W transfected cells (C, n = 230). The red line indicates p-value cutoff for p &lt; 0.05. Gene ontology enrichment p-values were calculated using Metascape [ 51]. GO terms associated with expression of FOXL2 and/or SMAD3 were removed from the results (see Methods and Additional file 2: Tables S2–4) </caption>

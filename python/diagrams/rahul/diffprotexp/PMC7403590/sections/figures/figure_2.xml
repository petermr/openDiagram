  <p>Autophagic-lysosomal pathway in PD. Autophagic and lysosomal markers were determined in 
   <italic>post-mortem</italic> human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of sporadic PD patients and controls. The levels of LC3II, p62, Beclin1, Lamp2A, Lamp1 and CatD were determined in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) SNpc; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Hippocampus and (C) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Densitometric analysis of the levels of LC3II, p62, Beclin1, Lamp2A, Lamp1 and CatD. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5, **p &lt; 0.01, versus SNpc control subjects; 
   <sup>###</sup>p &lt; 0.001, versus hippocampus control subjects and 
   <sup>&amp;&amp;</sup>p &lt; 0. 01, versus cortex control subjects). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information.

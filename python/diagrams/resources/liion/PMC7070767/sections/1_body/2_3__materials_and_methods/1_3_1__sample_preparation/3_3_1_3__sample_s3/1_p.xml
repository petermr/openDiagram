<p>Sample S3 was porous silicon nanowires (pSi-NWs) synthesized through metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) following the procedure of Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] using sample S1 as feedstock. Si powder was degreased in a Diener Electronic ZEPTO plasma cleaner under O
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 min. Then, 1 g of sample S1 were added to a 100 mL solution of 75 mL H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 25 mL HF (5M) and 0.344 g AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>. The Ag plating proceeded at room temperature for 5 min. After the first step (HF/AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>) of etching, we observe the formation of small silver particles on the surface of silicon particles. These particles grew in size and formed silver dendrites. During the first minutes of etching in the second solution (HF/H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), the silver particles sink into the substrate, the silver dendrites grow on and the nanowires are formed as the remaining of the unetched silicon [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Silver-deposited Si particles were etched in 5M HF and 0.3 M H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at room temperature. The metal-assisted chemical etching was performed for 8 min in an ultrasonic bath and then stopped by adding a large amount of deionized water to the etching solution. The etched Si powder was filtered through a micropore filter paper and rinsed several times with deionized water. The Ag particles loaded on the etched Si powder were easily removed with standard Ag etchant (NH

<p id="Par39">Another interesting observation of our study is the increased concomitant expression of GFAP, Vimentin, ALDH1A2, and CYR61 in the cerebral AVM-associated astrocytes. The CYR61 is a matricellular protein that is secreted by astrocytes during development. Expression of this protein is reduced in the adult brain. It is known that the CYR61 is upregulated during tissue remodeling, axon regeneration, and angiogenesis. Expression of CYR61 has also been found to be increased in various types of tumors such as pancreatic cancers, melanomas, mammary tumors, and various grades of primary gliomas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], whose expression is induced by CYR61 protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that the CYR61 over expression in the cerebral AVM-associated astrocytes could be an initial stimulus that activates downstream pathways leading to aberrations in differentiation of vascular structures and maturation. We conclude that CYR61 from abnormal astrocytes in pathological conditions may have a role in inducing the formation of aberrant vascular structures as seen in the AVM nidus.

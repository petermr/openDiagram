<p>In a living cell proteins perform their functions not as a single entity but rather work together in the context of networks. We analyzed all of the pathways and interactions connected to each of the identified proteins hoping to find the possible key node proteins during the larval development using pathway studio software. As a result, 23 proteins classified into 6 functional groups were linked in the network based on diverse linkage relationships like protein-protein interactions, modifications and regulation of expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013455-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Based on the protein functional group, most proteins presented in the network (30%) were related to carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, namely, aldehyde dehydrogenase (cg3752), aldehyde reductase (fdh), ATP synthase beta subunit (atpsynbata), Bellwether (blw), enolase (eno), phosphoglycerate mutase (pglym87) and transketolase (cg8036). Proteins involved in development processes were the second most represented (20%) and comprise Leonardo (14-3-3 zeta), 14-3-3 protein epsilon (14-3-3 epsilon), actin-87E isoform 2 (Ptx1), cathepsin D (cathd), imaginal disc growth factor 4 (idgf4) and lethal (2)37 (l(2)37cc). Proteins involved in metabolizing amino acid accounted for 9% that included proteasome subunit alpha type 5 (prosma5), arginine kinase (argk), and 4% fat acid metabolism, (fatty acid binding protein, rfabp). As the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> most represented protein in the functional enrichments (13%), antioxidant proteins comprised peroxiredoxin 2540 (prx2540-2), glutathione S transferase S1 (gsts1) and thioredoxin peroxidase 1 (jafrac1). Protein folding was also the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> represented (9%) functional term in the network linked through heat shock protein 8 (Hsc70-1) and ERp60 (erp60). Whereas, nutritional storage and transcription/translation proteins were networked by larval serum protein 2 (Lsp2) and translational controlled tumor protein (cg33057), respectively (

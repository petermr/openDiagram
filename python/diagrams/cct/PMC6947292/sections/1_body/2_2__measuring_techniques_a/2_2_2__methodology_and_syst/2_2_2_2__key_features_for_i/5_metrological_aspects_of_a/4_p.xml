<p>In the DSC analysis, the measure of the fraction of precipitates is the specific precipitation heat (or enthalpy) released by the precipitation. On reaching the UCCR, the enthalpy change by precipitation is obviously zero. This leads to a metrological problem: in a range of cooling rates close to the UCCR, we need to determine whether no precipitation heat is detectable in the measured curves. Thus, the challenge is to decide when a precipitation signal is above the device-specific noise level.</p>

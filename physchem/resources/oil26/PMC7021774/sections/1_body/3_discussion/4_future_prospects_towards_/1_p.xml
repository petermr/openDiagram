<p id="Par32">The current consensus is that ToxB sensitivity is predominantly conferred by a single locus, 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> (Friesen and Faris 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>; Abeysekara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). The wheat reference genome has been constructed in the variety ‘Chinese Spring’, which is insensitive to ToxB. The only other 
 <italic>Ptr</italic> effector sensitivity locus that has been cloned is 
 <italic>Tsn1</italic>, at which recessive alleles confer insensitivity to the effector ToxA. The protein kinase/NBS-LRR gene underlying 
 <italic>Tsn1</italic> is deleted in almost all ToxA-insensitive varieties (Faris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the gene underlying 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> may also be absent in ToxB-insensitive varieties, including ‘Chinese Spring’. To date, a small number of hexaploid wheat varieties have been resequenced, including ‘Claire’, ‘Paragon’, ‘Robigus’ (available at

However, we found none of these varieties to be sensitive to ToxB. Here we investigated the genome sequence of the synthetic hexaploid wheat accession ‘W7984’ (Chapman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>), previously shown to carry a ToxB-sensitive allele at the 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic> locus (Friesen and Faris 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). While the ‘W7984’ contigs have low (55%) genome coverage and have short length (contig N50 6.7 kb), we nevertheless thought it useful to undertake an analysis of the potential gene space in a ToxB-sensitive line. This analysis allowed the identification of additional candidate genes within the ToxB-sensitive line ‘W7984’ super-contig that were not present in ToxB-insensitive variety ‘Chinese Spring’, providing potential leads for future analysis. We did not further our analysis of the ‘W7984’ genome sequence due to its fragmented nature, and because a number of projects are currently resequencing additional hexaploid bread wheat varieties. These include the 10 + Wheat Genomes Project (

As MAGIC founder ‘Xi19’ is ToxB sensitive, we hope that the future completion of the ‘Xi19’ genome assembly will aid identification of the genetic variant(s) underlying 
 <italic>Tsc2</italic>.

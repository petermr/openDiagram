<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Enrichment has been shown to successfully decrease stereotypic behaviors in some situations but not all [<xref rid="B34-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], including the current study. In general, the interpretation of stereotypic behavior, such as pacing, is that it is a negative indicator of welfare; although, the implications of current versus past welfare, and coping versus frustration behavior, are less clear at this time [<xref rid="B2-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The motivation the aardvarks felt to perform the pacing behavior is also not clear at this time. Mason et al. [<xref rid="B34-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] hypothesized that if enrichment does not target the underlying motivation to perform a stereotypic behavior, it may have less of an impact. Additionally, the relatively low rates of pacing behavior displayed by the aardvarks in the current study (coupled with the lack of a control condition) could also explain why we did not see effects of enrichment on this measure, similar to the potential &#8220;floor effect&#8221; observed in relation to glucocorticoids. Aardvarks showing higher rates of stereotypic behavior may be more affected by enrichment use, or perhaps, the foraging and exploring enrichment impacted pacing equally.</p>

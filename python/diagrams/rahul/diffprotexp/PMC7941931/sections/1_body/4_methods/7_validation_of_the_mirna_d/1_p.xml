<p id="Par57">The 5′-RLM-RACE method was used to investigate the miRNA-directed cleavage of their predicted target mRNA in vitro. Total RNA was ligated to an RNA adaptor and was reverse transcribed using the FirstChoice® RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 5′-RLM-RACE was performed as described previously by DeBoer et al. [

<p id="Par46">In summary, this study use bioinformatics analysis to find that the occurrence of VTE is related to the abnormal expression of monocytes and mast cells resting. Ribosomes play a vital role in the occurrence of VTE. The ribosomal protein family genes may be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of VTE. In addition, immune genes S100A12, NR1D2 and CD3G may also be effective targets for the prevention and treatment of VTE, providing new ideas for the mechanism and treatment of VTE. It can be seen that the occurrence of VTE is related to inflammation, abnormal gene expression and immune abnormalities.</p>

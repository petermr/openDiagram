  <p>ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL expression in adult and pediatric malignancies. Comparison of median (

   <italic>ACE2</italic>, (

   <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>, and (
   <bold>c</bold>) 
   <italic>CTSL</italic> expression from 7 pediatric cancer tissues from TARGET (n = 734), and 33 cancer tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 10,535) was conducted. Gene expression is expressed as log
   <sub>2</sub>-transformed function of TPM. ANOVA with Tukey’s test was performed for comparison of expression between studies. ***

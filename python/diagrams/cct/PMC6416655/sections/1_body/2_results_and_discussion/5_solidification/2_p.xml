<p id="p0115">It was already known that the high-alloy steel with high carbon content has a high cracking susceptibility. Moreover, the segregation was another difficulty in forging production with continuous casting slab. Therefore, in the practical process, an improvement should be applied to the continuous casting process. The solidification characteristic curve measurement is necessary to optimize the process.</p>

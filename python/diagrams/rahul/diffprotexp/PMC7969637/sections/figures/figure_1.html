 <caption> The analysis of differential gene. (A) The volcano map of differentially expressed genes. The horizontal axis represents the multiple of differential expression (Log2FC), and the vertical axis represents â€“log10 (FDR). Meanwhile, the blue dot indicates 507 up-regulated genes, and the red dot indicates 201 down-regulated genes. (B) The heat map of differentially expressed genes. The horizontal axis indicates sample, and the vertical axis indicates different genes; red color denotes high gene expression, and blue color indicates low gene expression. </caption>

<p id="Par15">Cerebral AVMs can develop de novo and could also be congenital in origin. The long-term notion is that AVMs are congenital in nature, and limited studies are available on the pathogenesis of this disease to genes involved in early vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Recent reports suggest an association of cerebral AVMs with various pathological stimuli such as trauma/brain injury, viral infections, neuronal abnormal development, and migration disorders in the brain, which may occur prior to clinical manifestation of AVM [

An investigation on the nature and functions of glial cells in the immediate vicinity of blood vessels is also possibly relevant to understand AVM pathogenesis. Any stimuli from pathological astrocytes may affect endothelial cells because of the strong anatomical and physiological interaction between astrocytes and endothelial cells. The VEGF protein is pivotal in promoting angiogenesis, and it is known that there is a high degree of VEGF expression in astrocytes in recurrent cases of AVM, when compared to non-recurrent cases of AVM [

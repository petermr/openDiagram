<p>The lack of cellular bioactivity prompted us to question the ecological role for these intensely fluorescent molecules, since the intensely fluorescent yellow color of the sponge can be attributed to the tedaniophorbasins. The fluorescence spectra for both 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-19-00095-f002">Figure 2</xref>) showed significant Stokes shifts of 14,000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (280 nm ex/490 nm em) and 3400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (420 nm ex/490 nm em), suggesting excited state reactions and a change in dipole moments, respectively. The cyan fluorescence of tedaniophorbasin A (
 <bold>1</bold>) and B (
 <bold>2</bold>) further suggests that the compounds might act as donor luminophores for bioluminescence, while their UV absorbance between 280 and 419 nm suggests a role as sunscreens, since both compounds absorb strongly in the UVA (315–400 nm) and UVB (280–315 nm) wavelength bands.

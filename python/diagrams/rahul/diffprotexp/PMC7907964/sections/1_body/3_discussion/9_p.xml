<p>In conclusion, the present study used a label-free MS-based proteomic approach to study differentially expressed proteins in fibroblasts of patients with PD and healthy controls. Several proteins were identified, and a few predominant proteins were validated to confirm their expression levels. It was demonstrated that the proteome profiles of skin fibroblasts from patients with PD carrying heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants and those from healthy controls are different and unique. Heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants reveal a signature of protein alterations related to the regulation of macromolecular processes. Among these proteins, the ANXA2 level is most highly upregulated, and this increase is considered to be involved in autophagy regulation and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Although heterozygous 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants are rare in patients with PD, this heterozygous form shows a signature of protein alterations related to the regulation of cytoskeleton organization and biological quality. Among them, the TUBB level is most highly upregulated, and this increase is likely to be involved in cytoskeleton organization. However, further studies are required to clarify the functional roles of these proteins in the cells of patients with PD carrying 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants. Taken together, this study demonstrated the value of the proteomic approach to identify proteome profiles and to compare their expression levels that may be associated with the physiological changes occurring in the cells. These alterations may be related to disease progression and development.

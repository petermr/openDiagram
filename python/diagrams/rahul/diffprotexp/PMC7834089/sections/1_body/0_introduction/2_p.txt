0: Recently, anti-inflammatory mechanisms mediated by the nervous system have generated considerable interest.
1: Autonomic nervous system dysfunction with sympathetic activation and vagus withdrawal contribute to the progression of VMC [ 12].
2: Our previous studies indicated that excessive sympathetic activation upregulates levels of inflammatory cytokines that aggravate inflammatory lesions, whereas carvedilol, the nonselective -blocker, alleviated the inflammatory response [ 1315].
3: The vagus nerve, involved in control of heart rate and in hormone secretion, is also an immunomodulator.
4: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) is mediated by the vagus nerve, which is the longest cranial nerve that dominates most of peripheral organs and relies on the 7-nicotinc acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) to alleviate the inflammatory response and to repair immune injury from VMC [ 16].
5: Signal transmission and activation of CAP is dependent upon the vagus nerve, and 7nAChR bond with ligands to regulate the signaling pathway and modify inflammation.
6: Activating the efferent fibers of the vagus nerve regulates systemic and local inflammatory responses via CAP [ 17].
7: Our previous studies demonstrated that activation of CAP with the 7nAChR agonist nicotine alleviates the inflammatory response [ 18, 19] and right cervical vagotomy aggravates VMC by inhibiting CAP [ 20].
8: However, the effect of the vagus nerve on differentiation of CD4 + T cells has not been studied in VMC mice.
9: Therefore, in this study, we examined the potential effects of the vagus nerve on differentiation of CD4 + T cell subsets.
10: Furthermore, we investigated the effects of cervical vagotomy in a murine model of myocarditis infected with CVB3.
11: Finally, we examined the underlying mechanism of Th cell differentiation after activation or inhibition of 7nAChR in CD4 + T cells.

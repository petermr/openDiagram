<p>To understand the patterns of AS in the antiviral response, the DIU transcripts for interferon regulatory factor (
 <italic>IRF</italic>)
 <italic>-1/7</italic> and the 65 kDa NFκB transcriptional subunit (
 <italic>RelA</italic>) were extracted and SMRT isoforms were compared to the exon abundances of each transcript determined by short-read RNA sequencing analysis. For each gene, the full splice match (FSM) transcripts were extracted and compared to exon abundance in the integrated genome viewer (IGV) in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Exon abundance quantified by short-read RNA sequencing analysis is represented in the pile-up graph in the top panel of each gene. 
 <italic>IRF7</italic> shows marked alternative TSS utilization, as well as intron inclusion in introns 9–10 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). Notably, a number of isoforms lack the NH2 terminal IRF DNA-binding domain. We identified 22 
 <italic>RelA</italic> isoforms by SMRT sequencing; these variants are encoded by alternative TSS utilization, intron inclusion, and exon skipping (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f007">Figure 7</xref>B).

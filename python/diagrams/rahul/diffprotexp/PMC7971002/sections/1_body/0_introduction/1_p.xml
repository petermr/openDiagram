 </sup>. One of the key goals of sheep breeding is high reproductive performance since it plays a major role in production efficiency. Conversely, low fertility is one of the major limiting factors for the growth of the sheep industry. Traditional selection has been used to increase litter size due to low reproductive heritability and sex-limiting nature of local breeds. Nevertheless, candidate genes linked to ovulation and multiplets can lead to genetic improvement through gene and marker-assisted selection (MAS) in sheep

 </sup>. Thus, improving sheep breeding capability and increasing output of mutton and wool products can successfully fill the ever-growing gap in supply and demand while guaranteeing quality of mutton. There are several sheep species globally but only a few of them have high fecundity, while the vast majority produce only single lamb with few multi-born occurrences

This will provide a basis for further ovarian research at the molecular level to uncover their regulatory mechanisms.

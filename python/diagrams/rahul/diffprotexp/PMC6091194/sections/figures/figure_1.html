 <caption> Schematic representation of the protocol used to do label-free quantitative proteomics of P3, P14, and P30 cochlear sensory epithelia of normal hearing CBA/J mice. Cochleae were isolated and the lysate collected and digested using multiple enzymes in the FASP procedure, followed by SCX separation and analysis using LC-MS/MS. Three biological replicates were processed and analyzed for each age group </caption>

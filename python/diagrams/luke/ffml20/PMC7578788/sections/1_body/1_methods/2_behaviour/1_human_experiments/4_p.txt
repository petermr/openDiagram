0: Measurements of behavioural error were calculated as the angular displacement relative to the target when reaches crossed the boundary of the task space (endpoint error) 28,  29.
1: Movement initiation was determined when the joystick cursor exceeded a Euclidian distance of 5 pixels from the starting position.
2: Reaction time was measured between the time of target presentation (joystick trigger press), and movement initiation.
3: Reach duration was measured between the time of movement initiation and crossing of the task boundary.

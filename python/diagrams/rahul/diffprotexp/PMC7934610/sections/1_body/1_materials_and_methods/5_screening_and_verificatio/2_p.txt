0: In addition, before transcriptome functional annotation, nine differentially expressed genes were randomly selected to conduct real-time PCR analysis to verify the expression of genes detected by RNA sequence.
1: The  GAPDH gene was used as an internal control (for PCR verifications only).
2: Primer sequences are listed in  Table 1.
3: The mRNA expression levels for all samples were normalized to the level for  GAPDH housekeeping genes.
4: The expression level in every sample group was expressed by the mean  standard deviation ( x  s).
5: The data were analyzed by  SPSS17.0 software.

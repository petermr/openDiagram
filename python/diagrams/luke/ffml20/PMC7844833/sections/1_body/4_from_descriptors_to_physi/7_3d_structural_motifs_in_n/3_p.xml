<p>Analysis of the XANES portion of the X-ray absorption spectra, in turn, seems to be more up to this task due its high sensitivity to the 3D-geometry and symmetry of the environment around the absorbing atoms. As discussed above, pre-edge features in XANES spectra can allow one to easily distinguish between tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated structural motifs from K-edge spectra of transition metals.

 </sup> For octahedrally coordinated cations (e.g., Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ti
 <sup>4+</sup>), the intensity of the observed pre-edge is a commonly used descriptor of the distortion of the metal-O
 <sub>6</sub> octahedron due to the Jahnâ€“Teller effect.

 </sup> Analysis of the pre-edge features is also helpful to determine the symmetry around the active metal species in single-site catalysts for ORR and CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR.

 </sup> Note that due to different selection rules, different and highly complementary information can be extracted from the analysis of XANES data of the K- and L-edges of transition metals. For example, tetrahedral and octahedral environments have a much stronger effect on the Fe L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge XANES than on the Fe K-edge XANES spectra, as demonstrated in studies of single-site Fe-based catalysts for ORR.

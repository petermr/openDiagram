<p>All in all, there has been significant research effort to find suitable air electrode for hybrid Naâ€“air cells. Despite clear improvements of the performance of the batteries, they still lack cyclic stability to become commercially viable. Moreover, the power density is limited, and this is mainly due to the poor OER electrocatalytic activity at the air electrode.</p>

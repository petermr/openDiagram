<p>As we know, reed widely grew near lakes and rivers, so that reed flowers can be collected easily, which provides abundant feedstock to prepare biomass carbons with unique morphologies for large-scale production. As the starting materials, reed flower possesses the following advantages compared with other biomass materials. Firstly, compared with other biomasses such as dandelion, loofah, and jute [

 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], reed flowers can be collected in a larger area. In special, higher harvesting quality can be obtained per unit time. In addition, compared with biomasses [

 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] such as banana peel, prunus persica, and coconut shell, the natural fluffy structure of reed flower is beneficial to the synthesis of porous carbon materials with high specific surface area. Moreover, compared with a large number of edible biomass carbon sources [

 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-10-00346" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], reed flowers can be utilized directly and do not need to wait after they finish the edible value. In this study, we fabricate hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) with high specific surface area from reed flowers by a multistep calcination method. When the HPC is applied to anode materials for LIBs, it exhibits good cycling capability and rate performance. The paper provides us an idea for developing low-cost porous carbon materials derived from biomass and may promote the development of porous biomass carbon-based materials in energy-storage applications.

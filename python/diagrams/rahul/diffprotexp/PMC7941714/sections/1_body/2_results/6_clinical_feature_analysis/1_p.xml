<p id="Par46">To further investigate the 11 prognosis-related lncRNAs in the ceRNA network, we analyzed the correlation between lncRNAs and clinical features, including age, sex, tumor stage, and TNM stage. Seven lncRNAs were associated with the clinical features of CRC patients (all 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Four lncRNAs—NKILA, AC005520.2, AC245884.8, and AL354836.1—were age-related, four lncRNAs—MIR4435-2HG, NKILA, AL591845.1, and AC005520.2—were associated with tumor stage, and six lncRNAs—MIR4435-2HG, ELFN1-AS1, NKILA, AL591845.1, AC005520.2, and AL354836.1—were associated with TNM stage (Fig.

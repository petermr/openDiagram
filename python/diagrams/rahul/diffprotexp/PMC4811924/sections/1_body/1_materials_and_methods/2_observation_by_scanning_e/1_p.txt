0: Mid-exponential growth phase cultures of  S. suis ATCC 700794 were adjusted to an optical density of 0.1 at 600 nm (OD600).
1: Then, 2 mL cultures were transferred to the wells of a 6-well microplate containing an 11  11 mm sterilized rough glass slide (Mosutech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) on the bottom.
2: After culturing for 72 h at 37C without shaking, the glass slide was removed with tweezers, and the biofilms on the rough glass slide were washed with sterile PBS.
3: The remaining biofilms were fixed with fixative solution [4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, 2 mM CaCl 2 in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2] for 6 h and washed three times with 0.1 M PBS 10 min each, then fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide containing 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide and 6% (w/v) sucrose in cacodylate buffer.
4: The samples were dried, gold sputtered with an ion sputtering instrument (current 15 mA, 2 min) and observed using SEM (FEI Quanta, Netherland).

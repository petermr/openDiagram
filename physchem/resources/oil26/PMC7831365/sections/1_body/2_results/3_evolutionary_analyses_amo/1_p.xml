<p>We carried out the PAML analysis to detect the selective pressure of toothless/enamel-less lineages, and found the selective pressure of these toothless/enamel-less lineages (including ancestral nodes, terminal branches and even the whole toothless/enamel-less group) was significantly higher than that of background branches. For example, the terminal branch of 
 <italic>B. physalus</italic>: ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 1.883; the terminal branch of 
 <italic>M. novaeangliae</italic>: ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.641; the terminal branch of 
 <italic>E. robustus</italic>: ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 2.688; the terminal branch of 
 <italic>E. glacialis</italic>: ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.503. A similar tendency was found in the terminal branches of other baleen whales, and further model comparison shows that the selective pressure of these branches had been completely relaxed. Whilst, much higher selective pressure was detected in the ancestral branch of stem mysticeti (ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.120, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.436), even the clade of crown mysticeti (ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.522). Meanwhile, higher selective pressure was detected among enamel-less lineages, such as the terminal branch of 
 <italic>D. novemcinctus</italic> (ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.206), the terminal branch of 
 <italic>O. afer</italic> (ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.414), and the terminal branch of 
 <italic>K. breviceps</italic> (ω
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.116, ω
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.581). And the selective pressure of these branches had been completely relaxed, except for the terminal branch of 
 <italic>K. breviceps</italic> (

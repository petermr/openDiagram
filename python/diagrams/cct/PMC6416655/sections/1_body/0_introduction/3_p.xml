<p id="p0015">The current cost pressure in mould steel market arises the alternative flow of continuous casting slab to forging process, especially the thick slab. The advantage of using thick continuous casting slab instead of steel ingot is remarkable in decreasing cost and increasing quality rate, realized by the quality check on the slab before the forging process. We could perform the quality control and sulfur print detect to the continuous casting slab, to ensure the quality before forging, which is different from using the ingot (quality check implemented only after forging results in high rejection rate). Moreover, instead of the traditional process, we innovated top and bottom combined blown converter (LD) followed with slab continuous casting (CC) process. However, the LD + CC process is widely used in producing the high-strength low alloy steel, but not the high-alloy steel. Meanwhile, due to the high carbon and alloy content, the segregation and crack control of continuous casting slab is the most significant difficulties [

However, the segregation in the continuous casting slab is center type, which is more serious than ingot. It has a great influence on the quality of product especially after the forging process. People studied the cracking mechanism of the thin continuous casting slab.

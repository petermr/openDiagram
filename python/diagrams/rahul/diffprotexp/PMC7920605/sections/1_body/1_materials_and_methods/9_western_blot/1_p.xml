<p>Total protein of MH7A cells and synovial tissues of AA rats were extracted. SDS loading buffer was added to the extracted protein and the mixture was heated in boiling water for 10 min to denature the protein. A 10% polyacrylamide gel was prepared by an SDS-PAGE gel preparation kit (cat P0012A, Beyotime), and then, the protein samples were added to each well for electrophoretic separation. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and placed in 5% skim milk to seal at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody against WTAP (cat ab195380, Abcam, 1:2000), RIPK2 (cat bs-3546R, Bioss, 1:1000), JAK3 (cat ab45141, Abcam, 1:1000) and TNFRSF10A (cat bs-0591R, Bioss, 1:1000) overnight at 4Â°C with slow shaking. Then, the membranes were transferred to horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:20000) and incubated continuously at room temperature for 1 h. The protein was developed by a multifunction chemiluminescence imaging system and quantitatively analyzed by ImageJ software.</p>

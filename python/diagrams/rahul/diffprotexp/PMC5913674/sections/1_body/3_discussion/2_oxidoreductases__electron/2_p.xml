<p>Thioredoxin reductase was also inconsistent as a passive resistance mechanism, up- and downregulated in 106-MtzR and WB-MtzR, respectively, but unchanged in 713-MtzR. This may be due to expression-independent changes to enzyme activity [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or, alternatively, that downregulation of thioredoxin reductase negatively impacts downstream thiol antioxidant systems, outweighing benefits of decreased Mtz activation. While downregulation of thioredoxin reductase in WB-MtzR was accompanied by decreases in thioredoxin, in 106-MtzR, the enzyme substrate of the increased reducing power postulated to result from upregulated thioredoxin reductase is unclear. The wider profile of the oxidoreductase network also indicates a multiplicity of isolate-dependent expression patterns (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). For example, changes in the expression of oxidoreductases contributing to cofactor abundance and electron transport (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), including upregulation of multiple enzymes involved in NAD(P)H consumption and production, were observed in 106-MtzR. Despite the absence of shared differentially expressed oxidoreductases, all MtzR lines exhibited functional enrichment of electron carrier activity (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, panel B), indicating that Mtz variably affects the reducing power in the antioxidant network, the electron acceptors within glycolysis, as well as the critical relationship between them.

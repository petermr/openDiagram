  <title>Visualization of chemical reaction spaces as graphs with molecules as nodes and reactions as edges.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Full network of bond dissociation reactions for carbon-, oxygen-, hydrogen-containing molecules with up to four heavy atoms. 
   <bold>b</bold> Reduced reaction network of the initial steps of natural gas combustion. Nodes are colored according to the number of incident edges/reactions (their degree) from low (white) to high (dark green).

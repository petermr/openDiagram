<p>Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a zoonotic disease caused by 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic>, poses a great threat to the health of humans and domestic animals [
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The life cycle of 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> is complex and involves two hosts: definitive and intermediate. Infection with 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> occurs after oral ingestion of infective eggs (an oncosphere containing the invasive hexacanth [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). The hexacanth then hatches in the small intestine of the intermediate host, penetrates the mucosal tissue, enters the blood circulation system, and migrates to various organs (e.g. the liver and lungs), where it develop cysts filled with fluid and protoscoleces [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in definitive hosts like dogs, adult parasites develop from the protoscolex in the intestine. In domestic animals, especially in sheep, which appear to be highly susceptible to infection [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], CE causes considerable health problems and thereby significantly affects the income of herders [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

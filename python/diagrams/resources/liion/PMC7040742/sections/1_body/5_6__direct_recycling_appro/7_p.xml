<p>The process patented by Retriev [
 <xref rid="B214-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>] included crushing and screening steps followed by thermal treatment at 500 °C to modify the carbon surface and destroy PVDF. Then, selective flotation was applied to remove carbon. The sink fraction was mixed with appropriate amounts of lithium hydroxide solution before calcination at 500–800 °C. The capacity recovery was around 95%. This process is essentially similar to the one developed by Poe et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], except that PVDF was removed through NMP washing instead of being thermally calcined. The final calcination-relithiation step was also performed at higher temperatures (850 °C) with Li

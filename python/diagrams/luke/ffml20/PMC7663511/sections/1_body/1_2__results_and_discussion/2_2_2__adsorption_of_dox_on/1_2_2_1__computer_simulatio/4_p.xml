 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-08230-f008">Figure 8</xref>a presents the results for MWCNTs with DOX as a function of time. Gray squares represent the number of aggregates and red squares the average aggregate size. We can see that the aggregation process is similar to that observed for SWCNTs. The number of aggregates decreases fast reaching the value of (=4) after about 3 ns, while the average cluster size increases rapidly. This process is about twice as fast as in the case of SWCNTs and we also notice two parallel processes of aggregation. One of them is the aggregation of DOX molecules into free clusters that merge with time increasing their size, while the second one is the aggregation of DOX onto and into the MWCNTs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-08230-f008">Figure 8</xref>b displays the time evolution of the percentage fraction of DOX molecules that form aggregates with MWCNTs (gray squares), and the part of them that aggregated inside MWCNTs (red squares). We see that after 3 ns aggregation is saturated with about 75% of the DOX molecules bound to the MWCNTs, of which about 5% are aggregated inside the nanotube. This value is more than twice as high as in the case of SWCNTs.

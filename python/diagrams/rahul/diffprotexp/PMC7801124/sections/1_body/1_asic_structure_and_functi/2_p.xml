<p>Following initial work demonstrating that ASICs are activated by extracellular protons, much research has been dedicated to identifying the region and amino acids that detect protons [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the very first crystal structure of cASIC1a, an acidic pocket situated between the finger-thumb-ball region, was proposed to be critical for proton sensing [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, mutagenesis of residues within this acidic pocket did not fully abolish proton sensitivity for ASIC1a [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, rASIC2a is proton-sensitive, whereas its splice variant rASIC2b is not, yet both subunits contain the same 5/6 carboxylate residues of the acidic pocket; site-directed mutagenesis and chimera construction of rASIC2a/2b have identified that the first 87 amino acids after transmembrane domain 1 are of particular importance [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, mutational analysis of the rASIC1a palm domain has identified it to also be an influential component to proton activation, but of less importance than the finger-thumb-ball acidic pocket region [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

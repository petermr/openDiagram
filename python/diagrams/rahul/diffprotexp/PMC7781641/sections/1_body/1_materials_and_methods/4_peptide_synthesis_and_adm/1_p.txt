0: TAT-based cell-penetrating peptides used in this study were previously described (Cmarko and Weiss, Mol Brain 2020) and were synthesized by GenScript.
1: A Ca v3.3-blocking peptide called TAT-C3P (amino acid sequence GRKKRRQRRRPQEESNKEAREDAELDAEIELEMAQG, molecular weight 4311 g/mol) was administered to male and female mice via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg and monitored every hour for up to 5 h post-injection.
2: For control experiments, a peptide called TAT-C3D (amino acid sequence GRKKRRQRRRPQAVSSPARSGEPLHALSPRGTARSP, molecular weight 4006 g/mol) was used which does not block Ca v3.3 channels.
3: For all experiments, the peptides were dissolved in distilled water.

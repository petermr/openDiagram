<p id="p0090">We then applied the same comparison parameters for individual DNA repair pathway member genes to identify genes which contribute to differential regulation of the pathways (Supplementary file 5). For example, Biocarta cell cycle G2M checkpoint pathway had seven differentially expressed genes for PC vs FA comparison (
 <italic>ATR, CCNB1, CDKN2D, MDM2, PI4KA, RASGRF1, SFN</italic>), Supplementary file 5. Most of differential genes were up-regulated in PC (Supplementary file 5) which resulted in up-regulation of most of the pathways. However, 
 <italic>Biocarta cell cycle G2M checkpoint pathway</italic> was down-regulated in PC because most of the differential genes have negative activator/repressor role coefficients (ARR) for this pathway [

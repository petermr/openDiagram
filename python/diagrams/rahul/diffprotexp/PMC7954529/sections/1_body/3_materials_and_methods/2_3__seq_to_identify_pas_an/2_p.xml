<p>We mapped human 3' Seq libraries to GRCh38 (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005</xref>) using the STAR RNA-seq aligner with default settings (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to our previous work, we removed reads with evidence of internal priming resulting from the poly(dT) primer. We filtered reads proceeded by 6 As or 7 of 10 As in the base pairs directly upstream of the mapped location (

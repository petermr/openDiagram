0: The research was conducted in a greenhouse with a sand culture and parameters (light intensity of 600800 mol m 2s 1, relative humidity of 55%, photoperiod of 16 h, 25 C, and 18 C in the dark) were kept constant during the growth period.
1: For sand culture, quartz-sand purchased from Kasper Building Materials Company (Potter, WI, USA) was used.
2: Thoroughly rinsed quartz-sand was sterilized and then filled into nutrition bowls.

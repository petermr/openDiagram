<p id="Par7">Egg-laying hens with normal follicular hierarchies (Lohmann Layer strain) were kindly provided by MUXING company in Sichuan, China. In this study, a total of 15 hens in the same peak laying period were subjected for sample collection. Five were sampled for the transcriptome analyses, the remaining 10 birds were sampled for real-time PCR. The F5 follicle and F1 follicle were collected from each bird. In general, a chicken ovary in peak laying period contains 30–100 small yolky follicles and 4–7 follicles recruited in the hierarchy. F5 and F1 follicles selected in this study belonged to the third growth phase with fast growth in size and rapid yellow yolk incorporation

 </sup>. The F5 follicle and F1 follicle were collected from each bird. Granulosa cells were then separated from neighboring cells. Following our previously established method

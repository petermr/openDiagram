  <p>(a, b) Particle shape effect for ∼1 nm micellar Pt NPs supported on γ-Al
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub>. Fourier-transformed Pt L
   <sub>3</sub>-edge EXAFS data are shown in panel a, while panel b shows the CNs extracted for NPs with two different shapes (shown in the inset in panel a) for the first four coordination shells (filled squares) together with the corresponding CNs from NP shape models (open squares).

   <sub>22</sub> cluster.

   <sub>2</sub>(110) supports, and fitting of the corresponding EXAFS data with the RMC method. The results from measurements acquired with three different X-ray polarizations (2 parallel (∥) and one perpendicular (⊥) to the substrate) are shown for the Pt/TiO

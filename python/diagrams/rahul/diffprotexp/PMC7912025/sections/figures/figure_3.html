 <caption> Alternative polyadenylation analysis. ( A) Scatter plot of differentially polyadenylated transcripts in response to RSV infection. X axis: differential polyadenylation utilization (DPAU). DPAU refers to the fraction of transcripts utilizing the distal polyadenylation site. A positive-valued DPAU indicates enhanced distal site polyadenylation in RSV-infected cells, while a negative value indicates distal site utilization in uninfected cells. Y axis: âˆ’log10 ( Q-value) of significance of change. ( B) Pathway enrichment of genes undergoing DPAU. Shown are the top 10 gene pathways ( Reactome.org) for a fraction of the pathway represented (boxes) in the query data and the false discovery rate (FDR, circles) of each pathway. </caption>

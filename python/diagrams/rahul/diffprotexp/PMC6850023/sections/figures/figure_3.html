 <caption> Normalized spectral counts (means ±; n = 3) of differentially expressed branched alkane oxidation proteins during growth on a linear alkane ( n‐C 14/C14) a non‐hydrocarbon control (Pyruvate/PYR) and a branched alkane (Pristane/PRI) in A. borkumensis SK2 T; treatments not sharing a letter ( a or b) differ at P &lt; 0.05 (Tukey's HSD). The alkane monooxygenase (AM) introduces oxygen into the alkane at the terminal carbon converting it into a primary alcohol. This alcohol is further oxidized to an aldehyde by an alcohol oxidase (AO) or alcohol dehydrogenase (AD). An aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD) converts the aldehyde into a fatty acid, which enters β‐oxidation. Alternatively, a cytochrome P450 (P450) can oxidize the alkane up to it corresponding fatty acid, which enters β‐oxidation. </caption>

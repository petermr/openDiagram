0: P3 membranes co-expressing PcATP2/PcCdc50A, PcATP2/PcCdc50B or Drs2p/Cdc50p were diluted to 4 mg/mL in HEPES-sucrose buffer.
1: 20 g of total protein were added to a glycoprotein denaturing buffer (0.5% (w/v) SDS, 40 mM DTT) and protein denaturation was performed at 100C for 10 min in a dry bath.
2: Samples were cooled down on ice for 5 min and spun down at 15,000   g for 10 sec.
3: 10 L of denatured samples were enzymatically digested with either, PGNase F or EndoH (New England Biolabs) using the buffers and protocols provided by the supplier.
4: The reaction was carried out for 1 h at 37C and results were analyzed by western blot.

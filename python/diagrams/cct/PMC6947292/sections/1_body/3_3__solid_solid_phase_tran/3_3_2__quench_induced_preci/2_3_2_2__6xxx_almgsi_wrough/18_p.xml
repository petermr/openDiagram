<p>Furthermore, the alloying elements Fe and Mn are of primary importance for the nucleation of quench-induced precipitation, as these elements are typically found in either coarse primary particles, which act as nucleation sites for HT-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si particles, or in dispersoids, which are the preferred nucleation sites of the rod-shaped LT particles [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f042">Figure 42</xref>, which shows a comparison of the commercially produced 6082
 <sub>I</sub> and a pure ternary Al0.6Mg0.8Si alloy. Both alloys have a highly similar content of the main alloying elements, Mg and Si. The major difference between them is the additional mass fraction of 0.2% Fe and 0.5% Mn in 6082
 <sub>I</sub> (atomic fractions: 0.11% Fe; 0.24% Mn).

 <caption> PRKAA2 expression increased with miR-124-3p knockdown in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M. (A) The expression level of miR-124-3p in endothelial cells under fluorescence microscope by green fluorescence protein. BF, bright field; GFP, green-fluorescent protein; NC-miR-124-3p: negative control of lentiviral vector; miR-124-3p-down: miR-124-3p knockdown with lentiviral vector. (B) qPCR analysis of relative expression levels of PRKAA2 in HUVECs transfected with LV-miR-124-3p-down. The results show that the expression level of PRKAA2 mRNA in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M increased greatly with the knockdown of miR-124-3p. </caption>

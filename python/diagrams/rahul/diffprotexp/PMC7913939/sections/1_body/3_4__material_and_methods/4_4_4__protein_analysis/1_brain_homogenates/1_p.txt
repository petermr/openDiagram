0: After euthanization by cervical dislocation, mouse brains were dissected on ice into three different brain regions: hippocampus (H), cortex (C), cerebellum (CB).
1: Samples were homogenized in homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors), sonicated for 5 min in a water bath and incubated with rotation for 15 min.
2: Insoluble debris was removed by a centrifugation step for 20 min at 13,000  g at 4 C. The supernatant was transferred to a separate tube and stored at 80 C.

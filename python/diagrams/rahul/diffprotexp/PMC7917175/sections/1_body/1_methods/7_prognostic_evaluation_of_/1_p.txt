0: The prognostic values of the immune subtypes were evaluated using log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate cox regression, with stage and grade as covariates, and OS and RPS as the endpoints.
1: ANOVA was used to determine the association of immune subtypes with different immune-related molecular and cellular characteristics.
2: The most frequently mutated genes were screened using the chi-square test.
3: DAVID program was used to functionally annotate each gene module through gene ontology analysis.
4: Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) was used to calculate immune enrichment scores for each sample, which is the measure of genes that are coordinately up- or down-regulated within a sample.

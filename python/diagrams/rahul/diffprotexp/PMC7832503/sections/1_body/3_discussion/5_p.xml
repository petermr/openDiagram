<p>GO gene sets analysis results suggested the impact of positive regulation of response to IFN-γ on severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease. There is a study supported the statement that IFN-γ have a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of influenza A through a restriction in lymphoid cell group II activity [

Therefore, the differential levels of IFN-γ expression derived from its correlative genomic variants may influence specific immune cells viability and eventually dictate the disease outcome. In consistent with our findings, one recent study has suggested that IFN-γ played an important role in acute lung injury induced by severe influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection, and monoclonal antibodies against IFN-γ could be useful as a potential therapeutic remedy for future influenza pandemics [

Samojlik <italic>et al</italic>. showed the major constituents of anise essential oil were trans-anethole (87.96%) followed by &#947;-himachalene (3.17%), cis-isoeugenol (2.21%), and linalool (1.78%).[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In another study on chemical composition of essential oil, anethole accounted for 88.1% of identified constituents, followed by pseudo-iso-eugenyl-2-methyl butyrate (4.15%), and &#947;-himachalene (4.15%).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Trans-anethole showed hepatoprotective activities in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice with reduction of serum ALT, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, and interleukin 6 levels. Increased in nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), release of high-mobility group box-1 into the extracellular milieu, and the interactions between IRF-1 and histone acetyltransferase p300 after ischemia/reperfusion were attenuated by trans-anethole. Moreover, trans-anethole suppressed increases in toll-like receptor-4.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p>

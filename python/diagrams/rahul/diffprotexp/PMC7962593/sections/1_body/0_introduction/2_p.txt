0: The World Health Organization states that the annual number of deaths due to sepsis worldwide is approximately 6 million, most of which are preventable.
1: 5 The identification of altered molecular signatures and biochemical pathways in sepsis patients has driven interest in the discovery of novel biomarkers.
2: 6 Early recognition of sepsis is essential for timely treatment and can improve sepsis outcomes.
3: 7, 8 Mortality risk is higher when sepsis treatment is delayed.
4: 9 Analyzing the molecular characteristics of patients is an effective method to screen for potential diagnostic and prognostic targets.

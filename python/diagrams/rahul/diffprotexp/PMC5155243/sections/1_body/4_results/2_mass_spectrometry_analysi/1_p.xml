<p>In-gel enzyme digestion was performed on 17 differentially expressed protein spots visible to the naked eye on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels. PMF analysis was performed using MALDI-TOF-MS. The results identified using PMF were subjected to database searches. The search results with a Mascot search score higher than 64 were selected, and a total of 13 differentially expressed proteins were identified.</p>

<p id="Par10">Our results highlight what was found by comparing the mesentery at three different stages of regeneration. The normal, uninjured mesentery is mainly composed of mesothelium (peritoneocytes, muscles and neurons) and connective tissue. The regenerating mesentery at 1 and 3Â days after evisceration is made of the same tissues, but have undergone some changes in the differentiated state of its cells, and, as regeneration advances more undifferentiated cells are found in the area where the new intestine will form.</p>

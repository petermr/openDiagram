<p>The 2032-coin battery is assembled in a glove box filled with inert atmosphere for electrochemical performance test. The fabricated electrode consisted of active materials, acetylene black, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 7:2:1. Each component was well mixed to form a paste, which was coated on copper foil current collector. The loading on the electrode is approximately 1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The electrolyte used was 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in a 50:50 (w/w) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). The specific capacity of the battery was tested by cyclic charge and discharge between 0–3 V (Land CT2001A, Hubei, China). The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance test were obtained by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, CH Instrument Ins., Shanghai, China).

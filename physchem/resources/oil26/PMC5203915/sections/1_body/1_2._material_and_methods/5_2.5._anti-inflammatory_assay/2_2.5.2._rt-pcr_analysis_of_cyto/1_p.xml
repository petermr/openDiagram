The human astrocytes (4 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>) were seeded in 6-well multidishes and were treated with 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils and LPS (1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL), only LPS (1&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL), or only 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils for 24&#8201;h, at 37&#176;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The control cells were incubated in the culture medium for 24&#8201;h. RNA was isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Blirt, Poland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Reverse Transcription System (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland) was used for cDNA synthesis according to the instruction of the manufacturer. PCR was carried out using the gene-specific primers for human (<italic>&#946;</italic>-actin, IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic>). The products lengths were 509&#8201;bp, 93&#8201;bp, 296&#8201;bp, 425&#8201;bp, 476&#8201;bp, 292&#8201;bp, and 406&#8201;bp for <italic>&#946;</italic>-actin, IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic>, respectively. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95&#176;C for 3&#8201;min, denaturation at 94&#176;C for 1&#8201;min, annealing at 55&#8211;65&#176;C for 1&#8201;min, and extension at 72&#176;C for 2&#8201;min. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Further procedures are described in a previous study by Sitarek et al. [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The experiments were repeated three times.</p>

<p id="Par2">Motor adaptation, the ability to modify movements in response to changes in the environment to maintain accuracy, is a fundamental feature of most types of goal-directed behaviour. Motor adaptation is supported by a supraspinal neural network that includes (but is not limited to) the cerebellum and motor cortex. These brain regions are thought to serve different, but complementary roles during motor adaptation. For example, a large body of work indicates the cerebellum is critically involved in the generation of sensory prediction errors that drive the adaptation process, as well as online control of complex movements

 </sup>. In contrast, the motor cortex appears to support memory of different environment dynamics: Transcranial magnetic disruption of the motor cortex in humans does not influence learning of a new perturbing force, but leads to a deficit in behavioural performance compared with controls in a delayed re-test of the same force

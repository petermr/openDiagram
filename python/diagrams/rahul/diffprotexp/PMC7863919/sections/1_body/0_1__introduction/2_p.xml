<p>Recently, notable progress in the understanding of pathogenesis of CD has been made [
 <xref rid="B3-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], including the discovery of recurrent 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations [
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These mutations are observed in approximately 30–40% of patients suffering from Cushing’s disease as well as in silent tumors [
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Patients with Cushing’s disease with and without 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutations have a slightly different clinical profile according to previously published data [
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The studies showed that 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutation is related to lower tumor size [
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and clinical remission after surgery [
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] [
 <xref rid="B12-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, differences in expression of possible molecular predictive markers as 
 <italic>MGMT</italic> or somatostatin receptor were also observed in this group of patients [
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Perhaps testing the 
 <italic>USP8</italic> mutation status in patients could provide some kind of clinically useful information; however, the clinical results published up to today are insufficient, and molecular consequences of this mutation are only partially recognized.

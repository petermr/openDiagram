<p>Because the ERAD system and proteinâ€“protein interaction may be cell-dependent, we sought to corroborate our findings by conducting the experiments in a second renal cell line, OKP cells. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, immunoprecipitation of STCH followed by immunoblotting for NKCC2 revealed again that the two proteins interact and that their association involves mainly the immature form of the co-transporter (

 <italic>lane 3</italic>). Accordingly, STCH strongly colocalized with NKCC2 in OKP cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02207-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Moreover, similar to HEK cells, the main site of the interaction appears to be the ER as judged by the intensive colocalization of NKCC2 and STCH with the ER marker calnexin (

 <bold>upper panel</bold>). Again, although NKCC2 and STCH co-localized mainly at the ER, some of the interaction between the two proteins seems to take place also at the cis-Golgi apparatus as judged by partial co-localization of NKCC2 and STCH with GM130 (

 <bold>lower panel</bold>).

  <p>Prediction of poor OS of pRCC and bladder cancer using the LE multigene panel. Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves of pRCC (
   <bold>A</bold>) and bladder cancer (
   <bold>B</bold>). The TCGA pRCC (
   <italic>n</italic> = 278) and bladder cancer (
   <italic>n</italic> = 390) datasets were organized by SurvExpress. Risk scores of LE panel were calculated using multivariate Cox fitting; cutoff points were optimized to stratify low-risk and high-risk populations.

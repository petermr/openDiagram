 </sup> were utilized to further explore stress-induced depression and anxiety disorders. The proteomes of the prefrontal cortex from the depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, insusceptible, and control groups were comparatively profiled, providing the molecular basis correlated to adaptive and maladaptive phenotypes of depression or anxiety. Our present results can provide a window to understand the specific and common molecular mechanisms that underlie stress-induced depression or anxiety and stress resiliency.

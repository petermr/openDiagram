<p id="Par55">Western blots were used to validate the expression of selected proteins detected by MS. Candidate proteins were selected based on their exclusive expression between age groups (e.g., P3 relative to P14 and/or P30) as well as by their different functions and newly identified expression in the cochlea. Four potential protein markers identified by MS analysis as exclusively expressed on P3, Parvin, Dbn1, Tmed10, and SPARC, were chosen for verification by comparing expression at P3 to P30. Equal amounts of protein lysate were used from P3 and P30. The results verify the MS findings, since the panels show exclusive expression of Dbn1 (100 &amp; 120 kDa), Parvin (42 kDa), Tmed (21 kDa), and SPARC (43 kDa) on P3 but not on P30 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), except for Parvin. A lowly expressed peptide species of ~ 50 kDa was found, suggesting a modified form of Parvin.

<p>Graph complexity analysis in low-grade glioma has shown Etv5 and its network expression to be critical features of the neoplastic state [
 <xref rid="B27-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Unfortunately, ETV5 of the PEA3 subfamily does not appear to be significantly altered in tumor vs. non-tumor samples in the microarray datasets used in this study (data not shown). However, we have identified another PEA3 subfamily member, ETV1, to be expressed at high levels in low-grade glioma and decrease in expression in higher grades (

ELK-1 protein is known to be a critical partner for the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer, and its expression was found to be associated with a higher clinical stage and prognostic marker of disease recurrence in prostate cancer [

It should be noted, however, that the ETS expression profile is also different in epilepsy; ELF1, ELK1, ELK4, ETS1, ETS2, and ETV1 are expressed at higher levels than ELF4, ELK3, and ETV4, and there is also variability in expression among different types of epilepsy (

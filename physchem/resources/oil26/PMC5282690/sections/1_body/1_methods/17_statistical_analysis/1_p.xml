The results were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni&#8217;s as a post-test. A value of <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 was considered significant. The linear and nonlinear regression tests have been used as well. The chemical structures have been drawn by using the freeware version of the software ACD/ChemSketch (Freeware) 14.01.</p>

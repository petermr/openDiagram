<p>The electrochemical reduction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> (CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR) is an important reaction in alternative energy schemes due to its promise to convert CO
 <sub>2</sub> into valuable chemicals and fuels under ambient conditions (ambient temperature, pressure and neutral pH).

 </sup> However, it requires breaking the very stable C=O bond and is a complex multielectron process that results in multitude of different reaction products: C
 <sub>1</sub> products such as CO, CH
 <sub>4</sub>, formic acid, and formaldehyde, and C
 <sub>2+</sub> products such as ethane, ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol, etc. Used as fuels, C
 <sub>2+</sub> products seem to be more attractive due to their higher value and higher energy densities.

 </sup> The adsorption strength of H and CO, the protonation of CO, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction are limiting steps for this reaction.

 </sup> Control over catalyst selectivity and stability, together with the need to reduce the high overpotential required (typically âˆ’1.0 V vs RHE), is the main challenge to address to make CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR industrially viable. This stimulates the further development and research of suitable catalysts.

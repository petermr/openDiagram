<p>Taken together, these findings suggest that ORF6 deletion variants could play a major role in the inflammatory host-response, without impacting virus replication. Our study underlines the need to investigate how ORF6 deletions can impact host-response and clinical outcome, particularly since whole genome sequence analysis on the CoV-GLUE database has revealed converging clusters of similar ORF6 deletions mainly in Utah, USA and England, UK. Additional genomic and structural investigations are needed to explore the impact of ORF6 deletions, in terms of ribosomal frameshift stimulators, RNA translation production ratios, innate host immunity modulation, and clinical outcomes. The integration of more fundamental research dedicated to elucidating the factors that impact SARS-CoV-2 replication, transmission, and disease progression will ultimately help translational projects to advance the fight against the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

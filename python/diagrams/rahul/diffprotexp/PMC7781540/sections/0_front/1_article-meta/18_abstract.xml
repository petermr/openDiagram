 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>In the last 5 years inhibitors of the potassium channel K
  <sub>V</sub>1.3 have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation in rodent models of ischemic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and traumatic brain injury. At the systemic level these beneficial actions are mediated by a reduction in microglia activation and a suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide production. However, the molecular mechanisms for the suppressive action of K
  <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers on pro-inflammatory microglia functions was not known until our group recently demonstrated that K
  <sub>V</sub>1.3 channels not only regulate membrane potential, as would be expected of a voltage-gated potassium channel, but also play a crucial role in enabling microglia to resist depolarizations produced by the danger signal ATP thus regulating calcium influx through P2X4 receptors. We here review the role of K
  <sub>V</sub>1.3 in microglial signaling and show that, similarly to their role in T cells, K
  <sub>V</sub>1.3 channels also regulated store-operated calcium influx in microglia.

<p>The SOD may change slightly after the OCV test. Thus, if the cell is discharged to the next specific capacity point directly, the actual SOD may be different with the targeted point. In addition, the SOD cannot be adjusted by potential because of the very flat plateau before 80% SOD, which leads to a big capacity change with a small potential change, and an unacceptable SOD error. To obtain accurate SODs, the cell is fully charged and discharged to target SOD after every OCV tests.

The curve basically coincides with each other, indicating that the battery and the electrode material structure are both stable in the whole test process. This suggests that the above test procedure is meaningful. The open-circuit voltage and temperature curves measured at steady state reflect the intrinsic thermodynamic characteristics of LiNi

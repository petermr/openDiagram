 <caption> Main signaling pathways affected by m 5C. (A) Volcano plot showing the proteins significantly affected by m 5C regulators mutation in GI cancer. -log 10 ( P value) &gt;1.30 was considered a significant change. (B) Bubble plots showing the downstream pathways of m 5C based on gene count and P value. Prediction of the downstream pathways related to m 5C gene alterations was analyzed by KEGG pathway analysis via DAVID. (C) Heat map showing the important downstream pathways of m 5C in GI cancers based on P value. </caption>

<italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> has been studied in only the Republic of Congo, where this plant grows spontaneously on the &#8220;Plateau des Cataractes&#8221;. It is usually used by local people as a th&#233;iforme drink to relieve pain, which justifies its vernacular name &#8220;tikoni&#8221; (pain).

 <caption> The transcriptional dynamics of DEHP decaying primordial follicle formation. The middle line marks the time window of primordial follicle formation, which represents germ cell fate transition from germline cysts to follicles (right annotation text), however, it consists of three main biological events, granulosa cell invasion, cyst breakdown, and follicle assembly (left annotation text). The left panel indicates normal follicle formation without DEHP, consisting of normal expression levels of Figla, Lhx8, and Zp3, and TGF-beta members ( Gdf9, Bmpr1a, and Smad4) in germ cells, as well as TGF-beta receptors ( Bmpr1a) and effectors ( Smad3 and Smad4) in pre-granulosa cells. The right panel displays follicle assembly impaired by DEHP, which shows the decreasing transcripts of key genes for follicle formation ( Figla, Lhx8, and Zp3) and of TGF-beta components in germ cells ( Gdf9) and pre-granulosa cells ( Bmpr1a and Smad3), but the increasing levels of Smad4 in both cell types and Bmpr1a only in germ cells. </caption>

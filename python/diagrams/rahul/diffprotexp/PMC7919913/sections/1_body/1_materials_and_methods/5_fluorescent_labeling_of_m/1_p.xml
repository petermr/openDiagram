<p>NRK-52E cells were labeled with Dil-C18 (a lipid dye used to label cell membranes) for 1â€‰h and washed with PBS for 3 times. The medium was collected and the MVs was obtained by centrifugation. MVs were resuspended in DMEM/F12 and incubated with cultured recipient cardiomyocytes. After different incubation times, five non-overlapping fields were observed under a digital camera-equipped Nikon Eclipse 80i Epi-fluorescence microscope. The immunofluorescence images were captured under the same exposure Settings.</p>

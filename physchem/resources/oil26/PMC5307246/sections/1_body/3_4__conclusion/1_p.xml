<p>The present study on the chemical composition, physicochemical properties, and nutritional value of
 <italic> Lannea kerstingii</italic> seeds suggests that these seeds could be considered as an alternative source of oil, protein, and micronutrients. The seed flour contains all essential amino acids in higher values than those listed in the FAO/WHO/UNU standard, except for lysine. The seed oil of
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> is stable and similar to the palm oil and has good contents of tocopherol, sterol, and carotenoid. It can be a sustainable alternative to palm oil in food industries.

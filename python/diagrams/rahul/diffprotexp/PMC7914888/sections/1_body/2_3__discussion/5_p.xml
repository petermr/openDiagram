<p>We confirm that exposure to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU induces an arrest at different points in the cell cycle control for B16F1 cells and differential pigmentation phenotype associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in melanin synthesis [

L-Tyrosine and the thymidine analog, 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine induced a decrease in proliferation and pigmentation changes in melanoma B16F1 cells. These phenotypic changes remember terminal differentiation and replicative senescence induced by L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU, respectively.

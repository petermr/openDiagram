<p id="Par34">The cochlear sensory epithelium contains specialized receptors known as hair cells, which are responsible for transducing incoming mechanical signals for processing by the brain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Damage to hair cells can lead to hearing loss or impairment in both humans and mouse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The perception and processing of sound are dependent on the expression of many proteins of which many are regulated during the onset of hearing. As structural and functional development continues, hearing sensitivity increases on postnatal days 12–14 (P12-P14) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A number of studies have investigated gene expression in the inner ear and its age-related changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There have been far fewer studies of the inner ear performed at the proteome level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and even fewer that have explored protein pathways [

0: MD simulation results were analyzed for  d001 along the UC  c axis, hydrogen bonding, K +O coordination, and K + and water diffusion coefficients.
1: The energetics of stable hydration states were analyzed with 54,  557Q( N) is the hydration immersion energy (J/g) relative to a reference hydration state  No,  N is the number of water molecules per birnessite unit cell (H 2O/UC),  U is the time-averaged potential energy, and  Ubulk (46.8 kJ/mol) is the mean interaction energy of a bulk SPC/E water molecule.
2: In a second set of simulations, we replaced K + by Na + to compare with the MD results of Newton and Kwon 51 ( Figure S8).

0: In vitro techniques are often applied in the banana industry for producing large-scale disease-free plantlets with higher yield potential.
1: However, as a result of such processing, somaclonal variations often appear, which are considered as one of the major disadvantages for such techniques [ 4].
2: Dwarfism and giant variants are often observed in banana tissue culture plantlets [ 1,  5,  6].
3: On the other hand, the variants derived from tissue culture processing, however, are a good source of research materials suitable for a comparative transcriptome and metabolome analysis.
4: Pisang Awak ( Musa spp.)
5: is a cultivated banana sub-group with high yield and superior taste quality, which is widely grown in Asian countries as a desert fruit but for juice/brewing in African countries [ 7].
6: Normally, the plants of Pisang Awak varieties are vigorous with a height around 4.55.5 m. In our  Musa collections, there is a dwarf Pisang Awak variety Aifen No.
7: 1 (wild type, WT), of which the height is around 2.02.5 m. Recently, a semi-dwarf mutant (MT) with the height 2.83.5 m, was identified by screening the somaclonal variations from Aifen No.
8: 1 tissue cultured plants.
9: Previous studies showed that hormone biosynthesis pathways are responsible for such variations [ 1].

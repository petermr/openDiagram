<p id="Par23">The GO enrichment analysis revealed several significantly enriched biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components which are closely associated with ovarian tissue development and hormone production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Viral carcinogenesis biosynthetic pathway was the common enriched pathway in H1 vs H3; while Rap1, Ras, PI3k-Akt, oxytocin, neurotrophin, MAPK signalling, endocytosis and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) signalling pathways were among the preponderantly enriched pathways in H3 vs H8 group (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>b). The Rap1 signalling pathway regulates cell adhesion, cell–cell junction formation and cell polarity, cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound conformations

 </sup>. Rap1 acts as a switch during cellular signalling transduction regulated by binding to either guanosine triphosphate (GTP) or guanosine diphosphate (GDP)

 </sup>. The Pl3k-Akt signalling pathway, endocytosis and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were identified in the H1 vs H8 group; In contrast, Rap1 signalling, PI3k-Akt signalling, olfactory transduction, cell adhesion and CAMs pathways were predominantly enriched in the H3 vs H8 group. These enriched pathways are favorable for cellular processes in the ovaries and potentially contribute to the high folliculogenesis in the Hu sheep (Supplementary Figure

<p>We believe that we have identified most of the pathways and have attempted to clarify those that are not as obvious. Some pathways we encounter in the KEGG analysis are quite straightforward, such as KEGG:04610 complement and coagulation cascades. Others are less so, such as KEGG:05340 primary immunodeficiency. In this latter case we have attempted to explain to the reader that this means that there are some genes identified in our analysis that are shared with those in this pathway. For these analyses we did not always obtain the information regarding the exact genes involved, but where this data is available we have noted it.</p>

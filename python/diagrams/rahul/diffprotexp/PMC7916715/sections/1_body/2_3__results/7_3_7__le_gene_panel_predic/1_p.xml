<p>PC is a urogenital malignancy, under which also includes kidney and bladder cancer. It is of interest to note that the LE panel scores robustly predict poor OS in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) using the TCGA PanCancer ccRCC dataset at HR 2.72, 95% CI 2.03–3.63,

Nonetheless, the observed predictive effectiveness towards ccRCC poor OS is comparable to the Panel’s prediction of PC relapse at HR 2.72, 95% CI 1.96–3.77,

As the LE multigene panel was derived based on its association with CNTN1 in PC, the observed biomarker potential of the LE gene panel in assessing both poor OS in ccRCC and in predicting PC relapse risk is intriguing. This supports the potential role of the LE multigene panel in assessing PC recurrence.

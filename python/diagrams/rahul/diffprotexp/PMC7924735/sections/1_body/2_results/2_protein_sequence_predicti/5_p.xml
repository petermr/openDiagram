<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0009104.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, each culture showed a unique proteomic profile. This is probably due to genotypic differences in cysticerci and to their environmental history. It is important to consider that cysticerci were excised from naturally infected female pigs from Guerrero, an endemic region in Mexico for taeniasis/cysticercosis.

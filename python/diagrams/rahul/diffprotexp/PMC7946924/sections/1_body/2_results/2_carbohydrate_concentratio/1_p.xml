<p id="Par26">Similar to dry mass, starch concentration of the developing spikelets increased temporally during the post anthesis period in both the cultivars (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b). The concentration was higher in apical compared to the basal spikelet. The gradient in concentration between the spikelets was wider in SR-159 than in SR-157. During the post anthesis period, spikelets of SR-159 amassed less starch than that of the cultivar SR-157. Unlike starch, soluble carbohydrate concentration of the developing spikelets decreased with passage of time, after showing an initial increase of level in the first 5 days after anthesis in both the cultivars. The concentration was higher in basal spikelets compared to apical on different stages of development. Between the cultivars, gradient in soluble carbohydrate concentration of apical verses basal spikelet was wider in SR-159 than in SR-157 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c,d).

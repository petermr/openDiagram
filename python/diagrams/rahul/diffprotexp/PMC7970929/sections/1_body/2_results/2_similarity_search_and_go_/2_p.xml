<p id="Par15">Based on the ontologies, the annotated transcripts were placed under three different categories of Biological processes (BP), Cellular component (CC) and Molecular function (MF) respectively. Functional enrichment of GO terms has been shown in Supplementary file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.The most abundant category belonged to biological processes with 1931 terms with lowest 521 terms in cellular component and 1505 terms were obtained under molecular function. A donut chart representing the most abundant 10 terms from each of ontology has been given in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

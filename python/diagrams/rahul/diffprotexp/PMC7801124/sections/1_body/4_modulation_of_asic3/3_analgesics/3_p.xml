<p>Like NSAIDs, local anesthetics can also be prescribed to relieve pain and act primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels, but in a similar manner to certain NSAIDs, some anesthetics inhibit ASIC3. For example, tetracaine (

 <sub>50</sub> of 9.96 mM (at pH 4.5), with concentrations ≥ 3 mM also partially inhibiting the sustained current (at pH 4.5 and 6) [

0: Once the animals had learnt the reaching task (typically 4 weeks training) surgical implants of recording electrodes were made (see below).
1: Following full recovery from the surgery, daily recording sessions commenced in which the cats performed approximately 80 food-rewarded reaching trials before they became sated and the session was stopped, and they were returned to their home pen.
2: The progression of each recording session followed that of the human study and was divided into three stages.
3: Stage 1: twenty baseline trials were obtained in which unperturbed reaching was performed and animals rapidly and smoothly placed their forepaw into the target reward tube.
4: Stage 2: visuomotor adaptation trials in which a set of custom made 40 dioptre Fresnel laterally displacing prism glasses were placed in the animals line of sight (approximately 2 cm in front of the eyes).
5: Initial trials in the presence of the prism glasses led to reaches laterally missing the entrance of the target reward tube.
6: Adaptation to successfully reach into the target occurred after approximately 10 trials.
7: After 20 consecutive accurate reaches, the prism glasses were removed.
8: Stage 3: immediately after removal of the prism glasses the cats exhibited lateral misses to the opposite side of the tube, indicative of a motor adaptation aftereffect.

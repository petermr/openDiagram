<p>KRT17, a stem cell marker, is also a positive marker used for grading CIN. KRT17 immunostaining differs according to the degree of cervical intraepithelial lesions and SCC, and surprisingly, staining is significantly correlated with increasing lesion grade of CIN and SCC.

 </xref> Additionally, KRT17 and p16 expression patterns have been used to distinguish (atypical) immature squamous metaplasia from high‐grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III).

 </xref> As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cam43799-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, KRT17 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Normal squamous epithelium, normal cervical gland epithelium and mature squamous metaplastic cells were negative for KRT17 staining. KRT17 was also associated with increasing lesion grade in cervical intraepithelial lesions, as follows: LSIL&gt;HSIL&gt;SCC. KRT17 was extremely over‐expressed in SCC samples but was barely expressed in normal samples, which corresponded to the results of gene expression analysis. Expression of KRT17 was not significantly different in LSIL and HSIL (Figure 
 <xref rid="cam43799-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, KRT17 may be a good biomarker for cervical cancer and a lack of KRT17 expression strongly suggests a normal cervix.

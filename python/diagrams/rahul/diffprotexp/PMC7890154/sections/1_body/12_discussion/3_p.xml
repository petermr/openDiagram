<p id="par0245">MAPK cascade modulate the signaling network operating inside the plant system under various stresses [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. MAPK acts as master regulator to maintain the various physiological and biochemical activities inside the cell in response to stresses [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Complex MAPK cascades are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotic organisms [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. MAPK is involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and various stress responses [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Here, we identified 24 MAPKs in wheat and cloned two putative MAPK genes of 1.6 kb and 1.3 kb from wheat

 <italic>MAPK</italic> is reported in wheat ([

 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>];). We observed the presence of Serine/Threonine Kinase (STK) in the active domain of both the MAPK genes which is conserved functional domain of MAPK family [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Though, MAPK-encoding genes have been also characterized in other crops like

 <italic>DSM1</italic> (MAPKKK),

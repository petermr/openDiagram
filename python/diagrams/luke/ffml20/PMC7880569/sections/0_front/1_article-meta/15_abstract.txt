0: Birnessite is a layered MnO  2 mineral capable of intercalating nanometric water films in its bulk.
1: With its variable distributions of Mn oxidation states (Mn  IV, Mn  III, and Mn  II), cationic vacancies, and interlayer cationic populations, birnessite plays key roles in catalysis, energy storage solutions, and environmental (geo)chemistry.
2: We here report the molecular controls driving the nanoscale intercalation of water in potassium-exchanged birnessite nanoparticles.
3: From microgravimetry, vibrational spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we find that birnessite intercalates no more than one monolayer of water per interlayer when exposed to water vapor at 25 C, even near the dew point.
4: Molecular dynamics showed that a single monolayer is an energetically favorable hydration state that consists of 1.33 water molecules per unit cell.
5: This monolayer is stabilized by concerted potassiumwater and direct waterbirnessite interactions, and involves negligible waterwater interactions.
6: Using our composite   adsorptioncondensationintercalation model, we predicted humidity-dependent water loadings in terms of water   intercalated in the internal and   adsorbed at external basal faces, the proportions of which vary with particle size.
7: The model also accounts for additional populations   condensed on and between particles.
8: By describing the nanoscale hydration of birnessite, our work secures a path for understanding the water-driven catalytic chemistry that this important layered manganese oxide mineral can host in natural and technological settings.

<p>One can also note that other noncarbon-based single-atom catalysts have also been proposed for CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR applications. For example, Sun et al. reported on singly dispersed Ir-based catalyst on a Î±-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> support showing high selectivity toward CO production. In this case, the analysis of 
 <italic>operando</italic> XANES data confirmed the predominantly oxidized state of the Ir species and its stability under reaction conditions. The high dispersion of the Ir species was confirmed by EXAFS data analysis.

 </xref>, the shift in the position of the absorption edge can often be directly linked to changes in the materials oxidation state and charge transfer. However, the differences in the shape of the XANES features for samples with different structures may result in ambiguities in the definition of the energy corresponding to the absorption edge, and a systematic approach is needed for quantitative analysis. In the simplest case, the energy corresponding to a certain inflection point (maximum of the first derivative) in the normalized XAS spectrum associated with the absorption threshold, pre-edge, or the main absorption feature can be used as a descriptor of the absorption edge position.

 </sup> Alternatively, one can use integrated descriptors and determine the energy where the integrated absorption reaches a certain fixed value. For example, Capehart et al. suggested using as a descriptor of the absorption edge position an energy value corresponding to 80% of the integrated absorption spectrum area for the corresponding metal foil

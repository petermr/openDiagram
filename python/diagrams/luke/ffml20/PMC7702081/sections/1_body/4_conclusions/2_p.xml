<p>By means of 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD simulations, we have investigated the structural and low‐frequency dynamics of aqueous MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solutions, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.8 mol kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. Compared with bulk water, MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> has a considerable influence on the water‐water hydrogen bonding network, as confirmed by detailed analysis of the radial distribution function, hydrogen bonding statistics, and vibrational density of states, which weh ave ascribed to the specific strong Mg‐water interaction. The dynamics of the hydrogen bond network solutions was characterized in terms of the water‐water hydrogen bonding lifetimes and water dipole reorientation. The presence of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> in solution accelerates the dynamics of hydrogen bond making and breaking because of the weakening of the water‐water interaction strength. These effects have been assigned to the specific strong Mg‐water interaction rather than the Cl‐water interaction.

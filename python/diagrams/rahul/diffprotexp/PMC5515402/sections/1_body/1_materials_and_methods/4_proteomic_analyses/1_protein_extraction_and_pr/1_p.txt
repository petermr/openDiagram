0: Cells were harvested after 48 h of AAS exposure.
1: Lysis Buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS; GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA) were added to the cell pellets.
2: Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min at 4C.
3: Supernatants containing the cellular protein fractions were recovered and protein extracts were purified by precipitation, using a 2-D Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA).
4: After precipitation, protein pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (30 mM Tris-HCL pH = 8, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS).
5: Protein concentration was measured using a 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA).
6: Kits were used as suggested by manufacturers instructions.

0: During experimental trials, the contact tube to work piece distance was systematically increased in steps of 8 mm.
1: The starting value was set to CTWD = 12 mm, which is the standard distance based on the formula CTWD = 10...12   wire.
2: The maximum extension was set to CTWD = 52 mm.
3: Referring to the state of the art, a spin of the welding electrode  t  E could be observed resulting from the wire spooling.
4: The maximum measured value of  t  E is shown in  Figure 3a at the maximum extension of CTWD = 52 mm.
5: Hereby, the electrode spin was measured at a constant value of  t  E = 1.8 mm.
6: A commonly displaced position of the electrode to one direction does not affect the additive manufacturing process and can be compensated throughout the programming of an offset in the handling system.

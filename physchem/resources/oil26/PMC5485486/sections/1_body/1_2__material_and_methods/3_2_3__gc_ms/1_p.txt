0: The obtained essential oil samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph Trace GC Ultra equipped with a FID detector and a capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25  m film thickness) DB-5 (methyl polysiloxane with 5% phenyl); the injection volume was 1  L. The gas chromatograph was coupled to a mass spectrometer Q Polaris MS that performs the analysis of the mass spectrometry (70 eV with an ion trap).
1: The temperature program was 40C for 2 min and then heated to 180C at a rate of 4C/min.
2: The carrier gas was helium (1.4 ml/min).

0: Preparation of protoscolex samples: fertile CE cyst were obtained from the livers of naturally infected sheep.
1: The cyst fluid containing protoscoleces was aspirated using a syringe and transferred to a 50-mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 5 min; the supernatant was then discarded and the pellet was resuspended in sterile normal saline and centrifuged.
2: The operation was repeated 3 times, and the precipitate was filtered through a 200-m pore size filter.
3: After the protoscoleces were prepared for microscopic examination under a microscope at 40 and 100, a sample of protoscolex was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen.

<p>Indirect evaluation of leukocyte recruitment to the inflamed brain was performed by assessing the activity of enzymes NAG, MPO and EPO in tissue samples, relative to the presence of macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9c,e</xref>). Corroborating our previous results, the recruitment of evaluated leukocyte populations was similar between SLEV-infected WT and IFNγ-/- mice. Altogether, these data indicate that WT and IFNγ-/- mice develop a similar disease when infected with SLEV. We could not observe a significant impact of IFNγ deficiency in any of the evaluated disease parameters.

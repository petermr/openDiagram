0: The expression data of DEGs overlapped from HD versus control as well as BDNF-low versus high groups were extracted to perform weight gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA).
1: The hclust function was implemented to draw the clustering dendrogram eliminating the outliers of samples.
2: Using the default unsigned network type, a soft thresholding power of 14 meeting the scale-free topology criterion was selected in the pickSoftThreshold function [ 39].
3: The WGCNA package was implied to predict the co-expression modules for assigning different color labels [ 40].
4: The minimum size of module was set to 30 genes to avoid small modules and guarantee separation.
5: Functional annotations and enrichment analyses were conducted using the clusterProfiler package to screen genes enriched in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.
6: The FDR< 0.05 was considered as enrichment with statistical significance.

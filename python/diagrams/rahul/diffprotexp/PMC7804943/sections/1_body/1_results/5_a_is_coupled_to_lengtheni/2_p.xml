<p id="Par18">APA can elicit coupled regulatory changes in neurons, for example, by affecting where transcripts are localized for translation, and/or by controlling the steady-state GE levels of transcripts and corresponding protein products. To address whether the APA differences detected above are coupled with changes in steady-state GE, we performed a differential GE analysis on the corresponding transcripts using DESeq2. Consistent with previous studies indicating that APA is not significantly correlated with steady-state GE changes during neuronal differentiation

 </sup>, we do not observe a correlation between ΔPPAU and changes in transcript levels between proximal-distal pyramidal neurons versus the other profiled neurons (Supplementary Fig.

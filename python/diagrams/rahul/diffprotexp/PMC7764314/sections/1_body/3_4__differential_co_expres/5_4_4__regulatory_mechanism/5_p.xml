<p>Other regulatory layers have been less explored: only a few studies integrated epigenetic changes with biological networks (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B156-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], combining differential methylation and PPIs), but no direct inference of epigenetically regulated co-expression modules has been proposed. Of note, specific methods have been generated to assess co-expression dependence on sequence variants [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B157-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B158-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], and applied to identify genetic variations potentially responsible for gene network rewiring in disease [
 <xref rid="B158-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. In cancer, this led to imply the TF Myc-associated factor X (MAX) in modulating ATF4 and CLOCK interaction [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-21-09461" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Interestingly, this result was supported by MAX binding to ATF4 and CLOCK promoters.

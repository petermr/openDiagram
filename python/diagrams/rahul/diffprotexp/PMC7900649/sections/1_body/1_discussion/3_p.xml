<p id="Par32">In this study, APA switching genes and DEGs were found to participate in variety of biological processes such as cellular process, metabolism and immunity reactions, which was consistent with the results of Zhang et al., who analyzed the DEGs of PEDV infection in Vero cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several proteome analyses also show that, after PEDV infection, differentially expressed proteins involve in biosynthesis, metabolic and signal transduction processes, such as cell cycle, cell death and survival and virus entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Immune-related pathways, like TGF-beta signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway and antigen processing and presentation, were enriched in our results. The expression levels of more immune-related genes and proteins were found to be affected by PEDV infection by Zhang et al. and Sun et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In our data, some genes exhibited both APA switching and changes in expression levels, suggesting these genes are regulated by multiple mechanisms during virus infection. Furthermore, the overlapped genes tended to be the “focus” genes in the networks of cellular processes such as cell cycle and protein processing in ER as well as signaling pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). These genes may serve as essential genes during PEDV-cell interaction.

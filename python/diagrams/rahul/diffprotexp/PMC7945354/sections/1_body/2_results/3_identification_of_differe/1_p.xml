<p id="Par43">Using SWATH-MS analysis, we analyzed global protein changes in serum samples from 20 patients (5 healthy controls, 5 T2DM patients, 5 LAC patients and 5 T2DM + LAC patients). A total of 70 proteins were identified as differentially expressed between these disease groups and the control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–c). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, the three protein lists from the above analysis (T2DM vs. normal, LAC vs. normal and T2DM + LAC vs. normal) were further compared to identify a small group of proteins that were differentially expressed only in the T2DM + LAC group. Overall, 13 proteins were found to be unique in patients with T2DM + LAC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Among these proteins, 7 candidates exhibited differential expression between the T2DM + LAC and T2DM groups, including 2 upregulated proteins and 5 downregulated proteins (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). To arrange the samples according to similarities in protein expression patterns, we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis of the 70 DEPs as previously described [

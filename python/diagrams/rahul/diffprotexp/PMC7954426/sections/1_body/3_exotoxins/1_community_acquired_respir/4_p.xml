<p>CARDS TX can activate NLRP3 inflammasome by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of NLRP3, thereby cleaving pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β [

 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. CARDS TX mutants lacking the ART activity fail in binding and internalization, and thereby are unable to activate the NLPR3 inflammasome [
 <xref rid="cit0216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>], indicating that ADP-ribosylation is a unique post-translational modification that is essential for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In short, once the CARDS TX is trafficked to early and late endosomes, it undergoes retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum through an unusual KELED motif located at the junction of D1 and D2 domains, causing ADP-ribosylation-dependent NLPR3-mediated IL-1β release and induces the formation of vacuoles, which subsequently exert cytotoxicity [

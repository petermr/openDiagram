0: Here we performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of in vitro iPSCs-derived MNs to characterize the key principles of MN development by analyzing bulk transcriptome data from five crucial time points of MN neurogenesis: iPSCs (D0), NSCs (D7), post-mitotic MNP cells (D13), eMNs (D18), and mature MNs (D28).
1: We interrogated the transcriptomic signatures using next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology and performed in situ validation of key pluripotency and MN specific biomarker expression.
2: Additionally, we characterized the functionality of iPSC-derived MNs via electrophysiological analysis of neuronal network connectivity.
3: Our results corroborate transcriptomic profiles previously identified in the astrocyte-to-neuron transformation process [ 3]; specifically, upregulation of Shh and Wnt signaling pathways.
4: We observed altered gene expression of TGF signaling components during the early stages of iPSC conversion into neural stem cell (NSC) in response to chemical inhibition.
5: However, we detected an upregulation of positive TFG regulators in the subsequent steps of neurogenesis.

 <caption> ( A– D). Differential mRNA expression of MCT1, MCT2, MCT4 and Na +/K + ATP-ase α2 subunit in the cerebellum of WT and Prnp −/− mice. The mRNA expression level of MCT1 was significantly increased in the cerebellum of Prnp −/− vs. a control group, while MCT2, MCT4 and Na +/K + ATP-ase α2 subunit expression remained unchanged. Sample size of WT group: n = 5; Prnp −/− group: n = 6. Displayed are means ± SEM. A p-value &lt; 0.01 is considered as very significant (**) and ≥0.05 as not significant (ns). </caption>

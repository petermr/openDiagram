<p>To evaluate the contribution of the binding domain in Fiber-2 with KPNA3/4 to the pathogenesis, a 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAV-4_Del virus with the deletion of 7–40aa of Fiber-2 was generated through CRISPR-Cas9 technique. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies both demonstrate that N-terminal 7–40aa of Fiber-2 play vital roles in the viral replication and pathogenesis. FAV4_Del replicated significantly slower than the wild-type FAdV-4 in LMH cells, and did not shed viruses in cloaca in the infected chickens. The infection of FAdV-4 caused 100% mortality of the infected chickens whereas the infection of FAV4_Del did not cause any clinical signs and all the chickens infected with FAV4_Del were survival. Moreover, FAV4_Del can provide efficient protection in chickens against lethal challenge with the wild type FAdV-4. Again, the challenged chickens previously infected with FAV4_Del did not cause any clinical signs and all the chickens were survival whereas the challenged control chickens showed severe clinical signs with 80% mortality.

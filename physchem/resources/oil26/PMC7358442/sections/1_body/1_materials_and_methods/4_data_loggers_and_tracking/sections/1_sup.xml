Loggers were set to record temperature at 5-min intervals. Each temperature logger was calibrated in an insulated water bath against a high accuracy thermometer (Quat 100, Heraeus, Germany) over a temperature range of 28&#8211;42&#176;C in increments of 2&#176;C before implantation. We confirmed the reliability of temperature readings by re-calibrating all loggers after their removal. After calibration, the biologgers measured body temperature to an accuracy of better than 0.1&#176;C.

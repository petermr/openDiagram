0: Anabaena sp.
1: strain PCC 7120 is a model strain useful for performing molecular studies of cell differentiation and heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria; this strain was purchased from the Freshwater Algae Culture Collection at the Institute of Hydrobiology with accession number of FACHB-418.
2: The initial strain was cultured in Blue-Green medium (BG11) for 3 days, and then centrifuged and used in subsequent experiments.
3: Nitrogen-replete medium (BG11) [ 41] and nitrogen deprivation medium (BG110) were used to culture PCC 7120 at an initial inoculation concentration OD 730 of 0.1.
4: Before inoculation, the strain was centrifuged and washed three times with BG11 or BG110 for purification and enrichment.
5: The culture period was 72 h. To maintain the relative stability of nutrient elements in the culture medium, the strains were centrifuged and replaced with fresh culture medium every 24 h. After 72 h of culture, the strain OD 730 in BG11 medium and BG110 medium were 0.997 and 0.621, respectively.
6: The strain was cultured in 250-mL flasks sealed with plastic ventilating film, and the culture volume was 100 mL.
7: PCC 7120 cultivation was carried out in a double layer shaping incubator under the following conditions: light of 300 molm 2s 1, 30C, and shaking at a speed of 140 rpm.
8: All centrifugation steps were performed at 500  g for 5 min.
9: After 72 h of cultivation, the formation of vegetative cells and heterocysts in the filaments was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) ( Fig 1A1, 1A2, 1B1 and 1B2).

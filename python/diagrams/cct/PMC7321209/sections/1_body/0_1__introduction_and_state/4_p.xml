<p>The main challenge in WAAM is the high, periodic heat input due to the arc welding process. Thus, geometrical features of the deposited layers are influenced by large melt pool sizes as well as microstructural properties such as grain size. The analysis and reduction of heat input during WAAM is a key factor for the application of this technology. Therefore, investigations on energy reduced welding regimes were carried out [

However, the described methods of energy reduction are commonly coupled to specific hardware such as welding power sources with energy reduced processes or additional equipment, e.g., fluid bath, cooling clamps, etc. An applicable approach for the reduction of energy input during WAAM by gas metal arc welding is the extension of the free wire length during processing. Though, electrical properties such as welding current, respectively welding power can be reduced as described below.

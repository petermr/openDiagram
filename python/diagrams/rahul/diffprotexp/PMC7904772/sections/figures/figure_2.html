 <caption> Expression analysis of the identified differentially expressed proteins. A Venn diagrams displaying the differential protein number among the depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus), anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus), and insusceptible (Insus) groups. B Clustering of differential proteins from the three groups using a visualized heatmap. Lower expressions were shown by blue and higher by red. Various color intensities indicated the expression levels and a log2 scale was used in the color bar. The included eight labels were indicated on the y-axis. </caption>

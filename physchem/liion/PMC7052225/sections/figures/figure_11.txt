0: Figure 11Long cycling experiments performed at a constant charge/discharge current of C/2 between 1.2 and 2.5 V versus Li/Li   +.
1: Two LTO electrodes, one composed of VGCFCOOH () and the other of a mixture of VGCFCOOH and CNTCOOH (   ), are compared.
2: Full and empty characters represent charges and discharges, respectively.

 <caption> Enriched KEGG pathways related to the immune functions in lung lesion (LL) vs lung without lesions (LN) is shown. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (p&lt;0.05) in each treatment group was conducted and results were visualized as a map of predicted connections among significantly enriched pathways. </caption>

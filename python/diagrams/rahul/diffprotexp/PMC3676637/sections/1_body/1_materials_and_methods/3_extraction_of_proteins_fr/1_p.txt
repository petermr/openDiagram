0: To minimize contamination of samples by stromal cells, we selected the block that contained the largest amount of tumor tissue from each patient.
1: Extraction of crude proteins from these tissue blocks was carried out as described elsewhere [ 18], with minor modifications.
2: Briefly, 10 tissue sections (each 10 m thick) were deparaffinized in 1 mL of xylene with gentle agitation for 5 min.
3: After removing the xylene, 1 mL of 100 % ethanol was added and the sections were agitated for 5 min.
4: After centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was thoroughly dried under a vacuum for 10 min.
5: Then, 100 l of extraction buffer from the Qproteome FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was added to the dewaxed tissue pellet, followed by incubation on ice for 5 min, vortex mixing, and heating at 100 C for 20 min and 80 C for 2 h in a Thermomixer at 750 rpm.
6: After centrifugation at 14,000 g and 4 C for 15 min, 10 L of the supernatant was used to measure the protein content by the Lowry method [ 19].

<p id="Par43">A ceRNA network was constructed using 2489 lncRNA-miRNA pairs and 1148 miRNA-mRNA pairs using Cytoscape software. The association of 153 lncRNAs in the ceRNA network with patient prognosis was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The results showed that 11 of the 153 lncRNAs were significantly associated with OS. The 11 prognosis-related DElncRNAs were considered key lncRNAs. LINC02038 and AC104823.1 were positively correlated with OS, whereas MIR4435-2HG, NKILA, AFAP1-AS1, ELFN1-AS1, AC005520.2, AC245884.8, AL354836.1, AL355987.4, and AL591845.1 were negatively correlated with OS (Fig.

<p>We examined changes in myocardial histopathology by H&amp;E staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2a</xref>). On both d 7 and 14, there were no evident pathological changes in the control group, while VMC and VMC+Sham groups showed severe injuries accompanied by cellular infiltration and necrosis. Vagotomy exacerbated the extent of cellular infiltration and necrosis in VMC mice (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). The pathological damage was significantly reduced in VMC+Vag mice with pnu282987 treatment (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). Likewise, pnu282987 administration in VMC mice exhibited smaller and more limited foci of cellular infiltration and necrosis (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05). (

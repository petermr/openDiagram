<p>Locomotor activity (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> for a summary) was recorded using motion-sensitive loggers. In the first year (July 2012 to July 2013), activity was recorded by tri-axial piezoelectrical accelerometers (Actical, Mini-Mitter Corporation, United States), which were sensitive to forces of &gt;0.05 
 <italic>g</italic> and were set to record whole-body movements over full 5-min periods. In the following years (2013â€“2015), aardvark locomotor activity was recorded over 10-s periods at 5-min intervals using custom-designed activity biologgers (MLOG_AT1, Sigma Delta Technologies, Australia) with a tri-axial accelerometer sensitive to forces of &gt;0.04 
 <italic>g</italic>. These devices had previously been validated against visual observations of a free-living primate (

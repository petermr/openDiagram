<p>Dysregulations in various biochemical pathways play an important role in cancer formation and development. Genetic studies have identified numerous molecular defects in cancer cells and suggested multiple potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Conventional drug design has mainly focused on the inhibition of a single protein, usually an enzyme or receptor; however, this strategy has not been successful enough, as the development and progression of cancers are mostly due to the coordinated action of a group of biological entities rather than a single molecule dysfunction [

Hereby, PPIs have become highly promising targets that cover many therapeutic areas and potential intervention points for the development of anticancer agents. Until now, significant progress has been made in identifying small molecule inhibitors of various proteinâ€“protein systems in the field of oncology, and powerful and selective drug-like molecules that inhibit many interactions such as p53-MDM2 interaction have been discovered [

<p>Relatively less studied remain other multimetallic oxide catalysts for OER. Ni–Co and Fe–Ni–Co catalysts have attracted attention because of their high electrical conductivity and OER activity that surpassed that of pure Co oxides.

 </sup> The main role in their activity, is, however, played by Ni and Fe species, with Co species contributing indirectly by tuning the oxidation state and the local structure around the active sites. The passive role of Co species was suggested in several

 </sup> At the same time, as demonstrated by Bates et al., the introduction of Co lowered the potential at which Ni oxidation occurred,

 </sup> and resulted also in a shortening of the Ni–O (as well as Fe–O in Ni–Fe–Co catalyst) bonds. In this study, among the catalysts compared, the highest OER activity was observed for the Fe–Ni–Co system, suggesting that while the presence of Co modifies the electronic state and local structure around Ni, and may induce the strain in the structure, the Fe species are the key to ensure the activity in this trimetallic catalyst.

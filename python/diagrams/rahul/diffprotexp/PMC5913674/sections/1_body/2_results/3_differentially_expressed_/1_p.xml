<p>A nonredundant total of 443 proteins met both fold change and 
 <italic>P</italic> value thresholds for differential expression in the 3 MtzR isolate lines. Correlations between protein and RNA fold changes [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] from the same cell-pellet material in MtzR lines compared to MtzS were calculated at r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.154 for WB, r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.105 for WB, and r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.187 for WB (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) for genes identified in both datasets (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The largest number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was identified in WB-MtzR with 264 DEPs, followed by 106-MtzR (171 DEPs) and 713-MtzR (76 DEPs). The proportions of upregulated and downregulated proteins were approximately equal in each resistant line (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Of the nonredundant 443 DEPs, only 7 (1.6%) were common between all 3 MtzR lines (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>, panel A). A further 55 DEPs (12.5%) were variously detected in 2 of the 3 lines. Overall, the majority of DEPs (86.4%) were unique to each line. This distinction between DEPs was not due to discrepancies in protein identifications between TMT 10plex experiments, as in each of the 3 10plexes, 741 proteins were common identifications, constituting between 60.7% and 69.9% of proteins identified in each and 47.2% of the nonredundant total (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>, panel A). Furthermore, the majority of DEPs in each MtzR line were identified in the other experiments (

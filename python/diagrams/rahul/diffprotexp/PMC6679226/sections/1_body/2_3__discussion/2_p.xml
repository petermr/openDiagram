<p>Our BALF proteomic results from I.T. LPS treated mice are in agreement with BALF proteomic analysis in human subjects challenged with I.T. LPS, as well as in human patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS. For example, ApoA1 and S100A8/9 up-regulated by I.T. LPS treatment in mice were previously found to be up-regulated in BALF in healthy human subjects challenged with LPS endotoxin (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O:113) within a lung segment and in patients with ARDS [

 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, these apolipoproteins were not increased in BALF from I.P. LPS treated mice, and in fact, ApoA4 decreased following I.P. LPS administration (

 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a previous proteomic study, BALF thioredoxin levels were shown to be significantly increased in ARDS non-survivors compared to survivors [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In our study, BALF thioredoxin level increased only in I.P. LPS group but not in the I.T. LPS group, indicating that thioredoxin might be a biomarker for survival in only a subset of ARDS patients, i.e., extra-pulmonary ARDS.

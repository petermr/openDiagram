0: Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were collected by incubation (5% CO 2 and 37C for 1 h) with 2 ml cellular lysis buffer (8 M urea, 30 mM HEPES, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM DTT).
1: Ultrasonic processing (pulse on for 2 sec, pulse off for 3 sec; power, 180 W) of this solution was then performed using an ultrasonic processor and centrifugation at 20,000  g for 30 min at 4C.
2: The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at 80C until use.
3: For each sample, proteins were precipitated with ice-cold acetone prior to being redissolved in dissolution buffer (50% TEAB and 0.1% SDS).
4: The proteins were quantified by the Bradford protein assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).
5: Subsequently, 100 mg protein was tryptically digested and the resultant peptide mixture was labeled using the iTRAQ reagent (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).
6: The protein solution was further digested with sequence-grade modified trypsin.
7: For labeling, each iTRAQ reagent was dissolved in 70 l isopropanol and added to the respective peptide mixture.
8: Protein samples were labeled with iTRAQ isobaric tags: 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119 and 121.

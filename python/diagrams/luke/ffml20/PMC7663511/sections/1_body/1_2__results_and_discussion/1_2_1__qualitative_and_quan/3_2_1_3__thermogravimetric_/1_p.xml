<p>TGA is a useful tool widely recommended in the characterization of nanomaterials not only in the investigation of processes such as adsorption but also to quantify the degree of functionalization, decomposition, and possible structural damage. For this reason, thermal analysis was carried out in an inert atmosphere or in an oxidizing atmosphere. The determined TGA curves are plotted in

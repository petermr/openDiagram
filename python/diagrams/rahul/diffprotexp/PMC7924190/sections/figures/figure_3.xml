  <p>Validation of the Clariom
   <sup>TM</sup> S array analyzed transcripts using qRT-PCR. The hTCEpi cells were cultured in the presence of AC EFs and RNA was isolated after 24 h. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 µg of total RNA to prepare cDNA and qRT-PCR was performed to compare the expression analysis of different transcripts using respective primers for Twist1, Notch1, Notch3, Notch4, Jag2, Zeb1, Numb, NFkB, E-Cad, IL8, IL18, IL21, IL27, Ker9 and Ker27. Relative expression patterns were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle (2
   <sup>−ΔΔ
    <italic>C</italic>t
   </sup>) method. Expression values are represented as fold changes over the control on an arbitrary scale after normalization with GAPDH. Further, these transcripts displayed similar expression profile during Clariom
   <sup>TM</sup> S Arrays. Data represent means ± standard deviations of three independent experiments.

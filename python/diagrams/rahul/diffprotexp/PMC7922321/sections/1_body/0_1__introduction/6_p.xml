<p>ETV2, an early regulator of vascular development, was found to be overexpressed in high-grade gliomas, and was reported to play a critical role in endothelial transdifferentiation of CD133+ GBM stem cells, which is thought to render them resistant to anti-angiogenic therapy [

 <xref rid="B25-jpm-11-00138" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and ETS protein PU.1, known for its critical role in hematopoietic development, was also reported to be highly expressed in glioma patients, indicating its role in the progression of glioma [

In a network analysis based on complexity, as measured by betweenness, Etv5 was identified as a regulator in low-grade optic gliomas in Nf1 mutant mice, and experiments validated the increased expression of both Etv5 and its target genes in optic gliomas [

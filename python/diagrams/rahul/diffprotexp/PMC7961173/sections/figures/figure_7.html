 <caption> DCVC effect on ISR-associated ATF4 regulation of gene expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Because ATF4 transcriptional regulation is a key regulator of the ISR, ATF4 gene targets were tested for overrepresentation among DCVC-induced differentially expressed genes using a statistical enrichment test. a Venn diagram depicting overlap between the number of ATF4 gene targets and genes differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35[FC &gt; 1.3]) after a 12-h exposure to 20 µM DCVC compared with control ( P = 5.52 × 10 –22). b Heatmap visualizing hierarchical clustering and logFC expression of 47 genes differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35[FC &gt; 1.3]), after exposure to 20 µM DCVC for 12 h. Expression levels of other comparisons were included for reference purposes. c Visualization of ATF4 expression, along with the same 47 significantly expressed ATF4 and ATF4 + CHOP gene targets grouped by function and cell fate, with single gene-level logFC displayed. Genes displayed in blue are regulated by ATF4 alone, whereas genes displayed in salmon are co-regulated by ATF4 and CHOP </caption>

 <caption> Coincidence between altered expression of splicing-related genes and gDTUs in advanced pathologic stages of AD. Aâ€“ D Upset plots showing the total number of gDTU identified in the comparison between different Braak stages (low vs. high, low vs. mid, and mid vs. high) in BM10 ( A), BM44 ( B), BM22 ( C), or BM36 ( D). Horizontal bars show the total number of gDTUs identified in each comparison (low vs. high, low vs. mid, and mid vs. high), whereas vertical bars indicate the gDTUs exclusive or common to different comparisons. Black dots below vertical bars indicate stages analyzed. E, F Differential expression of genes associated with splicing/spliceosome after comparison of different Braak stages ( E) or AD vs controls in different datasets ( F). Red and blue squares indicate, respectively, up- and downregulated genes. Gene symbols highlighted in red indicate genes belonging to the neuronal splicing machinery. </caption>

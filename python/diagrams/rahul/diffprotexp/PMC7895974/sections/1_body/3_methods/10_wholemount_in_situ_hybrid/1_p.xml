<p id="Par39">Wholemount in situ hybridisation using DIG-UTP labelled antisense RNA probes for 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> (a gift from Baljinder Mankoo, King’s College London UK) and 
 <italic>TCF15</italic> (a gift from Susanne Dietrich, University of Portsmouth UK) was carried out using standard methods. Briefly, following fixation in 4% PFA embryos were treated with Proteinase K, hybridised over night at 65 °C. After post-hybridisation washes and blocking with BMB (Roche), embryos were treated with anti-DIG antibody, coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche). Signal was developed using NBT/BCIP.

<p>Mouse Gene Ontology (GO) data was downloaded from Bioconductor (org.Mm.eg.db). We used the TopGO R package version 2.34.0 (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2019</xref>) to test for enrichment of GO terms. For the analysis presented here, we restricted our testing to GO Biological Process annotations and required a minimal node size (number of genes annotated to GO terms) of 20. We used the internal ‘weight01’ testing framework and the Fisher test, a strategy recommended for gene set analysis that generally accounts for multiple testing comparisons. For GO BP analysis, we reported terms with p-value&lt;0.05. For all enrichment analysis, the test set of DE genes was compared against the background set of genes expressed in our study based on minimum read-count cutoffs described above. Heatmaps showing positive log
 <sub>2</sub> (expected/observed) values were plotted for GO terms of interest.

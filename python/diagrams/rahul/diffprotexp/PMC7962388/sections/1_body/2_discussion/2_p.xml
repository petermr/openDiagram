<p id="Par70">In the early 2000s, PCR-based methods were used to predict several 
 <italic>P. notatum</italic> transcripts associated with the occurrence of agamospermy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These preliminary amplification analyses, although rather limited, served well to the selection of candidates and the establishment of further functional characterizations that led, finally, to the identification of major components of the apomixis pathway in this species. In particular, the MAP3K-encoding 
 <italic>QGJ</italic> (
 <italic>QUI-GON JINN</italic>) transcript, initially identified by Laspina et al. (2008) as clone N46, was validated in sexual and aposporous plants through RNA in situ hybridization experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and functionally classified as an inducer of aposporous embryo sacs (AESs) formation in 
 <italic>Paspalum</italic> RNAi lines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>TGS1</italic> (
 <italic>TRIMETHYLGUANOSINE SYNTHASE 1</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] was also confirmed to express differentially in sexual and aposporous ovules by RNA in situ hybridization experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] and classified as an AESs repressor in 
 <italic>Paspalum</italic> antisense lines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The functional association between the apospory induction/repression pathways directed by 
 <italic>QGJ</italic> and 
 <italic>TGS1</italic> is currently under investigation

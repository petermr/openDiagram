0: The preparation method of the experimental materials was similar to previous research reports [ 22].
1: Since no studies have shown that the CE resistance of sheep is related to sex, 2-year-old Kazakh ewes with CE-resistant [ MvaI bc- SacII ab- Hin1I ab(R)] and CE-non-resistant [ MvaIbc- SacIIab- Hin1Iab (NR)] haplotypes were selected, as described previously, and raised on the farm of Shihezi University.
2: All animals were raised under the same conditions of free access to water and food, in natural lighting.
3: They were divided into two groups according to their MHC haplotype: three sheep with the CE-resistant haplotype were referred to as the CE-R group, three sheep with the CE-non-resistant haplotype constituted the CE-NR group, and a single sheep with the CE-non-resistant haplotype formed the CK (Control Check) group.
4: All the sheep were screened for the absence of hydatid cysts and were healthy prior to the experiment.
5: In line with the previous approach, all the sheep were orally infected with  E. granulosus eggs.
6: Since our previous research showed that there were already significant differences in miRNAs in the small intestine at 8 h after infection, we speculated that differential gene expression may occur at the same time point.
7: As a result, all animals were sacrificed 8 h after infection.
8: Immediately afterward, the intestinal tissue of every sheep was removed.
9: Approximately 100-mm 3-sized intestinal tissue blocks were collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen prior to long-term storage at 80 C until RNA extraction.

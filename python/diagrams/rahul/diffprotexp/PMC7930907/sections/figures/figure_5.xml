  <p>Combined analysis of DEGs and expression of differential metabolites in SASCs and EASCs. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A heat map of the top 20 DEGs and differential metabolites in SASCs and EASCs; the horizontal axis represents DEGs, and the vertical represents regulated metabolites. In the figure, red indicates a positive correlation, and blue indicates a negative correlation. The deeper the color, the greater the correlation. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The PPI network of the DEGs and differential metabolites. The red line indicates a positive correlation, the green line indicates a negative correlation, and the thickness of the line represents the correlation coefficient. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> KGML network analysis of DEGs and differential metabolites in SASCs and EASCs. The circles represent genes, hexagons represent metabolites, and diamonds represent pathways. Red indicates upregulated genes or metabolites, and green indicates downregulated genes or metabolites. ***

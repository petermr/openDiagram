 <xref rid="B10-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found high expression of the placenta-derived growth factor (PIGF) gene in carious tissue. PIGF is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor family, and the PIGF upregulation might promote cell migration and induce endothelial cell proliferation and permeabilization of blood vessels. Correspondingly, we noticed increased hemoglobin among the spots analyzed.

<p id="Par32">More generally, this study illustrates the utility of using Steered Molecular Dynamics simulations to understand the mechanisms by which an antibiotic can act on a biological process. The 100-fold speed up of SMD simulations over conventional MD methods suggests that it may be possible to utilize a similar approach to screen potential antibiotics for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis.</p>

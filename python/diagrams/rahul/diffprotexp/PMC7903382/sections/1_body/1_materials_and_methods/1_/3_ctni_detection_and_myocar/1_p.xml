<p>cTnI level was determined using an Automated Blood or Urine Chemical Analyzer (Vitro 350; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics). H&amp;E staining and Masson trichrome staining were conducted in the myocardial tissue samples in order to observe the myocardial pathology. Heart tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24 h at room temperature and embedded with paraffin, before 4-Âµm thick sections were cut. After deparaffinization by washing with xylene followed by rehydration in a descending ethanol gradient, sections were immersed in hematoxylin for 5-7 min, differentiated in 1% acid alcohol for 2-5 sec and stained with 0.5% eosin for 2 min. After rinsing with distilled water for 30 sec, sections were dehydrated with an ascending ethanol gradient and were cleared in xylene. All procedures were carried out at room temperature. Using a light microscope (magnification x200; Leica DM 4000B; Leica Microsystems, Inc.), pathological changes of myocardial tissues were observed. The procedure of Masson's trichrome staining was similar to H&amp;E staining, which was described previously (

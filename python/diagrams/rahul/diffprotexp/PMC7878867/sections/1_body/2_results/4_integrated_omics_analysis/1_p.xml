<p id="Par27">With data from the three sequencing platforms, integrated omic analysis was performed to identify miRNA-mRNA modules with significant antagonistic regulatory patterns, based on the gene silencing effects of miRNAs (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM20" ref-type="media">S15</xref>). First, subject to the progeny stress treatment factor, paired-comparisons were made between AtCC and AtCW, AtWC and AtWW to identify miRNA-mRNA pairs with significant antagonistic regulatory patterns (i.e. significant down-regulated miRNA expression, matching significant up-regulated mRNA target expression; or significant up-regulated miRNA expression matching significant down-regulated mRNA target expression) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM20" ref-type="media">S15</xref>). For the progeny from control parents, 100 miRNA-mRNA pairs showed antagonistic regulatory patterns in the flag leaf tissue (AtCW_L vs AtCC_L); in the developing grains, 359 miRNA-mRNA pairs were found (AtCW_G vs AtCC_G). For the progeny from the stressed parents, 400 miRNA-mRNA pairs showed antagonistic regulatory patterns (AtWW_L vs AtWC_L); in the developing grains, 344 miRNA-mRNA pairs were found (AtWW_G vs AtWC_G). Notably, in the flag leaf, the progeny from the stressed parents had a lot more (four times) stress-responsive miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs than the progeny from the control parents (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM20" ref-type="media">S15</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the top KEGG pathways enriched among down-regulated and up-regulated miRNA-target pairs in the progeny treated with water-deficit stress. In the progeny from the control parents, the top four KEGG pathways where genes were up-regulated in the flag leaf tissue were aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, photosynthesis—antenna proteins, endocytosis, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; while in the developing grain the top enriched KEGG pathway for up-regulated genes was protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the progeny from the stressed parents where genes were up-regulated in the flag leaf, the top three KEGG pathways were glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and plant-pathogen interaction; while in the developing grain the top enriched KEGG pathway for up-regulated genes was RNA transport (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

<p>In order to obtain a measure of the reproducibility of the SELDI mass spectral analysis, equal volumes (1.0 μL) of anion exchange fraction Q1 from the cytosolic fraction of pooled mouse brain tissue was spotted onto four NP20 protein chips (eight spots per chip) allowing an analysis of both spot-to-spot variation within a chip as well as chip-to-chip variation. The SELDI-MS spectra of each spot (A-H) obtained for one NP20 protein chip is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. A total of eighteen peaks with signal/noise (S/N) &gt; 5 were found to be common to all spectra measured on this chip which represented proteins with m/z ratios in the range from 7,500 to 42,772 Da. All spectra have very similar peak patterns as expected for replicates from the same pooled sample. Sources of variability include variation in manually spotting proteins on the chip, the reproducibility of the manufactured spot surfaces, and the intrinsic variation in the ionization and desorption process and in ion time-of-flight and detection. The coefficient of variation for each peak is listed in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The overall coefficient of variation for the peak intensity for this protein chip was 17.3%. No significant differences in the variability of peak intensities were observed as a function of mass/charge ratio. Analysis of the other three NP20 chips gave similar results with overall coefficients of variation for the peak intensities of 13.6%, 16.1%, and 15.3%, suggesting an average coefficient of variation for spot-to-spot variability of 15.6%. A similar analysis of the chip-to-chip variability of peak intensities suggests a slightly larger overall coefficient of variation of 17.6%. These values are similar to those reported by others for analyses performed on single machines [

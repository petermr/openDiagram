<p id="Par45">Our transcriptome analysis indicated that AS6 targets specific pathways in MCF7 cells concentrated on regulating the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–D). The apoptotic pathways were upregulated whereas cell cycle and DNA repair mediators were downregulated in AS6-treated MCF7 cells (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–D, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A–F). By contrast, AS6 suppressed the genes involved in apoptosis while activating the genes that regulate DNA repair and the cell cycle in HUMEC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D–G). In addition, the cytotoxicity analysis showed differential susceptibility to AS6 between these two cells, with an LC
 <sub>50</sub> value for MCF7 cells about tenfold lower than that for HUMEC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These results suggest more devastating effects of AS6 in cancer cells than in the normal mammary epithelial cells. In fact, we observed increased cell viability when HUMEC were treated with AS6 at concentrations up to 1 μM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). The trend shown by our cytotoxicity data for HUMEC resembled the hormetic curve

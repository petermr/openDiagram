<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver tumors that causes over 600,000 deaths per year in the world 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Patients with HCC usually combine with cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, ascites and neutropenia, and the complicated combination often makes the therapies for the patients ineffectual 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In addition, the prognosis of HCC is poor due to the frequent resistance to current chemotherapies via the dysfunction of signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival

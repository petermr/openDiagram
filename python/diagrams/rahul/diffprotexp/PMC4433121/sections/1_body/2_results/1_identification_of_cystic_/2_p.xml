<p>The 20 cPTCs were subsequently analyzed together with 56 benign cystic thyroid lesions (

These cases were identified after analyses of the FNAB reports (n = 69) or by identification of cystic lesion in surgically excised thyroid tumors in other samples (n = 7). A preoperative diagnosis of PTC was established in 8 cases (47%), whereas 9 cPTC cases (53%) had suspicious or benign FNAB results illustrating the diagnostic challenges for preoperative identification of cPTC (

<p>The edgeR package was used to perform difference analysis. The false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 and | log2 (multiple change) &gt; 1 were set as the cut-off values for the screening of the differentially expressed genes (DEG). The gene co-expression network was constructed using the EBcoexpress package. The GO enrichment analysis of the DEG in the co-expression network was carried out using the Database for Annotation, Visualisation, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (

0: Total RNA was isolated from TempusTM whole blood using the MagMAXTM for Stabilised Blood Tubes RNA Isolation Kit, compatible with TempusTM Blood RNA Tubes (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to manufacturers instructions.
1: Extraction batches were mixed for responders and non-responders in order to reduce technical bias.
2: Extracted RNA samples were treated with DNase to eliminate any potential genomic DNA contamination from downstream transcriptome measurement.
3: RNA was quantified using the Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and quality-assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer to generate an RNA integrity number (RIN; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

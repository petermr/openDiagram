0:  Protection effects of the essential oil from C. rotundus rhizomes on DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe 2+ and AAPH.
1: Lane 1, the native DNA; lane 2, the DNA treated with Fe 2+/AAPH; lane3, the DNA treated with Fe 2+/AAPH and solvent; lane 49, the DNA treated with the essential oil.
2: Different lowercase letters indicate statistically significant differences between the means ( p < 0.05) for essential oil of different concentration.
3: Different capital letters indicate statistically significant differences between the means of DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe 2+ and AAPH ( p < 0.05) for essential oil at the same concentration. )

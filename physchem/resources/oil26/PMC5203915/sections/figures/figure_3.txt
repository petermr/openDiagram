0:  The effect of Rhaponticum carthamoides HR and SGR essential oils on the expression of the inflammatory-related gene (IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF- ) in LPS-stimulated astrocytes.
1: mRNA expression levels were measured by RT-PCR analysis.
2: Astrocytes were incubated for 24 h with 100  g/mL of HR or SGR essential oils and LPS (1  g/mL).
3: (a) The bar graph shows the relative density.
4: The data is represented as means  SD of three independent experiments.
5: p< 0.05 versus LPS-treated cells.
6: (b) Lanes: 1: control; 2: cell incubated with SGR essential oil; 3: cell incubated with HR essential oil; 4: cell incubated with LPS; 5: cell incubated with SGR essential oil + LPS; 6: cell incubated with HR essential oil + LPS. )
7: )  Figure 3)

 </sup>, we examined the potential impact of RUNX1/RUNX1T1-dependent chromatin organization and transcription upon splicing events in more detail. Splice sites of diffEEJs were significantly enriched in the regions of open chromatin (marked by DNase I hypersensitivity sites and sites of H3K9Ac histone modification) and decelerated RNA pol II elongation compared to the splice sites of non-diffEEJs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Comparison of canonical splice sites with diffEEJs demonstrated a closer proximity of alternative 5’ splice sites (but not 3’ splice sites) to open chromatin regions, and sites bound by H3K9Ac and RNA pol II (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Similarly, alternative 5’ splice sites showed also a trend towards closer proximity to RUNX1/RUNX1T1 sites. These data suggest that splice sites of diffEEJs, which are occupied by H3K9Ac and RNA pol II, are controlled by RUNX1/RUNX1T1.

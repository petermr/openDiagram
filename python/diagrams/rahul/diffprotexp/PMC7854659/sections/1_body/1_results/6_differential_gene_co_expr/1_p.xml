<p id="Par11">To uncover the functional relationship between gene pairs across conditions, we applied a differential gene co-expression analysis for each tissue separately. From muscle, we identified 17,282 differentially co-expressed (DC) gene pairs (corresponding to 7,479 unique genes out of 11,439 tested; 
 <italic>q</italic> ≤ 0.05; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Among them, 101 and 91 genes were identified as DEGs and TFs, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the network of DC genes filtered by those gene pairs assigned either DEG or TF for muscle. We used the connectivity as a measure of centrality to select the genes topologically important in the network (“hubs”). Accordingly, 225 DC genes were identified as hubs (

 <italic>IGSF10</italic>, 
 <italic>ZBTB33</italic>, 
 <italic>CD2AP</italic>, 
 <italic>PLEKHG1</italic>, and 
 <italic>ZBTB1</italic>, and were associated with more than 120 genes in muscle. The DEGs were mainly differentially co-expressed with the genes 
 <italic>ZBTB33</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24), 
 <italic>IGSF10</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24), 
 <italic>HACD3</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16), and 
 <italic>ZNF131</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8). Interestingly, the co-expression of 
 <italic>ZBTB33</italic> and 
 <italic>ZNF131</italic> with the DEGs were classified as inversely correlated between the maternal diet groups based on the correlation classes proposed by the R-package DGCA

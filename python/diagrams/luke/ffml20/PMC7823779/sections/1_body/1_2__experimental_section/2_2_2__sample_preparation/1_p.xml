<p>Graphite oxide was prepared by the Hummers method [
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the brief process was showed as following. 3.5 g graphite was mixed with 120 mL concentrated sulfuric acid (H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, AR) in a flask. Then, 3.5 g sodium nitrate (NaNO
 <sub>3</sub>, AR) was added slowly. The temperature of the steps should be ensured under 10 °C and the solution needs to be stirred continuously. We added 15 g potassium permanganate (KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>, AR) into the mixture to induce a reaction for 4.5 h in 35 °C. Deionized water was used to dilute the solution and 40 mL hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, concentration 30%) was employed to react with the remaining KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>. Hydrochloric acid (HCl 1 mol/L) and acetone (CH
 <sub>3</sub>COCH
 <sub>3</sub> AR) was used to remove the inorganic impurities [

 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Then graphite oxide was obtained after drying in the vacuum oven. 1 g graphite oxide and 10 g NaNO
 <sub>3</sub> were ultrasonically dispersed in 150 mL of glacial acetic acid (CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH, AR). 70 mL concentrated H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> was dripped into the mixture under the ice bath. Then the temperature was raised to 45 °C, and the mixture was stirred for 6 h. The nitrated graphite was prepared after diluting, cleaning and drying.

<p>It might be assumed that the same types of precipitates are formed during isothermal soaking within similar temperature ranges. This is supported by the results published by Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="b14-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] for a similar alloy, 6063. At a isothermal temperature of 360 °C, they found rod-shaped precipitates with similar dimensions as we found for precipitation below 390 °C during continuous cooling in the alloy 6005A [

 <xref rid="b23-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] differentiate between inter- and intra-granular β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si for precipitation at high or low temperatures, respectively. The 10% line for precipitation published by Colley 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="b23-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] has its critical nose at about 360 °C after 20 s, which is very similar to our results.

0: Approaches to identify candidate genes that are responsible for the development of infectivity to mammalian hosts typically involve differential gene expression analysis between oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites [ 16,  17].
1: However, although these studies have successfully identified genes and proteins that are upregulated in the mammalian-infectious stage, the detection may be limited to annotated proteins [ 9] and open reading frames (ORFs) predicted using restrictive criteria such as a minimum length of 100 codons [ 18].

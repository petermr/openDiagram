 <sup>−/-</sup> mice used in this study are from different backgrounds: SV129 and C57BL/6, respectively. Several studies have shown mouse strain-related differences in susceptibility to infectious or sterile stimuli, such as

 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These differences were attributed to biased immune responses inherent to each mouse strain, and for ischemia-reperfusion, also to variations in cerebrovascular anatomy and hemodynamics. In a previous work by our group, we reported C57BL/6, SV129 and Balb/c mice had different degrees of susceptibility to SLEV infection [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which corroborate data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. Particularities in IFNγ-driven innate immune responses and in the activation of T and B lymphocytes may explain why wild-type C57BL/6 mice are more susceptible than SV129 when infected with SLEV.

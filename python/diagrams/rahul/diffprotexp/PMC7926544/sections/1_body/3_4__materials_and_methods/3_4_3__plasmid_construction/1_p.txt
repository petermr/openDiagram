0: The cDNA encoding mouse NKCC2 was fused at the C-terminal end of Myc (Myc- NKCC2) or EGFP (EGFP-NKCC2) using pCMV-Myc and pEGFP-C2 vectors, respectively [ 39].
1: The pcDNA3 plasmid encoding Myc-Hsp70 [ 46] was a kind gift from Jeffrey L Brodsky and Arohan R Subramanya (University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
2: The pEGFP-C1 plasmid encoding GFP-STCH [ 41] was a kind gift from Kyungpyo Park (Seoul National University and Dental Research Institute, Seoul, Korea).

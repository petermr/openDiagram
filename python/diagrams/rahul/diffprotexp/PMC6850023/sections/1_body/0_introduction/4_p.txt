0: We quantified changes in the proteome using liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) identifying proteins significantly upregulated, while growing on either linear alkanes (tetradecane,  nC 14) or pristane (the branched alkane 2,6,10,14Tetramethylpentadecane) looking at the key differences in the expression patterns on each substrate.

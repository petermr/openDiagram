0: The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of HR and SGR essential oils was evaluated by means of the twofold serial microdilution assay [ 18].
1: The essential oils dissolved in DMSO were diluted at concentrations ranging from 500 to 0.48  g/mL, with Mueller-Hinton broth medium for bacteria and 5000 to 4.88  g/mL with Sabouraud medium for yeasts.
2: The antimicrobial activity of the solvent DMSO was also evaluated.
3: Vancomycin (for Gram-positive bacteria), norfloxacin (for Gram-negative bacteria), and amphotericin B (for yeasts) were used as controls.
4: The MIC values, presented in  g/mL, were considered as the lowest concentration of the essential oils that inhibited the growth of the microorganisms, after 24 h of incubation at 37C.
5: The microbial growth was measured with an Absorbance Microplate Reader set to 620 nm (Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC).
6: Assays for each tested microorganism were carried out in triplicate.

0: Humans and our close primate relatives exhibit a striking array of phenotypic diversity despite sharing homologous proteins with nearly identical amino acid sequences ( King and Wilson, 1975).
1: Understanding how this diversity is propagated from genomic sequence to mRNA and then to protein necessitates an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that occur before, during, and after transcription.
2: Studying gene regulatory features in humans and other primates has long provided opportunities to understand genome evolution and function.
3: For example, studies comparing patterns of epigenetic marks in primates have provided mechanistic explanations that link genetic variation and divergence to differences in gene expression levels ( Banovich et al., 2014;  Cain et al., 2011;  McVicker et al., 2013;  Pai et al., 2011).
4: Although many studies have focused on inter-species differences in the regulation of gene expression, fewer studies have addressed isoform-level variation, which contributes to differences in mRNA, translation, and protein levels between species ( Blekhman et al., 2010;  Calarco et al., 2007;  Pai et al., 2016).

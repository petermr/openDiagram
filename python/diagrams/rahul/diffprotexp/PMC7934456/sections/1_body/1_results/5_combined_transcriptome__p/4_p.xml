<p id="Par29">Similarly, we used the 
 <italic>orf224</italic> protein of the sterility gene to verify the selected candidate genes. Previous studies have found that the sterility gene mainly interacted with pollen development and tapetum-related proteins; thus, we inferred that the sterility gene was mainly related to pollen development. The protein pathway related to tapetum development led to the occurrence of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS. Therefore, considering our results above, we propose a hypothesis to explain the mechanism of 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS’s occurrence and the role of gene restoration. When the restorer gene is a stealth gene, it will not interfere with the sterile gene’s function. Therefore, the 
 <italic>orf224</italic> protein would affect the proteins associated with the development of velvet cells or anther development in 
 <italic>B. napus,</italic> thus resulting in anther abortion in 
 <italic>pol</italic> CMS. When the restorer gene is dominant, as the restorer gene 
 <italic>Rfp</italic> cannot directly cut the mRNA transcript, the 
 <italic>Rfp</italic> gene will bind to the corresponding protein, which together causes the 
 <italic>atp6/orf226</italic> transcript to change; this causes 
 <italic>orf224</italic> to lose its toxic function, thereby restoring fertility.

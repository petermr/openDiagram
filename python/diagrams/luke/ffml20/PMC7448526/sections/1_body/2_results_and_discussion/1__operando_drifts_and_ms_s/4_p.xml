<p>It is evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> that the methyl rock band grows rapidly for the highest methanol loading zeolite and thereafter decreases gradually suggesting the occurrence of partial hydrolysis of methoxy species due to the presence of water, which is a result of the methoxylation reaction (eqn (1)), in the zeolite pores.
 <xref rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A similar observation is also reported by NMR and, significantly those methoxy species on ZSM-5 are not completely eroded on hydrolysis with water at room temperature unlike on Y and SAPO-34,
 <xref rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> implying the unique intrinsic nature of active acidic sites in ZSM-5. The evolution of the band is clearly hampered on decreasing the methanol loading from 8 to 2 molecules per acidic site and crucially no intensity gain of the band is observed for the lowest methanol loading of 1 molecule per acidic site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Based on this observation, the rate of methoxylation as a function of methanol loading is derived by following the rate of intensity gain of the methyl rock band at 1180 cm
 <sup>â€“1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>), for which the evolution of the band during the first 100 seconds is considered. The rate of methoxylation is 20 and 40 times faster for the zeolite with the highest methanol loading of 8 molecules per acidic site than that for the loadings of 4 and 2 molecules per acidic site, respectively. The occurrence of room temperature methoxylation is further corroborated with MS data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>) which show the evolution of water during the reaction. It is evident that the relative amount of water formed during the reaction decreases on decreasing the methanol loading from 8 to 2 molecules per acidic site and no water formation is observed for the lowest methanol loading of 1 molecule per acidic site, which is confirmed by the area under the MS profile as a function of methanol loading in the inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>. The rate of water formation is derived from the first 100 seconds of the reaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>), which is similar to that considered for the rate of methyl rock band evolution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). As expected, the rate of water formation is 2 and 12 times faster for the highest methanol loading zeolite than that for the 4 and 2 molecules per acidic sites, respectively. The relative rates derived from DRIFTS and MS are at least an order of magnitude faster for the highest methanol loading zeolite than that for the zeolite with a loading of 2 molecules per acidic site and confirm the loading dependent room temperature methoxylation in zeolite H-ZSM-5.

 <caption> Comparison of the elastic constant C 33 predicted by ( a) PR, ( b) DT, ( c) RF, ( d) SVM (with RBF kernel), ( e) k-NN, ( f) GPR (with Matern kernel), ( g) GPR (with RBF kernel) and ( h) NN with measured values computed by MD simulation. The error bars shown for each value represent the standard deviation around the mean values. </caption>

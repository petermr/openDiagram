0: In light of this, the study presented herein was focused on analyzing transcriptomics of pineal gland in STH sheep with  FecBBB (MM) and  FecB++ (ww) genotypes, to determine the DE lncRNAs and genes, and predict their potential function that related to reproduction.
1: Which is essential for better understanding the molecular mechanisms by lncRNAs regulate sheep reproduction with different genotypes, also providing insight for other female mammals.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as a spectrum of chronic liver disorders caused by irregular accumulation of fat in liver tissue which results in steatosis, inflammation, and in severe cases, cirrhosis. NAFLD is categorized into two main types including simple steatosis (fatty liver) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The former is usually considered as a benign condition, whereas the latter has severe complications such as inflammation, hepatocellular injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p>

 <caption> CPSF1 promotes alternative polyadenylation in the 3′UTR. (A) Scatterplot showing the percentage of distal polyA site usage index (PDUI) in the control and CPSF1-silenced groups identified by DaPars. Lengthened and shortened transcripts are highlighted with red and blue dots, respectively. (B) In the filtered transcripts (differential transcripts), the AAUAAA and AUUAAA polyadenylation signals were highly enriched upstream of the distal compared to the proximal polyadenylation sites following CPSF1 silencing. (C) Correlation between PDUI value and gene expression of control and CPSF1-silenced groups. (D) Genome browser plots showing the RNA-seq read coverage in representative genes regulated by CPSF1 with 3′ UTR lengthening (REEP5) or shortening (SLC9B2). Red box on the gene body indicates proximal polyadenylation sites predicted by DaPars. (E) Heatmap of PDUI showed the clustering of transcripts with both significantly altered mRNA expression and PDUI. (F) CPSF1-regulated transcripts are significantly associated with gene transcription, the endomembrane system, and cytoskeleton maintenance. Blue indicates downregulated, whereas red represents upregulated transcripts. </caption>

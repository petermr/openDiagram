<p id="p0065">The thermal expansion curve and CCT curve were used to analyze the phase transition and cracking susceptibility of continuous casting slab for production of high-alloy steels. The thermal expansion curve was measured at a slow cooling rate less than 0.1 K/s, while the CCT curve was figured co-related with practical cooling condition above 0.1 K/s. These two experiments together would provide overall information on the cracking susceptibility.</p>

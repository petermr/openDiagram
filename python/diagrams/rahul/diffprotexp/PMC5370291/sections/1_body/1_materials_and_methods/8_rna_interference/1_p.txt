0: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was applied to knockdown the expression of HSP70 in HepG2 cells.
1: Specific siRNA against HSP70 and the non-specific negative control were obtained from Qiagene (Hilden, Germany) and prepared according to manufacturer's instructions, and dissolved in siRNA suspension buffer at concentration of 20 M as previously described  10.
2: The HSP70 siRNA was transfected into HepG2 cells with T-Pro NTR II reagent (Ji-Feng Biotechnology CO., Ltd. Taiwan) to obtain high knockdown efficiency.
3: Control non-silencing siRNA (sense 5'-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTdT -3', antisense 5'-ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA AdTdT-3').
4: HSP70 siRNA targeting [2 lines pooled, HSP70(a), sense 5'-CCA UUG AGG AGG UAG AUU ATT-3', antisense 5'-GTG GUA ACU CCU CCA UCU AAU-3', and HSP70(b), sense 5'-GUU ACU UCA AAG UAA AUA ATT-3', antisense 5'-ACC AAU GAA GUU UCA UUU AUU-3'].

<p>To further identify genes affected by RSV in the treatment of breast cancer, the RNA of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with an optimal concentration for RNA sequencing were extracted. The results of the differentially expressed genes analysis (

  <bold>Figure 3A</bold>
 </xref>) showed that compared to MDA-MB-231 cells without RSV treatment, 8,527 DEGs in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with RSV were present. Additionally, compared to control samples, the BRCA samples had 16,241 DEGs. After comparison, 6,487 DEGs were identified as TNBC genes affected by RSV (

 </xref>). Furthermore, apoptosis-related proteins (PARP1, PCNA, and BCL-2) were detected, and POLD1 and PARP1 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the optimal concentration of RSV verified the mechanism of TNBC cell apoptosis. Western Blot (

 <caption> Characteristics of carrot transcripts. ( A) Distribution of coding, noncoding and structural sequences between the known and newly annotated transcripts. ( B) Conservation of the known and newly predicted protein-coding and non-coding transcripts. ( C) Transcript length distributions for the total coding, noncoding and structural RNAs. ( D) Number of exons per transcript for the total coding and noncoding RNAs. ( E) Proportional distribution of the total coding, noncoding and structural RNAs along each chromosome. ( F) Violin plot of the expression levels of carrot total coding and noncoding RNAs. The y-axis represents the average log2 of normalized count values. t-test p value &lt; 0.01 is considered to be significantly different. </caption>

0: Two strategies are routinely employed in current proteomics-based approaches for biomarker discovery [ 1].
1: The first characterizes differential protein expression patterns by comparing serum/plasma from animal models or patients with samples from normal controls.
2: The second compares diseased tissues/cells with their normal counterparts.
3: Despite the unique advantages of the first strategy, the extremely complexity of blood presents a significant challenge for the detection of useful potential biomarkers [ 1, 2].
4: Disease-specific proteins can be characterized relatively more easily by the second strategy.
5: However, most of these proteins remain within the cell and do not enter the bloodstream, which makes them unavailable for measurement via routine blood assays in a clinical setting.

<p id="Par56">Nevertheless, there are still some limitations to the present study. First, the data used in this study were mainly from Western countries and lacked data from the Asian population. Second, the number of normal cases was relatively small, and a larger number of paired samples are needed for further analysis. Third, the multiple sources of the online verification data need to be further confirmed by homogeneous research samples and systematic experimental studies. For example, although the immunohistochemistry data were extracted from The Human Protein Atlas (THPA) to verify the upregulation of the identified genes in CRC at the protein level, the exact molecular mechanisms involving these hub genes have not been experimentally investigated in the present study. In addition, we observed opposing PLAU expression patterns at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>), which is inconsistent with previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Taken together, further experimental studies based on a larger sample size are needed to verify our hypotheses.

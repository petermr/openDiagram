0: We conducted a PERMANOVA based on Bray-Curtis distances of normalized counts (1000 permutations) using the adonis2 function in the R package vegan [ 64] to determine whether prenatal treatment or average aggression score explained significant variation in transcriptome-wide gene expression patterns in each tissue.
1: We then performed a negative binomial generalized linear model with a local dispersion fit to determine differential gene expression within each tissue using DESeq2.
2: Treatment was the fixed effect for each gene and we calculated per-gene Wald test statistics to identify significant differences.
3: P-values were corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg corrections and FDR  0.10 (the default in DESeq2) were considered differentially expressed.
4: Furthermore, because we had 3 biological replicates per treatment, we applied a log2 fold change cutoff of 0.5 (absolute value) based on recommendations in Schurch et al.
5: [ 65].

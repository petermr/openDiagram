<p>As expected, the results presented here contrast with previous reports of miRNA expression profiles already obtained under discrete stages of melanoma progression. For example, miR-211-5p in this experimental model is over-expressed by the exposure to L-Tyr; in contrast, during tumor progression, miR-211-5p tends to decrease [

 <xref rid="B58-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For the let-7a family members, under-expressed in both L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU or let-7b overexpressed in 5-Brd-2′-dU and reported as a cell cycle regulator in melanoma, possibly through

These findings agree with the notion that some miRNAs are known to participate in tumor progression as a tumor suppressor, oncomiRs, or miRs and may involve a possible reversible tumor reprogramming mechanism through their targets, in processes that include cell proliferation, senescence, and melanogenesis.

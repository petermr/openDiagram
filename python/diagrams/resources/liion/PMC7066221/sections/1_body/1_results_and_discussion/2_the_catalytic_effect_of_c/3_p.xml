<p id="p0100">To further reveal the role of cobalt components, a home-made electrolyzer cell with a two-electrode configuration was designed (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S9</xref>A). A stainless-steel (SS) electrode or a Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>-coated SS electrode (denoted as SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>, preparation setup shown in 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S10</xref>) was used as the working electrode. A Zn plate was used as both the reference and the counter electrode. A larger quantity (10 mL) of the electrolyte with the same composition (2 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> + 0.2 M MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>) was used. An LSV scan from 1.0 to 2.3 V (oxidizing process) was applied to the SS electrode and SS-Co(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> electrode.

 </xref>. RNA sequencing was used to observe the changes of POLD1, other apoptosis-related pathways and factors in MDA-MB-231 under RSV treatment. Additionally, genes and pathways related to POLD1â€™s potential role were analyzed, and changes in the transcription and translation levels of POLD1 and its related genes were verified. Subsequently, 
 <italic>via</italic> ectopic expression of POLD1, the role of POLD1 in RSV-mediated breast cancer cell apoptosis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were further explored. The obtained results suggested that RSV may promote apoptosis of TNBC cells by reducing the expression of POLD1 to activate the apoptotic pathway, which may be a potential mechanism pertaining to its anticancer effects on TNBC.

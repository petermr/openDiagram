0: Both wild type and RGE-treated  D. melanogaster (21 d old, about 20 flies each) were resuspended in 600 L lysis buffer (7M Urea, 2M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)).
1: Bullet Blender (Next Advance, Averill Park, NY, USA) was used to break the tissue as described previously  [13].
2: Supernatants were collected after sharking in ice for 2 h and centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4C for 10 min.
3: Concentrations of proteins were detected using the  RC DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
4: The protein samples were purified using the 2D Cleanup kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.
5: Experiments in this study were performed in triplicate gels ( n = 3).

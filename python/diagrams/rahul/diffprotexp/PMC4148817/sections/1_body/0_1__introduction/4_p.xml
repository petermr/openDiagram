<p>The Calu-3 cells mimic the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> serous cells in that they form an epithelium that secretes a layer of mucous that covers the apical surface. An additional characteristic in common with the serous cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is that the Calu-3 cell line has cell junctions that serve a barrier function, protecting the internal milieu from the external milieu. Trans Epithelial Electric Resistance (TEER), which consists of paracellular and transcellular resistances, is used as a measurement of the barrier function of epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B8-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The formation of an intact, confluent cellular monolayer can be verified by an increase in TEER. We have previously shown a decrease in TEER of confluent monolayers after exposure to CNTs for 24 or 48 h. The decrease in barrier function in response to CNT exposure was manifested after exposure to the same, low concentration (100 ng/mL) that we have used in the current studies. The magnitude of the decrease indicated a disruption of the barrier function but no loss of cellular viability [
 <xref rid="B9-proteomes-01-00219" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the case of cell death, the confluent monolayer would have “holes” and it would be impossible to maintain a measureable transepithelial resistance. Thus, the TEER value is a more sensitive measure of cellular viability than most biochemical assays.

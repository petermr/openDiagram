0: DTT was added to 200 g of protein solution collected from each sample to reach a final concentration of 100 mM, and the samples were incubated in a water bath at 100 C for 5 min.
1: UA buffer (200 L) was then added, and the samples were mixed and transferred to a 30 kD ultrafiltration centrifuge tube.
2: The samples were centrifuged at 12,500  g for 25 min, and the filtrate was discarded (this step was repeated twice).
3: IAA buffer (100 L; 100 mM IAA in UA) was then added, and the samples were shaken at 600 rpm for 1 min.
4: The samples were allowed to react at room temperature for 30 min in the dark and then centrifuged at 12,500  g for 25 min.
5: UA buffer (100 L) was then added, and the samples were centrifuged at 12,500  g for 15 min (this step was repeated twice).
6: Then, 40 mM NH 4HCO 3 (100 L) was added, and the samples were centrifuged at 12,500  g for 15 min (this step was repeated twice).
7: Trypsin buffer (40 L; 4 g of trypsin in 40 L of 40 mM NH 4HCO 3) was then added, and the samples were shaken at 600 rpm for 1 min and placed at 37 C for 1618 h. The collection tube was replaced, and the samples were centrifuged at 12,500g for 15 min followed by the addition of 20 L of 40 mM NH 4HCO 3 and centrifugation at 12,500g for 15 min to collect the filtrate.
8: A C18 cartridge was used to desalt the peptides.
9: After the peptides were dried, they were reconstituted with 40 L of 0.1% formic acid solution.

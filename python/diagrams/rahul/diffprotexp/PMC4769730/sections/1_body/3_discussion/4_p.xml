<p>On the other hand, the increase of IL7 might be explained with the IL7 ability to counteract the TGFβ
 <sub>1</sub> activity, as observed in other in vitro models [

By contrary, the high IL10 expression is actually missing of explanation, although in experimental models of fibrosis the IL10 triggered (i) the anti-inflammatory response through the inhibition of TNFα, IL1, IL6, IL8, IL12, MIP1α and MIP2α release from monocytes/macrophages (anti-inflammatory response), (ii) the macrophage activity (down-regulating response MMPs/TGFβ
 <sub>1</sub>) and (iii) the up-regulation of TIMPs [

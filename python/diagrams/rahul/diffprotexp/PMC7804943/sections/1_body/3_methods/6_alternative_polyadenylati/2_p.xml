<p id="Par42">To further filter events for MOFA analysis (see below), the following steps were performed. First, genes with total expression of at least 3 transcripts per million (TPM) in 22 or more (out of 24) samples were retained. This ensures that genes are expressed in the majority of samples studied. Second, these genes were further filtered for those whose proximal 3′ UTR is expressed by at least 1 TPM in six or more samples. This ensures that there are examples of APA where the proximal 3′ UTR is expressed (in comparison to other samples). Finally, we filtered for 3′ UTRs with a |∆PPAU| &gt; 20 between one or more pairs of cell types, where ∆PPAU is defined as the difference between the median PPAU of two cell types.</p>

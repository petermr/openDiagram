<p>The common 5314 DEGs showed 3224 enrichment terms overall. The enrichment list showed 92 enrichment terms related to differentiation processes, including neuron, chondrocyte, osteoblast, macrophage, myeloid, and various immune and progenitor cells. Interestingly, among enrichments, GO terms fat cell differentiation (GO:0045444, 108 genes) and brown fat cell differentiation (GO:0050873, 32 genes) were most significantly present. Further filtering of enrichment terms was performed with focused terms relevant to fat cells and adipose tissue (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Four additional GO terms related to fat cell and adipose development were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>), including adipose tissue development (GO:0060612, 18 genes), regulation of fat cell differentiation (GO:0045598, 41 genes), positive regulation of fat cell differentiation (GO:0045600, 22 genes), and negative regulation of fat cell differentiation (GO:0045599, 10 genes) (top panel: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). MEFD3plu/MEF3min unique DEGs also relevant enrichments towards fat development including regulation of fat cell differentiation (GO:0045598,21 genes; Table S1), positive regulation of fat cell differentiation (GO:0045600, 11 genes; Table S2), and fat cell differentiation (GO:0045444, 26 genes; Table S3) (lower panel: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>). Whereas MEFD5plu/MEFD5min unique DEGs, constrictively showed enrichments towards brown fat cells including positive regulation of brown fat cell differentiation (GO:0090336, 2 genes; Table S4), regulation of brown fat cell differentiation (GO:0090335, 2 genes; Table S5), and brown fat cell differentiation (GO:0050873, 2 genes; Table S6) (middle panel: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>). Given that the common DEGs showed relevant enrichment terms as opposed to unique DEGs. Thus, the former was further analysed.

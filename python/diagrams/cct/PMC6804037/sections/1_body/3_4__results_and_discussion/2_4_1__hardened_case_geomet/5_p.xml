<p>The influence of pulse width on the depth, width, and hardened layer angle is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f008">Figure 8</xref>aâ€“c, respectively. Increasing the pulse width led to increases in the depth and hardened layer angle. When the pulse width increased, the laser energy increased. Therefore, more heat was transmitted to the sample surface. This phenomenon caused a larger hardened area (see Equations (2) and (3)).

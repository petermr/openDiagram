<p>Increasing the content of ι-carrageenan determines the formation of crystalline regions with higher dimensions (85 μm average diameter for PC5 and 120 μm for PC12), compared to PVA and CAR. This behavior seems to confirm the macromolecular entanglement of the two components. Since the crystalline domains act as junction regions and spacers, basically defining the hydrogels’ network, the larger the individual junction regions, the higher the water sorption capacity.</p>

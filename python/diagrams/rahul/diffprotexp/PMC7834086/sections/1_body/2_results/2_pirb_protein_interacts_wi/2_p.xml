<p>To examine the interaction between PirB and histone H4 (
 <italic>Pv</italic>histone H4) in shrimp hemocytes, His-tagged 
 <italic>Pv</italic>histone H4 was cloned, expressed, and the recombinant protein (His-rhistone H4) analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A single protein band (molecular weight ~30 kDa) was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3a</xref>). Next, GST pull-down and Far-Western blot analysis were applied to determine the interaction between GST-rPirB and His-rhistone H4. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3b</xref>, the GST pull-down results revealed that His-rhistone H4 could interact with GST-rPirB, but not rGST. Similarly, the Far-Western blot results showed that His-rhistone H4 could bind to GST-rPirB, but not rGST (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3c</xref> (i)), with His-rhistone H4 also capable of binding to rPirB, but not BSA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3c</xref> (ii)). In view of the fact that the mass spectrometry results revealed a possible interaction of PirB with histone H4 and histone H3, we speculated that PirB could bind to histone proteins. To further confirm the interaction between PirB and histones, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells nucleosome proteins (due to unavailability of shrimp cell lines) were purified using molecular sieve gel chromatography and ascertained by SDS-PAGE, Native-PAGE and Western blot analysis. A single nucleosome protein was obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4a-C</xref>), which indicates that the purified product could be used for subsequent experiments. Next, the purified nucleosomes were treated with His-rPirA or His-rPirB, before being resolved on Native-PAGE and then blotted onto PVDF membranes, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-histone H3 antibody. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4d</xref>, the purified nucleosomes could bind with His-rPirB, but not His-rPirA, in a concentration-dependent manner. When the nucleosome proteins were treated with His-rPirB, their interaction caused a change in the position of nucleosome proteins on Native-PAGE, with no change observed in His-rPirA treated or untreated groups. These results demonstrate that PirB could specifically bind to histones.

<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate a variety of developmental and physiological processes. Many of them have specific developmental and cell type-specific expression patterns. It is estimated that 30% of miRNAs are involved in the regulation of endogenous gene expression, thus, they play an important role in various biological processes. Specifically, miRNAs directly regulate the expression of milk component coding genes, cell differentiation and proliferation [

Therefore, in order to understand better the relationship between arginine supply and lactation functions of the mammary gland, we hypothesized that arginine may regulate functional genes associated with lactation and mammary tissue development by regulating the expression of miRNAs. The aim of this study was to increase the supply of arginine and determine the distribution of miRNA in the mammary gland at the end of lactation. In addition, histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes associated with arginine supply and changes in miRNA profile.

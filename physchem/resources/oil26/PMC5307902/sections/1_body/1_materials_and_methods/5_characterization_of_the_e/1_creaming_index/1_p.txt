0: The creaming rate was determined experimentally by the measurement of the creaming index (CI) from Eq.2.
1: The CI values were obtained from the ratio between the total height of cream layer (CC) and the total height of emulsion layer (CT).
2: CC and CT were measured directly into a storage glass flask with the help of a graduate scale.

<p>The essential oil was characterized by physical-chemical analyses for density, refractive index, 90% ethanol solubility, color, appearance, and identification by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection. The emulsions were prepared following a hydrophile-lipophile balance [HLB] spreadsheet design from two nonionic surfactants (Span 80
   <sup>&#174;</sup> and Tween 20
   <sup>&#174;</sup>) producing HLB values ranging from 4.3 to 16.7. The products were stored at room temperature at 5&#176;C. The emulsion stabilities were tested both in the long and short-term.

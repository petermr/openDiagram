<p>Western blotting was used to assess protein PTMs in trophozoite lysates of each MtzS and MtzR isogenic line (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Overall, these PTM blots (phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination) changed in both the appearance of new modified protein features in MtzR lines, as well as increases in intensity (abundance) of modified protein features in MtzR lines compared to MtzS parents (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Total acetylated lysine (KAc) increased in all 3 MtzR lines compared to the MtzS parents. This included the appearance of multiple new KAc-modified protein features in MtzR lines, particularly in the 713-MtzR line. Four common protein bands (3: approximately 70–100 KDa; 1: approximately25–50 KDa) with detectable KAc increased in intensity in all MtzR lines; albeit the smallest of the 4 bands was more highly expressed in 106- and 713-MtzR. Another 3 bands (approximately 25–50KDa) with detected KAc increased in 713-MtzR. Mono-methylated lysine (K-MMe) also increased overall in all 3 MtzR lines, but most changes were unique to 1 or observed in 2 of the 3 lines. Presumptive histone proteins H3 (approximately 17kDa) and H4 (approximately 11kDa) were detected by anti-KAc antibodies at the same molecular weight and pattern as previously detected by anti-KAc in enriched fractions [

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and subsequent immunoblotting with Anti-H3 and Anti-H4 showed that the modified protein bands at approximately 17 and approximately 11KDa in KAc and K-MMe blots aligned with antibodies for these histone variants (

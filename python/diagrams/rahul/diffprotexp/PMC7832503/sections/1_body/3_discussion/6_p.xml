<p>There exist limitations in our study. First, the sample size we used in this study was relatively small. The number of samples limited the statistical power of the analysis performed in this study. Another limitation is that the age distribution was not normal. Most patients were aged under 13 years old, but there was no distinct bias between the severe and mild patient groups. In fact, this is also consistent with the feature that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 caused more severe morbidity and mortality in children and young adults. Therefore, the range of our results may be limited in explaining the severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection mechanism.</p>

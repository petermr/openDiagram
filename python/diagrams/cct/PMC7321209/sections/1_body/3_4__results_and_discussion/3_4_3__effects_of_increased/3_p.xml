<p>In the next step of the investigations, wall structures with a length of 160 mm and 70 layers were manufactured to analyze process behavior and near net shape quality on large volume work pieces. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f011">Figure 11</xref> exemplarily shows the resulting work pieces for a CTWD of 12 mm (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f011">Figure 11</xref>a), 28 mm (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f011">Figure 11</xref>b) and 44 mm (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f011">Figure 11</xref>c). On these structures, microstructure and material hardness were tested additionally (compare Chapter 4.4). Therefore, the applied parameters were economically set to reduce processing time. The experimental trials were carried out with a welding velocity of 0.4 m/min, a voltage of 20 V and a wire feed of 5 m/min. The welding current as well as the energy input per unit length depend on the adjusted CTWD and varied from 4.23 (CTWD = 12 mm) to 2.82 kJ/cm (CTWD = 44 mm). The increase in CTWD from 12 to 44 mm led to a reduction of energy input per unit length of 34% (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The interlayer temperature was set to 100 Â°C between the deposited layers.

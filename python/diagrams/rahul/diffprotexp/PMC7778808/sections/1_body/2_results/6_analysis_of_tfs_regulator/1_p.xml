<p id="Par39">To further study the molecules that regulate 10 hub genes and three immune differential genes S100A12, NR1D2 and CD3G, this study screened the potential regulatory relationship between TFs and DEGs based on the data provided on ChEA, and predicted TFs that can regulate the expression of hub genes and immune differential genes. It was found that MYC, SOX2, XRN2, E2F1, SPI1, CREM and CREB1 can regulate the expression of these 13 genes (Fig.

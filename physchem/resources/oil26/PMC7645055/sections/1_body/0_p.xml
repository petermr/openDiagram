<p>Many organisms are adapted to endure substantial seasonal fluctuations in one or several environmental parameters. Recently, organisms across the globe also have to deal with accelerated climate change that is characterized by both a slow increase in mean temperature and increased frequency of extreme weather events (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To predict how this will affect wildlife, there is a need to understand how ecology and physiology have evolved to match the demands of an animal's current range. This Research Topic is comprised of both primary research and reviews that provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in mechanistic and eco-evolutionary aspects of how animals cope with changing environments. Studies range over molecular, cellular, and organismal levels of enquiry and from individual animals to populations of mammals, birds, and selected ectotherms. Collectively, the Research Topic covers three main aspects of how animals respond to environmental fluctuations: (i) seasonal expression and evolution of hypometabolism and heterothermy; (ii) metabolic responses to climate change in dry, energy-limited, or hypoxic environments; and (iii) thermal sensitivity of individuals during development and its potential lifelong effects.

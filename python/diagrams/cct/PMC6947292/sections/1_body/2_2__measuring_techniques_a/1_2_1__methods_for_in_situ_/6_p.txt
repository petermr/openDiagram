0: Positron lifetime spectroscopy [ 95, 96] can be utilised to investigate the precipitation processes in age-hardening Al alloys [ 96, 97, 98, 99, 100].
1: However, since the recording of single data points takes at least a few minutes (and up to some hours if the spectra are to be decomposed), this technique would be very slow for in situ cooling experiments [ 101].
2: This is probably one reason why no in situ cooling experiments have been published, to the knowledge of the authors.

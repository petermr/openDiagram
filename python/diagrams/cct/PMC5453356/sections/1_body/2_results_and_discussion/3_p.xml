<p>For the high temperature range between 450 °C and 430 °C, the maximum peak value is located at 440 °C after about 370 s (

Within the high-temperature range, the differences between the heat flows curves are relatively small. The interpretation, therefore, must be carried out with care. To enable the reader to see the differences between the single curves, an additional diagram with different scaling is inserted into

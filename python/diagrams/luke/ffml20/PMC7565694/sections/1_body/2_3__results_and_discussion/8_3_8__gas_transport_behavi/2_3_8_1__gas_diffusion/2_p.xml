<p>The log(MSD) of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PI systems was plotted as a function of time in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02048-f013">Figure 13</xref>. The diffusion coefficient was then calculated by the Einstein’s equation in the normal diffusion regime, where the slope of the log(MSD) vs. log(
 <italic>t</italic>) curve was unity [
 <xref rid="B50-polymers-12-02048" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The obtained diffusion coefficients are listed in 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02048-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The diffusion coefficients of O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O in the three PI matrices decreased in the order: Kapton ˃ 2,7-CPPI ˃ 2,7-CPI, which was consistent with the free volumes and chain mobility results. The 2,7-CPI had small 
 <italic>FFV</italic>, poor cavities connectivity, and low chains mobility, which restricted the diffusion of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub> and resulted in the lowest diffusion coefficients. The high 
 <italic>FFV</italic>, good cavities connectivity, and high chains mobility of Kapton facilitated the gas diffusion. As for a particular PI matrix, H
 <sub>2</sub>O presented lower diffusion coefficient compared with O
 <sub>2</sub>. Although the kinetic diameter of H
 <sub>2</sub>O was smaller, its diffusivity was lower than that of O
 <sub>2</sub>. This could be due to the strong interaction between polar H
 <sub>2</sub>O and PI matrix [

 <sub>2</sub>O.

<p>Based on the biological analysis of differential proteins in serum and urine, the protein changes in serum and urine were similar, indicating that the biological processes of blood and urine were interrelated and consistent. In the CC analysis, the changes in urine vesicles in the lung cancer group were more pronounced compared to those in the blood. The results of serum and urine are partially consistent, but urine and serum also have unique characteristics, so the combination provides a better reference for the selection of biomarkers. In summary, these differentiated proteins may be potential diagnostic markers for lung adenocarcinoma and may serve as a basis for the early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Further research is required to verify the experimental results.</p>

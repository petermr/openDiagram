<p>To find the mRNAs that were involved in LINC00466/miR-137 regulation of glioma activity, integrated bioinformatical analysis (miRTarBase, TargetScan and mirDIP) were used to find genes. We identified 2 potential miR-137 target mRNAs, PPP1R14B and EZH2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5A</xref>). Of which, PPP1R14B were high expression in tumor tissue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">D</xref>). The survival analysis showed that the survival time of patients with high expression of PPP1R14B was significantly lower than that of patients with low expression of PPP1R14B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5C</xref>). TargetScan database was employed and found that there existed potential binding site of miR-137 on PPP1R14B 3Ê¹UTR. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay illustrated that up-regulation of miR-137 could inhibit the luciferase activity of PPP1R14B-WT but had no impact on PPP1R14B-MUT, suggesting miR-137 could target PPP1R14B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5E</xref>). RIP assay confirmed the interaction between PPP1R14B and miR-137 in T98G cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, we detected the effect of LINC00466 and miR-137 on the expression level of PPP1R14B in T98G cell lines, showing that PPP1R14B was significantly increased in cells upon overexpression of LINC00466. The PPP1R14B was significantly decreased in cells upon overexpression of miR-137 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5G</xref>). These results showed that LINC00466 was very likely to competitively bind to miR-137 with PPP1R14B to regulate occurrence and development of glioma.

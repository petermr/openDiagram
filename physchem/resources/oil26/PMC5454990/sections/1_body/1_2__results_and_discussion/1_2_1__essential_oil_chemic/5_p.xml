<p>The EO of 
 <italic>O. cujumary</italic> leaves (
 <bold>Cuj-L</bold>) was rich in β-caryophyllene (22.2%) and caryophyllene oxide (12.4%), followed by 2-tridecanone (7.3%) and δ-cadinene (6.6%). However, the EO of the branches (
 <bold>Cuj-B</bold>) was dominated by 2-tridecanone (30.0%), limonene (20.5%), and β-caryophyllene (8.1%). The occurrence of fatty acid derivatives such as 2-tridecanone in Lauraceae species is not very common. However, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and δ-cadinene were the main compounds of the EO oil from leaves of

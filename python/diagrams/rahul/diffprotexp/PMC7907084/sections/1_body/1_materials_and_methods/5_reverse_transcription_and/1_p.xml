<p id="Par12">For reverse transcription, oligodeoxythymide (0.5 μg) and total RNA (2 μg) were mixed in a total volume of 5 μL, and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, then cooled at 4 °C for 2 min. 1 μL single strand buffer, 0.5 μL each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.5 μg oligo-deoxythymidine, and 100U moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were then added to the reaction mix in a total volume of 10μL. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed at 42 °C for 90 min. The total reaction mix containing the first-strand cDNA was diluted ten times by the addition of 90 μL Milli-Q water and stored − 20 °C freezer for downstream application.</p>

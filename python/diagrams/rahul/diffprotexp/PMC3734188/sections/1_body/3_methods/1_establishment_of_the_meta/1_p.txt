0: Walker-256 tumor cells were derived from rat mammary gland carcinosarcomas.
1: These cells have been widely used in cancer studies [ 7- 9].
2: In the present study, a model of liver metastasis was generated via inoculation of Walker-256 tumor cells into the spleens of male SpragueDawley (SD) rats, as described previously [ 10].
3: The control rats were subjected to the same surgical procedure as the model rats but were injected with saline solution instead of the tumor cells.
4: This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
5: The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use & Welfare Committee of Institute of Basic Medical Sciences (Permit Number: ACUC-A02-2011-046).
6: All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

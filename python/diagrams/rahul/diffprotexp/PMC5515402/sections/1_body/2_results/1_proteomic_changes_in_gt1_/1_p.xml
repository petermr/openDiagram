<p>To investigate the effect of a supraphysiological dose of AAS in the proteome of GT1-7 cells, we used 2D-DIGE analyses in extracts from vehicle and 17α-meT treated cells. Before examining the proteome, we first demonstrated that 17α-meT at 1 μM did not affect cell viability at 48 h (Control: 92.07 ± 0.012; 17α-meT: 92.82 ± 0.013; p = 0.703, unpaired t-test). Likewise, there were no AAS-induced apoptosis as indicated by caspase activity assays. Values of relative luminescence units for caspase 3 were: Control: 6.5 X 10
 <sup>6</sup> ± 2.99 X 10
 <sup>5</sup>; 17α-meT: 6.99 X 10
 <sup>6</sup> ± 1.29 X 10
 <sup>5</sup>; t
 <sub>6</sub> = 1.527; p = 0.177; unpaired t-test. Values of relative fluorescence units for caspase 9 were: Control: 468.21 ± 31.54; 17α-meT: 464.61 ± 22.02; t
 <sub>5</sub> = 0.097; p = 0.926, unpaired t-test.

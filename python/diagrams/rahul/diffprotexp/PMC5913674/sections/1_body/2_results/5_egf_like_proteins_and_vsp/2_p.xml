<p>Overall, a nonredundant total of 36 VSPs (defined according to Adam et al. [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) were identified in all 3 tenplexes, with fold change quantified in 23, 25, and 18 variants between MtzR and MtzS lines of WB, 106, and 713, respectively. The VSP gene family possessed the largest proportion of DEPs among 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> gene families, with 47.8%, 36.0%, and 77.8% of VSPs differentially expressed in WB, 106, and 713-MtzR lines, respectively. Furthermore, the majority of differentially expressed VSPs were in the top 10 upregulated or downregulated proteins in terms of fold change, specifically, 9 of 11 VSPs in WB-MtzR were among the top DEGs, as were 7 of 9 in 106-MtzR and 9 of 13 in 713-MtzR. Although MtzR lines showed these similar trends in overall VSP differential expression, common specific VSP variants were limited between MtzR lines (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, panel B), with only 2 common differentially expressed genes: VSP-123 (upregulated in all MtzR lines) and VSP-25 (upregulated in 106 and 713-MtzR and downregulated in WB-MtzR). Furthermore, MtzR lines also varied in directionality of differential expression (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, panel C), with the majority of VSPs downregulated in WB-MtzR, upregulated in 713-MtzR, and dispersed between upregulated and downregulated in 106-MtzR. Overall, although the expressed VSP complement of MtzR lines differed from their parent MtzS lines, cluster analysis also revealed divergences between MtzR lines as well (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, panel C).

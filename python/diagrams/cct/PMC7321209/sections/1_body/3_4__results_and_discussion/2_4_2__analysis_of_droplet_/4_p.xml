<p>The described correlation between short circuit frequency (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and droplet volume (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f007">Figure 7</xref>) with systematically varied CTWD is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f008">Figure 8</xref>. To determine the mean droplet size, high-speed camera recordings were analyzed and droplet diameters measured shortly before the transition into the melt pool on five consecutive droplets. The wire width served as a reference for the measurements in the 2-dimensional images. The short circuit frequency was determined on the basis of the number of current peaks, respectively voltage drops for a period of one second during the welding process. In the short arc welding regime the number of short circuits equaled the number of droplet transfers into the melt pool.

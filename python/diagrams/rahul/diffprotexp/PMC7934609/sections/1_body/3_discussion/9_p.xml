<p>Casein kinase (CK) is a conserved silk/threonine protein kinase of eukaryotes, which is involved in the regulation of a variety of important cellular processes [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], including the wnt (Wingless-Type MMTV integration site family) signaling pathway, membrane transport, and cytoskeleton maintenance [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recent studies have found that CK1 gene expression is related to parasite infections, like 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and 
 <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Highly expressed CK1 inhibitors can inhibit the proliferation of flagellates and trypanosomes in the blood of the host. Studies have shown that the high expression of CK has a positive regulatory effect on the immune escape of parasites [

 </sup> In this work, we computationally examined the ACE2 usage of SARS-CoV-2 for 285 vertebrates by modeling the binding energy between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) and host ACE2. The binding data correlate well with the reported experimental studies, perfectly distinguishing the effective ACE2 receptors from the less effective ones. Our results reveal that many mammals could serve as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. This work presents a fast and reliable computational approach to screen potential animal hosts for further experimental analyses.

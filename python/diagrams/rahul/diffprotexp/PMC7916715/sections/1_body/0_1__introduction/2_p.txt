0: Contactin 1 (CNTN1) is an Ig-like neural cell adhesion protein [ 21]; it plays an important role in the central nervous system through promoting axon elongation in the cerebellum, formation of the septate-like junctions between axons and myelinating glial cells, and generation of the neuromuscular junction [ 22, 23, 24].
1: Recent evidence clearly reveals CNTN1-derived oncogenic actions [ 25].
2: CNTN1 facilitates lung cancer metastasis [ 26] and associates with poor prognosis in patients with lung, esophageal and oral squamous cell carcinomas [ 26, 27, 28], and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 29].
3: CNTN1 upregulation and its association with worse clinical features have been reported in breast cancer [ 30], astrocytic glioma [ 31], thyroid cancer [ 32], and stomach cancer [ 33].
4: In prostate cancer, CNTN1 upregulation occurs in cancer stem cells and primary cancer [ 34].
5: Functionally, CNTN1 promotes PC metastasis [ 34].
6: Clinically, CNTN1 is associated with PC relapse [ 34, 35].
7: Nonetheless, CNTN1 is a relatively new oncogenic protein, particularly in PC; its contributions to PC progression remain largely uncharacterized.

 <caption>
  <p>The three independent characteristics of voltage-dependent calcium, potassium and sodium channels in the left atrium (LA), right atrium (RA), left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). (
   <bold>a</bold>) Average expression level (AVE); (
   <bold>b</bold>) (relative) expression variation (REV); (
   <bold>c</bold>) expression correlation (COR with 
   <italic>Actc1</italic>). AVE unit is the normalized median of all genes quantified in all samples, so AVE = 20 indicates that expression of 
   <italic>Cacna1h</italic> in LA is 20 × larger than that of the median gene in all 16 samples. Expression variation is quantified by the Relative Expression Variation (REV) and expression correlation is measured by COR, the Pearson product-momentum correlation coefficient between the (log
   <sub>2</sub>) expression levels of the two genes across the biological replicas (see “
   <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>”).

<p id="par0020">Thyroid carcinoma, most common endocrine malignancy, can arise from follicular and parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Papillary (PTC), follicular (FTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer can originate from the follicular cells in thyroid follicles. During the last decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer sharply increased in many countries 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This increase in incidence is commonly attributed to the overdiagnosis of early indolent cancers. The histopathological diagnosis of thyroid nodules is mostly dependent on Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) as it is a gold standard method due to its reliability and inexpensiveness. This method allows the cytological differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Despite the benefits of FNAB based differential diagnosis, it is not helpful in determining some cases of thyroid nodules which then results in unnecessary surgical operation for patients with benign thyroid nodules

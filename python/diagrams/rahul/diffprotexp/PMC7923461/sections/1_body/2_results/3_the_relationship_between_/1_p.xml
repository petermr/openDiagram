<p id="Par48">Several evidences prove that the characteristics of TIICs were significantly correlated to the occurrence and development of tumor tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we explored whether the expression of TUBA1C was associated with TIICs in LUAD tissues. Based on the expression of TUBA1C, we segregated 497 samples into high and low expression groups. A total of 248 high expression samples and 249 low expression samples met the screening criteria. The two groups exhibited differences in the 28 proportions of immune cells, which were observed by downloading the gene expression source from an established and trusted computing resource (CIBERSORT, Newman et al., Stanford University, USA). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a displays the results of the 28 immune cell subsets. The expression of TUB1AC was significantly correlated to the following types of immune cells: activated B cell, activated CD4 T cell, central memory CD4 T cell, effector memory CD8 T cell, eosinophils, gamma-delta T cell, immature B cell, immature dendritic cell, mast cell, memory B cell, natural killer T cell, regulatory T cell, and type 2 T-helper cell. In particular, activated CD4 T cell, effector memory CD8 T cell, gamma-delta T cell, memory B cell, natural killer T cell, and regulatory T cell were present in higher proportions in the high expression group than in others. Moreover, activated B cell, central memory CD4 T cell, eosinophils, immature B cell, mast cell, and type 2 T -helper cell were also present in higher proportion in the high expression group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Meanwhile, we used TIMER and GEPIA databases to further investigate the relationship between TUBA1C and the diverse set of immune infiltrating cells. After adjusting the correlation coefficients according to purity, we found that the expression of TUBA1C was significantly correlated to T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and neutrophils in LUAD tissues (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Furthermore, we used the GEPIA database to analyze the correlation between TUBA1C expression and the above-mentioned markers: T cell, B cell, natural killer cell, and neutrophils. The correlation results between TUBA1C and its related markers, namely, T cell, B cell, natural killer cell, and neutrophils were similar to those reported in TIMER database (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

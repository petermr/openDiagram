 </sup>. Among the differentially expressed mRNAs in H1 vs H3, ovarian steroidogenesis, TGF-β signalling, estrogen signalling, Rap1 signalling pathway, Hippo signalling pathway, MAPK signalling, NF kappa B signalling, p53 signalling, and phosphatidylinositol signalling pathways were identified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The enrichment analysis of KEGG pathway showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs in ovarian tissues of H1 vs H3 Hu sheep participate in multiple pathways associated with ovarian follicles development. The development of various parts of the ovary is characterized by a series of phenomena that affect sexual maturity. This is important for studying functions of associated mRNAs in the regulation of ovary development.

<p id="p0085">The boxplot presentations of PAL values for all differential pathway comparisons are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. We also assessed variation of each group under comparison separately and together, both on pathway (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary file 4) and gene levels (Supplementary file 5). We calculated the following statistical characteristics: mean, standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), Range (the difference between maximum and minimum), ratio of IQR and Range, the coefficient of quartile variation (CQV), confidence interval (CI) for CQV (Supplementary file 4). At the level of pathway activation, CQV was calculated for (PAL-minimal (PAL)) because PAL can take negative values [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We marked the pathways, for which CQV of two compared groups together was higher than CQV of each separate group (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary file 4), there were six such differential pathways (

0: The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed as described previously 6.
1: Briefly, a total of 1 g of RNA was reverse transcribed using RT-reagent kits with gDNA Eraser (Takara, China) as per the manufacturers protocols.
2: Total RNA (0.5 g) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA using PrimerScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa Biotech, Dalian, China; code: DRR037A).
3: Each cDNA sample was diluted 10 times in ddH 2O, and 1 l of this dilution was used as a template for qRT-PCR.
4: The qRT-PCR reactions were performed in a 10 l volume containing 5 l 2  QuantiFast SYBR Green Master Mix (TIANGEN Biotech, Dalian, China; code: FP204), 1 l cDNA, and 0.2 l of forward and reverse primers (both in 5 M) and 3.6 l nuclease-free H 2O in a Roche HOLD CYCLE LightCycler 480 II ((Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
5: The amplification conditions were 95 C for 15 min of the initial stage, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 10 s and 60 C for 30 s. The relative gene expression levels were estimated using the  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${2}^{-\Delta \Delta Ct}\mathrm{ method}$$\end{document}2-Ctmethod77.
6: Data obtained were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (vers 7; GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA,  https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/).
7: The student t-test ( p < 0.05) was used for mean comparisons.
8: All results were presented in bar charts with the means and their standard deviation ( SD).
9: Primers used for the qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table  S1.

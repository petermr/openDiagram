<p>200 μL pipette tips were packed with two punches of sulfonated divinylbenzene (SDB-RPS, Empore) with a 16-gauge needle and conditioned and equilibrated as described above. After loading 3 μg peptides, the resin was washed with 50 μL 20 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 10. Then, the peptides were eluted into three fractions with 20 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>HCO
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 10, containing 15, 30, and 90% ACN and dried in a rotary evaporator and stored at −80 °C until needed.

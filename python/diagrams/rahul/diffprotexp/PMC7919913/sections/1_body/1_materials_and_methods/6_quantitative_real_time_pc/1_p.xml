<p>According to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen), total RNA was prepared using TRIZol reagent and first strand cDNA was synthesized by RT II kit (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). Subsequently, using an Applied Biosystems 7300 Sequence Detection system, qRT-PCR was performed. The reaction system was follows: 10 µL RNase-free water (Qiagen),1 µL cDNA, 2 µL 10 × miScript Primer Assay, 2 µL 10 × miScript Universal Primer and 10 µL 2 × QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at a melting temperature of 95 °C for 15 s, followed by 60 °C for 1 min. All primers were synthesized by Qiagen, and housekeeping gene was U6. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The C
 <sub>T</sub> data were determined using default threshold settings, and the mean CT was calculated from the triplicate PCRs. ΔCT = CT treatment－CT control.

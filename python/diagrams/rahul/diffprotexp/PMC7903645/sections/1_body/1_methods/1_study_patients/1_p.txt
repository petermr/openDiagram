0: Patients who presented with minimal or no symptoms in whom speculum examination revealed cervical dilatation with visible fetal membranes in the second trimester were considered to have CI and were included in the study.
1: Cervical dilatation, effacement, and bulging membranes were evaluated by ultrasonography and confirmed by speculum examination.
2: The nitrazine test and/or Actim PromTM test (Medix Biochemica, Kauniainen, Finland) were performed to rule out premature rupture of membranes.
3: Uterine contractions were assessed by patient perception, cardiotocogram, and abdominal palpation.
4: Patients with cervical dilatation were observed for at least 6 h, and physical examination indicated that cerclage was performed, when preterm labor and chorioamnionitis were excluded.
5: The criteria for the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis include one or more of the following: maternal fever 38 C, maternal or fetal tachycardia (100 beats/min and  160 beats/min, respectively), or uterine tenderness.
6: We excluded women who had fetuses with major malformations, multiple gestations, persistent regular uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding, ruptured membranes, clinical chorioamnionitis, or prior prophylactic cerclage.
7: We also excluded women who had systemic symptoms or signs, such as cough, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abnormal skin rash that suggested viral and bacterial diseases that may affect pregnancy; women who had abnormal liver and kidney function test results; and women who had urinary tract infections on urine culture test.

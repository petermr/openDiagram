Best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) were calculated using a linear mixed approach in REML using GenStat (VSN International <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015</xref>). Heritability was calculated using GenStat: Broad sense heritability of line means was calculated from the estimate of the variance components in REML, taking into account all features of the experimental designs.

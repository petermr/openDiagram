 <sub>2</sub> in different geometric arrangements was considered, including modest-sized bulk samples in Phase I, II, and liquid, composed of 144 H
 <sub>2</sub> molecules. Moreover, unusual configurations found in HMLP-MD with preliminary versions of the potential were added to the DFT training set to improve performance and transferability. The final accumulated dataset includes up to 41,468 configurations, which are provided as a separated file in the

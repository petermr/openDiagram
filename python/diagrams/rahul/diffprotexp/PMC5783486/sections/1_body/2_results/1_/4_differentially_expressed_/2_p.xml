<p>To comprehensively characterize the associations among significantly differentially expressed proteins in CAA and CAD, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and signaling network modelling were employed using the Cytoscape plug-in ReactomeFIViz (

 <xref rid="f4-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The thresholds for pathway enrichment were defined as P&lt;0.05 and FDR &lt;1%. These enriched pathways were associated with bacterial and viral infection (e.g., 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection), inflammatory responses (e.g., complement cascades and platelet activation) and other metabolic processes. Various bacteria and viruses have been reported as infectious agents of KD, such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="b14-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which may explain the activation of the inflammatory response pathways. However, KD is a highly-complicated disease, and its etiology and pathology are still unclear. The infection and inflammatory response-associated sub-networks were extracted from the whole differentially expressed protein networks in KD and the sub-network was highly enriched for proteins in infectious and inflammatory pathways. Some of these have demonstrated a high correlation with KD; the expression levels of the fibrinogen Î³ chain, which belongs to the fibrinogen family, are associated with KD according to a previous study (
 <xref rid="b15-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Thus, the sub-network generated was deemed to be associated with KD (
 <xref rid="f4-mmr-17-02-2402" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The network proteins were divided into 5 modules (presented as nodes of different colors in the figure) according to different clusters; proteins that serve a core role in each module and have either not been investigated or have rarely been investigated in previous studies were identified. Specifically, CFH, MBL2, KNG1, FN1 and SERPINC1 were identified as primary candidates involved in CAA and CAD (presented as bigger nodes with red circles). CFH and MBL2 were associated with classical complement proteins (yellow and pink clusters), KNG1 and FN1 were associated with proteins correlated to KD (grey and green clusters), and SERPINC1 is as an inhibitor in a complement protein associated pathway (green cluster). These results clarified the differentially expressed proteins in CAA and CAD samples and the associations among proteins in the network.

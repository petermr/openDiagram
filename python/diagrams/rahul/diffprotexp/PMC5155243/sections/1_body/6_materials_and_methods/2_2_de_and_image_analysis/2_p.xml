<p>Two-dimensional electrophoresis through isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the first dimension with an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) was performed as follows. A specific amount of protein was accurately aspirated (150 μg of protein loaded for silver-stained samples and 1.0 mg for Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained samples), and rehydration buffer was added to a final volume of 350 μL. After thorough mixing, the samples were loaded into the IPG gel wells between the positive and negative electrodes. The protective membrane of the pre-made IPG gel strip (18 cm, pH 3~10, NL) (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) was then removed, and the samples in the gel well were covered with the strip, with the gel side facing downward. The gel strip was slowly pressed down to avoid bubbles. The top of the gel strip was then evenly sealed with 1 ml of cover oil. The cover was secured, and IEF was performed in an IPG-IEF apparatus (BioRad). After the IEF step was completed, the IPG gel strip was balanced. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 12%), as the second dimension in 2-DE, was then performed vertically on the PH-balanced IPG gel strip. The settings of the electrophoresis parameters were as follows: 20 mA/gel and electrophoresis at a constant current for 40 min, followed by 30 mA/gel electrophoresis at a constant current until bromophenol blue reached the end of the gel. The gel was then stained with silver nitrate or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (BioRad).</p>

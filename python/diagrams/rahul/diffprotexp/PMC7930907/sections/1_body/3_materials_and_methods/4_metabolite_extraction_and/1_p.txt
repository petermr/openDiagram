0: P3 SASCs, PASCs, and EASCs were cultured in 10 cm diameter cell culture dishes with six replicates in each group.
1: When the cells grew to 90% their original size, the metabolites were extracted as follows: the cells were washed three times with PBS, then 0.5 ml of 80% (HPLC grade) methanol was added.
2: After repeated blowing and washing of the residual cells, as much of the cell mixture was collected as possible, centrifuged at room temperature at high speed, and the supernatant was dried with nitrogen and stored at 80 C for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

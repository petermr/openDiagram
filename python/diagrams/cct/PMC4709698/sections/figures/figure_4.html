 <caption> Characterization of as-cast BT X rods with a diameter of 10 mm. ( a–h) The back-scattered scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of BT15, BT20, BT30, BT40, BT60, BT80, BT90, and BT95, respectively. BT15 shows a fully amorphous structure, and other samples have a two-phase microstructure. The growing intensities of the diffraction peaks (110) of β-Ti from BT20 to BT95 suggest an increasing volume fraction of β-Ti. ( i) The X-ray diffraction patterns of BT X. The compositions of BT X are designed using the lever rule and calculated by equitation (5), as listed in Table 2. The designed mole fractions, x, of β-Ti have a strong influence on the final microstructure and the measured volume fractions of β-Ti are listed in Table 2. </caption>

<p>Another issue to consider in the soft X-ray range is that the penetration depth of low energy X-rays is lower than that for hard X-rays, which makes soft X-ray XAS more surface sensitive. For example, the shift to lower energies of the Au M
 <sub>5</sub>-edge XANES spectrum in Au NPs deposited on carbon nitride (C
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>) was observed by Zhang et al.,

 </sup> whereas no changes at the Au L
 <sub>3</sub>-edge were detected.

 </sup> This difference was interpreted as an interface effect due to electron transfer from the support to the NP surface. The accompanying minor shifts of the nitrogen K-edge XAS features to higher energies observed allowed Zhang et al. to identify N atoms as the likely source of the transferred electrons. This negative charging of Au NPs on carbon nitride was correlated with an observed enhanced CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR activity of these NPs with respect to similar NPs deposited on carbon.

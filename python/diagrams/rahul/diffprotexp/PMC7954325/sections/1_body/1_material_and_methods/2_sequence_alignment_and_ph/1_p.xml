<p>The bZIP protein sequences from potato, rice, maize, barley, and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were aligned with gap opening and gap extension penalties of 10 and 0.1, respectively, using Clustal W. A Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method was used to develop a cladogram of all bZIP protein sequences. The associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test of 1000 replicas. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 7 software, version 7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and visualized through EvolView v2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

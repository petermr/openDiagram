<p>Replication kinetics was performed on both confluent buffalo green monkey (BGM) (BioWhittaker Europe) and human lung adenocarcinoma (CaLu-3) cells (ATCC® HTB-55™, Plateforme iPS, NeuroMyoGene Institute, Lyon, FR, [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10
 <sup>−3</sup> at 36°C with 5% CO

Comparative viral particle quantification of culture supernatant was performed by RdRp Institut Pasteur qRT-PCR on a QuantStudio™ 5 System (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) with a standard curve after semi-automated EMAG® extraction (bioMérieux, Lyon, FR) [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons between both factors of comparison (virus variant and cell line) on GraphPad Prism (software version 8.4.3).

<p>Those body temperature profiles were substantially distorted during a drought. The profiles of body temperature no longer were bimodal but more cosinor. The 24-h maxima of body temperature differed little from those in the absence of drought, but in the winter month (August 2013, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), the 24-h maximum occurred before sunset, coinciding with a shift in activity pattern as aardvarks emerged earlier, with activity starting to increase during the late morning, and peaking during the early evening. During the drought summer month (February 2013, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), the two aardvarks for which we retrieved activity data had different activity patterns; one became diurnal and the other remained largely nocturnal. The average body temperature of these two, plus two other aardvarks for which we retrieved body temperature data but not activity data during this particular month, continued to peak at night, but now after a gradual increase beginning soon after sunrise. The stable body temperatures that occurred during the day in the absence of a drought disappeared, presumably because some aardvarks were not in the burrow, and body temperature dipped to a nadir occurring a few hours after sunrise. In the drought winter month (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), that nadir, averaged for six aardvarks for which we retrieved body temperature data, was below 34Â°C. Variability in body temperature between aardvarks, as indicated by the standard deviation, was much higher during the drought winter month than in the non-drought winter month, when aardvarks had remarkably similar body temperatures. In the summer months, drought had little influence on that variability.

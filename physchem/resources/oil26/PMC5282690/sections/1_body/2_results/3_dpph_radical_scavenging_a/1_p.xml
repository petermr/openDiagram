<p>The radical scavenging activity of AcEO against DPPH radical increased significantly in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>); the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values calculated from the graph was EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 690 μg/ml. However, the radical scavenging activity attributed to ascorbic acid seems to be more important, characterized by a linear and stable shape of the graph with a maximum of 96.23% of the antioxidant effect (AA % higher than 50%).

<p>At SR facilities, X-rays are produced by bending with magnetic fields the trajectories of electrons (or positrons) accelerated to relativistic velocities. The intensity of single bending magnet beamlines is usually sufficient for standard XAS experiments. However, for time-resolved studies, investigations of dilute samples or samples in attenuating environments, beamlines based on insertion devices are better suited. In the wiggler-type insertion devices, the X-rays are produced by arrays of magnets with alternating polarity, and the intensity of the X-ray radiation is several-times higher. Another type of insertion devices, undulators, can also be used at XAS beamlines. They can achieve even higher X-ray intensity by exploiting the interference effects and interactions between the emitted light and relativistic electrons but require tapering or scanning of the gap between arrays of magnets to expand the width of the emitted X-ray radiation spectrum to 1–2 keV needed for EXAFS data collection. In all cases, the produced X-ray beam is usually collimated in the synchrotron plane and strongly polarized, which may be exploited in advanced XAS studies of oriented samples.

 </sup> The synchrotron radiation produced passes through a series of optical elements, such as X-ray mirrors with different coatings, which ensure further collimation of the X-ray beam and cutting off undesired portions of the emitted radiation to reduce the heat load on further beamline components and to remove higher harmonics contributions to the monochromatized spectrum.

<p>The NGO was prepared by the nitrification of graphite oxide and the NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> prefer to react with the epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the edge to produce C-NO
 <sub>2</sub> and O-NO
 <sub>2</sub> groups. Structural changes cause changes in performance. The NGO behaves hydrophobicity, similar thermal property with other nitrate materials and fine combustion performance. These properties might conduce to storage and promote reaction in the energetic formula. Therefore, NGO is a promising two-dimensional material as an energetic additive in catalysts, electrode materials and other fields.

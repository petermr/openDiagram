<p>The ionic conductivity of prepared PVDF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane was carried and compared with commercially available celgard-2400 (PP) monolayer membrane and cellulose (NKK, Kochi, Japan) membrane to analyze the performance in sodium electrolyte solution. From the obtained results, the prepared PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> separator membrane showed high ionic conductivity of 4.7 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> S cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at room temperature among all samples studied and also higher than previous reports [

 <xref rid="polymers-12-00405-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The capability of electrolyte uptake of PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> membrane was estimated by soaking in 1 M NaPF
 <sub>6</sub> solution for 60 min, and it was plotted in the graph between the time and percentage of liquid electrolyte uptake (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f004">Figure 4</xref>c); from this graph, one can observe that the membrane has its saturated position within 10 min, which revealed the high porous nature of prepared membrane and also the high amorphous nature of PVdF. The electrochemical performances of PVdF-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite membrane was analyzed using prepared P2-type Na

 <sub>6</sub> solution used as electrolyte. The temperature dependent ionic conductivity plot for prepared membrane is shown in

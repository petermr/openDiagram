0: The last decade has seen increased interest in the use of essential oils from plants in the food, human health, and the pharmaceutical industry [ 1].
1: Different parts of plants can synthesize essential oils with diverse pharmacological activities, ranging from the cytotoxic, through the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiparasitic, to the anti-inflammatory [ 1,  2].
2: Their antibacterial activity makes essential oils suitable alternatives to antibiotics [ 3].
3: Many antibiotics can be not effective as bactericidal agents due to drug-resistancy of bacteria that have developed from the widespread use of antibiotics.
4: Essential oils can be used as natural food preservatives against food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria [ 4].
5: They may be an alternative to currently used synthetic compounds, which may have toxic effects and may be carcinogenic [ 3,  4].
6: The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils is associated with different functional groups and the synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects between them [ 4,  5].
7: Essential oils may also play an important role in scavenging free radicals which may lead to oxidative stress [ 1].
8: Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) may induce the inflammation [ 6].
9: The inflammation is connected with many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other nervous pathogenesis [ 7].

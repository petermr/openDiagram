<p>Interestingly, the observed discontinuity in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05570">Figure S2</xref> at approximately 18.0 wt.% coincides with the start of the experimentally determined biphasic regime. Such a trend points to the unequal “washing-out” and resulting solvophobic segregation of the components upon dilution, resulting in the phase separation of the system into a more apolar [P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl bi-continuous phase stabilized by adsorbed organic acid molecules and a water-rich phase. Further addition of water results in the complete solubilization of all components and the return of the monophasic system containing a [P

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05570">Figure S1</xref>, increases the dehydration of the aggregate surface and favors aggregate coalescence. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of [P

 <sup>+</sup> micelles (20.0 wt.% IL) in the presence of acetic acid, presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05570">Figure S4</xref>, shows the minimal micelle swelling with increasing acid concentration. This suggests that coacervation occurs rather through the nearing of neighboring micelles into a bi-continuous regime rather than through micelle-micelle fusion.

<p>Most ASIC3 research to date has been conducted in rodents, with channel expression predominantly in the PNS [
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], unlike hASIC3 which is reportedly more equally distributed between CNS and PNS. Hence, most published studies have focused on peripheral ASIC3 expression and the accompanying function in pathophysiology.

<p>Total lung proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) and quantified using the BCA Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Waltham, MA, USA). Equal amounts of proteins from BALF or total lung protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting as described [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-20-03401" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Two Antibodies against Cxcl15 were used (goat anti-mouse Cxcl15, R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; monoclonal rabbit anti-mouse Cxcl15, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) with similar results. Densitometry measurements were performed using NIH ImageJ.

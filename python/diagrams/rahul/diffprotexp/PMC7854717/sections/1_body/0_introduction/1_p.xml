<p id="Par2">Starting with crocodilians, the heart pumps the blood through the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation by the coordinated rhythmic contractions of its upper left and right atria (LA, RA) and lower left and right ventricles (LV, RV). Each of the four heart chambers has a well-defined role in circulation and the adequate morphology but how their distinct functions and buildups are determined by the transcriptomic profiles is still not completely understood. </p>

<p>Differences in gene expression between clusters were identified using a significance analysis of the sequencing data (SAMseq) [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] from the samr package [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-22-01399" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. SAMseq is a non-parametric statistical function dependent on the Wilcoxon rank statistic that equalizes the sizes of the library by a resampling method accounting for the various sequencing depths. The analysis is implemented over the pure raw dataset that has the unnormalized expression read counts after excluding the ERCCs. The SAMseq function indirectly calls a subfunction called rankcol, which was written in Fortran. This function is used to attribute column-wise ranks to a matrix. Due to some limitations in handling large datasets, the function was rewritten in R and incorporated into DIscBIO. Furthermore, binomial counting statistics are used to identify the differentially expressed markers for each cluster. This is done by highlighting the DEGs in the target cluster comparing to all the remaining clusters using binomial differential expression. Differentially expressed markers help characterize the molecular signatures. For instance, when analyzing cancer cells, it might help to characterize the tumorigenic capabilities of each cell cluster, leading to the development of better therapeutics [

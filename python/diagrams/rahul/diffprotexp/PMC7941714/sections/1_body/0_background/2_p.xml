<p id="Par29">In the present study, we acquired the expression profiles and clinical information for colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), and miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were then identified by comparing tumor samples and normal samples. We performed survival analysis and predicted RNA interaction pairs to construct a prognosis-related ceRNA network. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was embodied in Cytoscape to identify module clusters and hub genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed to explore the biological functions of the mRNAs in the ceRNA and module network. In addition, we analyzed the correlations between key lncRNAs and the clinical features of CRC patients. Co-expression analysis between lncRNAs and target genes was performed to verify the ceRNA hypothesis. Eventually, we established ceRNA regulatory subnetworks based on the above results. GEPIA and immunohistochemistry were used to validate the differential expression of genes, whereas GSEA was used to predict the underlying functions of the genes in the subnetwork. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to estimate the proportion of immune cells for further correlation analysis (Fig.

<p id="Par20">On a related theme, our identification of an association between 91 established osteoarthritis variants and disease state, cell-specific gene expression and protein profiles highlights the value of integrating multi-omics data with genetic association summary statistics to identify likely effector genes for GWAS signals, and hence targets for development of new therapies. The subsequent ConnectivityMap analyses built upon this theme to identify molecules with potential clinical application to reverse the molecular signatures characteristic of diseased chondrocytes, an in-silico complementary approach to conventional compound library screening. Here, we identify 19 molecules and 36 genes with biological supportive evidence for validation as candidate drugs in experimental models, such as that recently applied by Shi et al. to demonstrate that the small molecule BNTA stimulates expression of ECM components while supressing inflammatory mediators in human osteoarthritic cartilage, an effect mediated through superoxide dismutase 3

<p id="Par66">MAPK-signaling (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) has an important role in mediating neuronal differentiation and survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Consistent with our expectations, the transition from iPSCs to NSCs was guided by inhibition of signal transduction pathways supporting self-renewal and activation of genes regulating neuron-specific development pathways. Gene expression of Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor type 2, 
 <italic>NTRK2</italic>, was prominently upregulated at D7 when the NSC population was established, while a subset of genes encoding for γ-subunits of voltage-dependent calcium-channels (Cavs) were dramatically downregulated (
 <italic>CACNG5</italic>, 
 <italic>CACNG7</italic>, and 
 <italic>CACNG8</italic>), along with 
 <italic>MYC</italic>, Ras guanyl-releasing protein 2 (
 <italic>RASGRP2</italic>), and 
 <italic>GNG12</italic>. Gene groups encoding the auxiliary subunits of high-voltage activated (HVA) Cavs were upregulated during the early stages of neuronal development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]: 
 <italic>CACNB3</italic> (induced 4-fold at D7) and 
 <italic>CACNA2D3</italic> (16-fold activation at D7-D13). The late stage of MN formation (D18-D28) was marked by upregulation of 
 <italic>CACNA1E</italic> and 
 <italic>CACNG2</italic>. Several gene groups encoding auxiliary subunits of low-voltage activated (LVA) Cavs (
 <italic>CACNG5</italic> and 
 <italic>CACNG8</italic>), were initially downregulated in NSC and later upregulated during the MN maturation stage (D18-D28). Accumulation of Cavs gene transcripts throughout the MN differentiation process is consistent with the increased excitability of neuronal cells (Fig.

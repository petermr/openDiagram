The connection between single‐water molecules reorientational dynamics and the values obtained from DRS measurements is discussed in Supporting Information. The theoretical values are in good agreement with the experimental hydration numbers, especially at higher concentrations. The two

 <sup>2+</sup> with an increase in salt concentration. Since 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD simulations is a very computational intensive technique, it would be more advantageous using trajectories generated from classical MD. Divalent cations such as Mg

 </xref>] In this approach, the fast electronic polarization is taken into account in a mean field approach and implemented numerically by scaling the charges of the ions. Here, we have used the Lennard‐Jones potentials for MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solutions parameterized by Duboue‐Dijon et al. named ECC,

 </xref> Overall, the potential model of Duboue‐Dijon (ECC big) provided the best agreement with respect to quantum mechanical and experimental reference data. The retardation factor associated with the water subpopulations of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> was determined with the approach used for 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD (Figure S15 in Supporting Information), from which the hydration numbers of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>(aq) was computed as a function of the salt concentration. Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0012" ref-type="fig">12</xref> shows the hydration numbers generated from the classical MD trajectories of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (100 ps) are consistent with the 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD result and in good agreement with THz‐DR experiments, especially at lower concentration, probably because of the longer simulation period. Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0012" ref-type="fig">12</xref> also reports the average coordination number (CN) of the first and second shell of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> as a function of the MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, which were obtained from the integration of the Mg−O radial distribution functions at the second minima. Except for the more dilute solution, the values of CN are too high compared with the hydration numbers obtained from the water reorientation dynamic analysis. Since the coordination number is based on a simple spatial definition, it cannot capture the subtle cooperative hydration effects of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> on the dynamical properties of the surrounding water molecules.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f041">Figure 41</xref> shows a comparison of the predicted hardness values as a function of cooling rate for 6063 and two variants of 6082. This comparison is especially remarkable in terms of the technological application of age-hardening and the design of the applied heat treatment processes. It can be seen that the highest maximum hardness is achieved for the alloy with the highest alloying element concentration (6082
 <sub>V</sub>) after very rapid quenching. Thus, if the main objective is to obtain maximum hardness and strength, a highly concentrated alloy is required, although it is also necessary to ensure sufficiently fast cooling via the technologically applied cooling process. It may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve &gt;100 K/s as an average cooling rate in the relevant temperature range (≈500–200 °C) for thick sections and large batches/loads. In such conditions, it might be more appropriate to choose a leaner alloy. As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f041">Figure 41</xref>, in a certain range of slower cooling rates, the maximum hardness is achieved with the leanest alloy in this comparison. Slower cooling rates may be of interest, for instance due to requirements for distortion control or reduction. The results obtained in this work allow us to choose either a suitable process for a specific alloy or a suitable alloy for a certain fixed process.

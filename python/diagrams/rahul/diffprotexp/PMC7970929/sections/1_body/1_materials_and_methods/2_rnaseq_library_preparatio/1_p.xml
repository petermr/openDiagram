<p id="Par6">RNA sequencing libraries were prepared with Illumina-compatible NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) as per manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA was isolated from total RNA (100 ng to 1 µg) and subjected to first strand synthesis in the presence of Actinomycin D (Gibco, life technologies, CA, USA) followed by second strand synthesis. HighPrep magnetic beads (Magbio Genomics Inc, USA) were used to purify double-stranded cDNA and after end-repairing and adenylation, it was ligated to Illumina multiplex barcode adapters as per NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit protocol.</p>

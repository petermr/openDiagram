<p id="Par23">As the 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> Enh is highly conserved amongst amniote taxa—birds, reptiles and mammals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), we next asked whether the homologous mammalian sequences are active in chick. We found that a human 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> Enh, isolated from HeLa cells, was able to drive Citrine expression in somites. Activity was also detected in LPM and PSM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). The human 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> Enh sequence included conserved FOXO1 and ZIC3 binding sites and mutation of both sites led to loss of reporter activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Therefore, we propose transcriptional regulation of the 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> enhancer is highly conserved in human and chick, with FOXO1 and ZIC3 binding sites required for enhancer activity. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> Enh sequence was not found in fish or amphibians (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). However, when we injected the chick 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> Enh reporter into one cell of 
 <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos at the 2-cell stage, we observed Citrine fluorescence in the paraxial mesoderm of early neurula stages (NF stage 14), where it overlapped with 
 <italic>MYOD</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>). At NF stage 25, Citrine expression was detected in mesoderm and by NF stage 33 and stage 42 Citrine was visible in elongated muscle fibres, which are somite derived (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). The 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> Enh with mutations in the FOXO1 and ZIC3 binding sites showed no activity (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). This suggests that in amphibians the 
 <italic>MEOX1</italic> Enh can be activated by the same regulatory mechanism, even though the CRE is not conserved in the same location in the 
 <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> genome.

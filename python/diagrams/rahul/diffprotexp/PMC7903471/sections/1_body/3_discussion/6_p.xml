<p>The present study had several limitations. Firstly, the age of the patients in the NC group was lower than that of the patients in the OA group, therefore, a number of the detected transcripts may be age-related rather than disease-specific. Future studies should include a larger number of age-matched control cartilage samples. Secondly, as only a few patients agreed to donate knee cartilage, the present study consisted of a small sample size. In order to provide support for the conclusions made in the present study, further investigations should include larger cohorts. Thirdly, only indirect experimental evidence of the functional link between lncRNAs and their predicted target genes was included in the present study. Therefore, this also requires further investigation.</p>

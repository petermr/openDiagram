<p>T-bet, Gata3, Ror-γ, and Foxp3 are specific transcription factors for Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells, respectively. Thus, we detected the protein expression level of specific transcription factors in cultured splenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells on d 5 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The protein expression of Gata3 and Foxp3 were increased by 1.54- and 1.69-fold, respectively, but the T-bet and Ror-γ expression were decreased by 0.73- and 0.68-fold in the Pnu group compared with the PBS group (

Additionally, inhibiting NF-κB pathway through administering PDTC reduced the expression of T-bet and Ror-γ, whereas inhibiting STAT3 pathway through administering NSC decreased the expression of Gata3 and Foxp3 in the Pnu or MLA group, respectively (Pnu+PDTC versus Pnu, MLA+PDTC versus MLA, Pnu+NSC versus Pnu, MLA+NSC versus MLA,

 <caption> CMPK1 was regulated by CPSF1. CPSF1 was knocked down or overexpressed in HepG2.2.15 and HCCLM3 cells. The mRNA level of CMPK1 (A) PDUI and (B) PSI was determined by qRT-PCR. Statistical significance was calculated by one-sample Student’s t-test. (C) Cell proliferation was detected using the CCK8 assay over five consecutive days. The relative absorbance was measured at OD 450. Statistical data are presented as mean ± SD. * P &lt; 0.05 and ** P &lt; 0.01. </caption>

0: Recently, the publication of the genome and transcriptome of  E. granulosus has offered meaningful insights into the development [ 42,  50], immunobiology, evolution, and mechanisms of host-parasite crosstalk, which provided new information on the development of new, effective treatments and interventions for echinococcosis control.
1: However, there may still be deficiencies in currently available genomic resources for  E. granulosus [ 20].
2: After this landmark step, a series of studies including on miRNA expression [ 12,  38] and transcriptome analysis [ 17] were subsequently published for different developmental stages of  E. granulosus.
3: However, very few proteomic studies have been published on  E. granulosus, although numerous studies on proteomic profile analysis have been carried out on a wide range of parasites, such as  Mesocestoides [ 30,  52] , Hymenolepis diminuta [ 47,  48] , Schistosoma japonicum [ 31],  Trichuris muris [ 16],  Toxoplasma gondii [ 19,  51], and  Taenia solium [ 46].
4: Protein-compositions have been reported and some of the proteins are considered novel candidate diagnostic antigens [ 8,  35], or valuable tools for the identification of new therapeutic targets for the control of larval parasites [ 5,  53].
5: It is, therefore, necessary to detect the protein expression of  E. granulosus at the different developmental stages, which may provide information to better understand host-parasite interrelationships, and may point out potential targets for vaccines or drug discovery studies.

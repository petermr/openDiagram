 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows a schematic overview of the sample preparation and LC–MS/MS analysis conducted in this work. We assembled 18 fresh frozen thyroid tissues from CV-PTC (n = 6), FV-PTC (n = 6) and benign thyroid tissues (n = 6) to analyze the proteomic profiles of thyroid tumors. Quantitative analysis revealed 2560 protein identifications across all 18 samples.

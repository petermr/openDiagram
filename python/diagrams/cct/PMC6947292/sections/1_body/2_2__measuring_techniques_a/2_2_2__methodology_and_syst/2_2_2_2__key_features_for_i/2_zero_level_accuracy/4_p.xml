<p>For each individual sample measurement, a corresponding baseline measurement needs to be performed [

 <xref rid="B113-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,
 <xref rid="B121-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], and this measurement should be made promptly. This is particularly true for power-compensated devices, as their baseline behaviour drifts more strongly with time [

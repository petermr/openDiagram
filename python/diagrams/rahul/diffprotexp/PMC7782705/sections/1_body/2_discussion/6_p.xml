<p id="Par24">The high number of gDTUs observed in AD brains compared to controls can likely be explained by altered expression of genes encoding for proteins of the splicing machinery, affecting alternative splicing. According to this interpretation, we show that a high number of isoform switches is associated with alternative transcription start site, alternative transcription termination site, exon skipping, alternative 3′ or 5′ splice sites, multiple exon skipping and intron retention. Moreover, we show that several genes encoding for proteins of the splicing machinery have their expression altered in AD brains, especially those showing a high degree of pathology (Braak &gt;5). Also in agreement with the regional differences in gene expression described above, alterations in the splicing machinery are more prominent in the TL than in the FL, which could help to explain the low number of gDTUs in the latter brain region identified in our work and in the previous study using a different strategy to detect isoform switch

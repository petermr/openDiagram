<p>Apolipoprotein A-I (Apoa1) is one of the apolipoproteins and the main component of high density lipoprotein (HDL). The main function of Apoa1 is to stabilize the structure of lipoproteins and to transport lipids. It also activates lipoprotein metabolic enzymes and recognizes the corresponding receptors. Apoa1 is synthesized primarily in the liver, and partly in the small intestine. The expression level of Apoa1 is closely related to the liver functions [

The lower Apoa1 expression after ricin aerosol exposure, suggests that Apoa1 might be associated with the systemic organ failure and liver tissue lesions following the acute lung injury resulted from ricin aerosol poisoning.

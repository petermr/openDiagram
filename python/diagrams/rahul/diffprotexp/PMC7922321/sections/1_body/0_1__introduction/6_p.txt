0: ETV2, an early regulator of vascular development, was found to be overexpressed in high-grade gliomas, and was reported to play a critical role in endothelial transdifferentiation of CD133+ GBM stem cells, which is thought to render them resistant to anti-angiogenic therapy [ 23].
1: Another ETS-related gene, ERG, was found to be a novel and highly specific marker for endothelial cells within CNS tumors, a feature that can be used in studying the vascularization of gliomas [ 24].
2: A transposon-based study of gliomagenesis identified friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (Fli1), among other genes, to be expressed in gliomas, although Fli1 expression is limited to a subset of glioma cells [ 25], and ETS protein PU.1, known for its critical role in hematopoietic development, was also reported to be highly expressed in glioma patients, indicating its role in the progression of glioma [ 26].
3: In addition to their role in tumor vascularization, ETS proteins can also regulate other aspects of tumorigenesis.
4: In a network analysis based on complexity, as measured by betweenness, Etv5 was identified as a regulator in low-grade optic gliomas in Nf1 mutant mice, and experiments validated the increased expression of both Etv5 and its target genes in optic gliomas [ 27].

<p>Quantitative proteomics data of lung cancer cell line U1810 treated with miRNA mimics as previously described (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Search results of the associated data (gene symbol centric search; PSMs and proteins filtered at 1% FDR; 369,273 PSMs; 107,509 unique peptides; 8,677 proteins) was downloaded from ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD004163. Same as data set D1, median sweeping method was used to summarize PSM level intensities to protein log2 ratio. The data was filtered to remove proteins with missing quant values (resulting in 8625 proteins), and analysis was performed using biological triplicates of miR-372 mimics and control siRNA treated cells.

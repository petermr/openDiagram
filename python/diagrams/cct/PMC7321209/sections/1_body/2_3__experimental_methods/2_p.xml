<p>High velocity camera imaging was carried out with HV-camera of the type CR2000x2 (Optronis GmbH, Kehl, Germany) to analyze arc behavior and droplet transfer during GMAW. The frame rate was set to 2500 fps at a resolution of 800 pixels Ã— 600 pixels. The shutter speed was set to 1/10.000 s and the aperture adjusted manually to fade-out the arc partially in order to visualize droplet transfer.</p>

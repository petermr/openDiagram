<p id="Par30">From each fraction, 6 μL was removed and added to 2 μL of 10 × iRT standard peptide, and 2 μL of each sample was separated with nano-LC and analyzed by online electrospray tandem MS. The entire experimental system was an Orbitrap Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) connected in series with a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters, MA, USA) system. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution, and buffer B consisted of 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile aqueous solution (acetonitrile was 80%). The sample was separated by an analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA; Acclaim PepMap C18, 75 μm × 25 cm) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min using the following nonlinear increasing gradient: 0–5 min, 1% B; 5–95 min, 1% B to 28% B; 95–110 min, 28% B to 38% B; 110–115 min, 38% B to 100% B; and 115–120 min, 100% B. The electrospray voltage was 2.0 kV. The MS parameters were set as follows: (1) MS: scan range (m/z) = 350–1250, resolution = 120,000, AGC target = 3e6 and maximum injection time = 20 ms; and (2) DIA: resolution = 30,000, AGC target = 1e6, maximum injection time = auto and NCE = 25.5,27,30. The original MS data and the default parameters of Spectronaut Pulsar X were used to analyze the DIA data. The protein qualitative standard was a precursor threshold of 1.0% FDR. Serum proteins compared between the two specified groups with a threshold of fold change (FC) ≥ 1.50 or ≤ 0.67 and P value ≤ 0.05 were considered as differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs).</p>

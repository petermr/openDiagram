<p>In mouse, ASIC3 expression has been documented in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, with acidosis leading to upregulated expression of CD11c, MHC class II, CD80, and CD86 via ASICs; this effect was abolished the most by diclofenac which blocks ASIC3 selectively, compared to ASIC1a selective ibuprofen and the nonselective ASIC inhibitor amiloride (see modulator section for more details of inhibitors) [

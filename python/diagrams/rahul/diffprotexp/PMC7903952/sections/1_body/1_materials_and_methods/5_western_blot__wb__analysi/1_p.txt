0: The samples of tissues and cells were lysed with Radio Immune Precipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, china).
1: SDS-PAGE was used to separated proteins and proteins were transferred to Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
2: Five percent Bovine Serum Albumin or tris-buffered saline tween (BSA/TBST) were used to block the PVDF membranes.
3: Then, primary antibodies were used to incubate the membranes overnight at 4 C. Next, 1TBST (Solarbio, Beijing, china) was employed to wash the membranes at room temperature.
4: Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG was sequentially added into the membranes for incubation for 115 min at temperature of room.
5: Membranes were washed with TBST three times, 20 min each time.
6: Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) was used to visualized proteins bands.
7: The experiment was made in three times.
8: Supplement Table 4 lists the information of antibodies.

0: Total cellular proteins were extracted and resuspended in lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) supplemented with a protease inhibitor.
1: Western blotting was performed using a standard protocol described previously ( Chen et al., 2019).
2: Briefly, total proteins (30 g) were loaded in individual lanes and separated on an 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel.
3: The following primary antibodies against the indicated proteins were used: CPSF1 (1:1,000, Bethyl, A301-580) and -actin (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, United States).
4: The secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology, 7074S, 1:3,000) and anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076S, 1:3,000), and both were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
5: The protein band intensities were quantified using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager ChemiDoc TM XRS + system.

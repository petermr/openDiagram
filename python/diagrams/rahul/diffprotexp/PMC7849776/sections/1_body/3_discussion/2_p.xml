<p>Microbes acquire nitrogen through the degradation of proteins using proteases. Therefore, it is expected that the reduced protease production by the disruption of the 
 <italic>yjbH</italic> gene resulted in insufficient nitrogen supply. As 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> can utilize urea as a nitrogen source [
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], it is likely that 
 <italic>yjbH</italic>::Tn enhanced urease production to compensate for the nitrogen supply in the absence of YjbH. This notion is further supported by the enhanced production of urease in the mutants with reduced proteolytic activities [
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41â€“43</xref>]. In addition to the genes involved in urease production, we found that the genes related to transport of nickel, a urease cofactor, were highly upregulated in the absence of YjbH. Given that urease is responsible for the conversion of urea into ammonia [
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which is an important pathway to alleviate acidic stress in many bacteria [
 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], YjbH might have a role in acidic stress resistance and pH homeostasis.

0: Gene Ontology  (GO) analysis tool ( http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/analysis.php) was used to emphasize the target gene function of the differentially expressed miRNAs of SR-159 and SR-157 cultivars 30.
1: Further, the pathways associated with respective miRNA targets and their functional information was obtained from KEGG pathway database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
2: miRNA-target pairs along with GO and KEGG pathway annotation were searched and the input received was used to identify targeted genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs between apical and basal spikelets and also between SR-159 and SR-157 cultivars.

<p>In low-alloyed steel, the austenite grain continuously grows up during following cooling process above peak temperature [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-11-02127" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which is referred to as “hot-inertia” [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-11-02127" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, in this present steel, there was almost no growth of austenite measured, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It is reported that Mn atoms are likely to segregate toward grain boundaries during continuous cooling [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-11-02127" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mn segregation at the grain boundary was assumed to pin the grain boundary migration and hinder the growth of austenite grain. Further study is needed to figure out the Mn segregation behavior and its effect on grain growth.

0: Similar to those in other vertebrates, the ovary in adult birds contains numerous developing follicles in different size.
1: Under the control of pituitary hormones [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)] and local ovarian factors, such as somatic cell-derived factors [epidermal growth factors, activins/inhibins, kit ligands (KL), bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs)) and oocyte-derived growth factors [growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP15)), these follicles undergo growth, selection, maturation and finally are released into the oviducts for fertilization 1  3.

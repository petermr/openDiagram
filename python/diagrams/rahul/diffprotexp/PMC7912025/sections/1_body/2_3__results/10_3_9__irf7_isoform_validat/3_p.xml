<p>Finally, we determined whether AS splice events were similar to those seen in primary human small-airway epithelial cells. For this purpose, cytokeratin-19-positive primary human pSAECs isolated from the small airways of cadaveric donors were cultured and then infected in the presence or absence of RSV, and RNA was extracted. We observed an identical splice pattern in qualitative RT-PCR for primer pairs 4â€“7 (

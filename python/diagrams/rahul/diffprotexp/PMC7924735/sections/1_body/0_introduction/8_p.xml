<p>In the third strategy, a proteomic analysis is conducted, based on experimental data from two-dimensional gels and subsequent MS sequencing. While the latter is the most useful method when no genomic data is available [
 <xref rid="pntd.0009104.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it is often the case that the products of interest are only a small fraction of the proteins in a complex mixture [

 <xref rid="pntd.0009104.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although 2DPAGE-MS is a powerful, mature, and sensitive technique, it is often not optimal for the analysis of a complete proteome. It has been shown that only 40% of the differentially expressed proteins identified were sufficiently abundant to be identified by MS [

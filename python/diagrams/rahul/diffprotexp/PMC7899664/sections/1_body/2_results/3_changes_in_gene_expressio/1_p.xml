<p>Because HA content in any tissue is a product of the balance of synthesis and degradation, changes in gene expression of HA synthases and hyaluronidases with topical 4-MU treatment were assessed. These results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. Skin HAS2 expression was significantly downregulated in female mouse skin after topical 4-MU treatment, as compared to untreated female mice, while HAS1 and HAS3 expression was not significantly changed between treated and untreated animals. This was not seen in male mice: none of the three synthases were downregulated in response to topical 4-MU treatment in male mice. No difference was seen in HYAL1, HYAL2, or KIAA1199 expression between groups.

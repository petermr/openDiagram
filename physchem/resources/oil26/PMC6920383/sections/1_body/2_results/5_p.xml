In the mesic grassland and the semi-arid savannah burrow entrances were always cooler than the other microsites, although these differences were smaller during the cooler part of the day. In the arid scrubland burrows, soil temperatures were buffered, being cooler than the rest of the microsites during the warmest times of day, but warmer during the cooler part of the day.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Soil temperature of microsites at three different times of day at the different study sites.

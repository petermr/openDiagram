 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f050">Figure 50</xref>), co-clusters may precipitate during quenching, as shown in SAXS experiments involving continuous cooling of 7449 to below 100 °C in Refs. [

The small Y-phase platelets and clusters cause a direct hardening effect, which is seen in the peaks in the as-quenched hardness, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength for cooling rates of about one to two orders of magnitude slower than the UCCR [

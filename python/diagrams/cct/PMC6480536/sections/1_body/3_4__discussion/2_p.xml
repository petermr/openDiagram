<p>Inclusion-induced AF nucleation is usually considered in welding the coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) where the peak temperature is around 1400 Â°C and the holding time is several to a few tens of seconds. However, for steel base metal, the heating temperature is not so high and the holding time is longer. In this case, the formation of MDZ will be affected as well as the ability of AF nucleation. Mn diffusion behaviors in austenite at different temperatures were calculated by Thermo-Calc DICTRA dynamics software, as shown in

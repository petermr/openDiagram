0: The mechanical properties were evaluated through uniaxial tensile testing (NCS GNT300) of ASTM-E8 standard specimens (diameter: 5 mm, gauge: 25 mm) at room temperature.
1: Impact transition curves were obtained from Charpy impact testing of full-size (10 mm  10 mm  55 mm) specimens with a 2 mm-long 45 V-notch.
2: The V-type impact test was carried out with a square having dimensions of 14  14 mm processing.
3: The notched direction was perpendicular to the square bar.
4: Testing was performed at temperatures ranging from 192 C to 100 C, on an NI-500 impact testing machine with a maximum capacity of 500 J.

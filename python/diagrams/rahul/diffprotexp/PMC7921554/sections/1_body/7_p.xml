<p id="Par8">To explore the correlation between Clusterin and bladder cancer progression, we first examined its expressions in bladder tumor patient specimens. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarray showed that Clusterin protein level was significantly higher in bladder cancer compared with normal bladder (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1n (a, b)</xref>). In particular, it expressed higher in muscle invasive bladder cancer compared with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1n (a)</xref>), consistent with the results of TCGA database and clinical samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1o</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Immunohistochemistry analyses showed that Clusterin level was positively correlated with tumor stage and differentiation grade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1n (c, d)</xref>). These results implied that Clusterin expression positively correlates with bladder cancer progression and may serve as a biomarker for treating with metformin in a personalized medicine fashion.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the preparation mechanism of the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO nanocomposites. Firstly, under the ultrasonic induction, PEO chains were tightly bound to the GO surface to form a large area of 3D PGO layered spatial structure due to the strong affinity between PEO's non-shared ether-oxygen electrons and GO hydrogen bonds. Secondly, under the electrostatic force,

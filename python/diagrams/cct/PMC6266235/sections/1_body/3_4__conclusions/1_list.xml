  <p>The pre-existing retained austenite in the investigated 5Mn steel enhanced the reversed austenite nucleation number during heating of the welding thermal cycle and led to the relatively small grain size in simulated CGHAZ and FGHAZ.</p>

  <p>Austenite growth dominantly took place in the heating process and there was almost no austenite growth in the cooling process above peak temperature during the simulated welding thermal cycle. Therefore, the relatively small size was found in CGHAZ.</p>

  <p>The higher transformation rate was measured to be a maximum of 0.98 in the simulated FGHAZ and a maximum of 0.60 in the simulated CGHAZ. Thus, a 10~11% austenite was retained in FGHAZ.</p>

  <p>Compared to CGHAZ with the larger grain size, the impact toughness in fine grain FGHAZ was not significantly improved. This was due to the transformation of relatively harder martensite and the TRIP effect during the impact test in simulated FGHAZ. Therefore, how to retain austenite will be the future work of how to improve impact toughness of HAZ.</p>

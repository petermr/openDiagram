0: Lethal concentration (LC 50 and LC 90) and their confidence limits for garlic essential oil and toxic compounds were determined by logistic regression in dose-response assays based on the concentration Probit-mortality 59 using XLSTAT-PRO (v.7.5) program for Windows 60.
1: Students t test was used for pairwise comparisons regarding lethal time effects in  T. molitor using SAS User software (v. 9.0) for Windows 61.
2: Repellency data larvae and adults of  T. molitor were transformed using formula   and analyzed by one-way ANOVA.
3: A Tukeys Honestly Significant test (HSD) was also used for comparisons of the means in the bioassays at 5% significance level using SAS User software.
4: Respiration rate were subjected to two-way analyses of variance (time  insecticide treatment) and Tukeys HSD test (P < 0.05) when appropriate (PROC GLM).
5: As the time interval was assessed in different insect samples, they are not pseudoreplicates in time and therefore subject to regular two-way analyses of variance instead of repeated measures analyses of variance using SAS User software.

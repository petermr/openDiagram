<p>Pathway enrichment of APAU genes was conducted in the Reactome Pathway Knowledgebase [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], a manually curated and peer-reviewed relational database. Strikingly, APAU-gene-populated pathways were highly enriched in ribosomal proteins important in signal recognition peptide (SRP) protein targeting, Cap-dependent protein translation, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-13-00218">Supplemental Table S2</xref> The individual genes included numerous members of the ribosomal protein L (RPL) family (RPL-2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 23, and 32), ribosomal S protein (RPS-A, 4X, 15A), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor (EIF4A) (

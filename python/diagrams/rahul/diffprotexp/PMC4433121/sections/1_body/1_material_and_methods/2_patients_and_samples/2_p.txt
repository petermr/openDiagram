0: The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of sections routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to the WHO classification of thyroid tumors [ 1].
1: Clinical information was retrieved for all cases from cytology and pathology reports and medical records.
2: MIB-1 proliferation index was determined by routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the MIB-1 antibody against the Ki-67 antigen.
3: Expression of thyroglobulin was assessed by IHC in the routine clinical setting.
4: For cPTCs, the tumor size was determined as equal to the diameter of the cyst (for intracystic tumors) or as a sum of the cyst and the extracystic tumor component (for tumors with additional tumor growth outside the cyst).

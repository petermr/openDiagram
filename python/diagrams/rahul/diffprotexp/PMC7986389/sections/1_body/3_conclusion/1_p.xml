<p id="Par45">We present several new methods for cancer gene prediction. Our WMFVS method uses differential gene expression to select MFVSs, improving the stability of the general MFVS algorithm and obtaining a much better result than the differential gene expression-based method when the weights of the genes are well defined. Our WFVS method is a variant of WMFVS, which aims at finding an FVS in the network that contains the maximum total weight. This method obtains better recall than WMFVS by sacrificing precision. Thus, generally, if the researcher wants to reveal as many potential cancer genes as possible, WFVS is better; if the researcher prefers better precision, then WMFVS is better. Furthermore, since WFVS ignores the restriction of the output size, it focuses more on the vertex weight than WMFVS. Therefore, if the researcher has good confidence in the weight definition, i.e., the weights are closely related to the classification, WFVS will have a better result than WMFVS. We can see this from the data analyses on the MsigDB data set, which has the highest enrichment score on our defined weights. However, in many cases, since we are not sure whether the defined weights are closely related to the classification, using WMFVS will maintain better precision for the prediction.</p>

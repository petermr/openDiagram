<p>The PPI network of the DceRBPs was established by using the STRING database, which incorporated 134 nodes and 315 edges (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Then, we searched the hub genes from the PPI network by using the MCC algorithm of CytoHubba plugin (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). According to the MCC score, the top 30 highest-scored genes were selected as the hub RBP genes (

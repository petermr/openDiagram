 </sup>. In summary, the results from our analysis of hippocampal RNA-seq data suggest coordinated functions of specialized local translation and localization of mRNAs to synaptic compartments occurring along the proximal-distal axis, principally through the combined contributions of GE and APA regulatory layers. Further research will be required to determine the specific functional roles of differential mRNA localization and translational control in defining proximal-distal hippocampal neurons.

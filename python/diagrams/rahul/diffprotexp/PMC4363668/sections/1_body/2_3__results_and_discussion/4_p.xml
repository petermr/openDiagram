<p>Protein DJ-1, also called PARK7 protein, is encoded by the dj-1 gene, which was described to be involved in the antioxidant response of the cells and is a redox-responsive cytoprotective protein with diverse functions. DJ-1 protein was observed to be downregulated at 1 to 24 hpi. This may be due to redox potential of cells infected with EV71 is decreased; thus, the protein expression is decreased compared with control. We analyzed the DJ-1 protein by western blot analysis and found the protein is downregulated from 1 to 24 hpr (

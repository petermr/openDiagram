<p id="par0105">The comparison of FV-PTC with benign tissues showed increased expression (fc ≥10) of the proteins regulating the energy metabolism. For example; the expressional magnitudes of pyruvate carboxylase, members of branched-chain alpha-keto dehydrogenase complex, NADPH:adrenodoxin oxidoreductase and ADP/ATP translocase 2 were significantly higher in FV-PTC lesions (p &lt; 0.05, fc ≥10), suggesting a change in energy metabolism. However, the fact that the expression of most proteins remained unchanged between FV-PTC and benign tissues underlies the proteome similarities and clearly demonstrates the controversial diagnosis of FV-PTC.</p>

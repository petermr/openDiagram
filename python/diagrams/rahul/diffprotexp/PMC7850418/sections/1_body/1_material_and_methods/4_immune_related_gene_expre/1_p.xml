<p>Confluent CaLu-3 cells were inoculated in triplicate with wild-type or ORF6 deletion strains at 0.2 MOI and incubated for 24 h at 36°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. For basal transcriptomic levels, a mock infection condition was also tested in triplicate. Cellular RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, DE) after supernatant removal and cell lysis directly in the culture vessel. Purified RNA was quantified with the Qubit RNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA). Host gene expression was evaluated using an 87-gene panel (Supplementary Table 1) with NanoString technology. Data treatment was performed using nSolver analysis software (version 4.0, NanoString Technologies). To normalize for differences in RNA input we used the geometric means over four housekeeping genes (

0: Figure 4Catalytic Effect of Cobalt Components in the Deposition Process of Active Mn Compound(A) Comparison of CVs (0.1 mV s   1) of coin-type batteries using -MnO   2 cathodes with or without cobalt modification.
1: (B) Comparison of LSV profiles (positive sweep, 1 mV s   1) of stainless steel (SS) and SS covered with pre-electrodeposited Co(OH)   2.
2: (C and D) (C) Mn 2p   3/2 XPS profiles and (D) digital photographs of the samples after the LSV positive sweep to specific potentials.
3: (E) First two CV cycles (1 mV s   1) of SS with pre-electrodeposited Co(OH)   2.
4: (F) Illustration of mechanism of the catalysis effect via Mn self-catalysis (Route 1) and via cobalt-induced catalysis (Route 2).Note that results in (BE) are obtained based on a home-made electrochemical cell (See    Figure S9A).

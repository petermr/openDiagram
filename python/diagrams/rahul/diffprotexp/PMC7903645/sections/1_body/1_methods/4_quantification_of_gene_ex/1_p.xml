<p id="Par36">We used Cufflinks with the strand-specific library option, −-library-type = fr-firststrand, and other default options to quantify the mapped reads on the reference genome into gene expression values [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The gene annotation of the reference genome hg19 from the UCSC genome browser database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) in GTF format was used as the gene model, and the expression values were calculated in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped reads. The DEGs between the CI and control groups, and between the CI-preterm and CI-term groups were analyzed using Cuffdiff software in the Cufflinks package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To compare the expression profiles among the samples, the normalized expression values of the selected DEGs were unsupervised clustered by in-house R scripts. Volcano plots for the expression-fold changes and adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic> values between the two groups were also drawn using in-house R scripts.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. The peaks at 1581 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1365 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> correspond to the symmetry and antisymmetric stretching vibration of nitro groups (–NO
 <sub>2</sub>). These two peaks were wider with higher wavenumbers than other nitro compounds. It means the nitro groups may connect to other atoms. The intensity of stretching vibration of –OH (3421 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), Ar–O (1280 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), C–OH (1089 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), O–C–O (1047 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), and bending vibration of –OH (1390 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) become weaker after nitrification. The 13C NMR spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00058-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) of NG has been used to determine the nitrogen-contained functional group. The graphene lattice is all sp
 <sup>2</sup> hybrids, and the chemical shift in the range from 120 ppm to 130 ppm would be regarded as graphene lattice [

 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-11-00058" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Two peaks located at 148 ppm and 157 ppm have been detected that are corresponding to the nitro group and nitrate group respectively. The intensity of donor groups (C–OH at 68 ppm and C–O–C at 57 ppm) drop significantly in the NGO diagram. Characteristic peaks of epoxy and hydroxyl both in FTIR spectra and 13C NMR spectra are greatly reduced. The content of carbonyl has a weak change. From the analysis of FTIR spectra and 13C NMR spectra, GO was nitrated to NGO successfully.

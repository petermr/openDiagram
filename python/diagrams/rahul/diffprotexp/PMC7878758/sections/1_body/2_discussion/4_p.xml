 </sup> and mTORC1 were found upregulated most prominently in the early stages of tail regeneration. Based on Gene ontological biological function RARRES1 is associated with negative regulation of cell proliferation, PCLAF is associated DNA repair and regulation of cell cycle, ADRM1 controls positive regulation of growth hormone receptor signalling pathway and MAP3K7 is associated with interleukin-1 mediated signalling pathway. mTORC1 and ANGPT17 genes were found to be involved in transcriptional regulation, homeostasis, cell growth regulation and metabolism. It has been well known that mTORC1 gain of function leads to neural stem cell differentiation and loss of function associated with limitation of differentiation and neuron production

 </sup>. The downregulated TMBIM6 was found to be associated with autophagy and negative regulation of apoptotic process.

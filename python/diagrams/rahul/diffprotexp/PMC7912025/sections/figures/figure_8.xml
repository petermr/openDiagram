  <p>Annotation and expression of NFκB/RelA AS forms. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Transcript annotation for NFκB/RelA. Exons are numbered at the top, relative to the RefSeq annotation; genomic coordinates are indicated. Coding exons are indicated in black; noncoding exons are indicated in blue. PacBio sequence identifiers are at the left. PB6969.5 is a novel transcript. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantitation of the most abundant RelA transcripts from short-read RNA sequencing. Data are presented as transcripts/million (TPM). Note that RSV infection induces major isoform switching, resulting in DIU.

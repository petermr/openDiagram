0: The 100 g ingots of all alloys listed in  Table 2 and the 150 g ingot of BT0 were prepared by arc melting Ti, Zr, Cu, Co, and Be pure metals (purities are over 99.9 wt.
1: %) under a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere.
2: As the chemical homogeneity was achieved after re-melting four times, the melts solidified into semi-spherical ingots within the water-cooled copper crucibles.
3: The as-cast rods with diameters of 2 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm of BT48 and the as-cast rods with diameters of 10 mm of other BT X were prepared by copper-mould casting after re-arc melting the master ingots in high-purity argon atmosphere.

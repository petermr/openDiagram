<p>In order to minimize the high resistance for ion transport at the polymer/ceramic electrolyte interface, the barriers for Li ions migration across the interfaces between polymers and ceramics can be greatly reduced by modifying the ceramics. Chinnam and Wunder
 <xref rid="advs1507-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">120</xref> developed a feasible solution to address this issue. The inorganic lithium ion‐conducting glass ceramics (LICGCs) Li

 <xref rid="advs1507-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>c). After silanization, the PEG‐silane/LiTFSI shows superior contact with SiO
 <sub>2</sub>‐LICGCs, which provide crucial lithium ion‐conducting channels to considerably decrease the interfacial resistance. In addition, the ball milling at low velocity and temperature is a simple and low‐cost way to facilitate the uniform dispersion of ceramic fillers in polymer host and construct more efficient interface between ceramic and polymer.

0: Inclusion-induced acicular ferrite (AF) nucleation has been used for microstructure refinement in steel.
1: Austenitization conditions have a significant influence on AF nucleation ability.
2: In this paper, the effects of austenitization temperature and holding time on the transformation behaviors of low carbon steel containing TiCa oxide particles were studied.
3: A thermal treatment experiment, high temperature in situ observation, and calculation of Mn diffusion were carried out.
4: The results indicate that small austenite grain size under low austenitizing temperature promoted grain boundary reaction products.
5: With an increase in austenitizing temperature, the nucleation sites transferred to intragranular particles and AF transformation was improved.
6: The inclusion particles in the TiCa deoxidized steel were featured by an oxide core rich in Ti and a lesser amount of Ca and with MnS precipitation on the local surface, which showed a strong ability to promote AF nucleation.
7: At a low austenitizing temperature, Mn diffusion was limited and the development of Mn-depleted zones (MDZs) around inclusions was not sufficient.
8: The higher diffusion capacity of Mn at a high austenitizing temperature promoted the formation of MDZs to a larger degree and increased the AF nucleation ability.
9: Boron segregation at large-sized austenite grain boundaries played an important role in AF transformation.
10: Austenite grain size, Mn-depleted zone development, and boron segregation at grain boundaries were the decisive factors influencing the transformation behaviors under different austenitization conditions for the test steel.

<p>Unexpectedly, we observed larger difference between “responder” and “non‐responder” samples at baseline with skewed expression of many of the same proteins that changed in response to gluten (

 <xref rid="advs2293-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; Table S2, Supporting Information). Biological pathways enriched in “responders” versus “non‐responders” at baseline correlated with biological pathways enriched in “responders” after versus before challenge (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2293-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>; Table S3, Supporting Information). “Shared Down” pathways reflect loss of intestinal absorptive function which agrees with reduced expression of several enterocyte proteins (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2293-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>; Table S3 and Figure S4, Supporting Information). “Shared Up” pathways represent innate immune activation, interferon/cytokine responses and complement/acute phase processes (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2293-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>; Table S3 and Figure S4, Supporting Information). Proteome analysis of laser capture microdissected samples from only the apical part of the epithelium from a subset of baseline biopsies separated "responders" and "non‐responders" (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2293-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>; Figure S5, Supporting Information) and confirmed an increase in complement cascade proteins in the epithelium of “responders” at baseline (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2293-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>; Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). These findings demonstrate that inflammatory processes, of which many are similar to those induced by gluten, are already ongoing in the intestinal epithelium of “responders” at baseline.

<p id="Par41">Each SCX fraction was analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS. Prior to separation, 5 μL of each peptide fraction was injected onto a 100 μm × 25 mm sample trap (New Objective, Woburn, MA) to remove salts and contaminants. Peptide separation was performed on a 75 μm × 10 cm C
 <sub>18</sub> column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) using a gradient from 98% solvent A (95% ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O and 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% FA) and 2% solvent B (80% acetonitrile and 20% ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O containing 0.1% FA) to 40% solvent B over 180 min with a flow rate of 300 nL/min on an Eksigent nanoLC (Thermo Scientific Inc.). Mass spectrometry data were collected using an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc.). A DDA “top 10” method was used with an isolation window of 3 around the precursor and 35 normalized collision energy value (NCE). Full MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer over the m/z 300–1800 range with resolution 60,000 and MS/MS resolution was 7, 500 with a minimal signal of 2.00E + 03. The MS proteomics data are deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium (

<p id="Par32">In vitro techniques are often applied in the banana industry for producing large-scale disease-free plantlets with higher yield potential. However, as a result of such processing, somaclonal variations often appear, which are considered as one of the major disadvantages for such techniques [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, the variants derived from tissue culture processing, however, are a good source of research materials suitable for a comparative transcriptome and metabolome analysis. Pisang Awak (
 <italic>Musa</italic> spp.) is a cultivated banana sub-group with high yield and superior taste quality, which is widely grown in Asian countries as a desert fruit but for juice/brewing in African countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Normally, the plants of Pisang Awak varieties are vigorous with a height around 4.5–5.5 m. In our 
 <italic>Musa</italic> collections, there is a dwarf Pisang Awak variety ‘Aifen No. 1’ (wild type, WT), of which the height is around 2.0–2.5 m. Recently, a semi-dwarf mutant (MT) with the height 2.8–3.5 m, was identified by screening the somaclonal variations from ‘Aifen No. 1’ tissue cultured plants. Previous studies showed that hormone biosynthesis pathways are responsible for such variations [

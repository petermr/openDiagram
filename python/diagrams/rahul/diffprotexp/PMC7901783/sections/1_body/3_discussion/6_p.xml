<p>The primary plant-derived small RNAs (miRNA and siRNA) are necessary regulatory factors for modification of endogenous or exogenous gene expression through either mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition. RISC factors such as DCL and AGO have crucial roles in miRNA and siRNA biogenesis. Since, in other plants DCL and AGO factors have been identified based on cleaved nucleotide size and 5’ terminal base of sRNAs [

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in this study we conclude that miRNA sizes of 21 nucleotides were cleaved by DCL1, and the single stranded RNAs with 5’U are loaded on AGO1 to guide the RISC to regulate the target genes. In

 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244364.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, in quinoa, the dominant nucleotide size of 24nt, which are known as hc-siRNAs and had the 5’A bias, were likely generated by association of DCL3, AGO4/6/9, and RDR2. Also, in our analysis presence of endogenous siRNAs with different sizes (21–27 nt) could be attributed to the function of RDR2.

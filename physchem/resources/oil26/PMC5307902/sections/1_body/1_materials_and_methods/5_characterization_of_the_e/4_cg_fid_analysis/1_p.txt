0: The quantification studies were performed on a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph (model GC-2010 Plus, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column DB-1 dimethylpolysiloxane (30mx 0.25 mm, 0.25 micron), and a flame ionization detector was used to analyze the samples.
1: [ 31] The carrier gas was N 2 with a flow of 1.3 ml/min., split 1:100, injector temperature 260C, detector temperature 280C, initial column temperature equal to 60oC heated at a rate of 10C.
2: min -1 up to 92oC for 3 minutes, followed by a heating rate of 10C/min up to 120C and a rate of 20C/min up to 280C.
3: The injection volume was 1.0 l. The calibration curve from a commercial sample of carvacrol [Sigma-Aldrich, Chicago, IL, USA] was obtained by recording the peak areas against the known injected amount contained in the same injected volume (1 ml).
4: The analysis was performed in triplicate.

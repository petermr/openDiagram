 <caption> ER Stress in VD. UPR markers were determined in post-mortem human brain samples from SNpc, Hippocampus and Cortex of VD patients and controls. The levels of GRP78 and ATF4 were determined in: ( A) SNpc; ( B) Hippocampus and ( C) Cortex brain tissue homogenates. ( D) Densitometric analysis of the levels of GRP78 and ATF4. The blots were re-probed for α-tubulin to confirm equal protein loading Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5, **p &lt; 0.01, versus SNpc control subjects; ##p &lt; 0.01, versus hippocampus control subjects; &amp;p &lt; 0.01, versus cortex control subjects). Full length blots are presented in the Supplementary Information. </caption>

0: A list of ACE2 orthologs from 318 vertebrate species was downloaded from the NCBI Web site ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59272/ortholog/?scope=7742).
1: Besides these, we also considered the ACE2 orthologs from three mammals that are not included in this list, namely, palm civets, raccoon dogs, and Chinese rufous horseshoe bats, as civets and raccoon dogs were suggested to be intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
2: 15 Additionally, it was shown that the ACE2 proteins of civets and horseshoe bats can also be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry in cell-level experiments.

<p id="p0115">To further characterize tumor type-specific pathway activation profiles, we used average PAL values to build radar-charts for the 15 differential DNA repair pathways for the FA, FC, and PC tumor types (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> A,D,G). We did not consider medullar thyroid cancer and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer because these tumor types did not have enough samples to enable statistically robust investigation. For most of the pathways, this analysis revealed downregulated activation pattern in FA, strongly enhanced pattern in PC, and intermediate pattern in FC (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, A,D,G). However, the observed activation patterns did not relate to the two pathways associated with passing through the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The 
 <italic>ATM Pathway G2-Mitosis progression</italic> pathway was strongly downregulated in all the tumor types investigated. The 
 <italic>Biocarta cell cycle g2 m checkpoint pathway</italic> showed another trend: it was upregulated in FA and to a lesser extent in FC, and downregulated in PC (

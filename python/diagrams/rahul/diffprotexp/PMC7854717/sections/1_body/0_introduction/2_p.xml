<p id="Par3">There are important left–right differences in the mean arterial pressure between systemic and pulmonary circulation measured invasively in mice. The mean RV systolic pressure of 16.3 mm Hg

 </sup> leads to a five times greater LV workload compared to RV. There are also LV-RV differences in intraparietal tension, oxygen consumption and metabolic stress, resulting in higher susceptibility to oxidative stress, reduced angiogenic response and higher likelihood of activation of cell death pathways

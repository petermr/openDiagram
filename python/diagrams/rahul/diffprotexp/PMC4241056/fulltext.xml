Many animal experiments and clinical studies had indicated that Se plays an important role in diverse physiologic actions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The essentiality of Se depends on its role at the catalytic site of multiple selenoproteins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), thioredoxin reductase (TRR), and deiodinases (ID) are also some of the enzymes with Se in their structure. These enzymes perform many important biological functions. The reduction of hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by GSH-Px through the reduced glutathione. As for TRR, it catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the redox protein thioredoxin
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. ID regulates thyroid hormone bioavailability. The above enzymes play a critical role in reproduction, antioxidation, muscle function, and tumor prevention
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although Se is an essential element, its margin between the lowest acceptable level of intake and toxicity is very narrow. According to a previous study, sodium selenite stimulated Caco-2 cell proliferation at low concentrations (10 to 100 nM) but inhibited growth at higher doses (&#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;M) in serum-free medium
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The toxicity and bioavailability of Se depend on the chemical form, physiological state, different absorption characteristics, and metabolic pathways
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In nature and organisms, Se presents as organic (such as selenomethionine (Se-Met) and selenocysteine (Sec)) and inorganic forms (selenide (Se<sup>2-</sup>), selenate (SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), selenite (SeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), and Se)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Selenium nanoparticles (nano-Se) is referred to as red or elemental Se, existing as nano-sized particles which usually between 20 and 100 nm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It has been reported previously that nano-Se has high biological activities and low toxicity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] when compared with other forms of Se. As one of the nanoparticles, nano-Se would have some special physiochemical and biological properties
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the differences of bioactivity and metabolism of different forms of Se deserve investigation.</p><p>It is well known that the small intestine is the main region for absorption of Se
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and thus it becomes the target organ for Se research. In the intestine of mice, the Sec-containing metabolite is produced by the reaction between Sec and GSH after oral administration of Sec
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The Caco-2 cell, differentiated human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, is usually used to mimic human intestine as the cell model. This cell is considered to present morphological and enzymatic characteristics of small intestinal cells and has been generally well accepted for estimating human absorption of various drug and nutrient compounds
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the Caco-2 cell model, treated with Se in different chemical forms, was established to investigate the corresponding differentially expressed proteins using basal proteomics methods including two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Therefore, the same concentration of Se at 100 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> were used in the present study to evaluate and determine the differential protein expressions in the Caco-2 cells treated with sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of nano-Se</title><p>Nano-Se was prepared according to the previous method described by Zhang et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] through the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the redox system of selenite and glutathione (GSH). In the present study, 2-mg BSA was dissolved in 4-ml 25-mM GSH and then 1-ml 25-mM sodium selenite was added. The pH value was adjusted to 7.2 using sodium hydroxide.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A conserved core sequence composed of about 150 amino acids from the -NH<sub>2</sub> terminus consisted in E2 proteins, and cysteine residue is necessary in this region, which plays an essential role in the formation of thiol ester bond with the -COOH terminus of ubiquition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this study, the expressions of E2 proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with Se were all higher than that of the control groups, and the highest expression of E2 proteins was obtained in the nano-Se groups. Higher expression of E2 proteins indicated the increase of cysteine. Compared with the groups fed with adequate or supranutritional selenium, the significantly decreased levels of plasma homocysteine and cysteine were found in the rats and/or mice fed with selenium-deficient diet
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The homocysteine can be converted to cystathionine and cysteine, formed from cystathionine, can be incorporated into protein
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, the three forms of Se may accelerate cysteine increase in the Caco-2 cells and then promote the expression of E2 proteins, and nano-Se has the optimum efficiency to increase cysteine and the expression of E2 protein.</p><p>GS catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of glutathione (&#x003b3;-glutamyl- cysteinyl- glycine; GSH) from &#x003b3;-glutamyl-cysteine(&#x003b3;-GC) and glycine. And &#x003b3;-GC is an intermediate which is produced by &#x003b3;-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) from the amino acid substrates glutamate and cysteine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As described in the E2 protein, Se can accelerate the amino acid substrates cysteine increase, so the activities of GCS could be stimulated subsequently. This hypothesis was verified in the rat liver, and the results indicated that the increase mediated by Se in the activities of GCS was observed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the present study, the expressions of GS in the groups treated with different forms of Se were all significantly higher than those of the control groups. In addition, the GS in the groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met were also significantly higher than those treated with sodium selenite. However, the levels of GS were similar and there was no significant difference between groups of nano-Se and Se-Met. All the different forms of Se may increase the activities of GCS in Caco-2 cells, and nano-Se and Se-Met are more effective than others. The increased production of &#x003b3;-GC should be attributed to the enhancement of GCS activities and then the expressions of GS were stimulated to adapt the demand of synthesis of GSH from &#x003b3;-GC and glycine.</p><p>TSP isomerase catalyzes the reversible interconversion of G3P (glycerol-3-phosphate) and DHAP (dihydroxy acetone phosphate). TSP isomerase is essential for energy production, because only G3P can be used in glycolysis. TSP isomerase allows two molecules of G3P to be produced for every glucose molecule, hence doubling the energy yield. In Se-enriched yeast (SEY), the level of TSP isomerase is lower than that found in regular yeast (RY)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present study, the levels of TSP isomerase in groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met were lower than those treated with sodium selenite and without Se (control). As for the level of TSP isomerase in SEY, it can be concluded that the Caco-2 cells can assimilate more nano-Se and Se-Met than sodium selenite at the same concentration. Nano-Se treatment had been demonstrated to present a higher accumulation of Se compared with sodium selenite treatment in the medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] with the similar exposure way of the present study. Therefore, in this study, nano-Se and Se-Met are more effective in absorption by Caco-2 cell than sodium selenite, with the results that TSP isomerase performed down regulation.</p><p>TCPZ is the &#x003b6; subunit of T-complex protein 1 (TCP1), known as chaperonin-containing T-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) or TCP1 ring complex
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Regardless of cell type, the expression level of CCT depends on cell growth rate. The upregulation of CCT is to meet the increased requirement for assistance in the folding of proteins which are actively synthesized during cell growth
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. HnRNP-F is one of the constituents of the splicing-related hnRNP complex and is related to the pre-mRNA cleavage reaction in the mammalian nucleus. And it seems that hnRNP-F might also be related to the cells growth
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Different forms of Se exposure induced the different expressed levels of TCPZ and hnRNP-F in Caco-2 cells. Compared with the control groups, significantly more downregulation was found in TCPZ and hnRNP-F of the groups treated with Se. However, no significant differences were observed in TCPZ and hnRNP-F between groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met. The results indicate that nano-Se has the similar impact with Se-Met to regulate the growth of Caco-2 cells.</p><p>The SOD, as a key enzyme in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anion to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In chicks, Cu, Zn-SOD activity was at the higher level if the diet Se was deficiency compared with the normal diet. Se and the increased activity of SOD could be linked with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the present study, the expressions of Cu, Zn-SOD in three Se treatment groups were lower than that of the control groups. It suggested that the less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in the Se treatment groups is associated with the lower expression of Cu, Zn-SOD. In addition, the similar levels of Cu, Zn-SOD were observed between groups treated with nano-Se and Se-Met.</p><p>As for lamins, they are important structural components of the nuclear lamina and play a role in nuclear architecture, DNA replication, and gene expression. The lamin-B1 mutant mice provide evidence for a broad and nonredundant function of lamin-B1 in mammalian development
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In the present study, the downregulated lamin-B1 was observed in Caco-2 cells treated with Se. In addition, nano-Se and Se-Met also had the similar levels of lamin-B1, and there was no significant difference. It might be related to the metabolic pathway of these two forms Se in Caco-2 cells and the interaction between both nano-Se and Se-Met and lamin-B1 was similar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the differentially expressed proteins were determined in Caco-2 cells treated with/without Se (sodium selenite, Se-Met, and nano-Se) using the methods of 2D-PAGE and MS. Thirty spots represented reproducible upregulated or downregulated changes in different Se treatment groups were compared with those of the control, and finally, seven proteins were identified as E2, GS, TSP isomerase, TCPZ, lamin-B1, hnRNP F. and Cu, Zn-SOD. The present study provides the foundation for further understanding the mechanism of proteins associated with Se in Caco-2 cells. In addition, different results were observed in the groups treated with nano-Se, a novel form of Se particle, and thus the reasons and related mechanisms should be investigated in the future study.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LF carried out the cell culture, image analysis, and protein identification studies and drafted the manuscript.

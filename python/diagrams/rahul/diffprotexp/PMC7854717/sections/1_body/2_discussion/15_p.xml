<p id="Par44">We did not perform the pathway enrichment analysis because all pathways built by specialized software (KEGG, PathVisio, GenMAPP, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, GO-Elite, DAVID, Cytoscape etc.) are artificially universal, unique and rigid that we consider far from reality. Such constructed pathways are universal because their internal organization is the same regardless of race/strain, sex, age, tissue, medical history, (micro and macro) environmental conditions etc. They are unique because they provide only one wiring of the genes, although even two chemical elements (H &amp; C) can combine to form a wide variety of hydrocarbons. Finally, they are rigid because the gene interconnections do not change during maturation/ageing, progression of a disease or response to external stimuli. By contrast, numerous published reports have shown that the pathways: (1) depend on race

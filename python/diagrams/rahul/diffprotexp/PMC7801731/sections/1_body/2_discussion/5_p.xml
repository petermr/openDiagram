 </sup>. Diverging expressions were found mostly with ECM-related genes such as collagen alpha-1, laminin alpha 1, stromelysin-3 (MMP II) and developmental related Hox 9 (see supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S7</xref> online). In all cases, these genes were upregulated in our previous microarray study, whereas they were downregulated in our RNA-seq. As mentioned earlier we posit the differences between our results and previous studies stem from what each study used as a point of comparison to determine the gene expression profile. In all previous studies, the adult non-eviscerated intestine was used as the reference point to determine differential expression. However, as explained earlier, the ratio of the area of connective tissue to that of the mesothelium in the early intestinal rudiment is much smaller than in the adult intestine (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moreover, the adult intestine has a prominent mucosal layer that does not appear in the intestinal rudiment until the second week of regeneration. Therefore, the relative changes in cell/tissue distribution between the early regenerate and the fully formed organ are a clear cause for a skew in the resulting gene expression profile. Thus, the expression differences in previous studies might reflect differences in cell or tissue gene expression rather than differences in regeneration stages. On the other hand, our study takes these facts into account and focuses on a comparison with the normal mesentery which is a more trustworthy point of comparison because of similar distribution of cells and tissues.

<p>Another aspect is that in general, if cooling becomes faster, precipitation is increasingly suppressed, and the amount of heat released decreases with increasing cooling rate when approaching the UCCR. This is because precipitation reactions are diffusion-controlled, and diffusion is increasingly suppressed if the time available shortens. One very important aim of these studies from a technological point of view is the detection of the UCCR at which precipitation during cooling is completely suppressed, i.e., at which all alloying elements dissolved during solution annealing remain in a supersaturated solid solution. The UCCR is very relevant in technological applications, and it is shown below that the maximum age-hardening potential can be exploited only if the alloy is cooled at the UCCR or faster. However, faster cooling may result in undesired residual stresses and distortion of age-hardened aluminium components [

Although this is of lower importance for extrusions or rolled products, which are stretched after quenching, residual stresses and distortion are very important for complex cross-section extrusions and net-shaped cast and forged products.

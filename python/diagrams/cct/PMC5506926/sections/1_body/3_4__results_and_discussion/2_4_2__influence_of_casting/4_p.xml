<p>It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00420-t003">Table 3</xref> that, for a certain melt level, we can get a faster cooling rate with using the CP mode, and also nip temperature is lower than that under OSP mode. On the other hand, however, it is not expected to get a temperature too low at the roll nip because the special properties of metallic glass. Fully solidified metallic glass deforms hardly due to its very high strength. Therefore, we can use the OSP mode to adjust the strip temperature at nip for a certain melt level.

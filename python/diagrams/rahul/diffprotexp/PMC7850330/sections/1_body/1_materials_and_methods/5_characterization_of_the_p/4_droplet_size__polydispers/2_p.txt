0: The droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the selected nanoemulsions were investigated through dynamic light scattering adopting N4Plus submicron particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, UK).
1: Samples were appropriately diluted with distilled water and measured at room temperature.
2: The average values of three measurements  SD were recorded.
3: A conductivity meter (CM 180) was used to determine the electrical conductivity of the selected nanoemulsions by direct dipping of electrode into the sample at 25 C.

<p>A total of 50 μg of each protein fraction from each biological replicate was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with CBB. Each lane was processed into 5 gel slices and subject to pyridylethylation and in-gel trypsin digestion as described previously 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Peptides were extracted once in 100 μL of 1% formic acid and subsequently twice in 100 μL of 50% acetonitrile in 5% formic acid. The volume was reduced to 50 μL in a vacuum centrifuge prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.

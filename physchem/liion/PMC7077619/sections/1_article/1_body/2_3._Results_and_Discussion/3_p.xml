<p>In the FT-IR spectrum, the peaks are observed at the range of 3000 to 3500 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> attributed to the &#8211;OH stretching, the tiny bending in the wave number around 1635 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> assigned to H&#8211;O&#8211;H bending, the deformation of C&#8211;H group indicated at 1380 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The asymmetric stretching of Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si appeared at 1040 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and the &#945;-Crystal nature of PVdF indicated at 864 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. &#946;-phase crystal of PVdF intimated around 474 and 840 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> [<xref rid="B26-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

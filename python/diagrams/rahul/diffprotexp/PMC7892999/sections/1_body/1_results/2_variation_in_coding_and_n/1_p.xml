 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Considering the global gene variation of the 12 evaluated libraries (i.e., three for each phenotype/tissue combination), the color phenotype was clearly the main source of variation (PC1, 49%), while the tissue specificity factor was also important albeit less significant (PC2, 18%), (Fig.Â

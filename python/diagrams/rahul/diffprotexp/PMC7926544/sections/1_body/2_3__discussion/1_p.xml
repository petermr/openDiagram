<p>This study was conducted to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of NKCC2 transit through the ER. Here, we have identified STCH and Hsp70 as two novel interacting partners of the immature and ER-resident form of NKCC2. In contrast to Hsp70, the implication of STCH in the ERAD of misfolded proteins has never been directly investigated. Here, we have found that STCH and Hsp70 differentially regulate the protein expression of NKCC2 and its diseasing causing mutants. Indeed, whereas STCH enhances the ERAD of NKCC2, Hsp70 exerts the opposite effect by promoting the maturation of the co-transporter. Interestingly, the ERAD of NKCC2 mediated by STCH involves both the proteasome and the lysosome pathways. The reciprocal control of NKCC2 stability and maturation by STCH and Hsp70 may open new avenues in the treatment of diseases related to abnormal NKCC2 trafficking.</p>

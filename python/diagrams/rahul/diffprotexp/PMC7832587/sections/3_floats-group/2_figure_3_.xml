  <p>Deglycosylation assays of PcCdc50B and PcCdc50A co-expressed with PcATP2. Membranes co-expressing PcATP2/PcCdc50B, PcATP2/PcCdc50A or Drs2p/Cdc50p were enzymatically deglycosylated with PNGase F or EndoH, as indicated. 10 µg total protein were loaded in the experiments with PcATP2/PcCdc50B and PcATP2/PcCdc50A, whereas 5 µg of total protein were loaded in the control experiment with Drs2p/Cdc50p. The western blots were revealed with the HisProbe
   <sup>TM</sup> to detect the 10xHis tag.

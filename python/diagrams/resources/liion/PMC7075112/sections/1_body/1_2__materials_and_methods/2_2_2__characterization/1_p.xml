<p>The phase of as-prepared samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-TTRIII, Tokyo, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation. The Raman spectra was identified on a Lab RAM HR800 (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) with a 632-nm laser. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Tokyo, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100, Tokyo, Japan) were used to characterize the microstructure and morphology of the sample. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was performed on V-Sorb 2800P (Jinaipu, Beijing, China). The specific surface was analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was performed to obtain pore size distributions.</p>

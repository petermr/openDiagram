 <caption> Influence of designed mole fractions, x, on the two-phase quasi-equilibrium. The precipitation of β-Ti is more difficult as x becomes smaller and the liquidus temperature also decreases, causing the T n –lines and T e –lines to shift to larger times and lower temperatures. The T n –lines, T e –lines, and T f –lines of BT95, BT60, BT30, BT20, and BT15 and the crystallization curve of the remaining liquid of BT15 are drawn. The cooling curves (indicated by the diameter or the weight of the samples) of the as-cast rod with a diameter of 10 mm and the ingot of 100 g obtained by equation (2) are also plotted. There are two cooling-rate dependent critical values: and . If the cooling curves do not intersect the T n –line ( ), fully amorphous are the outcome. If the cooling curves intersect the T n –line but not the T e –line ( ), non-equilibrium BMGCs will be obtained; if the cooling curves intersect the T e –line ( ), quasi-equilibrium BMGCs will be achieved, and then the fraction of β-Ti can be precisely controlled by the lever rule. In the as-cast rods with diameters of 10 mm of current BT X, , . </caption>

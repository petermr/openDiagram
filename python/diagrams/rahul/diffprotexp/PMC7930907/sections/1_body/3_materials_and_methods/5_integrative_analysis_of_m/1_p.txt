0: Top 100 DEGs and differential metabolites (top 50 upregulated and top 50 downregulated) were selected for further correlation analysis by calculating Pearsons correlation coefficients on the relative gene expression and metabolite content data between different VASCs with SASCs ( Supplementary Table 9).
1: The correlation value and  P-value were used to assess the relationship between metabolites with genes which are shown by Heatmap and association analysis network diagram.

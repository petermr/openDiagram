<p>Using all of the dAPA genes as a background, we found functional enrichments for the genes that are differentially expressed in protein and not in mRNA. We identified small but significant enrichments for a number of sets related to vital cellular processes such as ribonucleotide binding, protein-containing complex binding, nuclear transport, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. We also found a number of gene regulatory components and processes enriched for genes with species-specific PAS compared to all genes where we identified a PAS.</p>

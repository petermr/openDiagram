<p>The 2-DE results indicate a significant change in the protein expression pattern (
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). According to the t-test statistical analysis, 108 spots were differentially expressed with p &lt; 0.05 as the threshold. Among these, 32 spots were up-regulated and 76 spots were down-regulated, with pre-induction cells being used as the control. When the p-value threshold was set to p &lt; 0.01 and differential expression greater than 2 fold was taken into account, 30 spots were found to be differentially expressed, with 10 being up-regulated and 20 being down-regulated. These 30 protein spots were subjected to identification using the mass spectral method with software against NCBI or Swiss-Prot databases. Only three proteins were successfully identified and these are listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0145542.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Among these three proteins, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NM23-H1) was down-regulated by the neuronal differentiation, whereas kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5B, UKHC) and protein kinase C epsilon type (PKC-Îµ) were up-regulated.

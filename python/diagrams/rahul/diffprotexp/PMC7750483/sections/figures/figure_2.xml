  <p>Expression of m
   <sup>5</sup>C writers and reader in GI cancer. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Based on RNA sequencing data from the TCGA database, a heat map of m
   <sup>5</sup>C writer and reader expression was drawn. Data were collected from cancer patients (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1,568) and healthy patients (
   <italic>n</italic> = 139). Each sample was normalized and was represented by a square. Red and blue regions represented higher and lower expression levels, respectively. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> RNA sequencing data were used to compare the expression level of each m
   <sup>5</sup>C regulator between tumor and normal samples in different GI cancer types.

<p>The primary and secondary structures of 49 differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. A Mascot-based retrieval in NCBI was performed to reject repetitive results, and finally 23 proteins were identified (22 from the ischemia group and ischemia/reperfusion group, and one from the sham-surgery group).</p>

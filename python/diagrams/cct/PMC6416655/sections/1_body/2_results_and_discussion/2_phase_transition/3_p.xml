 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref> which is the thermal expansion curve of high-alloy mould steel slab, the black line is the heating curve, and the blue one is cooling curve. These results are the phase transition during cooling. In the CCT curve of high-alloy mould steel, the temperature at which pearlite transforms to austenite (Ac1) and the final temperature at which all the ferrite is converted to austenite (Ac3) were 1002 K and 1076 K, and the starting temperature of the transformation of austenite to pearlite during cooling (Ar1) and the critical temperature line of ferrite precipitated from austenite during cooling (Ar3) were 562 K and 672 K, respectively. During the cooling process, there was only martensite transformation without bainite transformation. The Ar1 and Ar3 were low resulting in increasing the hardenability and cracking susceptibility.

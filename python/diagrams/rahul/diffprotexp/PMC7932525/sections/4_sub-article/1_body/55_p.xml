<p>ï¿½ The reference has been added in revised paper as the 31th reference. Ferimazova et al confirmed mature heterocysts were found to have an intact PSII in vivo at single-cell level by chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic microscopy, and the possible importance of the functional PS II in heterocysts is discussed [Ferimazova et al. Photosynthesis Research, 2013, 116(1): 79-91.

We conclude that both PS-I- and PS-II-related genes were expressed in heterospores, which is inconsistent with a previous study that reported that heterocysts lacked PS-II (Cardona et al, 2009, Tel-Or and Stewart, 1977, Thomas, 1972). Conclusively, we can say that at least PS-II inactivation or degraded did not occur at the transcription level.

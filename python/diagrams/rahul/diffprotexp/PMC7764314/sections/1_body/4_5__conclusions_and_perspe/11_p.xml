<p>In conclusion, as the availability of genome-wide data on gene and protein expression, proteinâ€“protein interactions, transcription factors binding, non-coding RNAs, SNPs, mutational analysis and epigenetic modifications is rapidly growing, it is becoming increasingly essential to enhance the power and reliability of computing methods aimed at faithfully reconstructing the cell environment 
 <italic>in silico</italic>. Compared to the widely employed co-expression networks, differential co-expression networks confer the key advantage of allowing a more precise reconstruction of disease-specific gene interactions, depleted of aspecific basic cell functions. Improving the precision of these reconstructions also via experimental or clinical validation will lead to predictive models of increasing precision, allowing for the formulation of stringent unbiased hypotheses related to the molecular causes of cancers, their resistance to drugs and the identification of the best alternative therapeutic targets.

<p>In this study, to distinguish specific biomarkers among different histological grades, we first collected all datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and select the analyzed a microarray (NO:

This microarray included 24 normal specimens, 14 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1) lesions, 22 CIN2 lesions, 40 CIN3 lesions and 28 cancer specimens, and found top 24 candidate biomarkers which were highly or lowly expressed in different histological grades, with KRT17 and CRISP2 being the most significant. The further IHC results suggested that KRT17 was dominantly expressed in the cervical squamous cancer and barely expressed in the normal cervix; while CRISP2 was specifically lowly expressed in HSIL.

<p>Collectin-11 decreased significantly in stage III and IV adenocarcinomas compared to earlier stages. Collectins are a family of collagenous calcium-dependent defense lectins in animals [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Collectins are humoral molecules of the innate immune system that modulate inflammatory and allergic responses, the adaptive immune system, and clearance of apoptotic cells [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Collectin-11 is directly related to cancer and the human immune system. In stage I and stage II lung cancer, collectin-11 is elevated because the human immune system is still in the early stage of cancer development. In stage III and stage IV cancer, collectin-11 is decreased, by the massive proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells, a process that destroys the normal immune system. This report is the first to identify changes in collectin-11 in lung cancer, which can be used as a marker for staging non-small-cell lung cancer.

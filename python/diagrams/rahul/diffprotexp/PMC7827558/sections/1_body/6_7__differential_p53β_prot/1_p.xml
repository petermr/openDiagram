<p>The shortened/altered C-terminal tail of p53β is the only difference between p53β and FLp53 in terms of the linear amino acid sequence. The C-terminal domain of FLp53 protein contains several sites for post-translational modifications, especially acetylation and ubiquitination, as well as domains for protein–protein interactions and oligomerization. It will be intriguing to explore how the replacement of the C-terminal tail of FLp53 by a short, new 10-amino-acid sequence in p53β will change the protein interactome of p53β and to determine which changes in this interactome contribute to the distinct cellular effects of p53β compared to FLp53, specifically the senescent phenotype versus programmed cell death. To begin to address these questions, we used two independent and complementary systems of p53 expression: GFP-TRAP and BioID. For the former, we generated GFP-FLp53-inducible and GFP-p53β-inducible SY5Y cell lines. After doxycycline-induction, GFP-FLp53 and GFP-p53β proteins were pulled down by GFP-TRAP beads and bound proteins were identified by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). This system permits the determination of differences in strong interactors of the FLp53 protein versus the p53β protein. Initial MS screening after GFP-p53FL or GFP-p53β pulldowns identified proteins such as SMG5, SMG7, MDM2, and MDM4 as interactors with GFP-p53FL, but not GFP-p53β (

These proteins all require the p53 oligomerization domain (lacking in p53β protein) for interaction, so they serve as reassuring positive controls for the system’s ability to successfully identify differential binding partners. Interestingly, about 71 proteins had ≥2 fold more binding to p53β than to FLp53 and 50 proteins showed ≥2 fold less binding to p53β than to FLp53. Thus, differential cofactor binding occurs between p53β and FLp53.

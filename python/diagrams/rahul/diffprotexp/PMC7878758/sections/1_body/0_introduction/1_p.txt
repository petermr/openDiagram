0: Regeneration is a sequential process specifically controlled by cellular mechanisms to repair or replace tissue or organ from an injury.
1: The mass of undifferentiated cells (blastema) surrounding the injured tissue results in the formation of fully functional replica or imperfect replica which enacts the phenomenon of epimorphic regeneration 1,  2.
2: The ability to regenerate a full limb is absent in mammals but urodeles; teleost and anamniotes have the propensity to replace limbs, spinal cords, nervous system, heart, tail and, other body parts 1  3.
3: To understand the mechanistic framework of regeneration, research studies have been majorly executed in urodeles amphibians 4 and teleost fishes 1.
4: Though amniotes i.e.
5: lizards are closely related to mammals and other vertebrates, limited studies 5,  6 have been carried towards understanding the molecular mechanism of regeneration.

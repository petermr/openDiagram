<p>High temperature melting test and DFT calculation have been further conducted to investigate the structural stability of the obtained 3D Li–B–Mg composite. The results are respectively shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e,f. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e clearly shows the intact structure of the Li–B–Mg composite plate (no free Li melts out) even when it is heated to a high temperature of 288.6 °C. In comparison pure Li has melted into a ball shape under this high temperature condition. This investigation clearly demonstrates a strong structural stability under high temperature condition. To further study the chemical affinity between lithium alloy skeleton and lithium, we calculated the adsorption energies of Li on different sites and substrates by using the DFT and the results are illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f. From Figure 
 <xref rid="advs1513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, it can be seen that the adsorption energy is −2.03 eV between a Li atom and the top Li atom of the LiB skeleton. However, when Li is adsorbed on the top of B atom in the LiB, the adsorption energy has decreased to −2.63 eV, which suggests a stronger adsorption preference in the LiB substrate (LiB–Li2). The strong interaction between LiB and Li facilitates the absorption of Li
 <sup>+</sup> by the LiB skeleton, highlighting its lithiophilicity and availability of the host. The influence of Mg toward the affinity to Li has been also studied. In the first place the adsorption energy between Li atom and the unoccupied site and the bridge site of Mg metal are found respectively to be −1.49 and −1.48 eV. After Mg was introduced into the LiB compound, the calculation indicates an enhanced adsorption energy of Li (by about 0.19 eV relative to the adsorption energy (LiB–Li2) of −2.63 eV). The results declare an important role played by Mg atom and the enhanced chemical affinity of Li to the skeleton in the presence of Mg is thus obtained.

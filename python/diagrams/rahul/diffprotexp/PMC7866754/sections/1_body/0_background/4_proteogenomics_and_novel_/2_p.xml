<p id="Par13">The use of proteogenomic approach has gained its popularity given the increasing amount of transcriptome data available thanks to next-generation sequencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], as well as the improved accuracy and resolution in MS data for proteomics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For the larger human genome, it has been used to identify novel coding regions in normal tissues and cancer cell lines, where a significantly larger number of novel peptides were discovered in the latter, indicating the biological importance of unannotated coding sequences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The proteogenomic methods are particularly valuable for non-model organisms like 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, whose genome assembly and annotation tend to be incomplete, and protein database construction is difficult owing to the lack of close sequence relatives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Previous successful examples include 
 <italic>Thermococcus gammatolerans</italic>, an archaea extremophile whose genome was sequenced and annotated using proteogenomic analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

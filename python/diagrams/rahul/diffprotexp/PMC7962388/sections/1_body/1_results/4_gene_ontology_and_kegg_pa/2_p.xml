<p id="Par59">A similar GO analysis was conducted for DEATs (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>), but this time up- and down-regulated entities were not distinguished due to the low number of candidates involved. We were able to identify sequences involved in mRNA surveillance and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis modulated only at premeiosis; others related to cyanoaminoacid metabolism modulated during postmeiosis; and pentose/glucuronate interconversions, vitamin B6 metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism and fatty acid elongation occurring exclusively at anthesis. Interestingly, DEATs related to endocytosis and spliceosome resulted exclusively regulated at two developmental stages: meiosis and anthesis (Additional files

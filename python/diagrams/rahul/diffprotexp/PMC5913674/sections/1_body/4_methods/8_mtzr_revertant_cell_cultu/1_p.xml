<p>Trophozoites from the lines 106-MtzR and 713-MtzR were cultured in TYI-S33 in the presence of Mtz as above and designated passage 0 (P0). Subsequently, Mtz drug selection was discontinued, and isolates were subcultured twice weekly without Mtz. MtzR revertant cultures were preserved every 4 weeks. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined for cells at P8, P16, and P24 relative to susceptible parent isolates as detailed in Section 2.1 in Ansell et al. [

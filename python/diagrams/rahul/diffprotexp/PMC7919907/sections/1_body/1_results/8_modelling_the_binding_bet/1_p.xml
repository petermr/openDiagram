<p>LF is a single chain 80-kDa iron-binding glycoprotein that belongs to the transferrin family. It contains two symmetric N- and C-globular lobes. Multiple studies have shown that the heparin-binding site of BLF is located at the N-terminal domain of the N-lobe, which contains a cluster of positive charges spanning residues 17â€“41 [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This positively charged domain confers to the antiviral activity against adenovirus [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], papillomavirus [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and echovirus 6 [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The trypsin digested N-terminal peptide lactoferricin alone is sufficient to prevent adenovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It was found that the N-terminal domain of BLF is more negatively charged than HLF (
 <xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8(A) vs. 8(B), and 8(C)</xref>), which might explain the more potent antiviral activity of BLF than HLF in inhibiting human papillomavirus, HSV, and HCMV [

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our data similarly showed that BLF is more potent than HLF in inhibiting common human coronaviruses including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(A) vs. 1(B)</xref>). To gain insights how BLF binds to HSPGs, we chose the bovine lactoferricin (PDB: 1LFC) [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and dp4 (PDB: 5E9C) [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] as structural models of BLF and HSPGs, respectively. Docking model showed that the negatively charged sulfate in dp4 engages multiple electrostatic interactions with the positive charges from Arg25, Lys27, and Arg39 (

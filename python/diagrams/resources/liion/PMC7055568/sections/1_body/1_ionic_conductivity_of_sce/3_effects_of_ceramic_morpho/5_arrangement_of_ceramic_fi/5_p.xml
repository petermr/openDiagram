<p>Except for the 3D ceramic framework, the ceramic fabrics manufactured by electrostatic spinning and template synthesis are another commendable reinforcement to improve the performance of SCEs, which endow the SCEs with high mechanical strength and ionic conductivity. Since the nanofibers could effectively provide long‐range and smooth conduction pathways for Li‐ions, well aligned Li

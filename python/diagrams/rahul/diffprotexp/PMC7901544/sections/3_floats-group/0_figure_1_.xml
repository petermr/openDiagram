   <bold>Fiber-2 efficiently interacted with host KPNA3/4</bold>. (a-b) LMH cells infected with FAdV-4 were immunoprecipitated with mAb 3C2 against Fiber-2. The cell lysates and the immunoprecipitates were examined with western blot using polyclonal antibodies against KPNA3 (a) and KPNA4 (b). (c-d) LMH cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-F1 or pcDNA3.1-F2 were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against KPNA3 (c) and KPNA4 (d). The cell lysates and the immunoprecipitates were examined with western blot using chicken sera against FAdV-4. All experiments were performed for three times with comparable results

<p>We attempted local 
 <italic>de-novo</italic> assembly of the transgenic insertion but were unsuccessful (data not shown). Our inability to generate an assembly for the transgenic insertion likely results from two limitations in our approach. The first is our use of short read sequencing alone (100-bp paired end), and the second is our choice to sequence the genomic DNA of a hemizygous 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic>
 <sup>Â±</sup> mouse. The first limitation can be overcome by targeted sequencing after identification of the transgenic insertion region with traditional chain terminator sequencing alone or in combination with long-read sequencing [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Both approaches add considerable effort and cost but may be necessary depending on the scientific question and model generated. With regards to the second limitation, genomic DNA sequencing of mice homozygous for a 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgene may not be possible due to the 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgene being targeted to the native promoter of a cell- or tissue-specific gene that is required for mouse development or survival. With regards to the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse, we chose not to attempt breeding the mouse strain to a homozygous state as this was not attempted by the donating investigator and would have presented difficulties in properly genotyping the resulting mice (one copy versus two copies), and may have resulted in lethality due to 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> gene alteration. An attempt to generate a homozygous animal may provide additional insight into the model. We nevertheless demonstrated that identification of the 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgene insertion can be made in hemizygous 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mice, with the potential to generalize our approach to other 
 <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mice.

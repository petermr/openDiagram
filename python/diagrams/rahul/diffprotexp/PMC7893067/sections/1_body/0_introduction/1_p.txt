0: The mammalian transcriptome harbors a myriad of coding and non-coding RNA transcripts, with biogenesis, abundance and subcellular localization tightly regulated to match the physiology and function of the cell.
1: Genome-wide technologies such as RNA sequencing have been instrumental in characterizing the transcriptome architecture.
2: However, transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing has primarily been performed on total or polyA + RNA from whole cells, overlooking the spatial dimension of gene expression at the subcellular level.
3: Nevertheless, an increasing number of reports are pointing to the importance of investigating the subcellular repertoire of RNA molecules and understanding the mechanisms that govern their distribution inside the cell 1  4.
4: Subcellular RNA localization is widespread and conserved from bacteria to mammals, and it is becoming evident that this process plays crucial roles in regulating gene expression 5,  6.
5: For mRNA, subcellular localization provides a means to spatially control protein production and target proteins to their site of function 7  11.
6: Therefore, the differential distribution of mature mRNA between the nucleus and the cytoplasm may have a direct impact on protein expression levels.
7: In fact, it has been recently shown that nuclear retention of mature mRNA is a mechanism that involves a wide range of protein-coding transcripts.
8: This nuclear retention is believed to ultimately fine-tune mRNA translation in the cytoplasm 12.
9: Similarly, identifying the subcellular localization of non-coding RNA such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can provide substantial insights into their biology and function.
10: Based on the link between localization, function, and regulation it is important to map the subcellular localization of coding and non-coding RNA in different cells and tissues to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of RNAs biological functions.

<p id="Par28">When comparing pre-operative with post-operative samples in the No-LCOS group, there was up-regulation of metabolic pathway associated genes such as 
 <italic>UQRC1</italic> (1.75 fold), 
 <italic>COX8A</italic> (1.21 fold), and 
 <italic>CYC1</italic> (1.21 fold). In contrast, comparison of post-operative samples over pre-operative samples in patients who developed LCOS revealed down regulation of metabolic pathway associated genes like 
 <italic>UQRC1</italic> (0.63 fold), 
 <italic>COX8A</italic> (0.49 fold), 
 <italic>CYC1</italic> (0.22 fold). Furthermore, in patients that developed LCOS there was an increase in 
 <italic>STAT5B</italic> (2.11 fold) an inflammatory signaling associate gene (Fig.Â

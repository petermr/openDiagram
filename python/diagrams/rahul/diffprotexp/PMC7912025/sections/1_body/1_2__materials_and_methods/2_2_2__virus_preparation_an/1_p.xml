<p>The human RSV long strain was grown in Hep-2 cells and prepared, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The viral titer of purified RSV pools was varied from 8 to 9 log PFU/mL, determined by a methylcellulose plaque assay [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Viral pools were aliquoted, quick-frozen on dry ice–ethanol, and stored at −70 °C until they were used. The virus was adsorbed onto the surface of hSAECs in submerged culture for 2 h prior to washing at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Mock infected cells were used as controls.

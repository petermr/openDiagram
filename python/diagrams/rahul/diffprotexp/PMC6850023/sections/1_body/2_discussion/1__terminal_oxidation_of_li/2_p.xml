 <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> contains alternative enzyme systems to AlkB for terminal oxidation of alkanes (Figs. 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="emi14620-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), including three CYP153 cytochrome P450s; ABO_0201 (P450‐1/P450‐c), ABO_2288 (P450‐2/P450‐b) and ABO_2384 (P450‐3) (Schneiker 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). The expression of ABO_0201 and ABO_2288 was higher on 
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>14</sub> than pyruvate, suggesting it can terminally oxidize medium‐chain alkanes. ABO_2384 was not expressed on 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>14</sub> suggesting it may act on different substrates. A similar trend has been observed in other bacteria with multiple CYP153s. For example, 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> sp. HXN200 possesses five CYP153 genes, three of which show activity towards 
 <italic>n‐</italic>C
 <sub>5</sub>‐
 <italic>n</italic>‐C
 <sub>10</sub>, whereas no affinity for these substrates was observed for the other two genes, suggesting that these genes are either pseudogenes or act on different substrates (Van Bogaert 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). P450‐1 and P450‐2 are phylogenetically grouped in one branch with CYP153A1 from 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. EB104, which was experimentally confirmed to catalyse terminal alkane oxidation (Maier 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Schneiker 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; van Beilen 
 <italic>et al.,</italic>
 <xref rid="emi14620-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). The coexpression of AlkB and CYP153 may cooperatively ensure that 
 <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> can utilize a broader range of linear substrates.

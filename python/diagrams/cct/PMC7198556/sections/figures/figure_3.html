 <caption> Micrographs of the hardened zone. ( a) Taken at 1000 μm depth: pure martensite with some manganese sulphides. ( b) Taken at 2500 μm shows the first occurrence of ferrite (circled) indicating that the material does not entirely reach Ac 3 any more due to local differences in chemistry (segregations). In ( c) at a depth of 4000 μm, the original ferritic areas only partly transformed into the austenitic phase, remaining in their original structure of the base metal. In ( d), the first traces of pearlite are found at 4400 μm, where some of the microstructure did not transform into austenite, indicating that the end temperature for Ac 1 transformation was not reached at this depth. </caption>

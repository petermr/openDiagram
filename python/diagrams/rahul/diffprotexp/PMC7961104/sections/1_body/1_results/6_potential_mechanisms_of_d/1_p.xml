<p id="p0150">Because there is limited understanding of how obesity affects the main cycles between liver and skeletal muscle metabolism through the blood, we generated inter-organ metabolic networks for three cycles: the glucose-alanine cycle, the glucose-lactate cycle, and the ketone body cycle. Liver provides gluconeogenesis activity, whereas skeletal muscle consumes glucose through glycolysis. These processes are linked through two cycles (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sarabhai and Roden, 2019</xref>). Alanine is transported to the liver and converted into glucose, which is then released into the circulation and taken up by skeletal muscle. This cycle is the glucose-alanine cycle (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Felig, 1973</xref>). Skeletal muscle converts glucose to lactate, which is then transported to the liver for conversion to glucose. This cycle is called the glucose-lactate cycle (Cori's cycle) (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cori and Cori, 1929</xref>). When glucose is limiting, ketone bodies provide a source of energy from fatty acid degradation (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cahill et al., 1966</xref>). Therefore, we explored potential mechanisms of how dysregulation of the liver and skeletal muscle trans-omic subnetworks of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis for glucose-alanine and glucose-lactate cycles (

<p>To minimize contamination of samples by stromal cells, we selected the block that contained the largest amount of tumor tissue from each patient. Extraction of crude proteins from these tissue blocks was carried out as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], with minor modifications. Briefly, 10 tissue sections (each 10 μm thick) were deparaffinized in 1 mL of xylene with gentle agitation for 5 min. After removing the xylene, 1 mL of 100 % ethanol was added and the sections were agitated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 15,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was thoroughly dried under a vacuum for 10 min. Then, 100 μl of extraction buffer from the Qproteome FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was added to the dewaxed tissue pellet, followed by incubation on ice for 5 min, vortex mixing, and heating at 100 °C for 20 min and 80 °C for 2 h in a Thermomixer at 750 rpm. After centrifugation at 14,000
 <italic>g</italic> and 4 °C for 15 min, 10 μL of the supernatant was used to measure the protein content by the Lowry method [

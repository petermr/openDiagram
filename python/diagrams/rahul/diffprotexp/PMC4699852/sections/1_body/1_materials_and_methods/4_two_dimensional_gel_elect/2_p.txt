0: 2-DE was carried out using a previously published protocol [ 18 19].
1: Samples of protein precipitate (approx.
2: 100 g protein) were mixed with rehydration buffer containing urea (7 M), thiourea (2 M), CHAPS (2% w/v), DTT (50 mM), and Bio-Lyte ampholyte, pH 310, (0.2%), and the resultant mixture was applied to a 18 cm nonlinear pH 310 IPG strip (GE Healthcare) settled in the slot of a strip holder (BioRad) and rehydrated at 50 V for 16 h. Proteins underwent isoelectric focusing in a Protean IEF Cell (BioRad, Hercules, CA) programmed as follows: 500 V for 1 h; 1000 V for 1 h; 1000 to 8000 V within 2 h; 8000 V for 7 h; and finally 500 V for 12 h. The total voltage-hour for IEF was 65 kVh.
3: After isoelectric focusing, strips were equilibrated in 2 sequential equilibrium buffers containing 2% (w/v) DTT and 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide for 15 min.
4: Electrophoresis in the second dimension was carried out on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Protean II xi Cell (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
5: Five replicates were performed in this study.
6: Gels were then stained as previously described [ 20] with a modification consisting of the reduction of the concentration of silver nitrate to 0.2% (w/v).
7: Stained gels were scanned on an ImageScanner densitometer (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) at 300 dpi resolution with a blue filter and images were analyzed by ImageMaster 2D platinum software (version 5, GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT).
8: The expression level of each protein spot was quantified by the %vol, defined as the value of the intensity integration over the feature area of one spot divided by the total intensity integration over all of the spots in the whole gel image.
9: The t-test was used for testing a difference in spot %vol between the two groups, before and after differentiation.

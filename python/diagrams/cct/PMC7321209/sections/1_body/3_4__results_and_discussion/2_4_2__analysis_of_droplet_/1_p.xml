<p>Chapter 4.1 verified alterations in short circuit frequency with adapted CTWD throughout the analysis of electrical properties. Referring to the state of the art, increasing CTWD leads to the formation of large volume droplets during material transfer in GMAW [

 <xref rid="B32-materials-13-02491" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Experimental investigations with a high velocity video recording confirmed a constant droplet growth with increasing CTWD. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows droplet formation in GMAW with differing CTWD of 12 mm, 28 mm and 44 mm at characteristic points during the short arc welding regime and correlated to the circled numbers in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b. The increase of CTWD is shown in uniform step size of 16 mm for equal welding parameters. Thereby, the formation of a new droplet on the electrode directly after short circuit phase is shown (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, circle number 3) as well as droplet growth during arc time (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, circle number 4). Furthermore, the maximum droplet size is displayed directly before the material transfer in the short circuit phase. The focus of the investigations was set to analyze droplet growth and size before material transition into the melt bead. Therefore, the short circuit phase with material transfer (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, circle number 1) and arc re-ignition (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, circle number 2) is not shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f006">Figure 6</xref>.

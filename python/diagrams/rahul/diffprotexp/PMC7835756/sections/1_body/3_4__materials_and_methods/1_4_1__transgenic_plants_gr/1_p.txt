0: Seeds from the transgenic lines L8 (overproducing H 2O 2) and L1 (acigotic line) obtained in previous works were used [ 41].
1: The seeds were surface sterilized by immersion in 10% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and washed three times with sterile distilled water.
2: The seeds were left in sterile water for three days; then 20 seeds of each line were sowed in flasks with Murashige-Skoog medium with 100 g/mL of kanamycin as a selection agent for the transgene.
3: They were kept at room temperature under a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod.
4: After three weeks the seedlings were transferred into individual pots with Mixture 3 Peat Moss Sunshine as substrate and kept inside a glass chamber at room temperature with humidity of 70% for three days.
5: They were kept in a greenhouse until seed obtaining.
6: The plants were watered daily.

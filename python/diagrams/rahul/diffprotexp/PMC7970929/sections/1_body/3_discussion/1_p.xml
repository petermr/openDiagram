<p id="Par27">In the present scenario of climate change, environmental stresses, particularly salinity stress limits growth, physiology and productivity of crop plants by the over-accumulation of toxic ions such as Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>. The effect of toxicity can be observed by measuring growth attributes, physiological/biochemical traits and yield characters. Most of the plants showed survival by excluding ions/salt from their cells or sequester them into the vacuoles and adopt various strategies to overcome the detrimental effects of stress. The plant responses along with the tolerance mechanisms of various crops have been in research from years but the information is available for few halophytes. Further, transcriptomics studies on salt related pathways/genes in halophytes e.g. 
 <italic>Sueda, Sporobolus, Atriplex, Spartina</italic> etc. are being explored now for development of climate smart crops.

<p>As seen from the above—and which is true for every engineering material—the structure of the material at micro- and nanoscales affects its properties. Thus, for several metallic alloys, changes in the inner structure due to solid-solid phase transformations control the properties. This includes not only mechanical properties such as strength, ductility and toughness, but also corrosion properties and others. The precipitation of secondary phase particles from a solid solution represents a solid-solid phase transformation. In technological applications, solid-solid phase transformations are typically adjusted by controlled heat treatments. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows a schematic diagram of the time-temperature profiles of some heat treatments that are relevant to the production of Al alloys. In addition to heat treatments, the production may incorporate several forming operations such as rolling or extrusion (at ambient or elevated temperatures), which substantially influence the microstructure. In addition, rolled or extruded products with relatively simple cross sections may experience a stretching treatment subsequent to the quenching process within the age-hardening treatment (prior ageing). This stretching causes relief of residual stresses induced by quenching, straightens the products and increases the dislocation density and thereby the nucleation site density for nanoscale precipitation during the final ageing.

0: Cysticercosis is a parasitic disease that affects humans and swine.
1: It is caused by the establishment of the larval form of  Taenia solium in skeletal muscle and brain tissues.
2: When cysticerci are established in the central nervous system of the host, they cause neurocysticercosis (NC).
3: This potentially life-threatening disease is endemic in rural areas of Latin America, Southeast Asia (India, China, and Nepal) and sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty prevails and hygiene is poor [ 1].
4: Unfortunately, human migration from endemic zones has reintroduced NC in Europe, Canada, and especially the United States, where more than 5000 infected patients were reported in the last decade [ 2, 3].

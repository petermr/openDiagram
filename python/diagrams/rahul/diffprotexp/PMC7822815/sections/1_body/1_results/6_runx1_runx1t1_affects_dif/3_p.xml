 </sup>. The binding site of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 locates in the first intron 6.6 kb downstream of the canonical 
 <italic>PARL</italic> TSS1. Knockdown of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 eliminated its binding to this genomic element and activated 3’-proximally located TSS2 and TSS3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d, e</xref>). In particular transcription of a non-canonical exon from TSS3 and the corresponding exon-exon junction J3 yielded alternative transcript 
 <italic>PARL-03</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). The observed increase in total 
 <italic>PARL</italic> transcript and protein levels in t(8;21) blasts upon RUNX1/RUNX1T1 knockdown was mainly due to alternative transcript 
 <italic>PARL-03</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c, d</xref>). Furthermore, junction J3 was a specific feature of the transcriptomes of primary AML subtypes with a more mature immunophenotype than t(8;21) AML, but of neither t(8;21)-positive AMLs nor normal CD34-positive haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3e</xref>). These data support the notion that the non-canonical TSS3 is activated in some AMLs, but is repressed in the t(8;21) AML subtype.

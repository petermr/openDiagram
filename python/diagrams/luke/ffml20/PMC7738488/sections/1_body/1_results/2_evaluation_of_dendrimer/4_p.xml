<p id="Par13">The Infrared (IR) spectrum of different generations of dendrimers was acquired. The IR spectrum of the synthesized dendrimer 4.0G showed absorption peaks at 3315.74 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for N–H stretching of primary amine, the peak at 2827.74 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for aliphatic C–H stretches, 1514.17 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1448.59 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> peaks for N–H bending and 1149.61 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for C–C bending. A peak at 1654.5 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was assigned for amide carbonyl absorption while a peak at 1568.4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was due to a core N–C stretching. The IR spectrum of the 3.5G showed absorption due to the presence of characteristic quaternary ammonium ion peak at 3282.95 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> as well as carboxylic carbon at 1670.41 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Other peaks include 3001.34 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for N–H stretch, 2700.43 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for C-H stretch and 1188.19 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for C–C bending. Half generation carboxyl terminated shows intense peaks in the -C = O region while full generations show intense peaks in the -N–H stretch for primary amine. The appearance-disappearance reappearance of distinctive peaks stipulates the evidence of synthesis, as shown in Table

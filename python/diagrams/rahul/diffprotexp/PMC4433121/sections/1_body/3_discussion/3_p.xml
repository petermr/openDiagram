<p>We investigated cyst fluids from benign thyroid lesions and cPTCs through global protein profiling using LC-MS/MS. Prior to LC-MS/MS, depletion of high abundant proteins was performed, to reduce the complexity of the samples and increase the chance of finding proteins specific to cPTC. Considering protein level patterns and the significance levels from the LC-MS/MS data as well as availability of antibodies, we selected CMBL, ANXA3, CK-19 and S100A13 for validation by IHC and WB in the same cases as used for LC-MS/MS screening. Further evaluation of CK-19, S100A13 and VIM was performed by ELISA using non-depleted cyst fluid from the extended material of cPTC and benign cystic thyroid lesions as well as cystic reference cases.</p>

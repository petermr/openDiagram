<p>The COL11A1 gene mutation was analyzed on COSMIC database comprising more than 2406 samples of colorectal cancer out of which 249 were recorded for mutations, among them the missense substitution is highest with 51.81% followed by synonymous substitution (15.66%), frameshift mutation (15.66%), nonsense substitution (4.42%) and other types (4.02%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The breakdown of various substitution mutation is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, representing the highest type of G &gt; A (25.73%) and lowest showing T &gt; A (0.58%). To determine and analyze the frequency and type of mutation, cBioPortal server was used where the cancer type summary indicates the mutation along with the various subtypes of colorectal cancer showing mucinous adenocarcinoma of colon and rectum (&gt;12%), colon adenocarcinoma (&lt;12%), and rectal adenocarcinoma (∼6%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The Oncoprint and Mutation tab shows that the COL11A1 gene is altered in 10% of the total 526 patients in TCGA colorectal cancer dataset along with the heatmap for the associated genes (

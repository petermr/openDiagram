0: More than 400 tumors from aGCT patients of diverse ethnicities [ 7] showed one single mutation in the Forkhead box L2 transcription factor gene FOXL2: Cys134Trp (c.402C < G) [ 8], however its role in the onset of aGCTs is still matter of investigation [ 9 14].
1: The mutation is not present in other cancers.
2: FOXL2 is expressed in the ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) and plays a key role during the development of female reproduction system and in its maintenance [ 15 17].
3: Potential FOXL2 targets revealed by ChIP and RT-PCR implicated its involvement in follicular and craniofacial development [ 18 20].
4: It has been also shown that FOXL2 affects collagen synthesis [ 21,  22].
5: Nicol et al .
6: carried out the first ChIP-seq on mouse FOXL2 WT in order to find its direct target [ 23].
7: In 2011, Benayoun et al.
8: demonstrated that FOXL2 plays a key role in the homeostasis of GCs and its failure leads to ovarian aging and tumorigenesis [ 24].
9: This mutation hyperactivates aromatase and downregulates GC apoptosis pathways [ 10].
10: Whole transcriptome analysis of 10 aGCT patient samples showed that the FOXL2 C134W acts as a hypomorphic mutant on the normally FOXL2 WT activated genes [ 25].
11: Another transcriptomic study on several stage 1 and stage 3 aGCT samples identified 24 genes whose expression significantly fluctuated between stages [ 26].
12: More recently, whole genome sequencing of a large aGCTs cohort indicated  TP53 and  DICER1 as potential drivers in these tumors and found a higher mutational burden in recurrent tumors, as compared to primary AGCTs [ 27].
13: However, these molecular events are not frequent as FOXL2 C134W.
14: Recent publications investigated the FOXL2 C134W pathogenicity from a transcriptional perspective.
15: Notably, Carles et al.
16: developed an inducible FOXL2 C134W stable luteinized cell line (SVOG3e) [ 28] which demonstrated that FOXL2 C134W mutation may precisely alter DNA binding specificity.
17: The study revealed low numbers of target genes and the authors noted the SVOG3e cell line may not respond appropriately to FOXL2 C134W.
18: This may be possibly due to the absence of the needed partner SMAD3.
19: Indeed, it is well known that SMAD3, a central element of the TGF pathway, is essential for the FOXL2 C134W activity [ 11,  29 36].
20: In line with this, a recent study by Weis-Banke et al.
21: [ 37], showed that FOXL2 C134W and the TGF pathway are together two important potential therapeutic targets.
22: Indeed, using FOXL2 C134W overexpression and silencing molecular approaches in a non-luteinized GC cell line (HGrC1) treated with TGF, they showed that SMAD4 is also an important FOXL2 C134W partner and the TGF/FOXL2 C134W molecular events trigger the expression of oncogenic, EMT, and stemness pathways in an aGCT model [ 37].
23: It is well accepted that TGF has an important role in tumor progression and involves SMAD mediators that control expression of hundreds of genes in different ways in diverse contexts and physiologies [ 38,  39] although additional investigations are needed to find its specific action(s) in aGCTs.

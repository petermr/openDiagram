<p id="p0030">However, there are rare study and report on the segregation and crack mechanism of a thick one which is more than 400mm with high carbon and alloy. The presentÂ work focuses on the practical process of high-quality mould steel 0.4C1.5Mn2Cr0.35Mo1.5Ni (as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with our innovated LD + CC process. We try to figure out the segregation and crack mechanism on continuous casting slab with high carbon (&gt;0.3 mass%) and alloy (&gt;5 mass%) content.

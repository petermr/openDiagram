0: To date, multiple mutation sites of LMNA (lamin A/C) related to DCM have been reported, such as LMNA-D300N, LMNA-H222P, and LMNA-N195K [ 5 7].
1: Also, increasing researches support that LMNA mutations cause DCM through dysregulation of various molecular pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, AKT/mTOR pathway, and WNT pathway [ 8,  9].
2: Previous evidences had shown that MAPK pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway have abnormal activation in LMNA mutation induced-DCM [ 10 13].

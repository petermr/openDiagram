<p>The infarct size was assessed using TTC staining 2 h after reperfusion. After surgery, the hearts were removed and frozen for 20 min at -20˚C, then transversally cut into sections with a thickness of 1-2 mm. Tissue sections were incubated in 2% TTC for 10 min at 37˚C in dark conditions and then fixed in 10% formaldehyde at 4˚C overnight. Under light microscopic observation, the infarct area was a white color, and the healthy tissues had a red color. The degree of myocardial infarction was represented by the percentage of infarcted area accounting for the left ventricle.</p>

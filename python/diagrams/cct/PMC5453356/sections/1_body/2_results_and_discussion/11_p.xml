<p>Frequently, the published isothermal TTP diagrams show a “C-curve”. This is a consequence of the interaction between diffusion and the number of nucleation sites. At high temperatures, diffusion is fast and the number of nucleation sites is low. At low temperatures, diffusion is slow and the number of nucleation sites is high. Optimal conditions for precipitation processes are located at intermediate temperatures. The three local “C-curve” noses found in the present work should therefore result from different phases or different nucleation mechanisms.</p>

<p id="Par84">While Shh drives motor neuron formation over intermediate neurons, there are multiple subtypes of MNs. In the final stage of MN maturation, we observed that genes encoding ionotropic nAChR (
 <italic>CHRNA3</italic>) and dopamine receptor (
 <italic>DRD2</italic>) were downregulated while adrenergic receptor (
 <italic>ADRA1A</italic>) and mAChRs (
 <italic>CHRM2</italic> and 
 <italic>CHRM3</italic>) gene expression was activated. Since mAChRs are found exclusively on the neurons from the parasympathetic system [

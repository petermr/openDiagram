<p id="p0165">To construct the inter-organ metabolic cycles, we not only used the data from the two trans-omic subnetworks (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B) but also added data regarding the expression of genes encoding relevant transporters and DRTFs that regulate those genes from our transcriptomic analyses. We also used the proteomic data to identify relevant transporters in liver and skeletal muscle. For the glucose-alanine cycle, we added the 
 <italic>Asct1</italic> and 
 <italic>Asct2</italic> encoding amino acid transporters to both skeletal muscle and liver (

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kandasamy et al., 2018</xref>). Although both genes were increased in expression in both organs, the DRTFs responsible for their regulation differed and neither of those transporters were detected in our proteomic data. For the glucose-lactate cycle, we added the monocarboxylate transporter Slc16a1, a major transporter of lactate (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Halestrap, 2013</xref>). Slc16a1 was a DEP that increased in liver but was unchanged in skeletal muscle.

<p>Producing a complete solid solution in terms of the dissolution of the major alloying elements of wrought Al alloys has major importance in terms of utilising the full age-hardening potential. In addition, incomplete dissolution will increase the quench sensitivity of an alloy [
 <xref rid="B148-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. This is because quench-induced precipitation is accelerated by the higher number of available nucleation sites that are present in the form of undissolved secondary phase particles (of the same or a highly similar phase, which precipitates during cooling). More precisely, if undissolved particles remain, nucleation is not necessary and instantaneous growth can take place. In such cases, the hardness after ageing (the age-hardening potential) can be substantially reduced [

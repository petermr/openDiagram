<p>The CCP diagrams for 6082
 <sub>I</sub> and Al0.6Mg0.8Si are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f046">Figure 46</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f047">Figure 47</xref>, respectively. Here, we can see a considerable difference between these alloys, which is caused by the different numbers of nucleation sites and thus different nucleation mechanisms for quench-induced precipitates. A comparison with a CCP diagram for a 6082 alloy obtained from in situ electrical resistivity curves is possible by considering Ref. [
 <xref rid="B85-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B85-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], over a cooling rate range of ≈16–0.03 K/s, the precipitation start temperature was found to be about 375 °C, which is close to the start of the LTR determined by DSC (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f046">Figure 46</xref>). In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B85-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], the end-temperature of precipitation was evaluated to be about 225–300 °C, which is comparable to the end of the LTR identified by DSC. From this, it can be concluded that the in situ electrical resistivity measurements were able to detect the LTR in 6082. It seems likely that the HTRs were not identified by this method; however, the UCCR was determined within a range of ≈16 to 30 K/s [
 <xref rid="B85-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], which is very similar to that identified for 6082
 <sub>I</sub> [

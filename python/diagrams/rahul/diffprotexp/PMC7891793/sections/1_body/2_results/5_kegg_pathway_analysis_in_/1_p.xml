<p>KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the whole transcriptome was performed in the context of comparison of every treatment group with the placebo and how this result is different in lung tissue with lesion and lung tissue without lesion. KEGG pathways with p&lt;0.05 and relevant to the study were selected and grouped (similar to GO terms) into several functional categories: “Innate immune functions”, “Adaptive immune functions”, “Complex immune pathway or response to pathogens”, “Prostanoid synthesis and fatty acid metabolism”, “Oxidative stress”, “Cell adhesion”.</p>

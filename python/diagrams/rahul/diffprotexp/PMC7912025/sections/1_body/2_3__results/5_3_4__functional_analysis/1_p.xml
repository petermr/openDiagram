<p>DIU genes were analyzed for pathway over-representation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f005">Figure 5</xref>). From this analysis, we observed that DIU transcripts were significantly enriched in the cell cycle, innate signaling, and chromatid separation in mitosis pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The same set of DIU genes was subjected to pathway enrichment analysis in the Reactome Knowledgebase. Over 15 highly significant pathways were identified; the top 10 over-represented pathways are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f005">Figure 5</xref>B. Of these, endosomal processing, antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing, and IFN cytokine signaling were identified as having a significant fraction of the pathway represented. The pathway enrichment and genes mapping to them are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-13-00218">Supplemental Table S3</xref>. We noted that the interferon-stimulated genes, including MX Dynamin-Like GTPase 1 (MX1/2), HLA-B,C, IFN-Induced Protein with Tetratricopeptide Repeats (IFIT1,2,3), 2′-5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 1 (OAS)-L/3, Interferon-Stimulated Exonuclease Gene 20 (ISG20), and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF7 were major genes constituting these pathways. The individual genes and values are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-13-00218">Supplemental Table S4</xref>. We noted that both analyses showed substantial signals of cell cycle regulation and IFN signaling.

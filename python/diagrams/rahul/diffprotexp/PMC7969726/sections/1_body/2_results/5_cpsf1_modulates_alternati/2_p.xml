<p>Gene Ontology analysis further demonstrated that these AS events were enriched in biological functions related to RNA splicing, viral processing, and protein or vesicle transport (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>), which was similar to the enrichment results in APA-related genes. Next, we searched the STRING database to identify proteins that were validated to be coexpressed and interact with CPSF1. Interestingly, the top 50 proteins sorted by interaction confidence score included splicing factors (SRSFs), nucleoporins (NUPs), ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs), and the CPA complex (CPSFs), together with several RBPs assisting the transcription and translation processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). The network of proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs) indicated that CPSF1 regulated both AS and APA by cross-interacting with multifunctional proteins that regulate RNA processing, reflecting the connection between AS and APA.

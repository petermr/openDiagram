0: HUMEC and MCF7 cells were grown to 7080% confluence in a 10 cm dish before splitting into a 96 well plate.
1: Approximately 4  10 3 cells were seeded in each well and AS6 was applied according to indicated concentrations.
2: After 2472 h incubation, 10% (v/v) of water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST, DoGen Inc., South Korea) was added to each well, following the manufacturers instruction.
3: Intensity of orange color developed from the enzymesubstrate reaction was measured at 450 nm using spectrophotometry (BMG Labtech, Germany).
4: Cell images were taken by Olympus IX-71 microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with objective lenses (Olympus LUCPLFLN20X, Olympus, Japan), a camera (Olympus XM10, Olympus, Japan), and a light source (Olympus TH4-200, Olympus, Japan).
5: Images were acquired, using CellSens Standard Imaging software (Olympus, Japan).

<p>The examples discussed in this Review illustrate the broad possibilities provided by the XAS method for catalysis research. In particular, XAS has become a method of choice for studies of electrocatalysts, often providing not only key information regarding the structural motifs in the as-prepared precatalysts but also in depth insight into the dynamic chemical, structural, and electronic transformations of the catalysts under reaction conditions.</p>

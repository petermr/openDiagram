  <title>Cluster of functionally connected GO terms in LN and their associated genes in the comparison of treatment group 6 vs 2.</title>
  <p>Differential gene expression analysis in LN across treatment groups showed DE genes in treatment group 6 versus 2. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these genes (p&lt;0.05) was conducted and results were visualized as a map of predicted connections among significantly enriched GO terms and related genes.</p>

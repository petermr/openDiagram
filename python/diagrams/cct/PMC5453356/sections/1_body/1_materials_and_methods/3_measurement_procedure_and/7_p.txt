0: The continuous cooling precipitation diagram of the batch of aluminum alloy 6005A investigated here is available [ 31].
1: Out of this diagram, one can read the critical cooling rates.
2: Two main temperature ranges exist that must be considered: high-temperature (HTR) and low-temperature (LTR) precipitation reactions [ 27, 31].
3: Each of those has its own known critical cooling rate [ 27, 31].
4: The critical cooling rates of 6005A are 6.3 K/s for the LTR and 0.67 K/s for the HTR.

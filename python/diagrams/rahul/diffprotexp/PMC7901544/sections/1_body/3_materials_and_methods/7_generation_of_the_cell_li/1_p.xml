<p>LMH cells seeded in the 6-well plate were transfected with sgRNAs targeting the KPNA3 or KPNA4 genes. 48 h post-transfection, 6 μM of puromycin was added to the transfected LMH cells. The LMH cells without sgRNA cassettes were then killed within 3–5 d. KPNA3-KO or KPNA4-KO LMH cells were then isolated by serial dilution, followed by an expansion period to establish a new clonal cell line.</p>

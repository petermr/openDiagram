<p id="Par40">This approach was applied to both putative novel proteins and canonical proteins, where the latter have annotated protein lengths that allow one to verify the feasibility of estimating full-length ORFs from PSMs of six-frame translated transcripts. By searching the MS/MS spectra against the customized transcriptome database, 2901 and 2933 canonical proteins in oocyst sporozoite and salivary gland sporozoite were identified, respectively, as compared to 1432 and 2040 proteins identified by Lindner et al. [

The results for the protein-length normalized spectral abundance factors (SAF) for canonical proteins were then compared with those reported by Lindner et al. The protein abundances (in SAF) that were computed for canonical proteins in the samples from two stages correlated strongly with the published data (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4b), with correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.91 for oocyst sporozoite and salivary gland sporozoite, respectively, indicating that one could deduce the ORFs for novel peptides using this method (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3) as well.

<p>Spinal cord tissue proteins were separated using CyDye DIGE Fluor saturation dye-labeled two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and study of differentially expressed proteins was achieved by image analysis using DeCyder software system. Using the spinal cord protein expression spectrum from the sham-surgery group as a standard, protein expression spectra at two different time points, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., ischemia for 60 minutes and ischemia for 60 minutes followed by 48 hours of reperfusion were established (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Protein spots from the ischemia group and ischemia/reperfusion group with a 2-fold expression difference compared to the sham surgery group, were included for further analysis. In total, 49 protein spots with obvious differential expression were screened. Compared with the sham-surgery group, 25 proteins were up regulated and five proteins were down regulated in the ischemia group, and 16 proteins were up regulated and three proteins were down regulated in the ischemia/reperfusion group.

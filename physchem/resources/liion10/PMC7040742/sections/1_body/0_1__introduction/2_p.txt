0: The estimated recycling rates reported in the literature fluctuate significantly; although they are highly variable from one geographical region to the other, they have still been low [ 14].
1: For example, Call2Recycle, the main organization responsible for the collection of end-of-life LIBs in Canada, reported collecting less than 200 tons of LIBs in 2017 [ 15].
2: While Gies et al.
3: determined that this quantity corresponded to a collection rate of 25% [ 8], we believe that their assessment was an overestimation considering the sale volumes of electronics and electric vehicles (EV).
4: As bench marking, based on electronic device sales statistics, Wang et al.
5: estimated the North American recycling rate was lower than 10% in 2012 [ 14].
6: As another comparison, the collection rate reported by Eucobat in Europe in 2016 was slightly higher than 15% [ 16].
7: Considering these data and the inability of the current pyrometallurgical processes to recover Li, Li recycling from spent LIBs is estimated to be lower than 1% [ 17], which is obviously not in agreement with the principles of sustainable development.
8: Therefore, it is imperative to increase both the collection and recycling rates of LIBs.

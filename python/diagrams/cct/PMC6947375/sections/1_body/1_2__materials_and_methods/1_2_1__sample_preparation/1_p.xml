<p>Typical 1.0C-1.5Cr steel was used in this study. The alloy was melted in a vacuum induction furnace, and an ingot was cast (300 × Ф 50 mm
 <sup>3</sup>). The alloy’s chemical composition, measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, is listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-04136-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The calculation using JMatPro software showed that the austenite-starting temperature (

 <sub>c1</sub>) and austenite-finishing temperature (

 <sub>c3</sub>) were 751 °C and 817 °C for the investigated steel. Using various cooling rates from 0.1 °C/s to 100 °C/s, the measured phase transformation diagram for the studied steel indicated (

<p>Following the cell type classification above, the germ cell population was extracted for in-depth analysis; according to the results, cell heterogeneity was not dependent on cell cycle genes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>A) and cells in the four groups were classified as twelve cell clusters (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A-B). In addition, marker genes in each germ cell cluster were identified (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S2</xref>), and the top five genes are displayed in a heatmap in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>B. Among them, several key genes involved in biological events were highlighted, including meiosis (
 <italic>Meioc, M1ap</italic>), PF assembly (
 <italic>Figla, Lhx8</italic>), and oocyte growth (
 <italic>Zp3, Padi6</italic>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>C). Specifically, the representative genes, 
 <italic>Taf7l</italic> and 
 <italic>Figla</italic>, were capable of separating cell clusters into two developmental stages (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Meanwhile, based on the expression pattern of genes associated with meiosis, PF assembly, and oocyte growth in clusters (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>C), the germ cells were divided into three developmental stages: pre-, early-, and late-stage of PF assembly (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E). The pre-stage consisted of cells in clusters 8 and 9; the early-stage contained cells in clusters 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, and 11; and the late-stage comprised cells in clusters 0, 4, and 5 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E upper). Moreover, the percentage of cells at the three stages indicated a decline in cell percentage at the early-stage for PD0 and the late-stage for PD3 after DEHP treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E bottom); furthermore, the results suggested that DEHP impacted the progress of PF formation. In particular, the immunostaining of ovarian sections at PD3 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F) with or without DEHP suggested that DEHP exposure indeed decreased the percentage of germ cells within follicles (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G).

<p id="Par83">Applying quantitative gene transcript analysis and immunohistochemistry, we observed that 
 <italic>ChAT</italic>, a marker of mature neurons, was upregulated as soon as iPSC committed to a neuronal lineage (D7). In addition, the well-orchestrated expression of key genes such as 
 <italic>Nestin</italic>, 
 <italic>Pax6</italic>, 
 <italic>NgN2</italic>, 
 <italic>MAP2</italic>, 
 <italic>Isl1</italic> and 
 <italic>HB9</italic> corroborated the phenotypic changes to MNs. The patterns of gene expression reported here are consistent with similar studies using small molecules to drive neuron reprogramming from astrocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] or fibroblasts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

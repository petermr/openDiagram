<p>Recently, a novel driver mutation in another deubiquitinating enzyme i.e., 
 <italic>USP48</italic>, was found in patients negative for 
 <italic>USP8</italic> changes. 
 <italic>USP48</italic> pathogenic variants cause increased activity of encoded deubiquitinase against its substrates Gli1 and H2A [
 <xref rid="B17-jcm-10-00375" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Because 
 <italic>USP48</italic> mutations affect the processes of protein degradation similarly to mutations of 
 <italic>USP8</italic>, we screened the tumor samples for both the mutations. Two samples with 
 <italic>USP48</italic> Met/Val variant were identified and excluded from differential miRNA analysis to avoid a bias resulting from similarities in pathogenic mechanism. Due to a very low number of 
 <italic>USP48</italic>-mutated tumors, these patients were also excluded from the analysis of clinical data.

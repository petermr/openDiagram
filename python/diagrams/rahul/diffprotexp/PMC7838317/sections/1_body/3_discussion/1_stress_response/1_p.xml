<p id="Par15">Our primary goal was to determine whether mussels brought into captivity were experiencing stress 11 months post translocation. The translocation of an organism to a new habitat is likely to change the physiological makeup of that organism for at least some period of time. Translocated organisms may need to re-establish homeostasis after being confronted with a change in their environment. Although the mussels translocated into captivity were undisturbed for 11 months, molecular manifestations of chronic stress were evidenced by the large number of up-regulated transcripts coding for various HSPs and antioxidants.</p>

<p id="p0190">In the CD-MOF, the 
 <italic>γ</italic>-CD molecules were parallelly face-to-face in couples. The polar hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of SCU formed strong hydrogen bonds with the 
 <italic>γ</italic>-CD in CD-MOF (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). As a result, the docking free energy of the first molecule of SCU reached −9.3 kcal/mol, while the docking free energy of the second molecule was −9.2 kcal/mol. The simulation showed that two SCU molecules hardly interacted with each other, which almost completely symmetrically distributed in the bi-cyclodextrin pair.

<p>For some alloys, quench-induced precipitation at relatively high cooling rates is shown to proceed at relatively low temperatures [

 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Particularly for AlZnMgCu alloys, it has been found that a thin platelet phase can precipitate at temperatures between 250 and 150 °C [

 <xref rid="B198-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. At even lower temperatures of down to ≈50 °C, cluster formation has been identified [

 <xref rid="B104-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Although the latter two particle types already provide a considerable direct hardening effect, since the volume fractions generated for these quench-induced particles are small, the total hardening effect is still relatively low [

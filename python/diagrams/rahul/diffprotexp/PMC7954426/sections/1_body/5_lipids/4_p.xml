<p>MfEL and lyso-MfEL are structurally similar to the platelet-activating factor (PAF) [
 <xref rid="cit0258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. Although MfEL and lyso-MfEL do not show any PAF-like activity, they can demonstrate PAF-like activity including rapid bronchoconstriction, vasoconstriction, decreased tidal volume, and edema formation in isolated perfused and ventilated rat lungs after lyso-MfEL acetylation [
 <xref rid="cit0258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. Moreover, Gil et al. also found that lyso-MfEL is more likely to be a fusion component of 
 <italic>M. fermentans</italic> since low-level lysolipids can substantially increase the fusion rate of model membranes and bio-membranes [

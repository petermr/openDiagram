<p>The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs with statistical significance were identified via volcano plot filtering. The threshold used to screen RNAs with |log
 <sub>2</sub>FC| &gt;1 was P&lt;0.05. |log

GO analysis and a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were applied to determine the biologic roles of these differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs based on the latest KEGG data (

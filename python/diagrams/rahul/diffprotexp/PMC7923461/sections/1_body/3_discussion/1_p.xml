<p id="Par52">In molecular biology, TUBA1C is a kind of Î±-tubulin subtype that is related to microtubules. It is a multi-functional cytoskeleton protein, and it participates in the process of cell mitosis and cell division [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that when the expression of TUBA1C is up-regulated, it significantly affects the growth and progression of tumor cells. This indicates that TUBA1C plays a pivotal role in the proliferation and cell cycle of various tumors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Recent studies have investigated the structure and function of microtubules (MT). These studies have reported its potential role in innate and adaptive immune systems [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, no previous study has reported about the relationship between TUBA1C expression and TIICs in LUAD tissues.

<p id="Par16">Another characteristic of Phase I is the molecular vibration or “vibron”: in Raman scattering this corresponds to the in-phase vibration of all molecules. The vibron frequency first increases, then decreases with pressure. Two plausible reasons are given for this reduction: either increased intermolecular coupling or weakening of the covalent bond. In our model, the covalent bond is always described by the same Morse parameters, so changes in the vibron frequency can arise only from resonant interactions between molecules, not weakening of the bond. Thus reproducing the reentrant vibron behaviour is a test of both the physical basis and the parameterisation of the model.</p>

<p>Under physiological concentrations of glycerol, the highly virulent strains of Mmm SC carry a 
 <italic>gtsABC</italic> transport system that can produce high levels of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and exhibit strong hemolytic activity, whereas low virulent strains lacking the 
 <italic>gtsB</italic> and 
 <italic>gtsC</italic> genes are contrary to the high-virulence strains [
 <xref rid="cit0189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. In Mmm SC, the glycerol in the interstitial fluid was actively taken up via the GtsABC or the less efficient GlpF, and subsequently phosphorylated to G3P by GlpK. Finally, the G3P is oxidized to dihydroxyacetone-phosphate to enter in the glycolytic pathway with the release of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. This toxic metabolite and the accompanying ROS can enter the host cell by intimate contact of Mmm SC and the cell membrane, and cause cell injury and inflammatory signaling cascade [

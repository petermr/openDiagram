<p>The idea of austenite stabilization during coiling simulations and isothermal bainitic transformation during cooling is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00958-f010">Figure 10</xref>, the top and down arrows, respectively. As in the case of ferrite, bainite can keep in solid solution lower amounts of carbon that in austenite. That is why, for both variants, carbon is eventually rejected from the ferritic phase to austenite. In the case of the present steel, aluminum prevents the formation of carbides in bainite. Therefore, all the carbon should diffuse to the austenite increasing its stability [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-13-00958" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This process in both cases is continued to a moment when the chemical driving force for the γ/α transformation is in equilibrium. This equilibrium corresponds to the determined amount of carbon in the austenite. When this carbon amount is the same as that of equilibrium, then the transformation is stopped. However, depending on the carbon content in the austenite at equilibrium, it can be stable to room temperature or not (depending on temperature, time and chemical composition).

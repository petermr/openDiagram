<p>After drying the plant material, the essential oil has been obtained by steam distillation using a Clevenger‐type apparatus (Clevenger, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1928</xref>). The heating temperature was fixed at 100°C, which allowed a constant flow of condensation. Each time, 300 g of vegetable material, consisting either of roots or stems, leaves, and young flowers was placed in a flask with 500 ml of water and subjected to distillation for 3 hr. The organic phase from the distillation was separated from the aqueous phase by extraction with diethyl ether. The organic phase obtained was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove traces of water, and the essential oil was recovered after the evaporation of the diethyl ether on a rotary evaporator. The samples of essential oil were stored in a refrigerator before submitting them to GC‐FID and GC‐MS analysis.

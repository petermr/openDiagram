0: sgRNAs targeting the  egfp and  fiber-2 gene, and the donor plasmid, with each 2 g, were co-transfected into LMH cells.
1: 24 h post-transfection, the LMH cells were infected with FAdV-4-EGFP at 0.1 MOI.
2: The rescued  fiber-2-edited FAdV-4, designated as FAdV-4_Fiber-2_del7-40aa (FAV4_Del), was then purified through limiting dilution assays and virus plaque assays.
3: The purified FAv4_Del was further identified by western blot, PCR and sequencing.
4: Moreover, Co-IP was also carried out to evaluate the interaction between KPNA3/4 and FAV4-Del.

0: The sequences for the siRNA targeting circ_0003865 were sense: 5-AGUUACACAGAUUCAGAUCCAUU-3, antisense: 5-AAUGGAUCUGAAUCUGUGUAACU-3; its negative control, sense: 5-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3, antisense: 5-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3; the miR-3653-3p mimics, sense: 5-CUAAGAAGUUGACUGAAG-3, antisense: 5-UCAGUCAACUUCUUAGUU-3; and mimics NC (the same as negative control); the miR-3653 inhibitors: 5-CUUCAGUCAACUUCUAG-3 and inhibitor NC: 5-CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA-3.
1: All oligos were synthesized by the GenePharma Biotech company (Shanghai, China).
2: As designated, the above sequences were transfected into human BMSCs using the Lipofectamine TM 2000 transfection kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
3: For overexpression of circ_0003865, the sequences of circ_0003865 were synthesized and ligated into the LV5 plasmid to construct the recombinant LV5-circ_0003865 vector.
4: LV5 and LV5-circ_0003865 lentiviruses were packaged by the Vigene Biosciences company (Jinan, Shandong, China) and infected into BMSCs according to the manufacturers instructions.

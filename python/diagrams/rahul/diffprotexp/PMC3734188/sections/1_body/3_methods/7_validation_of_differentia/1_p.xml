<p>A 20 μl aliquot of plasma collected for validation was first diluted in 1 mL of PBS. Then, the same volume of diluted plasma from every group was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, 0.22 μm) with a transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were first blocked in a 5% BSA/TBS solution for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were purchased from Abcam. The primary antibodies were diluted in a 1% BSA/TBS solution to the ratios indicated in the specific instructions from Abcam, and the membranes were then incubated with the antibodies overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then incubated with the secondary antibodies, diluted 1:10,000 in a 1% BSA/TBS solution, for 2 h at room temperature. The protein signals were detected and quantified with the AlphaEaseFC system.</p>

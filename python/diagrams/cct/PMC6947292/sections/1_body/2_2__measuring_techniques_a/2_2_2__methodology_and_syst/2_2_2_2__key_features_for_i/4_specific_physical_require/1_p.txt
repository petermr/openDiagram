0: To enable a full physical understanding of solid-solid phase transformations, the required high dynamic range is bounded on the one hand by very slow transformations close to equilibrium conditions, and on the other hand by relatively fast cooling beyond the critical cooling rates of the relevant transitions.
1: For instance, for aluminium alloys, the adjustment of maximum strength values requires the complete suppression of any precipitation reaction upon cooling from solution annealing.
2: The slowest cooling rate that just retains all alloying elements in solid solution is the UCCR [ 128].
3: For highly alloyed Al-Zn-Mg-Cu wrought alloys or Al-Si-Mg cast alloys, the UCCR can easily reach several hundreds of K/s [ 129, 130, 131].
4: The lower critical cooling rate defines the fastest cooling rate at which all the alloying elements (compared to the equilibrium solubility) precipitate during cooling from solution annealing, yielding enthalpy changes on a saturation level.
5: For an Al-0.72Si alloy, this lower critical cooling rate is about 3  10 5 K/s [ 117, 132].
6: To identify both critical cooling rates, they must be experimentally exceeded by at least one order of magnitude in terms of both slower and faster cooling, which requires a dynamic range of about 10 5 K/s to 10 3 K/s.
7: This wide dynamic range is now available, even for cooling, in scanning calorimetry using multiple devices.

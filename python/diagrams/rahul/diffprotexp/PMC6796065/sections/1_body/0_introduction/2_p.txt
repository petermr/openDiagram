0: Several studies have examined the expression of DARPP-32 in the postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 9  14, but only a few focused on other brain regions 12,  13,  15  17.
1: Besides, scarce reports have addressed the protein or mRNA expression of CaN in postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia 18,  19, and no studies have investigated this expression in patients with bipolar disorder.
2: DARPP-32 and CaN are mostly expressed on dopamine receptor-positive neurons in various brain regions, especially in the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) 20,  21.
3: In addition, NAc is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia 22; it has been especially implicated in generating so-called positive symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, on account of its major role in regulating dopamine release and midbrain dopamine system 23.
4: Nonetheless, the expression of DARPP-32 or CaN in the postmortem NAc of the patients with schizophrenia has not been investigated.
5: Thus, we investigated the expression of DARPP-32 and CaN in NAc and PFC of the patients with schizophrenia.

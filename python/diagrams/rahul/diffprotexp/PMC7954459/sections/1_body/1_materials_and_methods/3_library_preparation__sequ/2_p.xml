<p>SmRNA libraries were prepared using TrueSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Technologies) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Each smRNA library was sequenced on the Illumina platform to generate 50 nt long single‐end reads. The sequencing data obtained in FASTQ files were used for further processing. Cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences (Martin,

FASTQ format reads were converted to FASTA format and redundant reads were merged for further processing. The high‐quality non‐redundant set of reads were used for miRNA identification in each sample.

0: The twolevel factorial design as developed by Davies ( 1954) is wellsuited to addressing this type of question (Ortigosa,  1993).
1: The general formula for a complete factorial plan with N experiments is  N = 2 k, where k is the number of variables in the factorial.
2: If k = 3, then  N = 2 k = 2 3 = 8 experiments.

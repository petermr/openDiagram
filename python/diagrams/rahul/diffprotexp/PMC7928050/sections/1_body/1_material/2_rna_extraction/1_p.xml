<p>Fat tissue was extracted from the dorsal skinfold chamber before transplantation and from euthanized mice 7 and 15 days after transplantation. They were fresh frozen and stored at −80°C. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue samples, following the manufacturer’s protocol. Before microarray analysis was done, RNA integrity and concentration were examined on an Agilent Fragment Analyser (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using the HS RNA Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

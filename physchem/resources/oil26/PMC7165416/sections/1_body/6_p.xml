<p>Both identified critical sites associated with large spectral shifts (i.e., S134A in gerbil and A48T in elephant-shrew) occur in exon 2. By comparing orthologous exonic sequence across vertebrates, we found the same S134A replacement in some ray-finned fishes, lobe-finned fishes, and jawless fishes (

 <sub>max</sub> shift in the gerbil may have evolved independently in multiple vertebrate lineages. Indeed, the S134A replacement may also explain tuning in the cave fish, where a reported shift from 564 nm to 558 nm could not be fully explained by the five critical sites (

0: The  excess c  p thus represents only the changes in specific heat capacity that are caused by a reaction inside the sample.
1: Integration of the  excess c  p peak versus temperature (bounded by the zero level) determines the specific precipitation heat, or more generally, the enthalpy changes caused by the occurring phase transformation.

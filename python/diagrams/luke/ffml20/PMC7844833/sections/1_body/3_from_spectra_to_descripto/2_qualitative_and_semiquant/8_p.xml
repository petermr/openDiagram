<p>Finally, note that a powerful technique to improve the sensitivity of the XANES method is differential, or “Δ-XANES” analysis, where the subtle variations in the XANES features, due to, e.g., the interactions with adsorbates in the catalyst under working conditions, are emphasized by subtracting the spectra of the pristine material or other suitable reference and analyzing the difference spectrum instead (by integration or peak-fitting methods).

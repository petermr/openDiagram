 <sup>c</sup> regulates lactate transport via MCT1 in cultured astrocytes conjointly with Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> α2/β2 ATPase and basigin, and that the activity of the former is reduced in PrP-deficient astrocytes. We observed significantly lowered Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ATPase α2 subunit mRNA expression levels in

  <sup>−/−</sup>

 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ATPase α2 subunit. Glutamate uptake is known to stimulate aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes by activating the α2 subunit of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ATPase [

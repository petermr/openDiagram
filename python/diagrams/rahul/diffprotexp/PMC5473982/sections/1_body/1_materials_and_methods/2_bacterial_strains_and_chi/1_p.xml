<p>Newly hatched ISA Brown chickens from an egg laying line (Hendrix Genetics, Netherlands) were used in this study. Chickens were reared in perforated plastic boxes with free access to water and feed and each experimental or control group was kept in a separate room. The chickens were vaccinated with 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis mutant completely lacking 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) constructed as described earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and infected with isogenic wild type 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis 147 spontaneously resistant to nalidixic acid. The strains were grown in LB broth at 37 °C for 18 h followed by pelleting bacteria at 10 000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min and re-suspending the pellet in the same volume of PBS as was the original volume of LB broth.

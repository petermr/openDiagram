<p id="Par7">In this study we also contemplate the effect of size of dendrimer generation on the conformational characteristics. The deportment of the simulations conducted divulge the augment in average radius corresponding to the increased dendrimer generation. Consequently, the increment in radius of central atom magnifies the distance among atoms. Hence, these alterations toil synergistically with the entrapment or encapsulation of moiety by dendrimer. The simulation studies of PAMAMs overseen in this communication (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) manifest the use of high generation dendrimer molecules as a competent approach for drug delivery.

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> (A-C) shows the 30 most representative GO terms for each category. Besides, 43,275 transcripts were annotated into 168 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, with carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, spliceosome, endocytosis, mRNA surveillance and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis as the most represented routes (Additional file

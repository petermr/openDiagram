<p>The upregulation of imaginal disc growth factor 4 in queen larvae at both developmental stages supports formation of imaginal disc cells, which in turn accelerates organogenesis before the transformation of larvae into pupae

 <xref rid="pone.0013455-Randolt2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, imaginal disc growth factor 4 was totally missing in worker destined larvae in this study, which might be due to too low abundance to be detected by 2-DE and/or differences in protein extraction methods. The expressions of Leonardo protein that is known to be involved with the formation of olfactory learning and memory structures at late developmental stages in only queen larvae suggests the beginning of the formation of these important structures to equip the future queen with the sensory cells necessary for scent recognition and learning abilities

0: Osteoarthritis is a severe, debilitating disease that affects the whole joint organ and is hallmarked by cartilage degeneration and synovial hypertrophy.
1: As of 2019, osteoarthritis is estimated to affect 528 Million people worldwide and be the 15th leading cause of years lived with disability 1.
2: The lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee and hip osteoarthritis is estimated to be 45 and 25%, respectively 2,  3, and is on an upward trajectory commensurate with rises in obesity and the ageing population.
3: Between 2010 and 2019, the global prevalence of osteoarthritis and the resulting years lived with disability have both risen by 27.5% 1.
4: In 2013, osteoarthritis cost the United States $304 Billion 4 and was the second most costly health condition treated at US hospitals, accounting for 4.3% of the combined costs for all hospitalisations 5.
5: Osteoarthritis-associated reduced physical activity results in a standardised all-cause mortality ratio of 1.55 (95% confidence interval 1.41 to 1.70) for its sufferers versus the general population 6.
6: Disease management focusses on alleviating pain, and in end-stage disease the only treatment is joint replacement surgery, emphasising the clear and urgent need to develop new therapies.
7: To achieve this, we need to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular pathophysiology.

  <caption> Additional file4: Figure S6. Volcano plots of top significantly differentially methylated regions. a) Significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs; q&lt;0.05) with a log2-quasi-fold change (see Methods) greater than 1 are highlighted with black dots. Gray dots correspond to DMRs falling below the log2-quasi-fold change threshold. b) Top 250 significantly DMRs (q&lt;0.05) are highlighted in with black dots with all other DMRs shown in gray dots. These DMRs were used for the focused analysis in Figure 2b. </caption>

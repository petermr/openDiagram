For example, we have identified duplicate <italic>TP53</italic> retrogenes (<italic>TP53TRG</italic>s) in elephants, all of which encode premature stop codons suggesting they are pseudogenes. However, these <italic>TP53TRG</italic>s are expressed, encode functional separation of function mutants of the ancestral <italic>TP53</italic> gene, and contribute to enhanced DNA damage sensitivity in elephant cells.</p>

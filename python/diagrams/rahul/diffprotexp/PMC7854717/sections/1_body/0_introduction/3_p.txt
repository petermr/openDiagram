0: A recent publication 3 compared the regulation of genes involved in atrial fibrillation (AF) from paired human left and right atrial appendages of healthy and AF patients, concluding that there are different mechanisms for development, support and remodeling of AF within the left and right atria.
1: Other authors compared the gene expressions from the left and right aortic arches of the chick embryo 4.
2: Direct comparison of gene expression profiles among the heart chambers improves our understanding of the heart embryogenesis 5, signaling pathways 6, transcriptional enhancers and gene regulatory networks 7,  8, involvement of miRNAs 9, epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms 10 etc.

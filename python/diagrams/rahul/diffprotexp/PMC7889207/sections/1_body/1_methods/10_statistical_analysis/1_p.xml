<p>Data presented in this study were captured in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 2016) and statistical analysis conducted in GraphPad Prism software (Graphpad Prism® version 6.01, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA). Data are represented by the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). All data were normally distributed, as determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test and thus the unpaired Student’s t-test was used to test for significant differences between STD and CD groups. P ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A one-way analysis of variance for the 
 <italic>Slc27a3</italic> pyrosequencing was performed to calculate statistical significance of methylation between the two diet groups and at which CpG site methylation differed in CD vs STD fed rats.

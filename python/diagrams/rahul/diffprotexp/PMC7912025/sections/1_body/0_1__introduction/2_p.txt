0: Airway epithelial cells sense viral replication through a network of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) monitoring the airway lumen, cellular cytoplasm, and subcellular organelles for the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, [ 10, 11]).
1: Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 5-phosphorylated RNA are viral PAMPs generated by productive RSV replication that bind the intracellular retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I).
2: Activated RIG-I binds the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to form an intracellular signaling complex on the mitochondrial surface, known as the inflammasome.
3: The inflammasome is a signaling receptor scaffold that recruits and activates kinases and ubiquitin ligases that are rate limiting in the activation of the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)3 and nuclear factor-B (NFB) transcription factors, stimulating their nuclear translocation [ 12].

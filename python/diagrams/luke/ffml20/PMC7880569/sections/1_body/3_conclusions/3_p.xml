<p>The 1 W hydration state of K
 <sup>+</sup>-intercalated birnessite contains 1.33 water molecules per unit cell. This population can be distributed in the internal and external basal faces of the nanoparticles, the proportions of which vary with particle size. Condensed water on and between particle surfaces appears at ∼50% RH during adsorption but disappears below ∼20% RH during desorption. The 1 W state expands the basal spacing to

 <sub>001</sub> = 0.735 nm and consists of a single layer of water molecules simultaneously hydrating interlayer K
 <sup>+</sup> and donating hydrogen bonds to O-sites on the basal face. Unlike liquid water, those in the 1 W state of birnessite form almost no intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and their diffusion coefficient is four orders of magnitude lower than that of liquid water. This explains the distinct solvation environment offered by water intercalated in the birnessite bulk. The combined macroscopic, structural, and molecular information gathered for this work should provide new opportunities for exploring catalytic reactions driven by birnessite that are of great importance to nature and technology.

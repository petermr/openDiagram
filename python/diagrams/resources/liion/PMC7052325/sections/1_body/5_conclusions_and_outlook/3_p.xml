<p>However, more work should be done before the ionic conductors are sufficiently conductive for practical consideration in Mg batteries. The electrochemical potential window should be increased to a sufficiently high level. The feasibility of the solid conductor requires the practical evaluation in combination with Mg anode and cathodes as an all-solid-state Mg battery. Furthermore, theoretical calculation could be a powerful tool to improve the performance of solid conductor.</p>

<p>A total of 1,783 proteins were identified and quantified by the iTRAQ technique. Statistical calculations for iTRAQ-based detection and relative quantification were then performed using PD software. The protein identification threshold, an Unused Prot Score of &gt;1.3, was used to obtain a confidence level of 95%. The differentially expressed proteins were defined as the relative ratio of &gt;1.5 or &lt;0.5 (calculated as a ratio of Caki-1 cells/XIAP-knockdown cells; P&lt;0.05). Based upon these criteria, 87 proteins were significantly altered at 0 h. Following apoptosis induction, there were 178 significantly altered proteins at 0.5 h and 169 proteins at 3 h. However, no difference was observed in the level of protein expression between the two cell lines at 12 h, indicating that the change in cell protein levels mainly occurs in the early stages of apoptosis.</p>

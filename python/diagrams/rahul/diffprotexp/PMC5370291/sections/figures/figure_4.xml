  <p>Protein expression changes in response to TNFα. Cells were reacted with TNFα for 24 h, lysed for protein extraction, and the resulting crude proteins were subjected to immunoblotting. The indicated proteins were detected by using specific antibodies and chemiluminescence. Three independent immunoblotting experiments were performed for each protein and the representative images were shown. HSP70, heat shock protein 70. HMGB2, high mobility group B2.</p>

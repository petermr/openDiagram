0: The main clinical manifestations of knee osteoarthritis are slow-developing knee pain, tenderness, stiffness, joint swelling, limited mobility and knee deformity ( 8).
1: The occurrence and development of knee osteoarthritis are the result of the interaction between biomechanical and biological factors, including the mechanical environment around the knee joint, the metabolic rate of the individual, the apoptosis of chondrocytes and the levels of related cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) IL-4, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- ( 9-11).
2: A number of risk factors for knee osteoarthritis have been identified, including age, sex, obesity, inflammation, strain, trauma and genetics ( 12-14).

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We summarized percentages of scan variables and rates from all-occurrence variables by observation and by night for each individual. Continuous variables were also summarized as percentages using durations and as rates using counts. Data were analyzed without controlling for visibility, because both the focal aardvark and the enrichment were out of view less than one percent of the time. Although we recorded information on location within habitat and proximity to enrichment and substrate, because these variables did not answer our main questions, they will not be addressed further. Goal achievement was assessed by looking at three specific behaviors: total time foraging (scans of foraging and investigating foraging enrichment combined), total investigating non-food items (scans of investigating and investigating exploring enrichment combined), and locomotion. Although total time foraging and total time investigating non-food items have a clear connection to the goals of the enrichment items (i.e., foraging and exploring), we included locomotion as an indication of the efficacy of exploring enrichment, as movement throughout the habitat would present more opportunities for investigation. Behavioral diversity (H) was calculated each night from scan data using the Shannon&#8211;Wiener Diversity Index [<xref rid="B26-animals-10-01433" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Data were visualized using Microsoft Excel 2016 (Redmond, WA, USA). </p>

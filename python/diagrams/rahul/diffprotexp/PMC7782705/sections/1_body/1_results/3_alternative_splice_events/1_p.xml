<p id="Par11">To identify the causes subjacent to gene isoform switches in the AD brain, we quantified the frequency of splicing events associated with the isoform switches detected in AD compared to control brains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We found that alternative transcription start site (ATSS), alternative transcription termination site (ATTS), and exon skipping (ES) were the most frequent splicing events in AD brains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Other common splicing events observed were alternative 3′ or 5′ splice sites (A3 and A5, respectively), multiple exons skipping (MES) and intron retention (IR) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). These observations suggest that changes in alternative splicing could be implicated in AD pathogenesis, corroborating previous analyses in the ROSMAP cohort using intronic usage ratios to identify abnormal splicing events in the AD brain

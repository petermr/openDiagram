<p id="Par19">The study not only mapped the transcriptome and proteome map of gecko tail tissue but also identified the list of 254 genes and 128 proteins involved in regeneration of the tail tissue upon amputation during the early stages of regeneration i.e., during 1, 2 and 5-dpa. Several known and unknown genes/proteins which were identified in this study were also involved in epimorphic regeneration of caudal fin tissue of zebrafish

 </sup>. Loss of function through downregulation of genes were majorly observed during regeneration at 1 and 5-dpa rather than gain of function of genes. Whereas at the proteome level it was observed that at 1 and 2-dpa, a prominent gain of function through upregulation of proteins widely. An anomalous downregulation of 67% of the identified proteins at 5-dpa impacts a huge loss of function. Validation of 50 genes identified from the transcriptomic analysis confirms the differential regulation of the genes for the biomechanism of regeneration, which is also evident from the hierarchical heat map analysis of the transcriptome and proteome.

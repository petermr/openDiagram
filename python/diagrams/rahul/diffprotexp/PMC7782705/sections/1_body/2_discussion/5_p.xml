 </sup> are exclusively assigned to GABAergic neurons. These genes may be particularly relevant for AD pathogenesis, given the central role of GABAergic neurons for the generation of oscillatory rhythms, network synchrony, and memory in different animal models of AD

 </sup>. Isoform switches in the APP gene could particularly affect GABAergic neurons, which express high levels of that gene, contributing to AD pathogenesis. According to this possibility, conditional knockout of APP/APLP2 only in GABAergic forebrain neurons using DlxCre mice leads to cognitive deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory tasks, associated with altered neuronal morphology and synaptic plasticity

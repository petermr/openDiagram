0:  Effects of Rhaponticum carthamoides HR and SGR essential oils on IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF- , and GM-CSF levels in LPS-stimulated astrocytes.
1: The levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated astrocytes were measured by ELISA Kit.
2: Astrocytes were incubated for 24 h with 25, 50, and 100  g/mL of HR and SGR essential oils and LPS (1  g/mL).
3: The data is represented as means  SD and was obtained from three independent experiments.
4: p< 0.05 versus LPS-treated cells; # p< 0.05 SGR essential oil versus HR essential oil. )

<p>Essential oils of fruits from 
 <italic>K. anatolica</italic> collected in Lakes Region of Turkey contain high percentage monoterpene-rich volatile fractions, a-Pinene and β-Pinene. These compounds used as base compound in many areas including pharmaceuticals, foods and medicine. On the other hand, altitude affected the terpenoid biosynthesis and oxygenated monoterpenes generally and were greater at low altitude, while sesquiterpene constituents were greater at high altitudes. In conclusion, the influence of altitude seems to be an important factor for improved yield in chemical profile of 
 <italic>K. anatolica</italic> essential oils, and thus the location of the plant must be taken into account depending on the intended use. The results of the study revealed that this specie might be evaluated for its rich content of a-Pinene and β-Pinene by different industries.

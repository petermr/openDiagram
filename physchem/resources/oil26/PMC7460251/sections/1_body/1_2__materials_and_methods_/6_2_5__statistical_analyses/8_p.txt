0: In the results, we present b estimates (or exp(b) for count variables) along with the 95% CI for continuous predictors.
1: For categorical predictors, we made pairwise comparisons using estimated marginal means and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the least significant difference.
2: Standard errors are based on  n = 4 aardvarks unless otherwise indicated.
3: We considered  p< 0.05 to indicate statistically significant results.
4: Due to the large number of pairwise comparisons, we only present values for statistically significant results for comparisons that we thought answered the project questions.
5: Please see the  supplemental materials for all other pairwise comparisons.

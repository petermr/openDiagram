<p>Sex steroids have been found to modulate signal transduction pathways [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In this regard, p-ERK has been extensively related to cell proliferation, survival and plasticity [

 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. While some studies suggest that androgens might reduce p-ERK expression and induce apoptosis [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], other studies demonstrate that testosterone activates p-ERK expression and proliferation [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The fact that we found proteins associated to cell proliferation, such as VCL, FLNA, GAPDH and STIP1, is in accordance with the proliferative effect of p-ERK. Therefore, it is suggested that these proteins might act as upstream regulators of ERK signaling pathways. Moreover, stimulation of cytoplasmic AR by anabolic steroids undergoes non-genomic signaling cascades leading to p-ERK activation and cell proliferation [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Interestingly, in our study, neither the non-phosphorylated forms of ERK nor AKT changed their expression after AAS exposure. On the other hand, the stress-activated kinase p-p38 [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] was downregulated, suggesting negative feedback for the restoration of cellular homeostasis after hormonal imbalance. This is in accordance with a previous study showing that acute stimulation of myotubes with supraphysiological doses of testosterone reduced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK [

0: Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, is caused by the accumulation of long-term genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations [ 1].
1: Although recent interventional and therapeutic advances have greatly improved the overall survival (OS) of CRC, patients with advanced CRC still show poor prognosis due to the high frequency of recurrence and metastasis [ 2].
2: Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC, from initiation to metastasis, is urgently needed to improve its early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.
3: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding transcripts that range from 200 to 100,000 nucleotides in length and lack protein-coding capacity.
4: They function as signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds in gene regulatory networks [ 3].
5: The regulatory mechanism of lncRNA depends on its subcellular localization.
6: Cytoplasmic lncRNAs primarily participate in post-transcriptional and translational regulation by acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges and modulating mRNA stability.
7: An increasing number of lncRNAs have been found to participate in CRC initiation and progression by functioning as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) [ 4 6].
8: Specifically, lncRNAs derepress target gene expression by competitively binding to shared sequences of miRNAs [ 7,  8].
9: Recent studies showed that ceRNA crosstalk was involved in various biological processes, including CRC cell proliferation, invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and immune infiltration [ 9 13].

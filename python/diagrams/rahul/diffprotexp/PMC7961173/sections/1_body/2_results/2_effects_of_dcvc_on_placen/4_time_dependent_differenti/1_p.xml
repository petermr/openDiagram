<p id="Par37">In addition to concentration-dependent DCVC effects, altered gene expression associated with treatment duration was investigated. Comparison of gene expression changes in cells exposed for 6 versus 12 µM DCVC was evaluated by calculating pairwise correlation coefficients of logFC estimates. The overall differential gene expression levels (relative to control) were moderately correlated by time for both 10 µM DCVC treatment [
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.14, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1.0 × 10
 <sup>–15</sup>] (Suppl Fig. 5a) and 20 µM DCVC treatment [
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.24, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1.0 × 10
 <sup>–15</sup>] (Suppl Fig. 5b). Moreover, differentially expressed genes with a logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3] and FDR &lt; 0.05 after 12-h treatment, had larger expression changes than 6-h treatment, indicating time-dependent responses for both concentrations tested (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, c). For 10 µM treatment, the only gene significantly differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 0.05 + logFC &gt; 0.35 [FC &gt; 1.3]) with 6-h DCVC treatment, 
 <italic>ALAS1</italic>, was also differentially expressed with 12-h treatment along with 14 additional genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Likewise, among the 12 genes differentially expressed after 6-h 20 µM DCVC treatment, 10 genes were also differentially expressed after 12-h 20 µM treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). Moreover, there were 2 genes exclusively differentially expressed with 6-h 20 µM treatment and 289 genes with 12-h 20 µM treatment.

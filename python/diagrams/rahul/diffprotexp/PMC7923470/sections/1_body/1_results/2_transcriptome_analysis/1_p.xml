<p id="Par37">We investigated the changes in gene expression profiles in the pseudostems of WT and MT plants. With three biological replicates, the transcriptome sequencing of the six samples yielded a total of 56.78 Gb clean data with an average of 94.46% bases scoring Q30 (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Of the total clean reads, 83.68 to 90.25% were unique matches with Musa genome

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Overall, the Fragments Per Kilobase of Transcript per Million Fragments Mapped (FPKM) for MT was higher as compared to WT, when FPKM &gt; 1 was used as a threshold to determine the gene expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between WT and MT replicates ranged from 0.25 to 0.87 (Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This is expected since MT was obtained from WT by tissue culture and probably, only a few genes were mutated. We also observed that there is a high intra-varietal diversity for pseudostem transcriptome. Therefore, we would recommend more replicates in future studies related to pseudostem growth.

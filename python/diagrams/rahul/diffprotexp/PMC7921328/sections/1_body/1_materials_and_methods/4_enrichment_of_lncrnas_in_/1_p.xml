<p>To evaluate the enrichment of individual lncRNAs in specific biological features, the correlations between individual lncRNAs and genes of biological features were first calculated by Spearman’s correlation. LncRNA-gene pairs with | Rs| &gt; 0.3 and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered as significant correlated pairs. For each lncRNA, Fisher’s exact test and hypergeometric test was employed to estimate the difference of significant pairs between interested features and the others across 50 hallmarks and 95 immune-related biological processes, respectively. LncRNA-hallmark pairs with OR &gt; 1 and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered as significantly enriched pairs. The corresponding lncRNAs were assigned to significant paired biological features as highly associated lncRNAs.</p>

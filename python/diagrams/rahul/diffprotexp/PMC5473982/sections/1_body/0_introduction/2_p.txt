0: Macrophages are professional phagocytes responsible for the destruction and clearance of pathogens.
1: When activated, macrophages increase their antibacterial activity by the expression of antimicrobial peptides like cathepsins B, C, D and S, avidin, ferritin or ovotransferrin [ 6], and production of NO radicals from arginine by inducible NO synthase.
2: The antimicrobial proteins expressed by macrophages are commonly produced also by heterophils though it is not known to what extent these may differ in their immediate availability and total amount produced by both cell types.
3: Macrophages can also regulate the immune response by the expression of cytokines e.g.
4: IL1, IL6, IL8, IL18 or LITAF [ 7] and are capable of antigen presentation [ 8 10].
5: However, similar to heterophils, an unbiased report on total proteome expressed by chicken macrophages is absent.

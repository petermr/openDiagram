<p>A great number of studies have confirmed that TME plays an essential role in tumor initiation and development (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). An aggressive TME may support continued tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. The interactions between numerous components of TME may result in different tumor growth patterns and prognosis, but the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated and thoroughly investigated. Li et al. recently found that three immune-related genes (

Huo et al. analyzed the scores of 22 immune cells in tumor tissues using gene expression data from 816 HNSCC patients and developed a TME score-based prognostic risk model accordingly. The model was significantly correlated with tumor stage, grade, HPV infection, and prognosis (

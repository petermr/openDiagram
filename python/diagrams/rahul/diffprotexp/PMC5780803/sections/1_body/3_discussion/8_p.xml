<p>In summary, in the present study, Caki-1 cells with XIAP-knockdown were successfully constructed and the differential proteins between the XIAP overexpression and the XIAP-knockdown cell lines were analyzed. According to these results, it was concluded that XIAP may have a number of other biological functions in addition to participating in the mechanism of apoptosis. For example, XIAP may be involved in the p53 pathway, the Wnt signal pathway, glucose metabolism, ER stress, and DNA repair and replication. These biological behaviors are closely associated with the progression and aggression of malignancies. Additionally, XIAP affected the cytoskeletal regulation, migration and metastasis of RCC cells. These findings may provide novel concepts and directions for research regarding XIAP. However, these conclusions are solely an inference based upon the differential expression of proteins in two cell lines and require verification through further experiments. With regards to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the XIAP RING domain, studies on the other potential biological behaviors of XIAP are not comprehensive and further studies are required to fully understand the role served by XIAP.</p>

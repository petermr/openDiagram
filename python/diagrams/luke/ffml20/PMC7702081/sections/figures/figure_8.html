 <caption> ( A) Definition of subpopulations near a solvent separated Mg 2+−Cl − ion pair showing the categorization of a water molecule in the W 222 subpopulation: the oxygen is in the 2 nd coordination shell of Mg 2+ and both hydrogen atoms are in the 1 st coordination shell of Cl −. ( B) Overlapping of the 1 st and 2 nd coordination spheres of the Mg 2+ and Cl −for a solvent separated ion pair showing the water. ( C) Distribution of molecules among the subpopulations for the 1.3 mol kg −1 MgCl 2 solution. Subpopulation analysis conducted at each time step (1 fs) using four different time origins. Standard errors computed from the variations of block averages, each lasting 5 ps. ( D) Number of water molecules in the bulk (black), coordinated to either Mg 2+ or Cl − (blue), or coordinated to both Mg 2+ or Cl − (red). Values normalized to MgCl 2 units. </caption>

<p id="Par38">In this paper, we have explored the applicability of ML models to chemical reaction networks. In this context, we introduced the Rad-6 database of ca. 10,000 open and closed-shell molecules and an associated reaction network of ca. 30,000 reactions (Rad-6-RE). Established compound space KRR methods were shown to accurately predict atomization energies of the Rad-6 molecules. While the AE prediction accuracy was fairly similar for different choices in training set selection and kernel construction, these choices had a large effect on RE prediction accuracy. In particular, we found the use of an intensive kernel for both FPS-based training set selection and KRR learning to work very well for RE prediction, while models trained on extensive FPS sets displayed unexpectedly large RE errors. This can be rationalized by the special topology of reaction networks, in which certain small molecules constitute important hubs that should be included early on in the training sets.</p>

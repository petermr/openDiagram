<p id="Par29">We found the DC genes from the fetal muscle over-represented in the nutrient-sensing signaling pathways PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and FoxO. These pathways along with mTOR, play a major role in muscle development, energy metabolism, gene expression, and metabolic epigenetic programming

 </sup>. The Akt-mTOR pathway acts as positive regulator of protein synthesis, whereas FoxO signaling is required for muscle atrophy

 </sup>. We found the 
 <italic>ELK3</italic> TF more connected and negatively and differentially correlated with 
 <italic>AKT1</italic> in fetuses from RES dams. The ELK3 protein is a transcriptional repressor whose knockdown induced the activation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway in breast cancer cell line

 </sup>. In addition, intrauterine growth restriction in rats has been associated with reduced activity of this pathway
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. We found 
 <italic>FoxO6</italic> significantly more connected in the RES group. FoxO induction leads to the transcription of atrophy-related genes

 </sup>. Additionally, SMAD3/SMAD4 heterodimers may repress mTOR
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. We identified the 
 <italic>SMAD4</italic> gene negatively co-expressed with 
 <italic>EIF4EBP1</italic> that acts as protein synthesis inhibitor

 </sup>. Altogether, it seems that the TFs were acting redundantly and coordinately to repress muscle formation and differentiation in response to nutrient restriction.

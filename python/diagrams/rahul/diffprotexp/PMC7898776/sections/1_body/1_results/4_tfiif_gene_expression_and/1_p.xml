 <italic>General transcription factor IIF</italic> (
 <italic>TFIIF</italic>) gene expression was higher in the mandarin fish of Group X than that of Group W. We then analyzed the CpG islands at − 5000 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site (designated as 0) of 
 <italic>TFIIF</italic> by methylation analysis software. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, one CpG islands containing 9 CpG sites existed in − 3619 to − 3574 bp of 
 <italic>TFIIF</italic> gene. The total DNA methylation level was significantly higher in the fish of Group X than that of Group W (Table

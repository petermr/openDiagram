0: Briefly, for all transcripts with peptide-spectrum matches, their spliced nucleotide sequences were first extracted and six frame translation was performed.
1: Then, for each peptide-spectrum match, the frame of which the matched transcript it maps to was identified and the translated protein sequence was extracted.
2: All possible open reading frames were subsequently determined from the protein sequence defined by the presence of start and stop codon, which is indicated by methionine and * respectively in the protein sequence.
3: The matched peptide was then mapped to these possible ORFs and see if it matches to any of them.
4: If not, the ORF will be defined as the sequence flanked by the start and stop codons closet to the matched peptide (Additional file  1: Figure S3).
5: An R script was written to perform this task and can be found in  https://github.com/PrabakaranGroup/nORFs-in-malaria.

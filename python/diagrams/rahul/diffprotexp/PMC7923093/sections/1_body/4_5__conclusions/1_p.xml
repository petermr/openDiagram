<p>In summary, the supplementation of arginine altered the expression level of seven miRNAs including miR-206-3p, miR-133a-5p, miR-133b-3p, miR-1-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-1b and miR-486 in mammary tissue potentially via some unknown pathways. The miRNAs and target genes screened out in this study have an unclear relationship with the related physiology of mammary and lactation. Thus, further research is needed to focus on the mechanisms whereby miRNAs selected in this work affect mammary gland development by manipulating cell cycle and cell division in response to supply of arginine.</p>

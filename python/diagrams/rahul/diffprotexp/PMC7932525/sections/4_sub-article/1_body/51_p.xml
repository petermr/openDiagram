<p>We think that PCR is not a good method to prove the differential expression of Nif gene. No matter whether the gene is expressed or not, the Nif gene in the genome will be amplified by PCR. We speculated that the reviewer wanted to supplement the results of qRT-PCR or RT-PCR. qRT-PCR is shown in Figure 6 of the paper. Here, we added some electrophoresis pictures of RT-PCR, which proved that the expression trend of NifH1 and NifH2 genes in vegetative cells and heterospores was similar to that of transcriptome and qRT-PCR. See figure S1.</p>

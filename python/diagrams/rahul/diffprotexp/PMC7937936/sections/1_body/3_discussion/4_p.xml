 <italic>P2RY14</italic> is a purinergic receptor for UDP-glucose and other UDP-glycans coupled to G-proteins. It plays a role in the immune system by participating in the regulation of the stem cell compartment (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> is now thought to be closely associated with tumorigenesis and development. For instance, Wang et al. found that 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> is significantly down-regulated in lung cancer tissues based on analysis of different data sets, and the higher the expression level of this gene, the better the patientâ€™s prognosis (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Similar to the results we obtained in TCGA-HNSC data set, the higher the expression of 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> in the tumor tissue, the better the prognosis of the patient (

 </xref>). And in tumor tissues, the levels of the gene are significantly down-regulated compared to normal tissues (

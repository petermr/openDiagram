<p>Animal experiments showed that RSV has a direct inhibitory effect on TNBC in nude mouse models, while overexpression of the POLD1 gene was found to reduce the inhibitory effect of RSV on tumors. Compared to the control group (

 </xref>), the RSV and RSV + POLD1-OE groups had a smaller final tumor volume (493.66 ± 138.30mm3 vs. 222.70 ± 102.55mm3 and 313.48 ± 140.93mm3, P &lt;0.01 P &gt;0.05) and lower wet weight (0.54 ± 0.10 g vs. 0.26 ± 0.13 g and 0.34 ± 0.14 g, P &lt;0.01, P &lt;0.05). HE staining showed that the tumor tissue of the RSV group had obvious necrosis, while the RSV + POLD1-OE group had less fibrous tissue than the RSV group (

However, the POLD1 overexpression group antagonized these inhibitory or promotive effects (× 200-fold), signifying that POLD1 was an intermediary for RSV in treating MDA-MB-231 cells. Mechanistically, RSV may drive the apoptosis gene by reducing the expression of POLD1, activating the apoptosis pathway in the apoptosis of TNBC cells (

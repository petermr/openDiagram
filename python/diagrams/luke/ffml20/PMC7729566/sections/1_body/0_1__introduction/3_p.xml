<p>Bulky quaternary ammonium and phosphonium ILs such as tetrabutylammonium chloride ([N
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl) or tetrabutylphosphonium chloride ([P
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl) are common constituents of hydrophilic and hydrophobic mixtures with organic acids despite both salts being fully water-miscible [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Most surprisingly for ionic compounds, certain of these hydrophilic quaternary salts including [P
 <sub>4444</sub>]Cl and its surfactant derivative tributyltetradecylphosphonium chloride ([P
 <sub>44414</sub>]Cl) present a pronounced lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in the presence of water [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05570" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] opens up the possibility of reversibly varying the system from monophasic to biphasic through the addition of water and/or temperature manipulation. Such versatile systems could facilitate the integration of leaching and solvent extraction unit operations, providing a bridge between hydrophylic and hydrophobic solvents. Although no such systems were applied to metal recovery, the mixture of lidocaine and oleic acid presents an LCST of 298 K driven by the change in ionicity from oleate to oleic acid with temperature increase. The mixture was shown to efficiently extract a range of dyes from aqueous solutions [

  <p>Quantification of similarity between fluoxetine, dexamethasone, bupropion, or paroxetine drug-treatment signatures and IL6ST or NFKB1 gene knockdown signatures. (A and B) Analyses of differential gene expression signatures elicited by fluoxetine, dexamethasone, bupropion, or paroxetine treatments compared to differential gene expression signatures elicited by (A) 
   <italic>IL6ST</italic> knockdown or (B) 
   <italic>NFKB1</italic> knockdown. Similarity is quantified as concordance score. The maximum absolute concordance scores from all comparands are reported. Means derived from cell lines are also reported. (Câˆ’F) Heatmaps and corresponding data tables representing full concordance analyses comparing drug-treated cells and C, (E) matched IL6ST knockdown or D, (F) matched NFKB1 knockdown cell lines. For comprehensive coverage, the heatmaps and corresponding data tables represent additional concordance scores derived from cell lines lacking data set(s) within our inclusion parameters for one or more comparison (black boxes in heatmap; gray boxes in data table). Means and standard deviations (SD), derived from all available comparand cell lines (N) are also presented.

<p>Proteins related to cell motility and cytoskeleton dynamics were modulated after exposure to 17Î±-meT. This was represented by changes in VCL, FLNA, and CFL1 (3.12E00). VCL, a structural protein regulating cell-cell adhesion [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], showed decreased expression. Accordingly, the progesterone metabolite, 5a-pregnane-3, 20-dione, decreases both VCL expression and cell adhesion, suggesting proliferative and metastatic inductions by an endogenous steroid [

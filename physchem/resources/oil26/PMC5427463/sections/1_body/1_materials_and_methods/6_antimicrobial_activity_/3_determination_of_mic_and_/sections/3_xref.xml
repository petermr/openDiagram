<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). When microbial growth was inhibited, the solution in the well remained clear after incubation with MTT. The MMCs were determined by serial subcultivation of 10 &#956;L in LB or PDA plates and incubated at the optimal temperature of the indicator organism. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the MBC and the MFC, indicating &#8805; 99.5 % killing of the original inoculum. 50 % ethanol was used as a negative control. The determinations of MIC, MBC and MFC values were done in triplicate and repeated twice.

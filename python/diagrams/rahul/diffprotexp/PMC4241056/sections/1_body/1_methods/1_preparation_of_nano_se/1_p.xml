<p>Nano-Se was prepared according to the previous method described by Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] through the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the redox system of selenite and glutathione (GSH). In the present study, 2-mg BSA was dissolved in 4-ml 25-mM GSH and then 1-ml 25-mM sodium selenite was added. The pH value was adjusted to 7.2 using sodium hydroxide. The sizes of red elemental Se was determined using the Mastersizer particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK), with the average sizes being 22.19 nm as nano-Se.

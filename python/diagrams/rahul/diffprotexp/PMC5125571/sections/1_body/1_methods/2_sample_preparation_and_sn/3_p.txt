0: The snails (N = 900) were exposed to  O.  viverrini mature eggs according to previously described procedures [ 11].
1: Three replicates (100 snails per replicate) were used for each of the time points of the experimental infection.
2: Briefly, infection was performed by placing each snail individually with 50 embryonated  O.  viverrini eggs into plastic containers containing 5 ml of de-chlorinated tap water for 24h.
3: Uninfected snails were treated in a similar way but no eggs were present in the containers.
4: After infection, the snails were maintained in plastic 50 L containers (38 cm wide x 52 cm long x 31 cm high) at 100 snails per container in de-chlorinated tap water to a height of 10 cm with soil base.
5: Snails were provided with boiled gourd leaves and artificial snail food as described previously [ 43].
6: One hundred individual snails were randomly collected at 24, 48 and 96 h post-infection (hpi), and uninfected snails (N = 300) were used as controls.
7: Snail infection was determined by examination of egg hatching in snail faeces (as determined by opening of the operculum) [ 45].
8: In addition, after collection of hemolymph, whole soft bodies of all snails were subsequently employed to screen for trematode infection by PCR designed to amplify the ITS regions as described elsewhere [ 46].
9: PCR products were amplified and visualized on a 3% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.
10: The presence of bands of approximately 380 bp in size was considered diagnostic for  O.  viverrini infection.

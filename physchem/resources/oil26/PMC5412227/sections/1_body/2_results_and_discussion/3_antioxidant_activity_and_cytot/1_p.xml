<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The stable DPPH free radical has been widely approved as a tool for the free radical-scavenging activity assessment in antioxidants (Nagai et al., 2003). In the DPPH test, the antioxidants managed to reduce the stable DPPH radical to yellow-colored diphenylpricryhydrazine. The effects of antioxidants on DPPH radical scavenging are attributed to their hydrogen-donating ability (Ye et al., 2013). In this study, an <italic>in vitro</italic> examination of the free radical scavenging activity of the essential oils is presented. The essential oils showed the highest reduction ability with an IC50 of 49.2 &#956;g/m1. BHT and ascorbic acid were employed as positive controls that exhibited antioxidant activity, with IC50 values of 28.7 &#956;g/m1 and 87.3 &#956;g/m1, respectively.</p>

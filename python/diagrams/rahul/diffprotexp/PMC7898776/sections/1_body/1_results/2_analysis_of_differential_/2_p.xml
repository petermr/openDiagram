<p id="Par34">The normalized data were analyzed by PCA and PLS-DA with multivariate analysis. The PCA result showed the positive and negative ions from the different groups were in the two clusters, and were separated clearly by the first two components (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). PLS-DA result showed the clear separation of the two groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), suggesting the significant biochemical changes. The hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of the differential metabolites showed that Group X and W showed significant difference (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The information of these metabolomic biomarkers was listed in Table

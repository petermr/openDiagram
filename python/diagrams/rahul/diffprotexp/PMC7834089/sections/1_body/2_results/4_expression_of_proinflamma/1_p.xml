<p>To evaluate the effects of the vagus nerve on proinflammatory cytokines in the heart, we measured expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α by Western blot. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>, on d 7, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly increased by 1.54-, 1.87-, and 3.07-fold in VMC group and 1.46-, 1.83-, and 3.03-fold in VMC+Sham group compared to Control group, respectively. Vagotomy upregulated the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α by 1.43-, 1.28-, and 1.40-fold in VMC+Vag group compared to VMC group (

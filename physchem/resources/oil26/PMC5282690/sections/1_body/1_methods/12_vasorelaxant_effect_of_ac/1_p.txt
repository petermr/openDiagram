0: In endothelium-intact aorta ( n = 6), steady tension was evoked by Phen (1 M), then, AcEO (10 410 1 mg/ml) was cumulatively added to the Krebs solution.
1: The contribution of endothelium, muscarinic receptor and subsequent Ca 2+-CaM complex formation in the vasorelaxation-induced effect was checked out by the application of experiments described by Monteiro et al.
2: [ 46].
3: Denuded rings ( n = 6) were obtained by gentile rubbing of the lumen of aorta with a plier curved end, and the denudation was verified by the absence of any degree of relaxation caused by carbachol (10 4 M), then, AcEO (10-410-1 mg/ml) was cumulatively added.
4: In another set of experiments, endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 M;  n = 6) and Ca 2+-Calmodulin binding to NOS blocker calmidazolium chloride (10 3M;  n = 6) for 20 min prior the contraction with Phen (1 M), then, the cumulative concentrationresponse curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.

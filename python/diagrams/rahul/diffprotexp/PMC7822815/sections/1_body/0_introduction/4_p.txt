0: To address this question, we performed perturbation experiments in t(8;21)-positive AML cells and examined the impact of  RUNX1/RUNX1T1 knockdown on the gene expression and RNA splicing at a global level.
1: Our results demonstrate that  RUNX1/RUNX1T1 downregulation affects splicing of both direct target genes and in an indirect fashion.
2: Mechanistically, changes in the production of RNA isoforms are implemented via (i) direct control of alternative transcription start site selection in target genes, and (ii) by direct or indirect control of the expression of the genes encoding splicing factors.
3: Our modeling and experimental results indicate that oncoprotein-mediated differential splicing affects conserved domain structures in proteins, ultimately modulating leukemia-relevant processes such as nucleotide metabolism, cell adhesion and cell differentiation.

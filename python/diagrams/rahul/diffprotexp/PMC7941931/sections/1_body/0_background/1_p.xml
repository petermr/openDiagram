<p id="Par25">MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of endogenous non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) that are 20–24 nt in length, play crucial regulatory functions in animals and plants by repressing their target genes expression at the transcription or post-transcription level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In plants, the biosynthesis of miRNAs is a multistep pathway that is involved in many genes and enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Plant miRNA genes are initially transcribed into primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Then, the pri-miRNAs are processed into miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) with stem-loop structures by the DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) and SERRATE (SE) protein complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Next, these pri-miRNAs are further cleaved into miRNA::miRNA
 <sup>*</sup> duplexes under the action of DCL1, HYL1 and SE protein complex, and then the 3΄ end of the duplexes are methylated by the methyltransferase HUA ENHANCER1 (HEN1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. After methylation, the duplexes are exported to the cytoplasm by the HASTY protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Finally, the miRNA duplex is bound by ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to carry out its function by either cleaving target mRNAs or repressing the translation process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At present, miRNAs have been identified in numerous plants, and more and more evidence indicates that they play crucial roles in plant growth and development, secondary metabolism, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and signal transduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

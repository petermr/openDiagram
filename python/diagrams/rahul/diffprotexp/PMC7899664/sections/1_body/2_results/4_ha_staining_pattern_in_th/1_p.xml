<p>We used HABP to probe for the effect of the topical 4-MU formulation on histologic staining pattern of HA in the skin. In the untreated mice, we found that HABP stained the dermis uniformly and with high intensity. Pretreatment of histologic sections with hyaluronidase prior to staining with HABP was done to ensure that we were accurately analyzing skin HA, and these sections were clear of any staining except in the residual connective tissues that were clearly cleaved with hyaluronidase, but not fully washed off from the histologic slides during the staining procedure. 7–8-week-old female mice were observed to have a thicker epidermal layer and more adiposity at baseline; male mice, on the other hand, had a thicker dermal layer and less adiposity. Representative images from our histological results are in

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Dao and Kazin 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). We observed that treatment with topical 4-MU notably resulted in dermal matrix disorganization and a breakdown in the normal dermal HA pattern in both male and female mice relative to untreated controls, with no apparent exacerbation of this effect on the basis of sex.

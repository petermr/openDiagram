<p>Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) intervene the ubiquitination and turnover of specific substrates of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A conserved core sequence composed of about 150 amino acids from the -NH
 <sub>2</sub> terminus consisted in E2 proteins, and cysteine residue is necessary in this region, which plays an essential role in the formation of thiol ester bond with the -COOH terminus of ubiquition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this study, the expressions of E2 proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with Se were all higher than that of the control groups, and the highest expression of E2 proteins was obtained in the nano-Se groups. Higher expression of E2 proteins indicated the increase of cysteine. Compared with the groups fed with adequate or supranutritional selenium, the significantly decreased levels of plasma homocysteine and cysteine were found in the rats and/or mice fed with selenium-deficient diet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The homocysteine can be converted to cystathionine and cysteine, formed from cystathionine, can be incorporated into protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, the three forms of Se may accelerate cysteine increase in the Caco-2 cells and then promote the expression of E2 proteins, and nano-Se has the optimum efficiency to increase cysteine and the expression of E2 protein.

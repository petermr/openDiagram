<p>A comprehensive high-quality spectral library was built following established and validated bioinformatics protocols [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005104.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. All mass TripleTOF 5600+ fragment ion spectra files (.
 <italic>wiff</italic>) from shotgun data acquisition (DDA mode) were converted into an open format (mzML) using qtofpeakpicker (ProteoWizard, v/3.0.9576) and fragment ion spectrum complexity was subsequently reduced to keep the top 150 peaks using msconvert (ProteoWizard, v/3.0.9576). All datasets were conducted through sequence database searches against a

The identified peptides were statistically scored using PeptideProphet and iProphet. False discovery rate (FDR) control was conducted using MAYU, and only proteins with a minimum of two unique peptides per protein and a FDR &lt;1% were used in subsequent analyses. The validated spectra were used to generate a consensus library and all retention times were normalized using SpectraST. To generate a SWATH assay library from the consensus spectra, spectral libraries were formatted for Skyline and the most abundant y and b fragment ions for each spectra with

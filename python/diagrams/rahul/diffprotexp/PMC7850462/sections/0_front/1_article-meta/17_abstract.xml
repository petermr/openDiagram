  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>This study was designed to uncover the mechanism of miR-34b-5p-mediated aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in sepsis-induced injury using human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2).</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Serum levels of miR-34b-5p, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, serum creatinine (SCr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in septic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and healthy controls were detected. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce sepsis in HK-2 cells. LPS-induced HK-2 cells were transfected with miR-34b-5p inhibitor, miR-34b-5p mimic, pcDNA3.1-AQP2, si-AQP2, miR-34b-5p inhibitor + si-NC, or miR-34b-5p inhibitor + si-AQP2. The expressions of miR-34b-5p, AQP2, Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in HK-2 cells were detected. TUNEL staining revealed the apoptosis of HK-2 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay verified the binding between miR-34b-5p and AQP2.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The expression of miR-34b-5p and the inflammatory responses were augmented in septic AKI patients. miR-34b-5p was up-regulated and AQP2 was down-regulated in LPS-induced HK-2 cells. miR-34b-5p inhibition or AQP2 overexpression ameliorated apoptosis and inflammation in LPS-induced HK-2 cells. In contrast, overexpressing miR-34b-5p deteriorated LPS-induced injury in HK-2 cells. AQP2 was a downstream target of miR-34b-5p. AQP2 silencing abolished the suppressive effects of miR-34b-5p inhibition on LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response in HK-2 cells.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>miR-34b-5p inhibits AQP2 to promote LPS-induced injury in HK-2 cells.</p>

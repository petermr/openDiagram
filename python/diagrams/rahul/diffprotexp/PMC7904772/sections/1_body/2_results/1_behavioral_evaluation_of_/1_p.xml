<p id="Par16">In general, the preclinical model offered by the CMS protocol can help to explore potential molecular features of depression and anxiety disorders. In this study, SPT and FST were used to assess the CMS-induced depression-like behavior (anhedonia and behavioral despair). Afterward, the EMT experiment was used to index anxiety-like behavior. Given the rat prefrontal cortical sample used was from the same batch as the CMS model used in our previous publication

 </sup>, it was briefly illustrated that the sucrose inclination of the depression-susceptible group was diminished, whereas the immobility time was increased when compared to the other groups. Despite this, some stressed rats did not show depression-like behavior, yet their anxiety-like behavior was found by the EMT. Accordingly, these stressed rats were classified as the anxiety-susceptible group. Also, there were no significant differences in the SPT, FST, or EMT between the insusceptible and control groups. This suggests the insusceptible group did not include any anxiety-like or depression-like phenotypes. By these evaluations, we finally obtained a subset of the depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, insusceptible, and control groups. These results demonstrated that the CMS protocol offered an effective way of defining CMS-induced molecular patterns related to susceptibility and resiliency to depression or anxiety.

0: Like many other Apicomplexan parasites [ 10],  P. falciparum is specialized to infect two separate hoststhe human host, and the female mosquitoes of approximately 40  Anopheles species that can transmit the disease [ 11].
1: The developmental cycle starts with malaria-infected female  Anopheles mosquito taking a blood meal, through which the sporozoites of  Plasmodium parasites are transmitted from the mosquitos salivary gland to the human host (Additional file  1: Figure S1).
2: The sporozoites then travel to the liver and infect liver cells, allowing them to replicate and mature into schizonts.
3: They then rupture and release merozoites, which infect red blood cells and is the stage that causes clinical manifestation of malaria.
4: Some of the blood-stage parasites mature into sexual precursor cells, known as gametocytes, which are ingested by the  Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal.
5: The gametocytes are activated by environmental stimuli inside mosquito midgut and differentiate into gametes and fuse to form a zygote [ 12].
6: The zygotes further develop into oocysts, within which sporogony takes place and produces sporozoites to invade mosquitos salivary gland, ready for next round of infection via a mosquito bite.

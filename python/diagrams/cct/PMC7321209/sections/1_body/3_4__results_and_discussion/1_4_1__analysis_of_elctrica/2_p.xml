<p>Short circuits are characterized by deflections in welding current and voltage in relation to the base values. Herein, a rapid voltage drop with increasing current could be recognized (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, circle number 1). At this point, the molten droplet transferred from the end of the electrode into the melt bead. A material bridge between the fed wire and the melt pool occurred. After material transition the arc re-ignited. Therefore, high voltage was required, which was characterized by peaks in welding voltage (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, circle number 2). At this point, welding current dropped slowly due to inductances in the welding circuit, leading to high welding power during arc re-ignition. The subsequent period of arc time led to the melting of the electrode tip and the formation of a new droplet (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b; circle number 3). Thereby, increasing arc time promoted droplet growth (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b; circle number 4) before the molten material transferred into the melt bead during the next short circuit phase.

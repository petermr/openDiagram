 <caption> Transcriptome analysis of the human granulosa HGrC1 cell line under different transfection conditions. a Schematic summary of study design. FOXL2 WT/FOXL2 C134W were in pCS2 + expression plasmid constructs; FOXO1 3A in pCDNA3 expression construct to minimize promoter competition. b Principal component 1 and 2 from all samples of the study, color-coded as indicated in the legend. Principal components were calculated on vst-normalized expression values from the top 500 most variable genes across samples. (SMAD3 was co-transfected with the other protein constructs per Methods but is omitted in the legend for brevity). c Venn diagram showing the number of differential genes (DESeq, q &lt; 0.05) identified in 3 pairs of conditions: FOXL2 WT vs Vectors, FOXL2 C134W vs Vectors and FOXL2 C134W vs FOXL2 WT. d Heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the 717 DEGs between FOXL2 C134W and FOXL2 WT in all 5 conditions. Expression values are z-score normalized across samples (columns) </caption>

<p>Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is one of the water channels expressed by renal collecting duct principal cells and plays an essential role in maintaining body water homeostasis [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Deficiency of AQPs is observed in many renal diseases, including AKI, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, renal cell carcinoma, and renal fibrosis [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Urinary exosomal release of AQP2 was reduced in ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI [

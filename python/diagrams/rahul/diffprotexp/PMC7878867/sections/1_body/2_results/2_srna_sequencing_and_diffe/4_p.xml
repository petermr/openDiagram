<p id="Par21">To study DEMs with tissue-specific patterns, paired comparisons were made between the flag leaf and developing grain samples (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). For progeny from the control parents and treated with the control conditions, 1067 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) between the flag leaf and the developing grain (AtCC_L vs AtCC_G). For progeny from the control parents but treated with water-deficit stress, 923 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1, AtCW_L vs AtCW_G). For progeny from stressed parents treated with the control conditions, 1168 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1) between the flag leaf and the developing grain tissue (AtWC_L vs AtWC_G). While finally, for progeny from stressed parents but treated with water-deficit stress, 1074 miRNAs showed significant differential expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log2foldchange|&gt; 1, AtWW_L vs AtWW_G). It appears that a higher number of miRNAs had tissue-specific expression in the progeny from the stressed parents (Supplementary Table

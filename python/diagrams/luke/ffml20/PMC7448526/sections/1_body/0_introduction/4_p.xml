<p>No detailed experimental evidence on the role of methanol loading in methoxylation has been reported so far. The present study, therefore, evaluates the effect of the number of methanol molecules per acidic site on the methoxylation at room temperature by 
 <italic>operando</italic> DRIFTS and MS. To this end, the methanol loading in H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al ≈ 25) pores is systematically varied between 32, 16, 8 and 4 molecules per unit cell, which corresponds to 8, 4, 2 and 1 molecules per Brønsted acidic site, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results show that the higher the methanol loading, the faster the methoxylation. Accordingly, the reaction is more than an order of magnitude faster with 8 methanol molecules per Brønsted acidic site than that with 2 molecules. Significantly, we find that no methoxylation is observed with ≤1 molecule per acidic site.

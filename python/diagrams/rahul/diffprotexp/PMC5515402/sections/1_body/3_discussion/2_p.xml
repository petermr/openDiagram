<p>Although androgen doses between 1 to 10 μM initiated apoptosis in a neuroblastoma cell line [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], in our study, 1 μM of AAS did not affect the viability of GT1-7 neurons, nor did they affect caspase activity. In this regard, two other cell lines have been differentially affected by androgens. Specifically, dopaminergic N27 neurons showed androgen-induced apoptosis, whereas GT1-7 cells were not affected [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, others have shown that exposure to methandrostenelone (1 μM), an AAS that belongs to the same category as 17α-meT, reported cell viability that ranged between 80–95% [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To further argument against possible treatment-induced toxic effects, we showed that physiological levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 0.1 μM) overexpressed pERK (131.86% over control; p = 0.026, unpaired t-test), similar to what we observed by 17α-meT (1 μM). In accordance with our data, another study suggested that androgen-induced-neuroprotection might be achieved through overexpression/activation of ERK signaling [
 <xref rid="pone.0180409.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, given that, in our study, the integrity of the cells was not compromised by a supraphysiological dose of androgens, we showed that, under these conditions, GT1-7 cells revealed protein changes in the categories of cellular metabolism, drug detoxification, stress response, cell cycle and motility, as well as in nucleotide binding and protein modification and transport.

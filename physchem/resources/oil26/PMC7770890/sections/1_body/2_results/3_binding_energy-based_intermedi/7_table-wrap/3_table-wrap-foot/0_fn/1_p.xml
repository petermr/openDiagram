<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The table is organized by ranking
the binding energy from low to high. The species in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> were not included in this table.
The binding energy cutoff (&#8722;47 EEU) was chosen by maximally
discriminating the experimentally determined effective ACE2 receptors
from the less effective ones.</p>

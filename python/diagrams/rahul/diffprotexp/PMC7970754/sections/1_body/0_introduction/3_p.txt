0: Therefore, this study aims to explore the specific mechanism surrounding RSV-mediated apoptosis of TNBC cells.
1: The corresponding flow chart of this research is shown in  Figure 1.
2: RNA sequencing was used to observe the changes of POLD1, other apoptosis-related pathways and factors in MDA-MB-231 under RSV treatment.
3: Additionally, genes and pathways related to POLD1s potential role were analyzed, and changes in the transcription and translation levels of POLD1 and its related genes were verified.
4: Subsequently,  via ectopic expression of POLD1, the role of POLD1 in RSV-mediated breast cancer cell apoptosis  in vivo and  in vitro were further explored.
5: The obtained results suggested that RSV may promote apoptosis of TNBC cells by reducing the expression of POLD1 to activate the apoptotic pathway, which may be a potential mechanism pertaining to its anticancer effects on TNBC.

0: GT1-7 cells were grown as previously described in proteomic experiments.
1: Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with CelLytic Mammalian Lysis/Extraction Reagent, supplemented with SIGMAFAST TM Protease Inhibitor Tablets (SigmaAldrich, MO).
2: Extracts were maintained with constant agitation for 30 min at 4C and then centrifuged for 20 min at 17, 000 g. Supernatants were collected and used to determine total protein concentration using the Bradford Quick-Start Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
3: All procedures were performed at 4C and samples were stored at -80C for further protein extraction and western blotting.

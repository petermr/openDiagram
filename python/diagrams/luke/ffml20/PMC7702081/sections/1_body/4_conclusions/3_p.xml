<p>We propose an approach to determine concentration‐dependent values of the hydration number of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>(aq) based on the water dipole reorientation dynamics. In this methodology, a hydration status analysis is devised to quantify the cooperative effect of ions on the reorientation dynamics of different water subpopulations in electrolyte solutions. This hydration model provides a tool to characterize the behavior of water in the hydration shell of ions and quantify the cation‐anion mixture effect on water reorientational dynamics. We have found that water molecules that are in the first shell of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, and water molecules that are in the second shell of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and the first shell of Cl
 <sup>−</sup> have a retarded reorientation dynamics compared with bulk‐like behavior, but no cooperative long‐range effects are observed for water molecules that are in the second hydration shell of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup>. The hydration number is determined from the number of moles of water molecules per mole of dissolved salt that no longer participate in bulk‐like reorientation dynamics. The hydration numbers of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> from this 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD analysis are in good agreement with those obtained from THz‐DR experiments. This approach is based on a well‐defined criterion for the definition of the hydration number and provides a link between this macroscopic parameter and the molecular‐level processes responsible for affecting the dynamic properties of the solution compared with bulk‐liquid water.

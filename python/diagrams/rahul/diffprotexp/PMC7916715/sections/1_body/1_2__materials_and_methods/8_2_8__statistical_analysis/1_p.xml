<p>Kaplan–Meier surviving curves, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) regression analyses were carried out using the R survival package. The PH assumption was tested. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were run using the R survival package. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (tROC) analysis was performed using the R timeROC package. A two-tailed Student’s t test, one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-hoc test were also performed. A value of

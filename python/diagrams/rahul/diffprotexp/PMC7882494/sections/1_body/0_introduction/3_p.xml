<p>The mutations in the COL11A1 gene and resultant impact on the oncogenomic and metabolic pathways are indeed very much essential in understanding the etiology of human colorectal cancer and are yet unclear, thus it provides an area for new research in understanding the actual significance of the COL11A1 gene in the progression of colorectal carcinoma. Regarding this, the application of various bioinformatics tools using the huge dataset of well-established cancer data from different demographic and clinicopathologic patients provides a comprehensive area for further research and development of therapeutic strategies. Considering the background, the objective of the present study is to collectively examine the differential expression, survival, co-expression, correlation, mutations, and protein-protein interaction network that result in the alteration of various pathways related to the COL11A1 gene playing a key role in the transformation of human colon tissue to colorectal cancer using an integrated bioinformatics approach. In addition, our study also aggregates all the available discrete data to identify the significance of the COL11A1 gene as a prognosis biomarker for colorectal cancer which may be useful in designing future research for the conception of appropriate therapeutic strategies.</p>

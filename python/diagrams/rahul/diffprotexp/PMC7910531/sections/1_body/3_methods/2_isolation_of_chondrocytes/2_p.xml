Each cartilage portion was minced with a scalpel and placed in 20 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 6 mgml
 <sup>−1</sup> collagenase A (Sigma). The tissue culture flasks were incubated overnight to digest the cartilage pieces. The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 30 μm filter (Miltenyi) and centrifuged at 400×

0: The viability was evaluated by the following formula: (1)%  Viability=ODOD0100.OD is the optical density of the solution in wells containing cells treated with essential oils and OD 0 is the optical density of the solution in wells containing DMSO treated cells (negative control).
1: The test was performed in triplicate.
2: The IC 50 values were graphically determined using the Microsoft excel 2013 edition.

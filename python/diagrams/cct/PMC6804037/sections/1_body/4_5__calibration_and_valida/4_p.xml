<p>The temperature distribution in the hardening direction is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f017">Figure 17</xref>a. During the simulation, the temperature reached about 1400 K by ensuring the phase transformation in the hardened region. Mesh size was essential to achieve the precision of the temperature distribution in the regions with high thermal gradients. The mesh used in the FEM simulation is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-03136-f017">Figure 17</xref>b. The mapped mesh in the geometry had 12,800 volumetric elements and 1024 nodes. The mesh was applied uniformly in the sample volume.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The<italic> p</italic>-anisidine value of the oil was 0.08 and lower than that of 0.30 reported for<italic> Salvia hispanica</italic> L. seed oil [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The total oxidation (TOTOX) value of 2.06 was lower than those of vegetable oils reported in the literature and indicates high primary and secondary oxidative stability [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The oxidative stability of<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil was 52.53&#8201;h at 120&#176;C. This value was higher than those of palm kernel oil (26.80&#8201;h) and refined-bleached-deodorized palm olein (25.50&#8201;h) measured at 110&#176;C [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The low level of polyunsaturated fatty acids provides the oil with high oxidative stability [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The double bounds in polyunsaturated are more reactive than a double bound in a monounsaturated chain [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Consequently, the high level of monounsaturated fatty acids and the high proportion of saturated fatty acids in<italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil are factors that positively contribute to the oil oxidative stability.</p>

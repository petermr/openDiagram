 <caption> Western blot and densitometric analysis of MCT1 and PrP c expression in the cortex of 9-month-old WT and Prnp −/− mice. ( A) Homogenates prepared from cortex were examined for MCT1 and PrP c expression by Western blotting. All brain homogenates of WT mice exhibited PrP c expression (diglycosylated at 35 kDa, monoglycosylated at 33 kDa and unglycosylated at 26 kDa), whereas Prnp −/− mice blots confirmed the absence of PrP c. An equal protein load (20 µg per lane) is shown by GAPDH expression. ( B) Densitometric quantification of band intensities via Image Lab 6.0.1 revealed a higher protein expression of MCT1 in WT as compared to Prnp −/− mice. The analyses were performed on n = 4 animals per group in three different Western blots. Displayed are means ± SEM. A p-value &lt; 0.01 is considered as very significant (**). </caption>

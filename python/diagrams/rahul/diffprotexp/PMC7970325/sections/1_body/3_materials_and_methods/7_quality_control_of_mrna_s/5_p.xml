<p id="p0325">Overall, our data quality assay did not identify any significant internal problems or internal bias in the RNA sequencing data presented. We did not include the poorly differentiated thyroid cancer sample in our further analysis because it cannot be used for group comparisons. We used reads per million (RPM) normalization of expression data. We filtered low-expressed values (less than one) to reduce data noise.</p>

<p>Auxin, particularly indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), is a plant growth hormone that affects plantsâ€™ growth and development [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Following treatment of 10 mM IAA, an analysis of the differential log 2-fold expression showed that only three 
 <italic>StbZIPs</italic> (5, 32, and 59) exhibit positive regulation, while a set of 18 
 <italic>bZIPs</italic> are down-regulated. IAA regulates various biological and physiological processes such as cell elongation, induction of root growth, and flower and fruit development [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Such responses are controlled by the cis-acting auxin-responsive elements (AuxREs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], which are directly linked by auxin response factors (ARFs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] by protein-protein interaction and repressed by AUX / IAA protein transcription [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The promoter analysis in prior studies suggests that other cis-elements are also involved in auxin-mediated transcription in addition to AuxREs. For example, the soybean and tobacco GH3 promoters found a conserved organization of G-box-related elements (GREs) located near AuxREs [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. An enrichment of modules consisting of GREs and AuxREs in auxin-inducible promoters in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice was reported using 
 <italic>in silico</italic> bioinformatics approaches [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Based on our expression data, and available literature, it is evident that 
 <italic>bZIPs</italic> regulate ABA / IAA stress in potato.

0: Alternative splicing is also regulated by epigenetic marks 8,  9.
1: Histone modifications and DNA methylation can affect exon usage by controlling the elongation speed of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and, consequently, the choice of splice sites.
2: Furthermore, they may affect the recruitment of splicing factors to chromatin through adapters such as CHD1.
3: Moreover, chromatin modifications have been found to regulate the activity of alternative or cryptic transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in the genome 10.
4: Indeed, deregulation of alternative promoter usage has been recently identified as a common phenomenon in cancer 11.
5: However, underlying genetic reasons for alternative promoter choice are largely unknown.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Essential oils were characterized as good bioactive agents, because of oils and extracts from plants presenting LC<sub>50</sub> values below 1000&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and previous studies by Andrade et al. [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Meyer et al. [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and Nascimento et al. [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] considered them as bioactive. Specifically, oils and plant extracts have degrees of toxicity against larvae of<italic> A. salina. </italic>According to the intervals, they demonstrated activity at or below 100&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and were considered as having a strong cytotoxic activity. LC<sub>50</sub> values between 100 and 500&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were considered to be moderately toxic. LC<sub>50</sub> values between 500 and 1000&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were considered as weak cytotoxic activity, while LC<sub>50</sub> values greater than 1000&#8201;<italic>&#956;</italic>g&#183;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were categorized as nontoxic [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>

<p>Our study identified aberrantly expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in endothelial cells, analyzed their biological functions and the signal pathways in tumorâ€“endothelium interaction, and it verified significant upregulation of PRKAA2 mRNA and its targeted miRNA, miR-124-3p, which plays a key role in endothelial cells with tumor adhesion.</p>

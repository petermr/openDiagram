  <p>Protein levels of Ca
   <sub>v</sub>3.3 in male and female FRICT-ION mice following Ca
   <sub>v</sub>3.3-blocking peptide injection. (A) Ca
   <sub>v</sub>3.3 vs actin levels in whole TG lysates of male and female naïve, male and female FRICT-ION injected with control TAT-C3D peptide, and male and female FRICT-ION mice injected with Ca
   <sub>v</sub>3.3-blocking TAT-C3P peptide (n = 3 mice per group). (B) Normalized ratio of intensity of TAT-C3P-injected to control TAT-C3D-injected male and female FRICT-ION mice at the peak of the anti-allodynic effect (4 hrs post-injection). (*p &lt; 0.05, t-test)

<p>In 2014, the proteome map of human tooth pulp was reported, with a total of 342 proteins identified [
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-08-01234" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the present study, we compared the proteomic profiles of healthy pulp with inflamed and traumatic pulp. This study improves the current understanding of the difference between healthy pulp and inflamed or traumatic pulp to a limited extent. Specifically, annexin V seems to play a critical role in the inhibition of inflammation and promotion of the immune reaction. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of annexin V in pulp inflammation.

<p>Secretion of GAG by cMSC cultures was significantly elevated from day-0 with the highest level observed at day-21 (p&lt;0.01), which is about ten times more than day-0 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, the deposition of GAG declined at day-28 (83.94 ± 4.83 ng GAG/μg/mL protein). No significant difference was found between the GAG amount at day-21 and day-28 (
 <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). In general, ACs secreted GAG at a slower pace than cMSCs. However, AC doubled its GAG secretion at day-14 (65.42 ± 0.57 ng GAG/μg/mL protein) as compared to day-0 (14.85 ± 0.38 ng GAG/μg/mL protein), and the highest being observed at day-21(107.55 ± 6.28 ng GAG/μg/mL protein). At day-28, GAG secretion by ACs declined to 91.25 ± 4.82 ng GAG/μg/mL protein. In addition, secreted GAG from cMSC and ACs did not differ between day-21 and day-28 (p&gt;0.05).

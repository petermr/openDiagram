<p id="Par44">The prognosis-related tumor antigens were next screened from the aforementioned genes as potential candidates for developing mRNA vaccine. Twenty-one genes were closely associated with the OS of PAAD patients, of which 7 genes showed significant correlation with the RFS

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, patients overexpressing ADAM metallopeptidase domain 9 (ADAM9) in the tumor tissues had significantly shorter survival compared to the ADAM9
 <sup>low</sup> group. Likewise, high expression levels of Ephrin B2 (EFNB2), MET proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (MET), tropomodulin 3

 <bold>)</bold>. One gene was identified as a favorable prognosis factor (data not shown). Taken together, 6 gene candidates were identified that are critical for PAAD development and progression. Furthermore, higher expression levels of ADAM9, EFNB2, MET, and TMOD3 were significantly associated with increased tumor infiltration of macrophages, DCs and/or B cells

 <bold>)</bold>. These findings suggest that the identified tumor antigens may be directly processed and presented by the APCs to T cells, and recognized by the B cells to trigger an immune response, and are therefore promising candidates for developing mRNA vaccine against PAAD.

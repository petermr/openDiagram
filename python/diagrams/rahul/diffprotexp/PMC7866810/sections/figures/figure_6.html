 <caption> Identification of the MLS sub-populations. ( a) Gene filtration by accounting for technical noise based on the variation and expression of the ERCC spike-ins. ( b) PCA plot visualizing clusters identified using model-based clustering. ( c) The plot from ( a) with cells colored based on their pseudo-time ordering. ( d) The plot from ( a) with cells labeled based on their cell cycle phase. ( e) A bar-plot of the outlier probabilities of all cells across clusters. ( f) A heatmap portrayal of cell-to-cell distances; cluster centers were ordered by hierarchic clustering. </caption>

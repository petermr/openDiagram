<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00405-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the X-ray diffraction analysis pattern of the pure PVdF, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and the prepared membrane composed of PVdF-SiO<sub>2</sub> at 2&#952; range of 18.3&#176; and 19.8&#176;, 26.6&#176; attributed to the &#945;(010), &#945;(110), and &#945;(021), which can reveal the pure PVdF contains only &#945;-phase [<xref rid="B26-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. From the diffraction pattern of the PVdF-SiO<sub>2</sub> separator membrane, it is observed that a strong peak appeared at 2&#952; = 20.2&#176; assigned to the &#946;-phases viz, &#946; (110) and &#946; (200) planes [<xref rid="B27-polymers-12-00405" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It can be clearly concluded that the introduction of SiO<sub>2</sub> into the pure PVdF changed the &#945;-phase into &#946; phase which elevates the amorphous nature with transformation in the prepared PVdF-SiO<sub>2</sub> separator membrane. This enhanced the ionic movement for larger Na-ion during the intercalation process.</p>

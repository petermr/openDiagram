0: Seventy percent of the HPC materials, 20% of the Ketjen black, and 10% of the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder was mixed in DI-water to form slurry.
1: Then, the anode was fabricated by painting the slurry on Cu foil and was dried at 60 C for 10 h. The HPC anode, lithium cathode, celgard 2400 separator, and the electrolyte (1 M LiPF 6 in a mixed solution of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate, EC/DEC = 1:1 by volume) were encapsulated into 2025 coin cells in a glovebox under an Ar atmosphere (H 2O< 0.01 ppm and O 2< 0.01 ppm).
2: The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the batteries were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Princeton, VersaSTAT 4, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) at 0.1 mV s 1 from 0.01 to 3 V. Galvanostatic charge-discharge were tested on a NEWARE battery tester (Shenzhen, China) in the voltage window of 0.013 V (vs. Li +/Li).

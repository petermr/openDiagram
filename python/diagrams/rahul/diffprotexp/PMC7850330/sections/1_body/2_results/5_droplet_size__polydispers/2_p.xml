<p>Droplet size is an important characteristic for evaluation of the stability of nanoemulsion and improvement of drug bioavailability (Xi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It is an essential factor since it influences the drug release and biological absorption (Parul et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Depending on the appearance, viscosity and entrapment results, F1, F2 and F3 were selected for this investigation. The mean droplet size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of these formulations are displayed in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. F3 demonstrated the smallest droplet size (85.2
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>0.2
 <bold> </bold>nm) while F1 showed the largest one (149
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>2
 <bold> </bold>nm). F2 and F3 had the lowermost values of PDI (0.44
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>0.02 and 0.35
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>0.0 respectively) while F1 exhibited a PDI value of 0.78
 <bold> </bold>±
 <bold> </bold>0.01. Zeta Potential ranged from −20.8 to −29.7
 <bold> </bold>mV with F2 having the highest value. The electrical conductivity values ranged from 0.00 to 0.02 mS/cm. Thus, F2 and F3 were selected for following investigations.

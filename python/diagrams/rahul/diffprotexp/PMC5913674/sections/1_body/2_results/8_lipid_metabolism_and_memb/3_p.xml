<p>Additionally, a range of transmembrane and plasma membrane associated proteins were differential expressed in all MtzR lines, which have been summarized and sorted into functional categories in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>. Of the groups not previously addressed in the results section ‘EGF-Like Proteins and VSPs’, section 3.4, several peptidases were observed as differentially expressed throughout MtzR lines. Some of these were EFG-like, cysteine-rich endopeptidases, with 1 (14 225) universally downregulated in all 3 lines. Additionally, several different dipeptidyl-peptidases were differentially expressed, which have been previously implicated in regulation and signal transduction relating to encystation [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These dipeptidyl-peptidases, while potentially linked to amino acid metabolism, are also secreted proteins [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which may allow them to compete with host amino acid metabolism. Several members from the annexin-like alpha-giardins that interact with phospholipids [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] were exclusively observed only within downregulated proteins across MtzR lines, although no specific alpha-giardins were common between lines. Beta-giardin (4812), which is a microtubule associated protein in the adhesive disc [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], was also downregulated in MtzR lines.

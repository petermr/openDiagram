<p id="Par67">A search for hormone-related transcripts expressed during the apomictic and sexual reproductive developments was performed by testing our transcriptomes against the

A BLASTx analysis showed 3781 top hits associated with plant hormones and related compounds, including 714 related with auxin, 595 with jasmonate, 592 with cytokinin, 520 with abscisic acid, 517 with gibberellin, 487 with brassinosteroids, 245 with salicylic acid and 111 with ethylene (Additional file

Of them, 56 (related to auxin), 70 (related to jasmonate), 39 (related to cytokinin), 42 (related to abscisic acid), 46 (related to gibberellin), 36 (related to brassinosteroids), 21 (related to salicylic acid) and 5 (related to ethylene) transcripts resulted differentially expressed between the apomictic and sexual samples (DE Hormones) (Additional file

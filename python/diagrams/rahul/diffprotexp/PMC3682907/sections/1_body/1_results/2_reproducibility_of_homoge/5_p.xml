<p>The two methods gave a similar pattern of protein intensities, and significant differences in mean peak intensities with the two homogenization methods were observed only for one protein peak (m/z = 11,814 Da). Nevertheless, it is clear that method M2 introduces significant additional variability beyond that contributed by the SELDI-MS method itself, while homogenization method M1 together with the subcellular fractionation method employed here yield highly reproducible protein samples for proteomic analysis.</p>

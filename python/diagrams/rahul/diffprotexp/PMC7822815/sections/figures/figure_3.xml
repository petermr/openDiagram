   <bold>a</bold> Violin plot showing the enrichment level of Kasumi-1 exon-exon junctions in the transcriptome of primary t(8;21)-positive leukemia blasts from 20 patient samples. 
   <italic>P</italic>-values were calculated with two-sided Mannâ€“Whitney U test. 
   <bold>b, c</bold> Independent component analysis of t(8;21)-positive AML cells with normal CD34-positive cells 
   <bold>b</bold> or other AML subtypes 
   <bold>c</bold>. This analysis included 20 samples of each cell type. For each sample, the expression of 84,743 exon-exon junctions was quantified.

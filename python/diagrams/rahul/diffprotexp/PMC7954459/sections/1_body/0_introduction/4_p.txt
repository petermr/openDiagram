0: Chickpea being the second most cultivated legume crop worldwide, understanding of seed development and seed size/weight traits is important to provide a foundation for its improvement.
1: Recently, transcriptome analysis during seed development in two chickpea cultivars with contrasting seed size/weight suggested that extended period of cell division at lateembryogenesis and high level of endoreduplication at midmaturation stages are the possible factors that determine large seed size/weight in chickpea (Garg et al.,  2017).
2: Although miRNAs and their targets have been analyzed in different tissues/organs (mostly vegetative) in chickpea (Jain et al.,  2014; Khandal et al.,  2017; Khemka et al.,  2016; Srivastava et al.,  2015), their analysis during seed development and role in seed size/weight determination remains to be explored.

<p id="Par2">Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial that kills bacteria by inhibiting their growth and replication. Antibiotics target a diverse range of molecules and processes including DNA gyrase, RNA polymerase, cell wall synthesis, metabolic pathways and protein synthesis

 </sup>. Due to the central nature of protein synthesis to life, many different antibiotics target and disrupt this process. Protein production occurs via the action of the ribosome, which covalently links amino acids together through the catalytic action of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Newly synthesized protein segments leave the ribosome through the exit tunnel

 </sup>, a 10 nm long, irregularly-shaped tunnel that is on average 1.5 nm in diameter. The passage of a newly synthesized protein through the exit tunnel can be dramatically slowed due to interactions between the exit tunnel wall and sequence motifs within the primary structure of nascent proteins

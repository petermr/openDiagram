0: Total RNA was extracted from HepG2.2.15 cells transfected with CPSF1 or scrambled siRNAs.
1: Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kits (Illumina) and subjected to 150 cycle paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform.
2: Each group was sequenced in three replicates.
3: Quality control and preprocessing of the sequencing data were performed using fastp-0.20.1 ( Chen S. et al., 2018).
4: Based on the constructed transcriptome, the abundance of transcripts was quantified by Salmon-1.0.0 ( Patro et al., 2017) and gene models were generated in BED format.
5: Wiggle files indicative of read coverage were generated by GenomeCoverageBed (BEDTools, v2.26.0) after sequence alignment by STAR-2.7.0f ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010).
6: Then, APA event analysis was performed using DaPars (version 0.9.1) to predict proximal polyadenylation sites and distal polyadenylation sites ( Masamha et al., 2014).
7: Significant APA events were determined using three criteria.
8: First, the  P-value of the PDUI differences should be<0.05.
9: Second, the absolute mean difference of the PDUI must be 0.2.
10: Third, the mean PDUI fold change must be 1.5.
11: For functional analysis of the transcripts, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) gene sets were analyzed using DAVID 3.
12: For motif analysis, sequences between proximal and distal polyadenylation sites were collected in FASTA format and submitted to MEME suits 4.
13: For network analysis of functional protein association, CPSF1-associated proteins were filtered using experimental or curated data from the STRING database 5.
14: For APA data analyzed by DaPars, we downloaded the PDUI values of transcripts from 6.

  <p>Validation of the differential expression analysis of 28 DEGs in whole blood from melioidosis patients. Genes that were found to be differentially expressed in patients with melioidosis that did not survive and survived were validated with real-time qPCR. The Kruskal–Wallis test was performed for comparing three groups. Subjects from our study were melioidosis survivors (
   <italic>n</italic> = 30), melioidosis non-survivors (
   <italic>n</italic> = 30), and healthy controls (
   <italic>n</italic> = 20). *

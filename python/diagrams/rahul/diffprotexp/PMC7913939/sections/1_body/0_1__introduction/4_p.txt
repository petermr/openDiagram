0: Therefore, we aimed to investigate if the presence/absence of PrP c in the cortex and the cerebellum of WT and  Prnp  / mice may directly influence MCT mRNA/protein expression levels along with additional genes involved in lactate/pyruvate energy metabolism, such as  basigin,  LDH-A and  LDH-B.
1: In particular, the former protein is of interest because it is recognized as necessary for correct MCT1 localization and functioning [ 20].
2: Moreover, we investigated the hippocampus, in which important glucose metabolism changes were reported in prion-diseased mice [ 2].

<p>The oxygen‐oxygen (O−O) radial distributions (RDF) for pure water and aqueous MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution, 
 <italic>with</italic> and 
 <italic>without</italic> contact ion pairs, are reported in Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and Figure 
 <xref rid="cphc202000498-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B. The first and second peak are positioned at 2.74 Å and 4.5 Å, which correspond to the average O−O distance of two hydrogen bonded water molecules and of two water molecules hydrogen bonding to the same water molecule, respectively. The O−O RDF profiles show a progressive rise in the first minimum and lowering of the first and second maxima with increasing concentration, this being associated with a decreasing order in the system. The influence of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> on the water structure is noticeable even at low concentrations (0.15 mol kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). On the contrary, Gaiduk et al. reported 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> MD simulations of NaCl(aq) where the O−O RDF was very close that that of pure water, even at much higher concentrations (0.9 mol dm
 <sup>−3</sup>).

 </xref> Similarly, classical MD simulations of KCl(aq) and CsCl(aq) with concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 1.90 mol kg
 <sup>−1</sup> did not display significant effects on the water structure.

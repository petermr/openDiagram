<p id="p0040">The thermal expansion curve measurement (DIL402C, NETZSCH, Germany), an illustration of the relationship between expansion and temperature (0–1173 K), is used to evaluate the phase transition process to ensure the martensite starting point (Ms) and martensite finishing point (Mf) in low cooling rate for the study of cracking susceptibility. The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curve measurement (Gleeble2000, DSI, USA), distinct from the thermal expansion curve, examines the phase transition process under different cooling rate to evaluate the cracking susceptibility. The sample was firstly heated from room temperature to 1273 K at a heating rate of 5 K/s, and held for 3 min to ensure a uniform thermal state afterwards, and then quenched to 100 °C with different cooling rate of, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 K/s.</p>

 <caption> Proteomic analysis of endometrial cancer cells after treatment with metformin or insulin. Protein lysates of HEC-1A cells were collected 7 days after repeated administration of 0.5 mmol/L metformin or 100 ng/mL insulin and subjected to scioDiscover antibody microarrays targeting 1,300 different proteins. Untreated cells served as the reference control sample. Proteins were defined as significantly differential for |log 2FC| ≥ 0.5 and an adjusted p value ≤ 0.05; n = 3. ( A– C) Volcano plots for each treatment group display the distribution of proteins that were differently expressed after metformin ( A) or insulin ( B) administration compared to control samples or between metformin and insulin treatments ( C). ( D) Hierarchical clustering of samples based on differential protein data. One sample (Metformin_3) was identified as an outlier and removed from proteomic analysis. ( E) Venn diagram of differentially expressed proteins after treatment with metformin or insulin (metformin/insulin vs. control) or between both treatment groups (metformin vs. insulin). </caption>

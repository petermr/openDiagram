0: The birnessite samples used in this work are important analogues to the most common vernadite and biogenic Mn oxides in nature and thus especially informative to understand natural and technological processes.
1: 21,  25,  41,  42 To this end, we prepared birnessite formed in acidic (AcidBir) and alkaline (-MnO 2) solutions, which are two synthetic representative isomorphs of layered MnO 2 with a hexagonal structure.
2: 25 Here, we follow the classification of Villalobos  et al., 25 where AcidBir is synthesized by reduction 16 of a permanganate solution under acidic conditions, and -MnO 2 is synthesized from a redox reaction of permanganate with Mn 2+ under alkaline conditions.

<p id="Par8">In the present study, we analyzed MEL-induced alterations of circRNA profiles in BMSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation through large-scale deep RNA sequencing, followed by elucidation of the roles of circ_0003865 in regulating BMSC osteogenic differentiation and OP development using both cell and animal models. These results provide novel insights into the BMSC differentiation-regulating functions of MEL associated with OP pathogenesis, which may also provide novel biomarkers for OP diagnosis and treatment.</p>

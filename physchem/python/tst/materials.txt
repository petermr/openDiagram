the size dependency of the
electrochemical properties in zero-dimensional CuO
nanoparticles synthesized by thermal decomposition of
CuC2O4 precursor at 400°C [9]. One-dimensional (1-D)
CuO nanorod and nanowire CuO electrodes have also
been produced via hydrothermal and wet chemical
methods for enhanced reversible capacity [10,11].
Recently, two-dimensional (2-D) CuO nanoribbons and
other three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures
such as dendrites and spheres, assembled with
nanoneedles, have been reported as high-performance
anodes for Li ion batteries [12-14].
Herein, we demonstrate a low-temperature and largescale
conversion of initially prepared 1-D Cu(OH)2
nanowires into 2-D CuO nanodiscs and further vertically
interlaced nanodisc structures. The detailed morphological
evolution during the growth of the
nanostructured CuO was examined by controlling the
reaction conditions, such as synthesis time and temperature.
The electrochemical reaction of Li with the
obtained CuO nanodiscs was investigated by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and galvanostatic cycling. Furthermore,
the enhanced reversible capacities and capacity retention
in the CuO nanodisc composite electrodes, by the incorporation
of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),
are reported by offering better efficient electron transport
paths.
Experimental
Cu(OH)2 nanowire precursors were prepared by a simple
chemical solution route at room temperature [15].
First, 30 mL of 0.15 M NH4OH (28-30% as ammonia,
NH3, Dae-Jung Chemical, Shiheung, South Korea) was
added to 100 mL of 0.04 M copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate
(CuSO4·5H2O, 99.5%, JUNSEI Chemical, Tokyo,
Japan), followed by drop-wise addition of 6.0 mL of 1.2
M NaOH (98%, Dae-Jung Chemical, Shiheung, South

Korea) under magnetic stirring. The Cu(OH)2 precipitate
appeared in the blue solution. The as-prepared
solution containing the Cu(OH)2 precursor was stored
at room temperature for 1 h and heat-treated at 60°C
for 3 h in a convection oven to produce CuO nanostructures.
The black powders were centrifuged and
washed with deionized water and ethanol several times
and were dried overnight at 70°C in a vacuum oven.
For preparation of the multiwalled carbon nanotube
(MWCNT)/CuO composites, a calculated amount (60
mg) of synthetic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT
Co., Ltd., Incheon, South Korea) was first dispersed and
sonicated for 3 h in 100 mL deionized water in the presence
of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%,
0.2 mg, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) [16].
After complete dispersion of the MWCNTs, the same
steps as those for the CuO nanopowders were followed.
The crystal structures and morphologies of each powder
were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD; model D/MAX-2500V/PC, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan),
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM;
model JSM-6330F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM;
model JEM-3000F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Additionally,
the specific surface areas were examined using the Brunauer-
Emmett-Teller (BET; Belsorp-mini, BEL Japan
Inc., Osaka, Japan) method with a nitrogen adsorption/
desorption process.
The electrochemical performance of each powder was
evaluated by assembling Swagelok-type half cells, using
a Li metal foil as the negative electrode. Positive electrodes
were cast on Cu foil by mixing prepared powders
(1.0-2.0 mg) with Super P carbon black (MMM Carbon,
Brussels, Belgium) and the Kynar 2801 binder (PVdFHFP)
at a mass ratio of 70:15:15 in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
(NMP; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis. MO, USA). A
separator film of Celgard 2400 and liquid electrolyte
(ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (1:1 by
volume) with 1.0 M LiPF6, Techno Semichem Co., Ltd.,
Seongnam, South Korea) was also used. The assembled
cells were galvanostatically cycled between 3.0 and 0.01
V using an automatic battery cycler (WBCS 3000,
WonaTech, Seoul, South Korea). All cyclic voltammetry
measurements were carried out at a scanning rate of 0.1
mV s-1.
Results and discussions
The crystal structures of the obtained CuO products
were analyzed through the XRD patterns in Figure 1a.
All the reflection peaks could be completely indexed as
well-crystalline, monoclinic CuO, which was in good
agreement with literature values (JCPDS file no. 48-
1548). As shown in Figure 1a, no characteristic peaks
from unreacted starting materials or initially synthesized
Cu(OH)2 precursors were detected on the XRD patterns
of the products, indicating that all samples obtained
were single-phase CuO.
Figure 1b shows the low magnification FESEM image
of CuO powders. It can be clearly observed that uniform
2-D disc-like morphologies with an average diameter of
500-700 nm and a thickness of 30-50 nm were obtained
on a large scale. More interestingly, more than one
standing disc was inserted into the central part of the
lying discs, indicating CuO-interlaced nanodisc structures.
This characteristic nanostructure was also confirmed
by local contrast differences in a representative
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of an
individual disc (Figure 1c). The inset in Figure 1c
depicts a typical CuO-interlaced nanodisc based on the
FESEM and TEM observations. Figure 1d shows the
magnified HRTEM image of the surface region in the
nanodisc. The measured lattice spacings obtained from
the HRTEM image were 2.76 and 2.30 Å, in accordance
with the (110) and (200) planes of the monoclinic CuO
structure, respectively.
To understand the growth mechanism of the above
CuO-interlaced nanodisc structures, temperature- and
time-dependent experiments were carried out. Figure 2
shows the series of typical FESEM images of samples
taken after reaching a preset temperature and time.
First, Cu2+ ions in the CuSO4 solution formed a squareplanar
complex [Cu(NH3)4]2+ upon addition of NH3OH
at room temperature [17]. When NaOH was further
added, Cu(OH)2 nanocrystals began to precipitate. The
template-free formation of a 1-D nanowire morphology
with a 30- to 50-nm diameter was due to the specific
crystal structure of Cu(OH)2 (Figure 2b), because the
growth of the layer-structured orthorhombic Cu(OH)2
along [100] was much faster than along any other direction,
leading to a tendency to form a 1-D structure
[10,14,15,18]. With the increase in the reaction temperature
from room temperature to 50°C, each nanowire was
shortened and thickened laterally due to the oriented
attachment of the Cu(OH)2 nanowires (Figure 2c,d)
[17-20]. Meanwhile, a gradual dehydration involving
conversion from Cu(OH)2 to CuO might occur.
After achieving a temperature of 60°C, most morphology
changed suddenly to a disc shape by the acceleration
of the oriented attachment (Figure 2e) because
this 2-D compact nanostructure would be energetically
favorable by reducing the interfacial energy of the 1-D
nanowires [18,21]. In addition, Cu(OH)2 almost completely
transformed into CuO. However, a small
amount of the Cu(OH)2 phase remained, supported by
the presence of nanowires reminiscent of the Cu(OH)2
precurso.r With a reaction time extended to 3 h,
complete conversion to CuO was observed using XRD
(Figure 1a).

Another feature in this CuO nanostructure was the
interlaced nanodisc morphologies, namely the vertically
interconnected structure with standing nanodiscs in the
center part of the lying nanodiscs (Figure 2f). The morphological
evolution of each intermediate phase is schematically
illustrated in Figure 2g. As a detailed
transformation process from Cu(OH)2 to CuO suggested
by Cudennec et al. [22], the possible formation mechanism
of the interlaced disc nanostructures can be
suggested via a different dissolution and recrystallization
pathway, which can be supported by the coexistence of
CuO nanodiscs and Cu(OH)2 nanowires (Figure 2e)
[23]. As the reaction time was prolonged, a Cu(OH)2
with a different dissolution rate, resulting in a different
nucleation rate and secondary nucleation, may occur at
high-energy sites on the surface of the primary nanodiscs
[4]. Finally, one or more secondary standing nanodiscs
gradually evolved into the larger lying flat

nanodiscs, finally forming interlaced disc nanostructures,
as reported in similar CuO nanostructures, by hydrothermal
conversion from Cu(OH)2 at 100-130°C [23,24].
Therefore, the formation mechanism of the CuO-interlaced
nanostructures during the phase conversion from
Cu(OH)2 can be given via combined effects of the
oriented attachment and subsequent dissolution-precipitation
processes.
The galvanostatic cycling characteristics of CuO-interlaced
nanodiscs in the configuration of the CuO/Li half
cell were investigated over a 0.01- to 3.0-V window at a
rate of C/5 (based upon a theoretical capacity of 670 mA
h g-1 by the conversion reaction, CuO + 2e- + 2Li+ ↔
Cu0 + Li2O), as shown in Figure 3. The first discharge
and charge capacities were 971 and 699 mA h g-1, respectively.
However, the capacity faded gradually from the
subsequent cycle to a reversible capacity of 290 mA h g-1
after 20 cycles. Recently, Xiang et al. reported the synthesis
of shuttle-shaped CuO particles with a length of 1
μm and a thickness of 100-200 nm at 90°C using Cu(Ac)
2·H2O precursor, which have similar structures to our
CuO-interlaced nanodiscs [8]. We found that shuttleshaped
CuO (cycled at a rate of C/10) and our CuOinterlaced
nanodiscs (cycled at a rate of C/5) showed
similar electrochemical performance. The BET surface
area of CuO-interlaced nanodiscs was estimated to be a
relatively large value, approximately 60 m2 g-1, but a significant
impact on the electrochemical performance of
this CuO-nanostructured electrode cannot be fully
realized, possibly due to the aggregated CuO nanostructure
(Figure 2f) and inhomogeneous mixing of conducting
Super P carbon black with CuO nanostructures,
which eventually increased the interparticle resistance,
thereby degrading electrochemical performance
[16,25,26]. This detrimental phenomenon may also have

been caused by the significant volume change upon
cycling [27].
Formation of composites by incorporation of
MWCNTs can provide an enhanced electronic conductivity
of electrodes and elastic buffers for releasing the
strain of CuO during the Li conversion reaction [28].
Figure 4a shows the XRD pattern of the CuO/MWCNT
composites. Compared to the XRD pattern of pure CuOinterlaced
nanodiscs (Figure 1a), that of the CuO/
MWCNT composites showed an additional peak at 25°
by the MWCNT phase. From a comparison of the weight
loss between pure CuO and CuO/MWCNT composites
using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), the incorporated
amount of MWCNT in the composites corresponded
to approximately 13%, as shown in Figure 4b.
Figure 4c,d shows typical FESEM images of the CuO/
MWCNT composite. MWCNTs were spatially dispersed
in the composites without any appreciable agglomeration.
In addition, the morphology of CuO in the composites
was found to be mostly primary nanodiscs, not the

interlaced disc nanostructures. It is believed that incorporation
of MWCNT mitigated secondary nucleation
and growth on the surface of the primary nanodiscs.
Cyclic voltammetry was recorded for pure CuO and
CuO/MWCNT, as shown in Figure 5. For both samples,
the CV profiles were nearly identical to those reported
for the CuO nanostructures [10,12]. Efficient electron
transport by introducing MWCNT upon lithiation of
the CuO was confirmed by the enhanced redox peaks in
the CV curves (measured on samples of similar mass at
the same voltage sweep rate). Therefore, it is believed
that MWCNT improved the Li electroactivity of the
CuO nanostructures because of its effect on conductivity
and the efficient electron path [16,26].
Figure 6 represents the charge-discharge behavior of
CuO/MWCNT composite electrodes at a rate of C/5.
The first discharge and charge capacities were 1,025 and
657 mA h g-1, respectively, and a high reversible capacity
of approximately 440 mA h g-1 obtained after 20
cycles. These CuO/MWCNT composite nanostructures
exhibited a higher reversible lithium storage capacity
and better capacity retention than the pure CuO nanodiscs
(Figure 3). The specific capacity of the CuO/
MWCNT composites was estimated to be 47% greater
than that of pure CuO nanodiscs. This additional
lithium storage capacity in the CuO/MWCNT composites
may result from the efficient electron transport by
the incorporation of MWCNT in high surface area CuO
nanostructures. Therefore, other surface modifications
using carbon or conductive metals could possibly
further improve electrochemical performance of these
CuO nanostructures.
Conclusion
In summary, the successful low-temperature synthesis of
phase-pure 2-D CuO-interlaced nanodiscs was demonstrated
using simple dehydrogenation of 1-D Cu(OH)2
nanowires at 60°C in solution. The details of the growth
aspects of the CuO-interlaced nanodiscs were suggested
by the combined effects of the oriented attachment and
subsequent dissolution-precipitation processes based on
systematic temperature- and time-dependent morphology
evolutions. These CuO nanostructures had a large
surface area, approximately 60 m2 g-1, and the effects of
their enhanced active sites by nanostructuring on the
electrochemical performance of CuO could be further
realized by the incorporation of MWCNTs.

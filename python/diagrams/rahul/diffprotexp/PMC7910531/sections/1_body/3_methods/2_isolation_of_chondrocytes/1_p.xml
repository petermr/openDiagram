 </sup> with the details as follows. Osteochondral samples were transported in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies), 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) (serum free media). Half of each sample was then taken forward for chondrocyte extraction. Cartilage was removed from the bone, dissected and washed twice in 1xPBS. Tissue was digested in 3 mg/ml collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum free media overnight at 37 °C on a flatbed shaker. The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 70 μm cell strainer (Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged at 400×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Subsequently, the cell pellet was washed twice in serum free media and centrifuged at 400×
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in serum free media. Cells were counted using a haemocytometer and the viability checked using trypan blue exclusion (Invitrogen). The optimal cell number for spin column extraction from cells was between 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>. Cells were then pelleted and homogenised.

0: We developed a reciprocal best hit BLAT (RBHB) pipeline to identify putative homologs and estimate gene copy number across species.
1: The Reciprocal Best Hit (RBH) search strategy is conceptually straightforward: (1) Given a gene of interest  G  A in a query genome  A, one searches a target genome  B for all possible matches to  GA; (2) For each of these hits, one then performs the reciprocal search in the original query genome to identify the highest-scoring hit; (3) A hit in genome  B is defined as a homolog of gene  G  A if and only if the original gene  GA is the top reciprocal search hit in genome  A.
2: We selected BLAT ( Kent, 2002) as our algorithm of choice, as this algorithm is sensitive to highly similar (>90% identity) sequences, thus identifying the highest-confidence homologs while minimizing many-to-one mapping problems when searching for multiple genes.
3: RBH performs similar to other more complex methods of orthology prediction and is particularly good at identifying incomplete genes that may be fragmented in low quality/poorly assembled regions of the genome ( Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009;  Salichos and Rokas, 2011).

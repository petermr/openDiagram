<p>GT1-7 cells were grown as previously described in proteomic experiments. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with CelLytic Mammalian Lysis/Extraction Reagent, supplemented with SIGMAFAST
 <sup>™</sup> Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Sigma–Aldrich, MO). Extracts were maintained with constant agitation for 30 min at 4°C and then centrifuged for 20 min at 17, 000 g. Supernatants were collected and used to determine total protein concentration using the Bradford Quick-Start Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). All procedures were performed at 4°C and samples were stored at -80°C for further protein extraction and western blotting.

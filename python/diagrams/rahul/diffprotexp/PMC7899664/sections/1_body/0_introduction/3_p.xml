<p>One of the most well-known inhibitors of HA synthesis is 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU). A coumarin derivative, 4-MU has been shown to experimentally reduce HA levels both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Kakizaki et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kultti et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Nagy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Though many of its functions are still yet unidentified, three primary mechanisms of action are well described: first, it acts as a competitive substrate of UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), a necessary enzyme in the creation of the dimer unit (GlcUA-GlcNAc) that comprises the HA molecule. Second, 4-MU has been reported to reduce concentrations of UDP-GlcUA 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> via binding directly to glucuronic acid (Kultti et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Finally, 4-MU is also capable of reducing mRNA expression levels of HAS2 (Kultti et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Many groups have developed strategies for intravenous administration of 4-MU or oral administration with 4-MU added into the mouse chow (Kuipers et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), which have proven very useful for understanding the role of HA in several disease processes, but the systemic side effects of such treatments are either unknown, strongly confounding, or undesired.

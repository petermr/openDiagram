<p>The digenetic trematode,

 <italic>viverrini</italic> has a complex life cycle with freshwater 
 <italic>Bithynia</italic> spp. snails acting as intermediate hosts. Snail immune responses towards trematode infection are known to rely on both plasma and cellular host factors, which are likely to dictate the success or failure of parasite infection [

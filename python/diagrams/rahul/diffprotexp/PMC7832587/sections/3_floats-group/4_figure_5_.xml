  <p>Fluorescence-detection Size Exclusion Chromatography of detergent solubilized PcATP2 and PcCdc50B. Membranes containing 5 mg/ml of total protein concentration were solubilized with 1% (w/v) DDM, 0.2% (w/v) CHS, and the supernatant after ultracentrifugation was loaded into a Superose 6 10/300 GL gel-filtration column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) Glycerol, 0.1 mg/mL DDM, 0.02 mg/mL CHS, and connected to a fluorescence detector. Normalized FSEC profiles of single-expression of PcATP2-GFP-BAD (dotted lines) and co-expression of PcATP2-GFP-BAD with PcCdc50B-His (solid line). A profile of membranes expressing no protein is shown (in grey shadow). Normalized FSEC profile of single-expression PcCdc50B-GFP-His (dashed line). The presence of free eGFP is indicated. On top of the figure, analysis of PcCdc50B-His co-elution with PcATP2-GFP-BAD (solid line chromatogram). Collected fractions of 200 µl between 10.4–12 ml of the PcATP2-GFP-BAD elution were analyzed by western blot using the HisProbe
   <sup>TM</sup> to detect the presence of PcCdc50B-His.

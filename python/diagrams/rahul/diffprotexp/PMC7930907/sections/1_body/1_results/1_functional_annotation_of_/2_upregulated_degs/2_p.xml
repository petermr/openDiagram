<p>In particular, the top scored network analyses of common upregulated DEGs were found to be involved in positive regulation of blood pressure by epinephrine-norepinephrine (16.0%), regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by norepinephrine-epinephrine (16.0%), positive regulation of heart rate by epinephrine-norepinephrine (14.0%), adenylate cyclase-activating adrenergic receptor signaling pathway (16.0%), and adrenergic receptor signaling pathway (16.0%) (

The unique upregulated DEGs in EASCs showed the top scored network is a cellular response to oxygen-containing compound (52.0%), G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, coupled to cyclic nucleotide second messenger (28.0%), adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (26.0%), response to organic cyclic compound (48.0%), and cellular response to organic cyclic compound (38.0%) (

<p id="Par33">One of the particularly interesting finding in our study is that 
 <italic>WNT4</italic> is predominantly and abundantly expressed in G1p cells. We found that the FPKM values of 
 <italic>Wnt4</italic> (G5p:1600.32, G5d:1624.18) showed no significant difference between Gp and Gd cells in F5 follicles. In sharp contrast, in F1 follicles, 
 <italic>WNT4</italic> is expressed in Gp cells nearly exclusively (G1p:236.95, G1d:8.72). As a secreted glycoprotein, 
 <italic>WNT4</italic> may regulate its own expression through an autocrine route and control cell proliferation

 </sup>. It may also regulate the proliferation of neighboring cells in a paracrine manner

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. Since paracrine signaling is limited by physical distance between cells in such narrow space as the follicle, the action of WNT4 is likely restricted to neighboring Gp cells only. In Gd cells, 
 <italic>WNT4</italic> expression level is much lower, hinting its limited role in these cells. Like 
 <italic>WNT4</italic>, 
 <italic>IHH</italic> (Indian Hedgehog Signaling Molecule) also showed a higher expression level in Gp cells (G1p:108.95, G1d:25.21). As a secreted signaling molecule, IHH was reported to regulate a variety of developmental processes including growth, patterning and morphogenesis

 </sup>. It is likely that the proliferative effect of IHH also depends on the close contact between G1p cells, similar to that of 
 <italic>WNT4</italic>.

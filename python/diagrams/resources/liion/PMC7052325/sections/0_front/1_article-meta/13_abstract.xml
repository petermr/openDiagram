 <p>Although the successful deployment of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in various fields such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles and electric grid, the efforts are still ongoing to pursue the next-generation battery systems with higher energy densities. Interest has been increasing in the batteries relying on the multivalent-ions such as Mg
  <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
  <sup>2+</sup>, and Al
  <sup>3+</sup>, because of the higher volumetric energy densities than those of monovalent-ion batteries including LIBs and Na-ion batteries. Among them, magnesium batteries have attracted much attention due to the promising characteristics of Mg anode: a low redox potential (−2.356 V vs. SHE), a high volumetric energy density (3,833 mAh cm
  <sup>−3</sup>), atmospheric stability and the earth-abundance. However, the development of Mg batteries has progressed little since the first Mg-ion rechargeable battery was reported in 2000. A severe technological bottleneck concerns the organic electrolytes, which have limited compatibility with Mg anode and form an Mg-ion insulating passivation layer on the anode surface. Consequently, beneficial to the good chemical and mechanical stability, Mg-ion solid electrolyte should be a promising alternative to the liquid electrolyte. Herein, a mini review is presented to focus on the recent development of Mg-ion solid conductor. The performances and the limitations were also discussed in the review. We hope that the mini review could provide a quick grasp of the challenges in the area and inspire researchers to develop applicable solid electrolyte candidates for Mg batteries.

<p>The SCW was used to estimate the relative protein abundances in the samples. The difference of each protein’s SCW between the model and control rats was analyzed for statistical significance by Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.01 was set as a cut-off. To increase the credibility of protein identification and quantification, three strict criteria were used to select differentially expressed proteins (see details in the Experimental Procedures). A total of 59 proteins showed an increased relative abundance, and 27 proteins presented a decreased relative abundance in the model perfusates (Additional file

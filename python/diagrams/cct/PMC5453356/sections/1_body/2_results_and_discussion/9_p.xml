<p>However, since during continuous cooling, the nucleation conditions also change continuously, it is to be expected that some differences are present compared with isothermal precipitation. For a slow cooling, first β-Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Si forms, and later on, also β’ and B’ precipitate. At that time, the amount of solutes available for the precipitation of β’ and B’ is already reduced, which is not the case for isothermal soaking at relevant temperatures. This might explain why, for isothermal soaking, three different temperature ranges for precipitation were found, contrary to the continuous cooling precipitation diagram with two precipitation areas. This finding supports similarities between crystallization and precipitation experiments, as mentioned in the introduction. Both crystallization and precipitation below a temperature range, which is critical for the related processes, are only accessible after quenching faster than the related critical cooling rate [

 </sup>. Briefly, chlorophyll content was measured three times along the middle part of the flag leaf with a SPAD meter, stomatal conductance was measured on the adaxial surface along the middle part of the flag leaf with a SC-1 porometer. All replications were arranged in a complete randomised block design. Eight biological replicates per group were used for chlorophyll content measurement. Four biological replicates were randomly selected from these eight for measuring stomatal conductance. At harvest, yield components including grain weight per plant, grain number per plant, biomass, harvest index, 1000-grain weight, plant height, tiller number and main spike length were determined. Ten biological replicates were used for harvest analysis. After harvest analysis, out of these ten biological replicates, four biological replicates per group were randomly chosen for destructive grain quality analysis. Wholemeal flour samples of the mature grains were prepared using an IKA A11 analytical mill

 </sup> for the measurement of grain quality traits. A rapid N Elementar was used to determine grain protein content (GPC) based on the Dumas method (nitrogen content multiplied by a factor of 5.7 at 11% moisture basis). Total starch content (TSC) of the grains was determined using the Total Starch Assay Kit as previously described

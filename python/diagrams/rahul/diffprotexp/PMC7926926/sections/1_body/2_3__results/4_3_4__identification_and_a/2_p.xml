<p>Among the 62 proteins with known functions, 43 proteins were up-regulated, while the remaining 19 proteins showed down-regulation in LB-04 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-11-00177">Table S4</xref>). We further explored the known DEPs for their associated functions and GO terms and identified 17 proteins potentially associated with response to stress-induced conditions. These differential proteins were identified as chlorophyll a-b binding protein (

 <italic>TRINITY_DN51146_c0_g2</italic>), putative spermidine synthase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN44650_c0_g1</italic>), NADH dehydrogenase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN48436_c0_g5</italic>), glutathione-S-transferase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN47449_c0_g1</italic>), LRR receptor-like protein kinase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN41128_c0_g2</italic>), aspartic proteinase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN40732_c0_g1</italic>), soluble starch synthase 1 (

 <italic>TRINITY_DN42434_c0_g1</italic> and 
 <italic>TRINITY_DN42941_c2_g2</italic>), purple acid phosphatase 1 (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN52089_c0_g2</italic>), NHL repeat (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN47063_c0_g1</italic>), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN50857_c0_g6</italic>), SCF ubiquitin ligase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN43846_c0_g1</italic>), ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 2B (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN44530_c4_g9</italic>), HYL1 (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN38298_c0_g1</italic>), and AMP-dependent synthetase (
 <italic>TRINITY_DN43346_c0_g2</italic>). Identification of diverse proteins as DEPs suggests that SL-inoculation facilitates the regulation of an array of biological and molecular functions to enable masson pine to tolerate the induced Al stress.

0: To analyze the expression of the proteins induced in the small-scale cultures, a total membrane preparation was done.
1: A volume of each culture corresponding to 10 optical density units at 600 nm was centrifuged at 800  g for 10 min and 4C.
2: Cells were re-suspended in 1 mL of ice-cold TEPI buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaN 3) supplemented with SigmaFast TM EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC) tablets (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Sigma-Aldrich) and transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.
3: After centrifugation at 1000  g for 10 min and 4C, the pellet was re-suspended in 100 L of ice-cold TEPI buffer, and cells were broken after adding 100 L of glass beads (0.5 mm of diameter) and vortexing for 25 min at 4C.
4: Then, TEPI buffer was added to a final volume of 1 mL and samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 500  g and 4C.
5: The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 000   g for 90 min and 4C.
6: The resulting membrane pellet was re-suspended directly in 200 L of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing urea, heated at 30C during 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.

<p>The increasing popularity of XAS in the field of catalysis is attributed to the widespread availability of powerful X-ray sources, the improvements made in the instrumentation and sample environments as well as the new data analysis tools at our disposal. Moreover, even scientists with moderate XAS training can relatively quickly identify the main features of an XAS spectrum, such as the position of the absorption edge or the main peaks in the FT-EXAFS data, both of which can immediately provide essential clues about the catalyst oxidation state and overall structure. Quite often such qualitative information is sufficient to gain key insight into the structure and oxidation state of material and its evolution under reaction conditions. At the same time, the availability of 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> codes and user-friendly data analysis packages allows one to easily model and fit at least the EXAFS part of the absorption spectrum. Nevertheless, one needs to be well aware of possible artifacts in the analysis due, for example, to the correlation of different fitting parameters, or to an overcomplicated fitting scheme with an excessively large number of fitting variables. Having an excellent fit to the experimental data does not necessarily mean that the chosen model is scientifically meaningful or in any way representative of the material under investigation.

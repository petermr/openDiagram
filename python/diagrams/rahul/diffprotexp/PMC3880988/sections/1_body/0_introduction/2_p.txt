0: Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are regarded as a promising and potential alternative cell source in the repair of cartilage due to its multi-lineage differentiation ability  in vitro.
1: Although MSCs possess strong intrinsic chondrogenic capacity, implantation of undifferentiated MSCs in constructs using various sources has also resulted in the formation of fibrous tissues, increased expression of type-I collagen and the loss of sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content  4.
2: Furthermore, bone marrow MSCs showed an increased propensity to express type-X collagen which correlates with mineralization of the tissue at the implanted site  4.
3: It has therefore been postulated that the use of pre-differentiated chondrogenic MSCs  in vitro would have the ability to express specific cartilage related proteins, which can lead to early if not better cartilage healing.
4: However, in our previous pre-clinical study, we were not able to demonstrate the superiority of cMSCs over MSCs  5.

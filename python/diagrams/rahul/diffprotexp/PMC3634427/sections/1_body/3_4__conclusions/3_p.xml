<p>Sorbitol induces similar changes when compared to sucrose, and this is for both species. This suggests that both sugars could be comparable as stressors. However, we identified more stress-related proteins in Désirée under sorbitol treatment than in Désirée under sucrose treatment, specifically proteinase inhibitors. This suggests that both sugars induce some different pathways in Désirée, but no evidence was found.</p>

<p>Adult vs. protoscolex: a total of 391 differentially expressed proteins were observed between adults and the protoscolex, with 127 up-regulated and 264 down-regulated. Metabolic pathways showed that they are involved in metabolic, several diseases, and focal adhesion pathways (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Partial significant differential expression proteins are listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Following GO analysis, partial representative GO terms of differentially expressed proteins were assigned as “oxidoreductase activity (including acting on the CH-OH group of donors, NAD or NADP as acceptor”, and “ion binding” (

The oven temperature was kept at 50 &#176;C for 1 min, then gradually raised to 230 &#176;C at 10 &#176;C/min and subsequently, held isothermal for 5 min. Nitrogen was the carrier gas at a constant linear velocity of 38.5 cm/ sec and a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The sample was diluted in hexane and 1 &#181;L was injected manually into the system. Quantitative data acquisition of the individual components was electronically obtained from FID area percent data.

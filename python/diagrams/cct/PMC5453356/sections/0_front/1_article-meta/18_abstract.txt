0: Time-temperature-precipitation (TTP) diagrams deliver important material data, such as temperature and time ranges critical for precipitation during the quenching step of the age hardening procedure.
1: Although the quenching step is continuous, isothermal TTP diagrams are often applied.
2: Together with a so-called Quench Factor Analysis, they can be used to describe very different cooling paths.
3: Typically, these diagrams are constructed based on mechanical properties or microstructures after an interrupted quenching,   i.e.,   ex situ analyses.
4: In recent years, an   in situ calorimetric method to record continuous cooling precipitation diagrams of aluminum alloys has been developed to the application level by our group.
5: This method has now been transferred to isothermal experiments, in which the whole heat treatment cycle was performed in a differential scanning calorimeter.
6: The Al-Mg-Si-wrought alloy 6005A was investigated.
7: Solution annealing at 540 C and overcritical quenching to several temperatures between 450 C and 250 C were followed by isothermal soaking.
8: Based on the heat flow curves during isothermal soaking, TTP diagrams were determined.
9: An appropriate evaluation method has been developed.
10: It was found that three different precipitation reactions in characteristic temperature intervals exist.
11: Some of the low temperature reactions are not accessible in continuous cooling experiments and require isothermal studies.

  <p>(a) Contraction of the Au–Au bond lengths in size-selected micellar Au NPs encapsulated by PS-P2VP ligands and supported on γ-Al
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub> compared to similar model Au NPs with and without the surface ligands as a function of the 1st shell CN. Structure models of NPs with and without ligands are shown in the insets. Reproduced with permission from ref (

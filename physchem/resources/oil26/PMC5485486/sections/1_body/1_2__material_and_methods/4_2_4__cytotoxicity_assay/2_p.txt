0: All experiments were performed with twice PBS washed cells at a density of about 1.5  10 4 cells per well (1.5  10 5 cells/ml), in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100  l complete medium per well.
1: Then 100  l of complete culture medium containing different concentrations of the tested essential oils (dissolved in DMSO) was added to each well.
2: After 48 h exposure of cells to these concentrations of tested essential oils at 37C and 5% CO 2, 100  l of medium was carefully aspirated from each well and replaced with 20  l of MTT solution (5 mg/ml of PBS).
3: After incubation in the same conditions for 4 hours, the plates were treated with 80  l of an HCl/isopropanol (24 : 1) solution to dissolve the blue intracellular formazan produced by living cells.
4: One hour later, the absorbance (optical density OD) of the plates was determined by a Multiskan EX spectrophotometer reader at two wavelengths (540 and 630 nm).
5: DMSO (0.5%) was used as the negative control and methotrexate (MTX) as the positive one.

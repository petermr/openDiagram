<p>Currently, many in situ characterization methods are used to understand the electrode reaction and decay mechanism of lithium-ion batteries.

 </sup> However, these characterization methods often need to be combined with specially designed cell models and electrode materials with special morphology, which is not convenient in many cases. Therefore, direct measurement of the thermodynamic data of the electrode reaction is a practical and economic means of electrode characterization, which is often ignored by material researchers.

 </sup> The measurement of electrode reaction and thermodynamic parameters is carried out in the half-cell or the full-cell. The whole measurement process has a little disturbance to the battery, so it can be considered to be a nondestructive in situ battery detection method. In other words, commercial lithium-ion batteries can be detected in situ without damage. In addition, thermodynamic characterization can be used not only to characterize the thermal properties of various electrode materials but also to characterize the structural changes and electrode reactions in the process of charging and discharging.

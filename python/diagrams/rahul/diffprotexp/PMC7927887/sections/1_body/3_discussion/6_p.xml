<p>We showed that alternative splicing might be a significant mechanism that has pathogenic relevance to MM. Hotspot mutations in the driver gene, 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>, result in a significant impact on the MM transcriptome. Although 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations represent a small percentage of driver mutations, it does present a promising target for splice modulating drugs. In addition to the hotspot 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations, we also show a general increase in novel splicing in MM, and at its extreme, this is strongly associated with decreased PFS and OS. There are a number of spliceosome modulators under investigation including spliceostatins A-G, E7107 and H3B-8800, that target 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>.

 </sup> Recent work has shown that these compounds are more effective in cells that have higher expression of 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> and are, therefore, more dependent on 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>.

 </sup> Our observation of increased 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic> expression in the high splice group, which constitutes up to 20% of patients, may increase the number of patients that may benefit from spliceosome modulators, rather than just the patients who have mutated 
 <italic>SF3B1</italic>.

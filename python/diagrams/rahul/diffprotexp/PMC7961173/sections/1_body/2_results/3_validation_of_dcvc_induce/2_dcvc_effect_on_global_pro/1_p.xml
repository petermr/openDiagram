<p id="Par42">We measured global protein synthesis attenuation, a principal functional feature of ISR signaling through phosphorylation of eIF2α. Although protein synthesis was not significantly altered after a 6-h exposure to DCVC, treatment with 20 µM DCVC for 12 h significantly attenuated protein synthesis 37% compared with controls (Fig.

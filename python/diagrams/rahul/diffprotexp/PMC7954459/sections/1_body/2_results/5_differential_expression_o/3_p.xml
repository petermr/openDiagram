<p>Additionally, we compared the differential expression of target genes vis‐à‐vis their corresponding miRNAs between the cultivars (JGK 3/Himchana 1) at each stage of seed development analyzed. An antagonistic correlation was observed for a larger fraction of miRNAs (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), i.e., targets of up‐regulated (higher expression) miRNAs in JGK 3 showed lower expression in JGK 3 as compared to Himchana 1 and vice versa (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). GO analysis of target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs between the two cultivars revealed a significant enrichment of specific terms, including cell division, cell differentiation, embryonic/post‐embryonic development along with seed development processes (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Interestingly, the target genes of down‐regulated miRNAs in JGK 3 as compared to Himchana 1, showed a significant enrichment of functional terms, including cell cycle and cell/nuclear division at S3 and/or S5 stage(s) (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). GO terms related to seed development, including post‐embryonic development, cell differentiation were enriched at many of the seed stages (Figure 
 <xref rid="pld3299-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). This suggested miRNA‐mediated differential regulation of these biological processes during seed development in the chickpea cultivars, which might be involved in the determination of seed size/weight too.

<p>Finally, let us note here that the emphasis on increasingly higher photon flux achievable at the next generation synchrotron radiation facilities will have less of an impact on conventional XAS, which is not considered a particularly “photon-hungry” technique. However, such improvements can be very helpful for advanced X-ray spectroscopies such as HERFD-XAS, RIXS, and XRS. As demonstrated in several examples in this Review, these techniques can provide unique information about the catalyst electronic structure and can be envisioned to become indispensable for understanding important aspects in catalysis such as catalyst–adsorbate interactions. Nevertheless, despite numerous success stories, the HERFD-XAS and RIXS methods remain currently underrepresented in catalyst research, and their full potential is not yet assessed. Again, the data analysis seems to be part of the problem since the interpretation of RIXS features, and even reliable quantitative analysis of features in conventional XANES spectra, is still a challenging task. As demonstrated during the last years, this problem can be successfully addressed via a combination of 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> simulations (which nowadays provide increasingly accurate description of the near-edge part of the absorption spectra) with machine-learning techniques. The latter allow one to establish the relationship between spectral features and descriptors of atomistic and electronic structure even in the absence of explicit analytical models.

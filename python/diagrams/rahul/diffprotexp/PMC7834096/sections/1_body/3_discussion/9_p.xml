<p>Our comparative analysis of AAF/I, III, IV, and V-expressing EAEC strains confirmed that the adherence and aggregation phenotype mediated by AAF/V is more similar to that of AAF/III than that of AAF/I. We show for the first time that these AAF subtypes mediate bacteria–bacteria interactions, which exclusively affect bacterial cells expressing AAF. This raises questions about the exact role of AAF in aggregative adherence to epithelial cells, in particular its primary involvement in bacterial autoaggregation and interaction with host factors. Moreover, our work indicates that the strong aggregative adherence phenotype conferred by AAF/I compared to other AAF subtypes is very likely less dependent on differences in expression and/or regulation of AAF, but rather on the structural fimbrial proteins themselves [

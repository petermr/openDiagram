<p>The LMH cells transfected with plasmids or infected with FAdV were collected and lysed in lysis buffer with PMSF, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were boiled in the loading buffer, and was then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (GE Healthcare Life sciences, Freiburg, Germany). After blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST for 2 h at room temperature (RT), the membranes were reacted with the corresponding antibodies at 4°C overnight. After being washed with PBST for three times, the membrane was incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. After another three washes, the membranes were developed with chemiluminescent reagents and imaged with an automatic imaging system (Tanon 5200).</p>

<p> As cited by Reviewer-2, the authors should include additional data to support their claim on the genome-wide transcriptome analysis. It is important to relate the disease pathology (lung lesions) or no pathology (no lesions) to corresponding transcriptome profile. This is needed to understand the relevance of the networks/pathways/genes that were reported to be differentially regulated in this article. In addition, as noted by Reviewer-1, the authors should re-organize the write-up to eliminate repetition of their results in the discussion section, and instead, highlighting what are the unique characteristics of their study, compared to published literature. </p>

   <bold>Author Contributions</bold> H.F.Z. conceived the project. L.Z. and H.F.Z. carried out the experiments. L.Z. and H.F.Z. proposed the two-phase quasi-equilibrium, and S.P. and J.E. provided insightful suggestions to improve it. T.M.Q. and H.F.Z. generated the idea to design BMGCs by using the lever rule on quasi-equilibrium compositions. L.Z. and S.P. drew the schematic illustrations and wrote the manuscript. All authors contributed to data analysis and discussion.

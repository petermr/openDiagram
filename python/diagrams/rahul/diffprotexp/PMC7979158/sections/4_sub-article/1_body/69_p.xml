<p>“RNA-seq datasets were generated from male and female embryos from 28 independent litters across control and MIA groups, typically with 1-3 embryos represented per independent litter (Supplementary file 20, Supplementary file 5). […] For transcriptomic analysis, we used a strategy of first defining DE genes at each time-point using the general linear model (GLM) approach implemented in edgeR, followed by mapping DE signatures to systems-level expression patterns via module assignment using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).”</p>

0: For identifying the common miRNAs, DGE related to grain ripening in SR 159 vs. SR 157, each sample of SR-159 (i.e.
1: 0 DFADays From Anthesis, apical) was compared with its respective SR-157 (i.e.
2: 0 DFA apical).
3: Likewise, the ratio of fold change (FC) of each miRNA in SR-157 was calculated over that in SR-159 in respective growth stages (Supplementary Table  S3).
4: The miRNAs which were reported earlier to be involved in grain filling in rice in other studies 20,  22,  28,  29 were kept apart, indicated by grey fonts.
5: From the newly identified (49 miRNAs), the miRNAs whose fold change (FC) values changed from +ve to ve or vice versa were of primary interest in this study (Supplementary Table  S3, in bold black fonts).

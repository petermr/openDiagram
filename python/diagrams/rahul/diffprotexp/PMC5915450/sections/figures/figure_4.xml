  <p>Pulling force versus time from the SMD simulations in which the non-bonded parameters are turned on gradually as nascent chain residues enter the exit tunnel for ErmCL (
   <bold>A</bold>) and H-NS (
   <bold>B</bold>) with ERY bound in the exit tunnel. Black lines represent the average force across trajectories, while gray lines are the force traces for each individual trajectory.

<p>Nanoemulsions are colloidal systems consisting of two immiscible phases. They are translucent having droplet size around 200
 <bold> </bold>nm. These systems are kinetically stabilized by the aid of surfactants or a mixture of surfactants and co-surfactants (Gurpreet and Singh, 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Nanoemulsions have the advantages of controlling the drug release and the possibility of delivering a wide variety of therapeutic agents (Hoeller et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Additionally, they are superior over macroemulsion in having larger surface area and free energy. They also avoid coalescence, flocculation, creaming and sedimentation. Nanoemulsions can be prepared adopting lower concentration of emulsifying agents and thus reducing surfactant-related toxicity (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, these systems have the ability to solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs and thus improve their permeation through mucosa and provide an advantageous formulation for delivering such drugs (Gaba et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).

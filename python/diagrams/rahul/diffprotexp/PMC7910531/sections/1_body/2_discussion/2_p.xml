<p id="Par18">The co-localisation of GWAS signals and molecular QTLs in disease tissue helps pinpoint the identity of causal genes for hithert unsolved association signals. A previous study

 </sup>, which does not include cartilage. Several osteoarthritis GWAS signals were found to co-localise with eQTLs in only 1 or 2 of 53 tissues (e.g. 
 <italic>ALDH1A2</italic>: ovary and tibial artery, 
 <italic>SMAD3</italic>: skeletal muscle; 
 <italic>SLC44A2</italic>: adrenal gland), without clear transferability of results to disease-relevant tissue. Here, we provide robust evidence that these three GWAS signals co-localise with molecular QTLs in primary cartilage. This availability of molQTL data from chondrocytes and synoviocytes offers a resource that will enable the resolution of further genetic association signals emerging from ongoing large-scale efforts in osteoarthritis (e.g.

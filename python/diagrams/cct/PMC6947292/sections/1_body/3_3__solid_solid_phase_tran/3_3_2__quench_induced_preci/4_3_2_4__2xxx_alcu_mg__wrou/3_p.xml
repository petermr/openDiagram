<p>In Ref. [
 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>], quench-induced precipitation in an AlCuMg alloy 2618 was investigated. Cooling DSC was conducted over a cooling rate range of about 0.02 to 1 K/s. The DSC results for 2618 obtained in Ref. [
 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>] are highly similar to those for 2024 in this work, and comparable precipitation enthalpies have been determined. However, since very slow cooling was not possible in the DSC device used in [
 <xref rid="B206-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>], the authors could not identify the HTR seen in 2024 (

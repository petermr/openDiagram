 <caption> TUBA1C expression levels in LUAD performed by immunohistochemistry. a–f TUBA1C protein was detected in normal lung tissues and LUAD tissues by TMA-IHC. × 40 magnification (bar = 500 μm), × 200 magnification (bar = 100 μm). TUBA1C protein was dyed brown particles in cell cytoplasm. g TUBA1C overexpression was negatively associated with the overall survival rate of patients by Kaplan‑Meier analysis (P = 0.035). h TUBA1C expression is an independent prognostic factor in LUAD by Multivariate Cox </caption>

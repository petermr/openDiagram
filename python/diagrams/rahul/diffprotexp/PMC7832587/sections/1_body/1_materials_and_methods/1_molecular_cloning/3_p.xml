 <italic>Co-expression vectors</italic>: pYedBAD-BAD-Drs2p/Cdc50p-His was cloned previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To construct the other co-expression vectors we used a previous strategy. The fragments containing the cassette Promoter-Cdc50-TEV-His10-Terminator from each pYeDP60-Cdc50-TEV-10xHis vector were amplified by PCR, incorporating the 
 <italic>SbfI</italic> restriction site at both the 5′ and the 3′ ends. The PCR fragments were then cloned at the 
 <italic>SbfI</italic> site of the corresponding species-specific single-expression vectors pYeDP60-ATP2-TEV-BAD and pYeDP60-BAD-TEV-ATP2.

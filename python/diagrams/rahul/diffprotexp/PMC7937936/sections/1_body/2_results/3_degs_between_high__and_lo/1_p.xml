<p>The 502 tumor samples were labeled as a high-score or low-score based on the median value of ImmuneScore or StromalScore, respectively. Regarding ImmuneScore, 776 genes were up-regulated, and 161 genes were down-regulated in the high-score group compared to the low-score group. For the stromal component scores, 985 genes were up-regulated, and 63 genes were down-regulated in the high-score group compared to the low-score group. There were 275 genes whose expression was simultaneously and significantly correlated with either the immune component or the stromal component (

0: For the EAE study, sample fractions containing differentially expressed proteins of interest were subjected to 1D electrophoresis on 16% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels.
1: Briefly, each sample was concentrated in a Thermo Speed Vac vacuum concentrator, then dissolved in sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8, (Invitrogen)), followed by heating for 10 minutes at 75C.
2: 20 uL of sample mixture were loaded onto the appropriate lane in the gel and electrophoresed at 200Vfor 45 minutes.
3: SeeBlue Plus2 (Invitrogen) pre-stained molecular weight standards were employed for calibration.
4: The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue R 250 (0.25% Commassie blue, 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid) and were destained with destaining solution I (40% methanol, 7% acetic acid) for one hour, and with destaining solution II (7% acetic acid, 5% methanol) overnight.

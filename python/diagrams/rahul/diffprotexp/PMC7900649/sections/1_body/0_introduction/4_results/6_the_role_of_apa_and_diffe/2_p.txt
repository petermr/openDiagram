0: Furthermore, we mapped the gene network connections of tandem APA switching genes and DEGs to explore the potential links between them.
1: We chose cell cycle [ 21,  22], endoplasmic reticulum protein processing [ 23], cell junction [ 24] and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [ 25], four pathways that were reported in previous research concerning PEDV infection.
2: As shown in Fig.
3: 8, genes clustered in either alternative polyadenylation or differential expression were mapped to four specific functional networks, while the overlapped genes are preferentially mapped as focus genes, such as CDK6, E2F1, DNAJC10, CANX and AKT3.

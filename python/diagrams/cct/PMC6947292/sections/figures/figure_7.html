 <caption> Quality attributes of DSC raw data. A &amp; B show the same raw data, measured by cooling an AlCuMg alloy with 0.3 K/s in a PerkinElrmer Pyris 1 DSC. ( A) Overshoot artefacts and the quality attribute of the heat flow difference between the high- and low-temperature isotherm, are highlighted; ( B) the quality attribute of heat flow difference between sample and baseline measurements in the isothermal section at high-temperatures is highlighted. </caption>

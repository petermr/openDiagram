<p>The Cu–Au system is considered a promising catalyst for CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR. As mentioned above, pure Cu and Au have quite different catalytic properties in CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR, with Cu being able to electrochemically convert CO
 <sub>2</sub> to hydrocarbons at high overpotentials, and Au being able to produce CO at moderate overpotential.

 </sup> Experimental studies suggest that Cu–Au alloys are efficient for CO production. However, even a small addition of Au can lead to the suppression of hydrocarbon formation.

 </sup> An increase of the Cu concentration generally results in the increase of the selectivity toward hydrocarbons, although never exceeding that of pure Cu.

 </sup> A possible explanation for this behavior is the segregation of Au under CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR to the catalyst surface.

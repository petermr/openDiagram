<p>The 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> (MAH 104) strain was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco), supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, ADC, and 0.05% Tween 80 (MP Biomedical, LLC (Solon, OH, USA). When 
 <italic>M. avium</italic> grows to OD
 <sub>600</sub> = 0.5, this is considered as the exponential phase and when it grows to OD
 <sub>600</sub> = 2.8, this is considered to be the stationary phase. Each measurement was detected from three biological and three technical replicates.

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows the significantly (p-val &lt; 0.05) synergistically, antagonistically and independently expressed genes out of the 2,793 pairs formed by the 57 potassium channel genes with the 49 sodium, calcium and chloride channel genes, in the four chambers of the male mouse heart. While there are less than 1% significant antagonistic and independent pairs, the percentages of the synergistically expressed pairs are very high in all chambers, although with remarkable differences among them: 28% in the LA, 22% in the RA, 53% in the LV and 43% in the RV.

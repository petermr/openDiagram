0: Sheep is one of the main livestock in China, which serves as an important source of meat and fur-related products 1.
1: Improved living standards have partly created a huge increase in the demand for high-quality sheep products.
2: However, current production seldom meets domestic demand across the country 2.
3: One of the key goals of sheep breeding is high reproductive performance since it plays a major role in production efficiency.
4: Conversely, low fertility is one of the major limiting factors for the growth of the sheep industry.
5: Traditional selection has been used to increase litter size due to low reproductive heritability and sex-limiting nature of local breeds.
6: Nevertheless, candidate genes linked to ovulation and multiplets can lead to genetic improvement through gene and marker-assisted selection (MAS) in sheep 3.
7: Thus, improving sheep breeding capability and increasing output of mutton and wool products can successfully fill the ever-growing gap in supply and demand while guaranteeing quality of mutton.
8: There are several sheep species globally but only a few of them have high fecundity, while the vast majority produce only single lamb with few multi-born occurrences 4.
9: Hu is one of China's most important sheep breeds reputed for its early maturity, four seasons of estrus and multiple lambs per birth 5.
10: In animal reproduction and breeding, the ovaries are the reproductive organs of female mammals.
11: Therefore, it is important to understand their gene expression and regulation.
12: This will provide a basis for further ovarian research at the molecular level to uncover their regulatory mechanisms.

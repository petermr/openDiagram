<p id="Par28">A previous study demonstrated that N
 <sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine modification was involved in autophagy. It was predicted that the mRNA of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) might directly interact with circRAB11FIP1. The RNA pulldown assay demonstrated that circRAB11FIP1 directly bound to the mRNA of FTO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4A</xref>). A significant enrichment of circRAB11FIP1 was observed using FTO-specific probes compared with the controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4B</xref>). It was predicted that circRAB11FIP1 bound to the mRNA of FTO by 14 bp (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4C</xref>). An in vivo RNA pulldown experiment with biotin-labeled FTO mRNA-specific probes was also carried out within SKOV3 cells subjected to circRAB11FIP1 transfection, either mutant or wild type (WT) with the deletion of 14 bases complementary to FTO-coding sequence (14-bp MUT). A specific enrichment of FTO mRNA was observed in both circRAB11FIP1 WT and 14-bp MUT overexpression in SKOV3 cells compared with the controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4D</xref>). However, circRAB11FIP1 enrichment in the mutant group was less in the WT group. The data indicated that the 14 bases were crucial for circRAB11FIP1 to combine with FTO mRNA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4E</xref>). The FTO level also declined in LV2-1- or LV2-2-transfected SKOV3 and A2780 cells, but elevated in the LV6-transfected SKOV3 and A2780 cells (Fig.

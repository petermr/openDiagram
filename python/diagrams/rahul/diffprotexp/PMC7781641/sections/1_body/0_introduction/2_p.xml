<p>One type of chronic pain that is particularly traumatic for patients is trigeminal neuropathic pain which is caused by inflammation and demyelination of the trigeminal nerve pathways. We have developed a highly robust, long-lasting, and easily induced animal model of trigeminal neuropathic pain that accurately depicts the kind of pain suffered by patients. We call this model FRICT-ION (Foramen Rotundum Inflammatory Constriction Trigeminal InfraOrbital Nerve) [

This common procedure provides ready proof-of-concept, dose-ranging, and efficacy testing for pain therapeutics that are later effectively guided through FDA approvals [

<p>Leaching with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> is the most studied hydrometallurgical process and is covered by many patents. A summary of the leaching conditions reported in the literature is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-00801">Table S1</xref>. The general conclusions from the literature could be summarized as follows: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label>▪</label>
   <p>The presence of a reducing agent is important for accelerating leaching kinetics;</p>

   <p>Of all reducing agents, H
    <sub>2</sub>O
    <sub>2</sub> appears to be the most efficient, followed by glucose and sulfites;

   <p>Metallic Cu (anode current collector) exhibited lower leaching efficiency followed by Li, Co, Ni, and Mn; </p>

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the very good agreement between the classical HMLP and the DFT phase diagrams. By eliminating finite size effects, the HMLP can capture the full long-range correlations, however, this does not appear to have a significant effect on the phase boundaries.

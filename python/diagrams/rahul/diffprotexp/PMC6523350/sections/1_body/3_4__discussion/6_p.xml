<p>One up-regulated synthetases protein was found out of five, while the rest were down-regulated proteins. Anti-stress and glucose metabolism processes were controlled by them. The annotation analysis revealed a down-regulated protein, sucrose synthase (SUS), with the highest proteinic expression. Sucrose synthase is the key enzyme for plant sucrose metabolism [

 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-09-00130" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] that played key roles in maintaining cell shape, movement, and signaling. Hence, signaling pathways and cell movement features of Se-enriched rice were better than non-Se-enriched rice. This study provided the basic data for secondary metabolic differences among different rice genotypes and uncovered important information at the proteinic level for further studies on Se-enriched food.

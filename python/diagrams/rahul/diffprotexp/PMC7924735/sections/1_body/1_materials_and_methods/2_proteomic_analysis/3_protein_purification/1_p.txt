0: The collected supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min.
1: Then, the supernatants were dialyzed against distilled water through a Spectra 3 membrane with a 3.5-kDa pore size (Spectra/Por, Rancho Dominguez, CA) at 4C for five days.
2: Once dialyzed, 300 ml of dialyzed supernatants were freeze-dried at 45C and 133 10 3 mBar for 48 h in a Freezone 4.5 Dry Freeze system (Labconco, Kansas City, MO).
3: The resulting powder was reconstituted with ultrapure DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a 1:10,000 ratio.
4: Protein concentration was determined with the 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) following the manufacturers protocol ( Fig 1).

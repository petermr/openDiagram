  <p>DCVC effect on principle proteins involved in ISR activation. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with 0 (control) or 20 μM DCVC for 12 h. Western blotting was used to measure eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 protein levels by a blot scanning system as described in the methods section. Graphical representation of: 
   <bold>a</bold> relative eIF2α phosphorylation and 
   <bold>b</bold> relative ATF4 protein concentrations normalized to total protein. Bars represent means ± SEM. Data were analyzed with student t-test. Asterisks indicate significant difference compared to control: *

<p>However, phosphoric acid is also efficient to dissolve spent LFP even at low acid concentrations (0.5–0.6 M) and room temperature, as demonstrated by Bian et al. and Yang et al. [

 <xref rid="B183-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Both authors recovered Fe(III)PO

 <sub>2</sub>O through reflux evaporation after leaching. In Bian et al.’s paper, there is no indication on the nature of the oxidizing agent; however, we can presume ferrous ions are oxidized to ferric with air during both leaching and reflux evaporation. The recovered precipitate was then subjected to the thermal relithiation process to resynthesize carbon-coated LFP. The discharge capacity of the active material thereof synthesized reached 159 mAh/g at 0.1 C and approximately 138 mAh/g at 1 C [
 <xref rid="B183-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Yang et al. developed a mechano-chemical activation in the presence of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) prior to leaching to enhance the efficiency and kinetics. The process flowsheet is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00801-f013">Figure 13</xref>. In comparison with Bian et al.’s process, mechano-chemical activation reduced the leaching time by half and doubled the solid concentration (50 g/L) while maintaining similar extraction efficiencies. After leaching, hydrated FePO

 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> with NaOH. [
 <xref rid="B76-materials-13-00801" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] In both processes, although leaching conditions appear promising for larger scales, the evaporation step represents a major challenge for their commercial application because it consumes significant amounts of energy.

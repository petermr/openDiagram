<p id="Par25">In order to confirm that raw cellulose fibers can be used as a support for the active material in a Li-ion battery, a simple paper electrode entirely composed of cellulose fibers is fabricated. This electrode is tested as a working electrode in a coin cell versus lithium metal. The cycling voltammetry experiment shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> reveals that the cellulose fibers (

In fact, the electrochemical response in the potential window from 2 to 4.2 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> is similar to that obtained in a bare electrode (

 <sup>4</sup> lower than those obtained when an LFP cathode is cycled, as shown in Fig.

<p id="Par18">Mussels brought into captivity exhibited up-regulation of numerous transcripts involved in the major energy metabolism pathways: glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The increased expression of these enzymes, some of which regulate rate-limiting steps, suggests that captive mussels experienced increased energy demand. One of the up-regulated transcripts, AOX, is a terminal oxidase in the electron transport chain that provides an alternative route for electrons typically passing through Complex III and IV

 </sup>. The simultaneous up-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) suggests that both the typical and alternative electron transport routes are engaged to maximize ATP production. Although the AOX route is less efficient, it can reduce the production of reactive oxygen species

 </sup> and, therefore, the up-regulation of this enzyme may be a means to limit oxidative stress during increased metabolic activity.

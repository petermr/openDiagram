  <title>Differential expressed genes cluster analysis of vegetative cells and heterocysts from 
   <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Heat map of the hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression in NDH, NDV and NV. Each row represents a single gene. Each column represents a single sample. Green squares indicate transcript levels below the mean; black squares, transcript levels equal to the mean; red squares, transcript levels greater than the mean; gray squares, technically inadequate or missing data. Colored bars leftmost adjacent to groups in which the cluster of genes is expressed. (B) Trend analysis of different clusters. The gray line in the figure shows the expression pattern of different DEGs in each cluster. The blue line represents the average expression level of all DEGs in the cluster in different samples. ‘NDV’ and ‘NDH’ refers to vegetative cells and heterocysts cultured respectively under nitrogen deprivation condition, and ‘NV’ refers to vegetative cells cultured under nitrogen-replete condition.</p>

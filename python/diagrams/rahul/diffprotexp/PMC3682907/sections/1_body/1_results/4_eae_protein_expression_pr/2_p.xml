<p>Protein expression profiles were further analyzed with hierarchical clustering techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and principal component analysis (PCA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed proteins employed a modified Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient as a distance measure and used the average linkage method to compute dendrograms in which the nodes join “objects” (protein fractions) with the most similar protein expression profiles. The relative length of the branches indicates the similarity of the expression profiles.

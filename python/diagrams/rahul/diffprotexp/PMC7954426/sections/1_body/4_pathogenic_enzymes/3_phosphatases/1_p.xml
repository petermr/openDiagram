<p>Serine/threonine phosphatases (STPs) have been described in several bacterial pathogens as essential enzymes involved in phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction pathways and are often associated with the virulence of these organisms [
 <xref rid="cit0241" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. A typical STP is encoded by the 
 <italic>M. genitalium MG</italic>_
 <italic>207</italic>, which can catalyze the dephosphorylation of threonine phosphate. The MG_207 mutant strain shows differential phosphorylated proteins and adherence phenotypes and reduced cytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="cit0241" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>], demonstrating that STP is critical for 
 <italic>M. genitalium</italic> virulence. Furthermore, a eukaryotic-type STP of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> (PrpC) has been confirmed in gliding motility [
 <xref rid="cit0242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. synoviae</italic> also encodes a PrpC [
 <xref rid="cit0243" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>], but its pathogenic role remains unknown.

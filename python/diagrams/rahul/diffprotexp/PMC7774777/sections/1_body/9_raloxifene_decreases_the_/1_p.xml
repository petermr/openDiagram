<p>Since the expression of catalytic core genes is only 1 aspect of the complex biology of the proteasome, we next aimed at defining whether raloxifene also impacts the accumulation of proteins linked to lysine 48-ubiquitin (Ub-K48) chains, which are targeted to the 26S proteasome for degradation. We performed immunoblotting using a Ub-K48â€“specific antibody. We found that raloxifene reduces the level of Ub-K48 chain linked proteins in the spinal cord of females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and that estrogen reduces ubiquitinated proteins in males, although to a lesser extent than raloxifene in females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). However, in view of the fact that estrogen increased the level of proteins in the insoluble fraction in males (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J-M</xref>), we reasoned that the superiority of raloxifene in females over estrogen in males must involve other factors.

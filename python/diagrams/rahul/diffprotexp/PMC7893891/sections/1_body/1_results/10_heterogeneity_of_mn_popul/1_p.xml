<p id="Par78">As previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in vitro differentiation of human iPSC resulted in heterogeneous populations consisting of several MN subtypes. Applying the same differentiation protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and quantitative image analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d-e), we observed that two pan-MN transcription regulators ISL-1and HB9 were present in ~ 60 (±12%) and ~ 85 (±15%) of the cell populations, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d-e). Thus, our quantitative image analysis data is in agreement with the 68 ± 7% double positive ISL1
 <sup>+</sup>/HB9
 <sup>+</sup> MN populations reported by Thiry et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Based on our image analysis on single cell level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and quantitative RT-PCR of bulk transcriptome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) we could infer that iPSC-derived neuronal populations are highly enriched on MN in general although without detailed analysis of the molecular markers characteristic to each MN subtype we are not able to conclude which one is predominant. Combination of transcription master regulators' activity determines the MN functional specifications (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Based on the quantitative image analysis, majority of the MNs were positive for the HB9 gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c-d), which remains activated in mature MNs from the median and hypaxial motor columns innervating the long muscles of the back and the respiratory muscles, respectively, while HB9 is downregulated in the medial neurons of the lateral motor column (LMC) innervating the limb muscles. The meta-transcriptome data from our study showed significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-5) activation (log
 <sub>2</sub> &gt; 2) of key molecular markers specific to various MN subtypes ranging from the preganglionic column (SMAD1 and ZEB2), spinal accessory column (RUNX1 and PHOX2B), and the lateral LMC (FOXP2 and ALDH1A2). Taken together, our results (summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) strongly indicate that in vitro derived MN populations are heterogeneous consisting of several functional subtypes.

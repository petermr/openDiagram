<p>We then examined the differential between the mean expression of each cluster in CLE-A versus HV and in CLE-A versus CLE-U (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>): cluster 3, IFN dominant included 14/18 genes in the cluster that were IFN responsive; and cluster 1, or CLE associated, was composed of a mixture of genes implicated in CLE pathogenesis. The IFN-dominant cluster (cluster 3) differentiated CLE-A from HV (23-fold change; p&lt;0.001) and CLE-U (eightfold change; p=0.002), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref>). The CLE-associated cluster (cluster 1) differentiated CLE-A from HV (fourfold change; p=0.005) and CLE-U (fourfold change; p=0.012), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>). A third gene cluster (cluster 2) composed of a mixture of IFN-associated and CLE-associated genes (CLE2-associated cluster) also distinguished CLE-A from HV skin (threefold change; p=0.001) but for this cluster, the difference between CLE-A and CLE-U did not reach the level of significance (

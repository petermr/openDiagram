 <p>3) Differences in APA and gene expression â€“ From the results in this section, it looks like the number of genes differentially expressed that also have differential PAS usage are a small subset. Is this because of lack of power (due to the small number of individuals included in the current study) or an actual biological phenomenon? How does this result compare to studies in humans of differential expression and differential APA in response to treatments or across cell types? What are the features and function of the genes represented in this subset?</p>

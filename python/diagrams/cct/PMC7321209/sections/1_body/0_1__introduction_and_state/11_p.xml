<p>The described correlations show a reduction of the welding current at a constant deposition rate, respectively a reduced heat input during the welding process. This makes the process strategy particularly suitable for additive manufacturing using WAAM. So far, the described advantages of CTWD extension have not been investigated in the context of wire arc additive manufacturing and exhibit large potential for the affection of geometrical, microstructural and mechanical properties of additively manufactured work pieces.</p>

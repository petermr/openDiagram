<p>Centrifuged wet pastes of birnessite were deposited on a diamond window of an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell (Golden Gate, single-bounce). They were dried with a heat gun to ∼110 °C, then to a hot stream of dry N
 <sub>2</sub>(g), and then covered with a lid enabling the passage of a flow of 250 mL/min N
 <sub>2</sub>(g) over the sample set to 25 °C. FTIR spectra were collected during the drying period to monitor the loss of water until the intensities of the O–H stretching and bending bands became constant. Accordingly, exposure of our sample to 0.4% RH, our driest N
 <sub>2</sub>(g) gas at 25 ± 1 °C, revealed residual levels of intercalated water (

<p>In silico simulation techniques have become an indispensable tool for modern-day drug discovery programs. Molecular docking currently offers the best alternative to quickly estimate the binding conformations of ligands that are energy-efficient to interact with a pharmacological receptor site. It has become more popular as it is time and cost effective in the pipeline of drug discovery and development. Interactions of some DIP proteins within the module were activated during the tumorigenesis, while some were found to be repressed. We hypothesized that, if we manage to break through the interactions that are activated, we might model a strategy to cure the disease. For this purpose, we considered DIPs with activated interactions in the tumor state as potential drug targets.</p>

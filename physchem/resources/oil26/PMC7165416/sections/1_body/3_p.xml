<p>We also performed M/L opsin in vitro expression assays for representatives of three orders of Afrotheria: the aardvark (order Tubulidentata), Cape rock elephant-shrew (Macroscelidea), and lesser hedgehog tenrec (Afrosoricida), hereafter referred to as elephant-shrew and tenrec. For the aardvark and tenrec, the respective spectral peaks (522 and 554 nm) were similar to values predicted by sequences (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In contrast, the elephant-shrew’s pigment had a λ
 <sub>max</sub> of 490 nm, showing a wide discrepancy (32 nm) with the predicted value (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The highly divergent elephant-shrew and gerbil appear to have both undergone dramatic functionally convergent shifts (−60 and −20 nm) in M/L opsin sensitivity toward blue-green light, extending the lowest known limits for vertebrates (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Both taxa occur in similar desert and/or grassland habitats (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and also show more daylight activity patterns than their respective closest relatives (e.g., tenrec or mouse/rat in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Thus the observed spectral changes are likely to be associated with transitions from a nocturnal niche to one characterized by a wider range of light conditions.

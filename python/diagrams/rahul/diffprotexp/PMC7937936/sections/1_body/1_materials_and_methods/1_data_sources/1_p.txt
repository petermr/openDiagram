0: The level 3 HTSeq-FPKM RNA-seq expression data and corresponding clinical data of HNSCC patients were retrieved from a data set of the Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA-HNSC) ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov).
1: A total of 546 RNA-seq expression data, including 502 tumor tissues and 44 normal tissues, were included in TCGA-HNSC data set, and were applied in the following analyses.
2: A total of 499 patients had both clinical data containing survival information and gene expression data included for survival analysis ( Table S1).
3: GSE41613 data set retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with both expression data and the corresponding survival information of 97 patients were recruited for external survival validation.
4: However, GSE41613 data set does not include gene expression data from normal tissues.
5: Therefore, GSE30784 and GSE37991 data sets from the GEO database with the expression data of both tumor and normal tissues were then used for external RNA-seq expression validation.
6: The GSE30784 data set includes gene expression data from 167 tumor tissues and 45 normal controls.
7: A total of 80 tumor and non-tumor pair-wise samples obtained from 40 male oral squamous cell cancer (OSCC) patients were recruited in the GSE37991.

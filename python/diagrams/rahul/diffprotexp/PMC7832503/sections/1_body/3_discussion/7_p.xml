<p>In summary, we used an efficient host-based WGS method to comprehensively evaluate the host genetic contributions on the occurrence mechanism of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Through such strategy, we revealed several novel candidate genes and pathways might play an important role in the process of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. These findings will facilitate us to expand our knowledge about the mechanisms of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 development and provide a theoretical basis for the design of new therapeutic strategy for patients with severe influenza. Further functional studies on these candidate genes are worthy to identify susceptibility marker for the severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.</p>

<p>On-column peptide labeling with TMT reduces the time for carrying out labeling from about 3 hrs to less than 10 min and the number of sample handling steps as compared to in-solution labeling because the desalting and labeling are carried out on the same resin [

On-column labeling of low microgram inputs of a murine B cell digest also has been shown to increase the efficiency and reproducibility of TMT labeling from 86+/−6% to 93+/−1% and it also provided a 27% increase in peptide spectral matches as compared to in-solution labeling [

Finally, small-scale fractionation of TMT-labeled peptides was incorporated into the protocol because it has been shown to improve depth of coverage for low input proteomics. For example, while single-shot MS/MS analyses of 1 µg of a murine B cell digest resulted in ~21 K peptide spectrum matches (PSMs), prior fractionation into three fractions increased the number of PSMs to about 39 K, 48 K, and 52 K for Stage Tips separations that were carried out with strong cation exchange (SCX), basic reversed phase C18, and basic sulfonated polystyrenedivinylbenzene (bSDB, pH 10) supports respectively [

The improved separation on both basic reversed phase modalities likely results from TMT labeling converting primary amines into amides, thus decreasing the positively charged character of tryptic peptides and their interactions with the SCX support [

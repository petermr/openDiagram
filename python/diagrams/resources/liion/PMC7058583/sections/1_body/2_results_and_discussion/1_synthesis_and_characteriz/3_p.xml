 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> presents the XRD pattern of the 3D flower-like MoS
 <sub>2</sub>-PrGO sandwich composites and the commercial MoS
 <sub>2</sub> specimens. All diffraction peaks of the MoS
 <sub>2</sub> matched well the diffraction peaks of the typical hexagonal MoS
 <sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 37-1492). The obtained hexagonal MoS
 <sub>2</sub> had lattice parameters of 
 <italic>a</italic> = 
 <italic>b</italic> = 3.16 Å and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 12.31 Å, which were consisted with the experimental values (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Other than diffraction peaks of the hexagonal MoS
 <sub>2</sub>, a weak and broad peak appeared in the XRD pattern of the 3D flower-like composites. This additional peak located at 24.5° was attributed to the (002) planes of rGO hosts (He et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Chong et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The chemical bonding conditions of the 3D flower-like composites were further analyzed by XPS. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, XPS spectrum of the C 1 s core-level was divided into two deconvolution peaks. The intense peak located at around 284.6 eV matched the C–C bonds of rGO nanosheets, and the weak peak near 286.0 eV was contributed by C–O bond (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C,D</xref> show the XPS spectrums of Mo 3d and S 2p, respectively. The bonding peaks centered at 228.8 and 232.1 eV reflected the bonding states of Mo 3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> and Mo 3d
 <sub>3/2</sub>, implying a standard Mo
 <sup>4+</sup> state. The main and satellite peaks of S 2p spectrum were, respectively, located at 161.7 and 162.8 eV with a 1.1 eV energy separation, corresponding to the S
 <sup>2−</sup> state (Khawula et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The XPS analysis indicated that S and Mo elements in the final products existed in the form of MoS
 <sub>2</sub>.

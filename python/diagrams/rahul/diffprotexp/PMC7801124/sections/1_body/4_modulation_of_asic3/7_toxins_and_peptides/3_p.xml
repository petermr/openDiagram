<p>Conversely, unlike sea anemone toxins, venom from the Texas coral snake (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8e</xref>), potentiates ASIC3 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 830 nM), although this effect was weaker than that observed with other ASIC subunits, ASIC1a and ASIC1b requiring a ∼100-fold lower concentration of MitTx for potentiation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">figure 8f</xref>), which comes from the eastern green mamba snake 
 <italic>Dendroaspis angusticeps</italic>, inhibits acid-gated currents in DRG neurones (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.8 µM, at pH 6.1) and although the currents were characteristic of ASIC3, this effect should be considered as nonselective ASIC inhibition before further characterization of effects against ASIC3 in a recombinant expression system; there is also evidence that α-DTx inhibits certain voltage-gated K
 <sup>+</sup> channels (1.1, 1.2 and 1.6), thus the toxin has nonselective actions [

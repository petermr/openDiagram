<p>The in situ observation of martensite transformation by SLCM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02127-f005">Figure 5</xref>) shows that lath martensite nucleated inside austenite grain and then grew quickly along the length direction. The austenite was divided by the first generated longer lathes. Then the lath widened. In the fine austenite grain, the martensite grew in the limited space, so short and thin martensite lath was found in FGHAZ. On the other hand, long and thick martensite lath was found in CGHAZ.

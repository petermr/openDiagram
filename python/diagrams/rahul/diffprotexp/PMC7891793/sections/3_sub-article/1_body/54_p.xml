<p>Author investigated differential gene expression and pathway analysis between lung lesion (LL) and No lung lesion (LL) of different treatment groups. However, to understand the real time effect of your treatment, pathological and histo-pathological data must be included. Authors did not provide viral load in the lung as well as nasal swab in different group. Quantification of viral load will help to better interpret the results from gene expression and pathway analysis regarding to their phenotypical effect such as progression of disease.</p>

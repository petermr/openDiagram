<p>Besides cubic-shaped catalysts, electrodeposited dendritic Cu catalysts were also investigated. For Cu dendrites electrodeposited on Ag and Pt foils, Cu(I) species were detected in the as-prepared catalysts via XAS and XPS but were found to be unstable. In fact, almost immediately after the exposure to CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR conditions, linear combination analysis of the XANES spectra and EXAFS data fitting showed the complete reduction of the CuO

 </sub> species.

 <italic>ex situ</italic> studies of frozen Cu foams were carried out at 20K, where EXAFS analysis and LCA analysis of the XANES spectra suggested the presence of Cu(I) species. However, further

<p>The voltage-gated potassium channel K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 was originally described in T cells [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and subsequently pursued as a target for treating T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref>]. More recently K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 has emerged as an attractive pharmacological target for reducing so-called “neuroinflammation” by modulating microglia activation. In both mouse and rat models of ischemic stroke K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers have been shown by us and others to reduce infarct area and improve neurological deficit [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockade decreased cerebral amyloid load, enhanced hippocampal neuronal plasticity, and improved behavioral deficits [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, in multiple animal models of Parkinson’s disease administration of the small molecule K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blocker PAP-1 inhibited degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and improved behavioral outcomes [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 inhibition or genetic deletion has further been shown to ameliorate white matter pathology after traumatic brain injury [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], postoperative cognitive decline [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and radiation induced brain injury [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In all these animal models of neurological disease increased K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 expression was observed on pathology-associated microglia and treatment with K
 <sub>V</sub>1.3 blockers resulted in reduced microglia activation and reduced inflammatory cytokine levels in the brains of the animals.

<p>The result of a hierarchical clustering analysis of fraction Q3 obtained with a HMW data acquisition protocol is given in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C and shows that the protein fractions are segregated into two distinct groups: (EAE stage 3) and (controls + EAE stage 1). This clustering of the EAE disease stage 1 sample with controls was also observed with fraction Q2 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). However, the segregation of EAE disease stage 1 with controls may not be significant as only one sample at this disease stage was examined.

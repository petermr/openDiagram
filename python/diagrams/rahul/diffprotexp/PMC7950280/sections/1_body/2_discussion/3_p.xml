<p>With except of the MAPK signaling, enrichment analysis of intersection pathways revealed that BDNF jointly participated in Ras and cAMP signaling pathways. The involvement of Ras has been increasingly reported in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and HD [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a dipeptidase that belongs to the Ras and cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II (Ang II) [

 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and HD [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], ACE inhibitors and Ang II antagonists were administrated to improve cognitive impairment by reducing mitochondrial oxidants.

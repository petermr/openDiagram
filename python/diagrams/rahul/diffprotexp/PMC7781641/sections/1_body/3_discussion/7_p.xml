<p>In addition, female mice injected with TAT-C3P displayed a greater decrease of Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 signal intensity compared to control TAT-C3D peptide than male mice. This infers that the TAT-C3P peptide is more effective in reducing Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.3 levels in female mice, which may explain the behavioral sex differences of the TAT-C3P peptide. This is the first example of a sex difference reported for a T-type channel blocking drug for any type of neuropathic pain.

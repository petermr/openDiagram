<p>We analysed the overlapping DEGs that had FDR-q &lt; 0.05 in all three comparison groups (0vs7, 0vs15, and 7vs15) and visualized them in a Venn diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). 1.74% of all upregulated DEGs showed a significant upregulation when comparing 0vs7, 0vs15, and 7vs15, supposing that time after transplantation had a cumulative effect on their expression. Likewise, 5.32% of all downregulated DEGs showed a significant decrease in every time comparison.

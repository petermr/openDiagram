 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f060">Figure 60</xref> shows the CCP diagram for 7020, and this can be compared to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f061">Figure 61</xref>, which shows the complete CCP diagram for 7150. The latter covers an extreme range of seven orders of magnitude of analysed cooling rates. The CCP diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04083-f061">Figure 61</xref> incorporates quantitative data from five different types of DSC device, as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-materials-12-04083">Section 2.2</xref>, and results from hardness testing over the entire cooling rate range, allowing for a profound knowledge of the kinetics quench-induced precipitation.

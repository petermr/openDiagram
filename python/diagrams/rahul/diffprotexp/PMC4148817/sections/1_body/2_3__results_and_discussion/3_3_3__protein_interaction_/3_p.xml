<p>Despite the interactions, CNT-altered proteins linked to each individual function are located in different parts of the cell and involved in different cell activities. For example, proteins involved in cell skeleton and membrane, nuclear transportation, transcription, cell junction, were all connected with each other. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="proteomes-01-00219-f005">Figure 5</xref> of interaction of proteins within functional network of “Cell Death”, proteins that are component of adherens junctions can interact with proteins that are component of ribonucleoprotein complex. Therefore, each function is integrated throughout the cell forming a whole cell adaptive response.

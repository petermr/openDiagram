<p>Lastly, ASIC3 involvement within the vasculature extends to pressure-induced vasodilation, which can lead to ulceration as blood flow is decreased, but ASIC3
 <sup>âˆ’/-</sup> mice or those treated with diclofenac/APETx2/amiloride show a reduced change (~25% from baseline) in response to local applied pressure (0 to 0.7 kPa), whilst the WT show a peak increased response by 50% at 0.2 kPa [

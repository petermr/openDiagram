<p>The molecular simulations were performed in Materials Studio 7.0 (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), using the Amorphous Cell module and the COMPASS forcefield. For modelling ι-carrageenan, 12 repeating (1-&gt;3)-β-D-galactopyranose-4-sulfate-(1-&gt;4)-3,6-anhydro-α-D-galactopyranose-2-sulfate- segments were used (2 molecules per cell). The poly (vinyl alcohol) was built having 10 repeating units/molecule (isotactic, 4 molecules per cell). The obtained structures were optimized with the same Amorphous Cell module.</p>

<p>At present, some typical lithium metal batteries, Li‐S battery, and Li‐O
 <sub>2</sub>/air battery have applied to the SCEs as electrolyte. The SCEs with prominent characteristics, including high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, wet interfacial contact, and satisfying thermal and electrochemical stability present preferable performances in various lithium battery systems. However, the most of the SCEs were applied in low‐voltage LiFPO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode and only few were used with high‐voltage cathode such as LiNi

 <sub>2</sub> due to the low electrochemical stability of polymer host. It is significant to develop the high‐voltage‐resistant polymer matrix or improve the electrochemical window of polymer electrolyte using ICEs to broaden the SCE application in all‐solid‐state battery. The specific capacity of S cathode in all‐solid‐state Li‐S battery using SCEs is still quite lower and its rate and cycling performance is poor due to the larger interfacial resistance between S cathode and SCEs and severe volume expansion. Integrated S cathode/SCEs architectures with lower interfacial resistance and highly stable structure should be further developed in the future research. The charge/discharge reaction of Li‐O
 <sub>2</sub> or Li‐air systems using SCEs would occur at solid–gas interface, which would greatly reduce the reaction kinetics due to the larger interface resistance. Some catalysts for all‐solid‐state Li‐O
 <sub>2</sub> or Li‐air system with SCEs should be developed to promote the charge/discharge reaction kinetics and improve its rate and cycling performance.

<p>To investigate the electrochemical behavior of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> in the cell, CV measurements were conducted on the fabricated cell. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>, the cathodic peaks at 1.78, 2.02, and 2.67 V (

 <sup>+</sup>/Li) represent the reduction of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> and the insertion of lithium ions, while the anodic peaks at 2.11, 2.23, and 2.89 V (
 <italic>vs.</italic> Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li) are attributable to the oxidation and extraction of lithium ions, demonstrating that 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold> exhibits a reversible multistep redox ability. The three redox potentials,

 <sup>+</sup>/Li) are close to the redox potentials of HHTP and HAT-CN in the coin-type cell, as shown in Fig. S15,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref> which suggests that the redox reaction of HHTP and HAT-CN influences battery performance. The redox reaction of 5,6,11,12,17,18-hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA), a HAT derivative, was reported to be a 6e
 <sup>–</sup> reaction that can be divided in two three-electron processes, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, 2.6–2.15 V and 1.68–1.38 V.
 <xref rid="cit49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Since HAT-CN has a lower LUMO level than HATNA, the redox reaction of HAT-CN occurs in the higher voltage region, which is consistent with the CV profile of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>. The redox peaks remained constant after 10 CV cycles, although the peak intensity decreased, which is consistent with the low cycle performance of the battery capacity (Fig. S10
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). The capacitive contributions in the CV profiles were separated from the total current according to the reported method (Fig. S16
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>).
 <xref rid="cit57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> The voltage profile for the capacitive current demonstrates that the anodic peaks at 2.11, 2.23, and 2.89 V (
 <italic>vs.</italic> Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li) and the cathodic peaks at 1.78, 2.02, and 2.67 V (
 <italic>vs.</italic> Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li) do not originate from the capacitive effect. In contrast, the large capacity and the sloping potential of the battery are partly due to the relatively large capacitive contribution, which was attributed to the porous structure of 
 <bold>PCT-1</bold>. Furthermore, the XRPD patterns of the cathode before and after the charge and discharge processes demonstrate that the hexagonal packing structure was retained, although the peaks became broader after charge–discharge (Fig. S17

<p>Group E and F are constituted by seven and one bZIP members, respectively. The members of these groups, e.g. bZIP 34 and 61, are reported to have a role in the pollen germination and tube growth in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Group F is primarily responsible for regulating genes involved in zinc transport, thus promoting plant adaptation through binding to zinc-deficiency-response elements (ZDREs; RTGTCGACAY) under zinc-starving conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Group G consists of nine StbZIPs. The name assigned by the letter ‘G’ refers to G-box, which also function as binding factors for bZIPs [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The G-box binding factor bZIPs in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are attributed to the regulation of light-responsive elements and perform a function in cell protection during both biotic and abiotic stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Group H is comprised of three StbZIPs. For several plant species possessing a complete conserved pattern of the bZIP domain, this group’s name is often known as the 
 <italic>HY5</italic> gene. In 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the gene 
 <italic>HY5</italic> attaches to the G-box and regulates root and hypocotyl development [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Potato Group I consists of eight bZIPs, and all members of the group I have a lysine (K) instead of arginine (R) at the 10
 <sup>th</sup> position [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Members of group I bZIPs are reported to be functionally involved in vascular development [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Group S bZIPs in potato is the second largest group, with sixteen bZIPs, although it is the main group in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The small size of proteins in this group specifies their requirement to interact with certain other transcriptional activation factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The bZIP proteins from 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (
 <italic>AtbZIP1</italic>), 
 <italic>Medicago</italic> (
 <italic>MtbZIP2</italic>, and 
 <italic>MtbZIP26</italic>), and rice (
 <italic>OsbZIP16</italic>) showed higher expression during salt treatment, resulting in an improvement in salt stress tolerance in several crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Group U in potato consisted of five StbZIP members which share high sequence similarity to the same members from other crops, including maize and rice. Conserved domains for members of this group have a set of signature sequences in the hinge and basic regions, and a conserved amino acid residue isoleucine is replaced with arginine. This substitution affects the DNA binding specificity as reported in earlier studies, and such a substitution has shown to inhibit the affinity of bZIP for AP1 protein in yeast [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and rice for promoters containing G-boxes [
 <xref rid="pone.0247864.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

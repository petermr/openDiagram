 <caption> Validation of IRF7 alternative mRNA processing. ( A) Predicted exons of IRF7. Annotated exons are numbered. For each AS event, primer sets #4-#8 were designed to validate differential exon inclusion/exclusion. The expected size of the PCR product is indicated in red ( B) Quantitative PCR for each primer set. Shown is agarose gel electrophoresis, with MW (in nt) indicated at the left ( C) Quantitation of IRF7 transcripts from qRT-PCR. ( D) Validation of AS in primary hSAECs. Agarose gel electrophoresis as in panel ( C). ( E) Quantitation of IRF7 transcripts from qRT-PCR findings indicate that RSV-induced mRNA processing of the IIR is a general response of the small-airway epithelium. </caption>

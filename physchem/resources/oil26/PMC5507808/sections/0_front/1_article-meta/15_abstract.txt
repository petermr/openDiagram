0: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the essential oil extracted from fresh leaves of   Pimenta racemosa in the improvement of fermented fish flour producing technology.
1: Essential oil of   Pimenta racemosa was extracted by hydrodistillation and its chemical composition was determined by GC and GC/MS.
2: Different types of fermented fish flours from Lesser African Threadfin (  Galeoides decadactylus) were produced by the modification of the traditional processing technology and the introduction of a step of essential oil adjunction during the process.
3: Three different essential oil concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 L g  1) were investigated.
4: Physicochemical, microbiological and nutritional analyzes were performed in order to evaluate the quality of the fermented fish flour produced.
5: Results obtained revealed that the essential oil of   Pimenta racemosa investigated has a chemical composition characterized by the presence of myrcene (25.1%), chavicol (7.5%) and eugenol (51.1%).
6: Fermented fish flour produced have a good nutritional potential.
7: However, on the microbiological level, only samples produced by adjunction of essential oil have a low level of microbial contamination, with an absence of pathogenic microorganisms.

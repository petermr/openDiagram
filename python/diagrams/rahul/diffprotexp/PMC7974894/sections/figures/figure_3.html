 <caption> Identification of the hub RBPs from the constructed DceRBPs' PPI networks. (A) Protein-protein interaction network of DeRBPs. Edges represent the protein-protein associations. The purple nodes represent up-regulated RBPs, while the green nodes represent down-regulated RBPs. (B) Identification of the hub genes from the PPI network using maximal clique centrality (MCC) algorithm. The red nodes represent RBPs with a high MCC score, while the yellow nodes represent RBPs with a low MCC score. </caption>

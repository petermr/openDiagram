0: Bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were cultured with high-glucose medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA) at 37C in a 5% CO 2 incubator.
1: CP biotype BVDV strain VEDEVAC AV69 kept in our laboratory was propagated on MDBK cells, and the virus titer was approximately 10 6.5 50% tissue culture infectious dose, TCID 50 per 0.1 mL.
2: Before infecting the MDBK cells with BVDV, 2  10 5 cells/mL of MDBK cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured at 37C in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 24 h. Subsequently, 10 3 TCID 50 BVDV was added to each well (experimental group, E group).
3: In parallel, high-glucose medium was used for mock infection (control group, C group).

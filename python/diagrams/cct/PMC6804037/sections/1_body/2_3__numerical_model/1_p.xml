<p>Nowadays, the finite element method (FEM) has been developed to reduce solution time and to predict thermal distortions, residual stress, and metallurgical change during the heat treatment. Therefore, in FEM simulation, in order to obtain a satisfactory process representation, the choice of the heat source model is very important. Moreover, validation and calibration of the model are essential to define heat source parameters correctly in order to establish a link between numerical and experiments results. Many studies have been conducted with different heat source models [

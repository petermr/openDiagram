<p>Examination of the functional gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the transcriptome in the lung tissue in each treatment group when compared to the placebo group revealed interesting data on the innate immune system. For example, there was no GO category related to the innate immune response detected in lung without lesion in group 1 (ibuprofen day 3) that could distinguish it from lung lesion of the placebo group. But there are some innate functions in lung lesions of group 1 that differentiate it from lung lesions in placebo; these include complement and coagulation cascades, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and chemokine signaling pathwaysâ€“all important aspects of the innate immune system. We may surmise that early activation of innate immune defenses by treatment with ibuprofen starting on the third day after BRSV infection provided an immune advantage to treated calves as compared to their placebo treated comtemporaties in group 3. Ibuprofen inhibits the production of prostaglandins and would have decreased lipid mediators in treatment group 1 compared with placebo treated calves. These differences were apparent in lung without lesion. For group 2, in contrast, we observed even more differences between lung without lesion if compared with the placebo group, particularly in functional categories of molecular patterns activation and response to the virus. Differences between group 1 and group 2 may reflect the different scheme of ibuprofen administration: group 1 treatment started earlier in the course of the infection and, therefore, acted longer and made an earlier intervention in the prostaglandin synthesis pathways. As a consequence of the immunomodulatory effect of the ibuprofen, the differences were also reflected in some innate immune mechanisms.</p>

  <p>Statistically significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) molecular processes (GO-terms) identified for 871 differential genes between radioiodine resistant cancers and other thyroid cancer samples. Differential gene names are shown in red. Circle size inversely reflects FDR-adjusted p-value for a differential GO-term identified. Filled part of a circle represents percentage share of matched differential genes in gene set of the respective GO-term. Links between the terms are taken from the STRING database.</p>

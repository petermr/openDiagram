 <caption> Mapping the calculated binding energy to 285 vertebrates. The ACE2 proteins are categorized by their animal Class ( Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Aves, Chondrichthyes, Mammalia, Reptilia, and Sarcopterygii) and ranked by the binding energy from low to high in each Class. The ACE2 proteins that are experimentally shown to be effective or less effective to SARS-CoV-2 are shown in blue and orange circles, respectively, while the others are shown in gray circles. Susceptible and insusceptible animals are highlighted in blue and orange, respectively. The error bars were estimated via bootstrapping by subsampling with replacement for 500 data points from the original data set of 500 binding scores for each species; the bootstrap steps were repeated for 1000 times. </caption>

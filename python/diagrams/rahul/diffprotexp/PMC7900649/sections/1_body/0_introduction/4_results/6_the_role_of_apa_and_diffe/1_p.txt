0: Since both tandem APA switching genes and DEGs showed dynamic regulation during PEDV infection, to explore the relationship between them, we analyzed the two data sets and found that 413 genes (nearly 20%) were subjected to changes of 3 UTR length and differential expression level during the PEDV infection concurrently (Fig.
1: 7a).
2: These genes are mainly enriched in spliceosome, protein processing in ER and cell cycle pathways (Fig.
3: 7b).

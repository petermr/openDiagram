<p>To further our understanding of the effects of chronic raloxifene treatment in the SOD1-G93A mice, we analyzed the proteasome subunit gene set and found that while only 3 proteasome genes were upregulated in the untreated SOD1-G93A mice compared with NTG untreated mice, 13 proteasome genes were upregulated in the SOD1-G93A mice upon treatment with raloxifene (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). As expected, raloxifene had no effect on proteasome genes in SOD1-G93A male mice (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>), while no effect on DUBs was observed in males (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>).

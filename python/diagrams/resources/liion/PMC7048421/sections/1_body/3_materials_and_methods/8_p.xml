<p>The SEM and XPS analyses were performed by first extracting the electrode samples from the fully discharged graphite/NCM622 pouch cells after cycling and washing 3Ã— with EMC. XPS tests were conducted on a PHI VersaProbe II Scanning XPS Microprobe. The samples were loaded in a glove box and transferred into the instrument through a vacuum transfer vessel. SEM imaging was performed on an FEI Nova NanoSEM 630 SEM instrument.</p>

<p id="Par18">Antibacterial potential of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower was tested against four Gram-positive bacteria reference strains which were 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. uberis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. ivanovii</italic> and three Gram-negative bacteria namely 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> following CLSI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] guideline. The bacterial suspensions were made by inoculating a fresh stock culture of the test bacteria strains into tubes containing 5 mL of sterile Luria- Bertani broth and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Active cultures grown overnight in sterile Luria- Bertani broth were inoculated into Mueller-Hinton Agar (MHA) incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, single colonies were transferred from MHA plates into 4 mL of normal saline solution determined spectrophotometrically at 580 nm as previously reported by Duarte et al., [

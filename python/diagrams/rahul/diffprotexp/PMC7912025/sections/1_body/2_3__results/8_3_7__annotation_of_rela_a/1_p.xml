<p>To understand the functional implications of RelA and IRF7 alternative mRNA processing, we conducted a functional isoform analysis in tappAS [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-13-00218" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Here, the major DIU isoforms are displayed for coding and noncoding mRNA transcripts with the PacBio sequence identifiers. Where possible, each is mapped to previously known (RefSeq/NCBI-curated) transcript variants or, where no annotation exists, labeled as novel splice forms. Of the five RelA isoforms identified in our analysis, three were curated and two were novel DIU isoforms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00218-f008">Figure 8</xref>A); only four were significantly expressed relative to the wild-type RelA mRNA. The predicted translation of PB6969.5 encodes a 520 aa peptide aligning to aa 32-551 of the canonical RelA protein; PB6969.13 encodes a polycistronic mRNA, with the upstream coding sequence identical to the 520 aa RelA protein and a 71 aa in-frame peptide downstream with a consensus initiation methionine residue. This downstream peptide has no distinguishing protein domains. PB6969.12 encodes three in-frame polypeptides with initiator methionines; the second and largest peptide is 186 aa (18.8 kDa), homologous to RelA transcript variant 2.

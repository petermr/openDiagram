0: In this study, we obtained previously published RNA-seq data representing six transcriptomes from the GEO database (ID: GSE99749).
1: Two sows (Tibetan pigs (TP) & Yorkshire pigs (LW)) used for RNA-seq were raised in the Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College Farm, under the same dietary and drinking water standards.
2: Animal care and all experimentation were conducted in accordance with the guidelines pre-approved by the Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College Farm Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
3: All samples were taken from longissimus dorsi muscle tissue of the embryo as described by Shang et al 10.
4: Divided into two groups (Tibetan pigs (TP) & Yorkshire pigs (LW)) according to breed.
5: After 60 days of fertilization, each group randomly selected a pregnant sow and randomly took out nine embryo samples.
6: The nine embryonic samples were randomly divided into three parts, each part as a biological replicate (each RNA library contains an equimolar ratio of RNA from the three samples.
7: ), and each group contains three biological replicates.
8: The pig gene annotations were downloaded from  ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/gtf/sus_scrofa, and the non-redundant reference sequence database was downloaded from  https://ftp.ncbi.nih.

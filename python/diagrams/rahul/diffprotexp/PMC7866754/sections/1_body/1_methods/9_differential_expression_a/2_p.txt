0: For protein differential expression analysis, the spectral count method was used for protein expression analysis that compares the peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) for each protein between the two stages, which has the highest reproducibility for label-free proteomics data [ 56]; it is then combined with the G test statistics [ 57] for computing p-values.
1: However, in this study the MS/MS spectra were matched against a customized transcriptome database instead of annotated protein database, definition of a protein was, therefore, adjusted.
2: Because the protein sequence of a translated transcript is different for each frame, an assumption was made that a given peptide can only identify one frame of the matched transcript being translated, and that a maximum of one protein can be translated from each frame of a transcript.
3: As a result, the sum of PSMs that identify one frame of a transcript are the spectral counts for the protein product from that frame of the transcript.

<p>Preparation of protoscolex samples: fertile CE cyst were obtained from the livers of naturally infected sheep. The cyst fluid containing protoscoleces was aspirated using a syringe and transferred to a 50-mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 5 min; the supernatant was then discarded and the pellet was resuspended in sterile normal saline and centrifuged. The operation was repeated 3 times, and the precipitate was filtered through a 200-μm pore size filter. After the protoscoleces were prepared for microscopic examination under a microscope at 40× and 100×, a sample of protoscolex was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen.</p>

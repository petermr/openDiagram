<p>The investigation of changes in overall network structure revealed some of the principles explaining cancer robustness to escape otherwise deadly treatments, linked to a higher network entropy that can be explained by the concomitant usage of more biological pathways compared with normal tissue, together with intra-tumour heterogeneity. This kind of data can inform about which tumours are more likely to respond to treatments, but also about which nodes (low-entropy genes) are more likely to be susceptible within the network.</p>

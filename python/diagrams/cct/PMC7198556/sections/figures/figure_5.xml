  <p>Hardness distribution at the bearing journal centreline showing a plateau of 650 HV1 down to a depth of 2 mm followed by an approximately linear decline to 520 HV1 at 4.2 mm, and a steep drop to a stable hardness of 280 HV1 from 5 mm downward, indicating the original microstructure of the base material. The accompanying phase fractions are shown underneath the hardness, with the microstructure beyond 5.3 mm assumed to be of constant composition.</p>

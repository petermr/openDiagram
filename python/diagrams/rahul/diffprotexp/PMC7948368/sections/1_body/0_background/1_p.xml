<p id="Par27">TNF-inhibitor (TNFi) therapies have revolutionised the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for many patients, reducing synovial inflammation and long-term disability attributed to cartilage and bone destruction [

Thus, early identification of non-responders for switching to an alternative therapy is a research priority for improved long-term outcomes and the responsible use of limited healthcare resources.

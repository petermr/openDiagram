0: Overnight cultures of EAEC strain 55989  agg3   carrying one of the plasmids pAAF/I, pAAUF/III, pAAF/IV, pAAF/V, and pBAD24 were diluted in fresh LB medium containing ampicillin (100 g/ml) and cultivated at 37C until an OD 600 of 0.40.6 had been reached.
1: Then, 10% arabinose solution was added to a final concentration of 0.3% for the induction of AAF fimbrial expression, and the incubation was continued for another 60 minutes at 37C.
2: A drop of bacterial culture of each sample was sedimented on a Formvar-coated, carbon-sputtered grid.
3: After negative-staining with 1% phosphotungstic acid, the samples were analyzed at 80 kV with a Tecnai 12 electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).
4: Images of selected areas were documented with Veleta 4k CCD camera (emsis, Munster, Germany).

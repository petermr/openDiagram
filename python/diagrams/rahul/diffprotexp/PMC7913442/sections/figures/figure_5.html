 <caption> Graphic summary of the results and conclusions. According to our results in HGrC1 cells, the complex SMAD3/FOXL2 C134W drives a specific transcriptomic effect which involves genes (e.g. TGFB2, SMARCA4, BAZ2A, COL4A2 and HSPG2) related to neoplastic pathways such as Tumorigenesis, Chromatin remodeling, ECM regulation and Proteoglycans in Cancer, (top panel). FOXO1 upregulated expression obtained by Lipofection shows a significative mitigation of the SMAD3/FOXL2 C134W transcriptomic effect and suggests FOXO1 transcription factor as a new putative target for the aGCTs (bottom panel) </caption>

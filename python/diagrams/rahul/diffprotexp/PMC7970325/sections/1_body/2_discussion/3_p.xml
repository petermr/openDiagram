<p id="p0230">These data allowed us to analyze characteristic features of DNA repair pathway regulation in different thyroid tumor types. Follicular and papillary cancers demonstrated higher activation level of DNA repair pathways than the follicular adenomas. Our results suggest that papillary cancers have more activated DNA repair pathways than follicular neoplasms, with the remarkable exception of a G2M transition checkpoint pathway which showed an opposite trend. We found that most of DNA repair pathways were minimally activated (among tumors) in follicular adenomas. This trend was also confirmed for literature dataset PRJEB11591. We hypothesize that lower DNA repair pathway activation strengths in follicular adenomas compared to thyroid tumors can be linked with relatively lower level of DNA replication defects. Alternatively, this effect can be also connected with hypoxia which frequently accompanies benign tumors and inhibits DNA repair pathways [

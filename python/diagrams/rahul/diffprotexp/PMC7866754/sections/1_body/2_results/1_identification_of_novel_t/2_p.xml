<p id="Par36">However, transcriptional evidence alone tends to be very noisy, especially for non-canonical transcripts that are constructed from de novo assembly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. With the availability of proteomic data, it was possible to use the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from novel transcripts to identify their existence with much higher confidence. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, most of the novel transcripts have one or two unique peptides mapped to them, with very rare cases of over ten peptides. This suggests that most of these novel transcripts tend to be translated in only one frame even with six-frame translation and the translated region probably covers a small segment of the transcript.

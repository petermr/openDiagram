    "The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of metallothionein (MT) protection from depleted uranium (DU) using a proteomics approach to search for a DU toxicity-differential protein. MT-/- and MT+/+ mice were administrated with a single dose of DU (10â€‰mg/kg, i.p.) or equal volume of saline. After 4 days, protein changes in kidney tissues were evaluated using a proteomics approach. A total of 13 differentially expressed proteins were identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The validating results showed that the expression of aminoacylase-3 (ACY-3) and the mitochondrial ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1) decreased significantly after DU exposure; in addition, the reduction in MT-/- mice was more significant than that in MT+/+ mice. The results also showed that exogenous ETHE1 or ACY-3 could increase the survival rate of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells after DU exposure. A specific siRNA of ETHE1 significantly increased cell apoptosis rates after DU exposure, whereas exogenous ETHE1 significantly decreased cell apoptosis rates. In summary, ACY-3 and ETHE1 might involve in protection roles of MT. ETHE1 could be a new sensitive molecular target of DU-induced cell apoptosis."

 <p>The ETS domain family of transcription factors is involved in a number of biological processes, and is commonly misregulated in various forms of cancer. Using microarray datasets from patients with different grades of glioma, we have analyzed the expression profiles of various 
  <italic>ETS</italic> genes, and have identified 
  <italic>ETV1, ELK3, ETV4, ELF4,</italic> and 
  <italic>ETV6</italic> as novel biomarkers for the identification of different glioma grades. We have further analyzed the gene regulatory networks of ETS transcription factors and compared them to previous microarray studies, where Elk-1-VP16 or PEA3-VP16 were overexpressed in neuroblastoma cell lines, and we identify unique and common regulatory networks for these ETS proteins.

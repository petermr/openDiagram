<p>In this work, we studied silicon microparticles for their possible use in anode fabrication to produce non-expensive anode material, which can achieve better capacitance properties. Commercial silicon powder was used as a starting material. The same material was ball-milled and chemically etched to obtain nanostructured material. Several works have been published on ball-milled Si nanocomposite anodes [

The micrometric size of Si powder allows safe and easy handling. Furthermore, this process could use Si waste (typically Si wafer scraps) as the starting material, reducing the precursor cost to nearly zero. In the present work, structural and microstructural changes in these three materials were examined using several methods–X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) combined with the results of Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectrometry, nitrogen adsorption measurements, and TEM analysis. Electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements.

 <caption> Comparative analysis of differential gene expression of key tissue development markers by RT-qPCR (gray) and RNA-seq (black). Pluripotency and NSC markers validated include ( a) Oct4, transcription factor that maintains self-renewal and pluripotency; ( b) Nestin, a filament protein marker of neural stem cells; ( c) Pax6, a transcription factor that drives neurogenesis; and ( d) NgN2, a neuronal-specific transcription factor. Motor neuron specification markers validated include ( e) Isl1, a transcription factor required for motor neuron generation; ( f) Map2, a neuron-specific cytoskeletal protein; ( g) HB9, an early marker of cholinergic neurons; and ( h) ChAT, an enzyme required for acetylcholine synthesis. Shown are the averages and standard error from three independent biological replicas from the iPSC to MN differentiation trajectory. The RNA-Seq transcripts were normalized to the total read per analyzed sample (in FPKM: fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments) and the transcript levels determined by RT-qPCR were normalized to GAPDH as the endogenous sample control. Fold change was calculated for each developmental stage relative to transcript levels in iPSC (D0). Statistical significance ( p &lt; 1.5e-6) was determined with Student t-test </caption>

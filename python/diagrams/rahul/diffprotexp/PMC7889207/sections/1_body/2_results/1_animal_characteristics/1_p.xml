<p>The characteristics of animals used in this study have been reported previously (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After three months of diet exposure, the CD-fed rats were 20% (p &lt; 0.001) heavier than STD-fed rats. Moreover, the retroperitoneal fat of CD-fed rats weighed 14 g more than that of STD-fed rats (p &lt; 0.001). While no differences in blood glucose concentrations were observed between the groups, the CD-fed rats exhibited increased serum triglycerides (1.20 ± 0.10 vs 0.50 ± 0.10 mM, p &lt; 0.01), fasting insulin concentrations (6.14 ± 2.79 vs 3.78 ± 1.97 ng/ml, p = 0.042) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, 1.65 ± 0.76 vs 1.00 ± 0.53, p = 0.039) compared with control rats. Consistent with these observations, circulating leptin levels were increased in CD-fed compared to STD-fed rats (Figure S2A, 24.81 ± 0.77 vs 4.91 ± 0.28 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.001), whilst no differences were observed in serum tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) levels (Figure S2B).

0: We previously reported significant sex differences in the expression and networking of mouse heart rhythm determinant genes (HRD), with males having higher expression in atria than in ventricles and females higher expression in ventricles than in atria 11.
1: We have reported also sex differences in subcellular localization of HRD proteins and that both expression and localization of HRD proteins in female heart change during the estrous cycle 12.
2: Since female transcriptome depends on the estrogen level 13 (uncontrollable variable) and phase of the estrous cycle (requiring synchronized animals in each of the four phases), the present research was restricted to males.
3: However, there are studies of chamber-specific gene expression profiles in female mice 14 but without mentioning whether the animals were in the same or different cycle phase.

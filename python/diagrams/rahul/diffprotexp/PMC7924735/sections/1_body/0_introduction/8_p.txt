0: In the third strategy, a proteomic analysis is conducted, based on experimental data from two-dimensional gels and subsequent MS sequencing.
1: While the latter is the most useful method when no genomic data is available [ 4], it is often the case that the products of interest are only a small fraction of the proteins in a complex mixture [ 18].
2: The high variability in protein expression levels severely limits the ability of 2DPAGE-MS to identify low-abundance proteins [ 19].
3: Although 2DPAGE-MS is a powerful, mature, and sensitive technique, it is often not optimal for the analysis of a complete proteome.
4: It has been shown that only 40% of the differentially expressed proteins identified were sufficiently abundant to be identified by MS [ 4, 20].

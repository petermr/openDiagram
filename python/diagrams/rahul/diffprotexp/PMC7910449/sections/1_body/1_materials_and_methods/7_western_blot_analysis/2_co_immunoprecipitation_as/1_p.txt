0: SKOV3 cells infected with LV2-NC or LV2-1 and A2780 cells infected with LV6-NC or LV6 were used for Co-IP assays.
1: The cells were lysed in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors after 72 h and centrifuged, and the protein concentration was estimated.
2: The lysates were precleared with protein A/G beads and then immunoprecipitated overnight with 2 g anti-DSC1 mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-398590, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were captured with protein A/G beads and washed extensively with NTEN buffer before elution by heating in 2 loading buffer.
3: NTEN buffer alone was used as an NC.
4: The eluates and reserved lysate (input) were electrophoresed, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-DSC1 mouse monoclonal antibody(sc-398590, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal anti-ATG101 antibody (SAB4200506, Sigma-Aldrich).

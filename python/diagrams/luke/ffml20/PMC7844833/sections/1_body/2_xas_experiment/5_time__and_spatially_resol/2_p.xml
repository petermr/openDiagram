<p>While the possibilities provided by energy-dispersive XAS for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> and 
 <italic>operando</italic> studies of catalysts are limited, time-resolved measurements are often the key for understanding the working mechanism of catalysts and other functional materials, by allowing one to follow directly the transformations in the materials structure and composition, and detect the presence of intermediate species. The collection of a full XAS spectrum at a conventional monochromator-based SR beamline requires several minutes, which significantly limits the achievable time resolution. However, the recent progress in the so-called quick-XAFS (QXAFS) method, which relies on specially designed continuously scanning monochromators and rapid data acquisition schemes, has been considerable and allows one to achieve time-resolution down to the ms range.

 </sup> This enables new experimental designs and access to previously unexplored details of the changes in the structure of the catalysts. For example, the QXAFS method with increasingly improving time-resolution has been instrumental for analyzing time-dependent processes at Pt electrodes during the ORR reaction, as demonstrated by Tada et al.

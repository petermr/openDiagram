<p>The selected spots were cut out and subjected to de-staining using Silver Stain Kit for Mass Spectrometry
 <sup>®</sup> (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to facilitate the complete removal of silver from stained protein spots and maximum protein recovery for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. Each spot was reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol, carbamide methylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide, and treated with trypsin for digestion. The peptides were dissolved in 0.3% formic acid and injected to the nano-flow-LC (Eksgent nanoLC 415 with ekspert cHiPLC, AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) with the tandem MS (TripleTOF5600, AB Sciex). Duplicate analysis was performed in trap and elute mode of the ChromeXP C18 Chip column (200 μm × 0.5 mm) and the ChromeXP C18 Chip column (75 μm × 150 mm). Formic acid (0.1%) was used as a mobile phase A and formic acid (0.1%) in acetonitrile as a mobile phase B. Acetonitrile was used as an organic solution to extract hydrophobic peptides to optimize the peptide extraction. Elution of 20-min gradients from 2% B to 32% B were done. Mass spectrum in the data dependent mode was performed.

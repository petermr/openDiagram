<p id="Par37">The concentrations of PZP (Catalog No. DY8280-05; R&amp;D Systems, MN, USA) and IGFBP3 (Catalog No. DGB300; R&amp;D Systems, MN, USA) in serum were quantified with commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Most samples were assayed in duplicates, and the average values were reported as pg/mL or ng/mL. The linear correlation between the PRM-MS and ELISA results was calculated using Pearson’s correlation analysis.</p>

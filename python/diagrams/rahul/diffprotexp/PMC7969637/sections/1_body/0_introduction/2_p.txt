0: Over the last decades, the management for pediatric sepsis has improved gradually ( 8).
1: The current therapies in clinic include resuscitation, prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, accurate fluid balance, blood glucose, as well as source control ( 9).
2: However, we still lack a specific molecular therapy for this condition, except for antimicrobial therapy.
3: Numerous trials of potential biological agents targeting different mediators of sepsis have failed ( 2).
4: Despite advances in intensive care and supportive technology, the mortality rate of sepsis in children still stay in a high position without going down ( 10).
5: The current recommendation for identifying sepsis is the SOFA score, which refers to Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment.
6: SOFA is a simple system, which uses accessible parameters in daily clinical practice to identify dysfunction or failure of the key organs as a result of sepsis ( 11,  12).
7: The European Medicines Agency has accepted that a change in the SOFA score of 2 or more is an acceptable surrogate marker for sepsis ( 13).
8: Unfortunately, the criteria still cannot confirm or refute the diagnosis of sepsis completely given the complexity of the sepsis response.
9: Moreover, sepsis is a time critical emergency, as the disease may progress rapidly to organ failure, shock, and death, which require a prompt recognition.

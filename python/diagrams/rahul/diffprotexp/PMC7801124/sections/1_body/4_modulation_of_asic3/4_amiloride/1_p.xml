<p>Waldmann and colleagues [

 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] first showed that ASIC3 is sensitive to amiloride (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6a</xref>) and its derivatives benzamil and ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), all of which are nonselective blockers of ion channels in the ENaC/DEG superfamily; interestingly, these compounds strongly inhibit the transient component of ASIC3 current whilst mildly potentiating the sustained component. Clinically, amiloride is prescribed as an antihypertensive medication with classification as a K
 <sup>+</sup> sparing diuretic due to its effects upon ENaC in the nephron [
 <xref rid="cit0180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>], thus, amiloride has limited potential as an analgesic due to diuresis being an unwanted side effect. A further disadvantage is that amiloride can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and hence there is also potential for side effects resulting from central inhibition of centrally expressed ASICs. Lastly, the lack of selectivity across ASIC isoforms at comparable concentrations to those that inhibit other ion channels and transporters limits the potential of amiloride directly being used to target ASICs to relieve pain [

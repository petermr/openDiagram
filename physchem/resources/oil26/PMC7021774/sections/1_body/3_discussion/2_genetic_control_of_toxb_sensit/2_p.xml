<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par29">Within the <italic>Tsc2</italic> region, SNP BS00072620_51 was found to be the most significant marker in both of the genetic mapping populations investigated. Furthermore, it was shown in the AM panel (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;480) to be diagnostic for ToxB sensitivity, with A:A and G:G alleles perfectly predicting insensitivity (ToxB score&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1) or sensitivity (score&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1), respectively. Similarly, SNP BS00072620_51 was also diagnostic for ToxB sensitivity in the 47 varieties investigated that post-dated the AM panel. As ToxB sensitivity has been shown to be correlated with susceptibility to tan spot (Friesen and Faris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>; Abeysekara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2010</xref>), the co-dominant KASP marker developed here which is diagnostic for allelic state at <italic>Tsc2</italic> represents a useful tool for selecting against ToxB sensitivity in wheat breeding programmes in regions where ToxB-containing <italic>Ptr</italic> is prevalent. The incursion of isolates carrying ToxB into new areas would make marker-assisted selection against ToxB sensitivity a priority target for guarding against future changes in pathogen prevalence and virulence.</p>

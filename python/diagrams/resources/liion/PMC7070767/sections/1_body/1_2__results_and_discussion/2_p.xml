<p>The total volume and specific surface areas of samples were measured using nitrogen adsorption. For these analyses, the samples were degassed at T = 250 Â°C and the sample chamber was filled with controlled increments of nitrogen starting at relative pressure of p/p
 <sub>0</sub> = 0.025 at T = 77K, where p
 <sub>0</sub> is the saturation vapor pressure of liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> at 77K. Figure 6 shows the N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples S1, S2, and S3. Samples S1 and S3 can be characterized by the H4 type hysteresis loops of physisorption isotherms. These types of loops are generally found within materials possessing narrow slit pores, often in the micropore region. For sample S1, the hysteresis loop closes at around 0.47 p/p
 <sub>0</sub> which is indicative of the so-called tensile strength effect. In contrast to the hysteresis loop of sample S1, the hysteresis loop of sample S3 is observable in the low-pressure region, which can be a consequence of irreversible adsorption of nitrogen in pores of a similar width as the adsorptive molecule or the chemisorption of the adsorptive molecules. Due to the presence of the low-pressure hysteresis in sample S3, an accurate analysis of pore size and pore volume is not possible. In contrast to these two samples, S2 exhibits a type II physisorption isotherm, which is characteristic of nonporous or macroporous adsorbents. The shape of such an isotherm is a consequence of unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption up to high values of p/p

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. From these data, the total surface area of the sample can be derived by the method of Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-00891" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For sample S1 the surface area is 10.6 m
 <sup>2</sup>/g, while for S2 it is 16.7 m
 <sup>2</sup>/g. The surface increase is expected because the particle size is reduced. Sample S3 has a surface area of 7.2 m
 <sup>2</sup>/g which is also expected because the average pore size of S3 (3.44 nm) is much bigger than for the S2 (1.26 nm) or S1 (0.56 nm). The total pore volume increased in sample S3. The average particle size and surface area of samples S1, S2, and S3 are given in

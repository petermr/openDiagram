<p>Analysis using SEM and HR-TEM with EDS and SAED/NBD [
 <xref rid="B132-materials-12-04083" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] showed that both reactions were caused by the precipitation of the same phase, i.e., the Si phase with diamond cubic crystal structure, but that the morphologies and dimensions were different: during HTRs, polygonal particles with a low aspect ratio grew (up to several tens of µm in diameter), while during LTRs, plate-like particles with a high aspect ratio were formed (up to several µm in length but only several hundreds of nm or less in thickness) [

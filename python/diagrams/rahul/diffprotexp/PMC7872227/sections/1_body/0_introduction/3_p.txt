0: Several current studies have attempted to address those issues by optimizing the growth and mineralization conditions of  S.  pasteurii.
1: These studies include using response surface methods to optimize the concentrations of urea, calcium chloride and nickel ions to maximize the growth rate and calcium carbonate precipitation capacity of  S.  pasteurii [ 14].
2: However, it is found that enhanced mineralization alone cannot solve the problems in large-scale engineering applications effectively.

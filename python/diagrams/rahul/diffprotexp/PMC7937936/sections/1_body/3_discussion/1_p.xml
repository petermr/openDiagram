<p>In this study, we identified three hub genes (
 <italic>CCR4</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR8</italic>, and 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic>) that were significantly associated with both TME and prognosis through a combination of correlation analysis and survival analysis for the TME related DEGs. Among them, there were significant differences in the expression of 
 <italic>CCR8</italic> and 
 <italic>P2RY14</italic> in tumor tissues and normal tissues. Enrichment analysis revealed that the functions of these genes are primarily associated with the immune system. In a subsequent analysis of tumor-infiltrating cells, we found that the expression of these genes was all significantly correlated with the fraction of multiple immune cells in the tumor tissue. This is further evidence that these genes influence the immune system and the tumor microenvironment by influencing the immune system and, thus, tumorigenesis, progression, and prognosis. They can also be used as reliable predictors of the tumor microenvironment and prognosis.

For the roots, the samples that have a very low residual water content should provide extracts richer in aristolone. The combined effects of the extraction duration and the state of division, on the one hand, and the extraction duration, the state of division and the residual water content, on the other hand, greatly influence the extraction of aristolone. However, these interactions are complex and difficult to assess.

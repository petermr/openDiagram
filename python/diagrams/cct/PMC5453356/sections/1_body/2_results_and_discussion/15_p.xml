 <xref rid="b23-materials-07-02631" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for the experimental details). However, it is believed that the triangle approximation of ∆

 <sub>dead</sub> overcomes this problem in a defined way. As the precipitation heat value was used for the determination of the characteristic times of the precipitation process, the ratio between the approximated contributions, Δ

 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>total</sub>, should be discussed. 
 <xref rid="f15-materials-07-02631" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref> shows this ratio as a function of temperature. It is obvious that the ratio possesses the largest values within the temperature range most critical for precipitation. However, Δ
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>dead</sub> amounts to a maximum of about 8% of the total evaluated precipitation heat. Therefore, one can conclude that the influence of the Δ
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>dead</sub> approximation on the evaluation of characteristic times is relatively small.

<p id="Par7">Identification of molecular QTLs can provide a better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of key cell types across disease stages. We identified 
 <italic>cis</italic> expression QTLs (
 <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs) for 1891 genes in at least one tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with high correlation of effects across the tissues studied (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The direction of effect was concordant across all 
 <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs detected in both low-grade and high-grade cartilage. We identified 
 <italic>cis</italic> protein QTLs (
 <italic>cis</italic>-pQTLs) for 38 genes in at least one tissue, with a similarly strong correlation across low-grade and high-grade cartilage (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

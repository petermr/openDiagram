<p>Ki‐67 is a nuclear protein that is expressed in G1, S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle and is then rapidly catabolized at the end of M phase and not detectable in cells in G0 and early G1. Ki‐67 is commonly used as a marker of cell proliferation. P16(+)/Ki67(+) nuclei have been classified with respective precisions of 77.1% and 82.6%.

 </xref> Many studies have indicated that cell proliferation in cancer patients and activation of Ki67 leads to cervical cancer progression.

 </xref> Therefore, Ki67 can be used as a positive control for auxiliary pathological staging diagnosis, and we evaluated Ki67 protein expression in normal, LISL, HISL and SCC samples by IHC. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cam43799-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Ki67 was expressed in the nucleus, the intensity increased with histological cancer progression and the quality increased following the histological progress. Significantly high expression of Ki67 in cervical SCC was observed, and these results were consistent with those of previous reports.

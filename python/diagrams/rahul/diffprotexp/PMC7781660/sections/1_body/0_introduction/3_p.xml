<p>In addition to cattle, BVDV can also infect sheep, pigs, deer, and other wild animals [

 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, vaccinated and naturally infected animals cannot be effectively distinguished by serological methods. The identification and elimination of PI livestock to prevent the spread of BVDV is the most widely used strategy today. However, this inevitably results in important economic losses for the farms due to the need to detect and remove PI animals, and underdeveloped countries and regions cannot bear such heavy costs. Thus, the elucidation of the mechanism of BVDV infection and host immune responses is crucial to characterize the pathogenesis of BVDV and to develop vaccines with which to control BVDV infection.

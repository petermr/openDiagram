<p>The different proteins and protein complexes were expressed in the 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain W3031b Gal4-2 (α, leu2, his3, trp1::TRP1-GAL10-GAL4, ura3, ade2-1, canr, cir+) [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For yeast transformation, 5 ml of non-transformed W3031b Gal4-2 strain was cultured in S6 AU minimal media (0.1% (w/v) Bacto
 <sup>TM</sup> Casamino Acids, 0.7% (w/v) Yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and with ammonium sulphate), 2% (w/v) glucose, 20 µg/mL adenine and 20 µg/mL uracil) for 24 h at 28°C. Cells were mixed with ∼1 μg of plasmid DNA and 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA (denatured at 100°C for 5 min and cooled down on ice). After vortexing, 500 μL of 40% (w/v) PEG 4000, 100 mM lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 1 mM EDTA and 20 μL of 1 M DTT was added. The tube was vortexed again and left overnight at room temperature. The next morning the tube was centrifuged at 350 
 <italic>× g</italic> for 2 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were re-suspended in 100 μL of S6A minimal media (SAU without uracil) and plated on S6A-agar plates. The plates were left in the incubator at 28°C for 3–5 days until the transformed colonies appeared.

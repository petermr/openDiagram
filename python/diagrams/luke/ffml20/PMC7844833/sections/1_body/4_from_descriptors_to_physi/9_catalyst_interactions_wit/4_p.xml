<p>In the case of strong particle–support interactions, the bonding between the catalyst particle and the corresponding support can also be detected. In fact, Pt–O bonds are often observed in the studies of oxide-supported metallic Pt NPs. For instance, Pt NPs supported on TiO
 <sub>2</sub> exhibited a significant Pt–O contribution even in the absence of any adsorbates (under UHV conditions), as recently reported by Ahmadi et al.

 </sup> In the latter study, the oriented nature of the sample (Pt NPs supported on a single crystal) and the fact that polarization-dependent XAS measurements could be implemented allowed the authors to directly probe the anisotropy of particle–support interactions and revealed the encapsulation of the Pt NPs by the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> support (

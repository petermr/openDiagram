<p id="Par5">Here, we provide the first report of transgenerational effects of water-deficit stress on the physiological traits, yield performance and grain quality in durum wheat. Next-generation sequencing analysis was carried out to profile the miRNAome, transcriptome, and degradome with or without the effects of transgenerational stress. Our data provide the first evidence in

New knowledge gained at the molecular level has revealed key miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules that are potential new candidates to enhance stress tolerance across generations in molecular breeding.

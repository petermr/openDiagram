 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows differences in short circuit frequency and uniformity of the short circuits over time with increasing CTWD. Thereby, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>a shows homogeneous droplet transfer with periodical short circuits of f = 42 Hz with a CTWD of 12 mm. Increasing CTWD leads to a reduction of the short circuit frequency (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). This can be explained by the formation of large volume droplets due to decreased welding current respectively decreased pinch force. Thus, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b shows a short circuit frequency of f = 11 Hz with increased CTWD of 52 mm. The irregularity of the short circuit frequency arose through the formation of larger droplets (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b; circle number 4), which were transferred with higher kinetic energy into the melt pool causing a wave formation of the liquid melt pool. These waves partially reached the newly forming drop at the end of the wire, creating a new short circuit. This effect caused the transfer of smaller droplets with a reduced detaching frequency during short circuit. The described effect is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-02491-f004">Figure 4</xref>b in the time window between 200 and 350 ms.

0: Studies investigating the genetics and biochemistry of bacterial alkane degradation have mainly focused on the enzymes involved in the initial step of oxidizing  n-alkanes, particularly medium-length chains ( van Beilen and Funhoff, 2007;  Rojo, 2009).
1: Terminal aerobic alkane degradation occurs through sequential oxidation of a terminal carbon initiated by alkane monooxygenases, which produce primary alcohols, and followed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, produces the corresponding aldehydes and fatty acids, respectively ( Ji et al., 2013).
2: Bacteria capable of degrading medium-chain alkanes frequently contain CYP153-type cytochrome P450s and/or homolog of well characterized integral membrane non-heme iron alkane monooxygenases, such as AlkB ( Rojo, 2009;  Wang and Shao, 2013).
3: The degradation mechanisms of long-chain alkane oxidation are less well understood.
4: Bacteria degrading long-chain alkanes may contain a long-chain alkane monooxygenase such as AlmA, and/or a thermophilic soluble long-chain alkane monooxygenase, such as LadA from  Geobacillus ( Feng et al., 2007;  Throne-Holst et al., 2007).
5: However, the genes that code for these proteins are not present in the  T. oleivorans genome ( Golyshin et al., 2013) and this study provides evidence that suggests an alternative enzyme system used by  T. oleivorans for long-chain alkane oxidation.

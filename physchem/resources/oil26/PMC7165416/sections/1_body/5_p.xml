<p>We repeated this approach for the elephant-shrew, and found a critical site (position 48), with an A48T mutation producing a −9-nm λ
 <sub>max</sub> shift. This species also showed an amino acid substitution (H294Y) at a known critical site (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) that resulted in a −3-nm shift. When combined with the A308S critical replacement, these three substitutions caused a 44-nm λ
 <sub>max</sub> shift toward blue-green range, which is still 16 nm short of the observed λ
 <sub>max</sub> (

Our findings thus indicate that lineages of two distantly related superorders of mammals have undergone tuning to blue-green light via nonidentical molecular routes, and that shifts in the latter stem, in part, from unknown molecular mechanisms.

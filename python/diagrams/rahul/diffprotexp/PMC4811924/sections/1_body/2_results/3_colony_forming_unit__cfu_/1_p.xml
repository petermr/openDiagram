<p>To better assess action of tylosin on biofilm quantitatively, the CFUs of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> were counted. The viability of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> treated with 1/4 MIC of tylosin was different from the viability of untreated 
 <italic>S. suis</italic>. The number of CFUs/mL in treated biofilms (5.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFUs/mL) was significantly fewer than in nontreated biofilms (6.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFUs/mL; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The number of CFUs/mL in treated biofilms (5.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFUs/mL) was significantly fewer than in nontreated biofilms (6.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFUs/mL; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The findings demonstrated that 1/4 MIC of tylosin remained effective in decreasing the viability of 
 <italic>S. suis</italic>.

<p>For protein quantification, the proteins containing at least two unique peptides were enumerated for all labeled samples. The quantifiable proteins were listed first, and the abundance ratio (treated/control) was log2 transformed. The differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between treatments were identified with fold change &gt; 1.2 and

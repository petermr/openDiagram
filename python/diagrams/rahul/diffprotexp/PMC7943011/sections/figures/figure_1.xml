  <title>Proteomic analysis of endometrial cancer cells after treatment with metformin or insulin.</title>
  <p>Protein lysates of HEC-1A cells were collected 7 days after repeated administration of 0.5 mmol/L metformin or 100 ng/mL insulin and subjected to scioDiscover antibody microarrays targeting 1,300 different proteins. Untreated cells served as the reference control sample. Proteins were defined as significantly differential for |log
   <sub>2</sub>FC| ≥ 0.5 and an adjusted 
   <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.05; n = 3. (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>C</bold>) Volcano plots for each treatment group display the distribution of proteins that were differently expressed after metformin (
   <bold>A</bold>) or insulin (
   <bold>B</bold>) administration compared to control samples or between metformin and insulin treatments (
   <bold>C</bold>). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Hierarchical clustering of samples based on differential protein data. One sample (Metformin_3) was identified as an outlier and removed from proteomic analysis. (

0: We fabricated 2.8-Ah pouch cells using LiNi 0.6Co 0.2Mn 0.2O 2 (Umicore) for cathodes and graphite (Nippon Carbon) for anodes.
1: The capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode, or NP ratio, was designed at 1.2.
2: The 2.8-Ah pouch cell contains a stack of 20 anode and 19 cathode layers.
3: A Celgard-2325 separator of 25 m in thickness was used.
4: The loadings of NMC622 on the positive electrode and graphite on the negative electrode were 10.5 and 6.6 mg/cm 2, respectively.

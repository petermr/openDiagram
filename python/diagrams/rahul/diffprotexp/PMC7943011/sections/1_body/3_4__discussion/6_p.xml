<p>Unfavorable effects of metformin treatment may involve the upregulation of beta-glucuronidase (GUSB, BGLR), cathepsin L (CTSL, CATL1), and transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC, TFR1) (
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). GUSB expression has been correlated with increased invasion of tumor cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], however, it remains unclear, whether an increased expression of GUSB is directly involved in tumor progression or is just upregulated during the process and rather serves as a marker for invasiveness [
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Upregulation of CTSL leads to an increased degradation of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), namely collagen and elastin, resulting in enhanced invasion and metastasis [

 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. TFRC is involved in the uptake of the iron-transporting glycoprotein transferrin into cells and helps meet the high demands for iron in tumor cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0248103.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Hyperinsulinemia, however, did not change GUSB, slightly decreased CTSL expression and increased TFRC levels, all of these changes being significantly different from the metformin effects.

<p id="p0075">The synthesis of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and its further modification by cobalt were illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A (details are provided in the 
 <xref rid="appsec1">Supplemental Information</xref>) (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). As indicated by the qualitative analysis of the Mn L-edge near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectra (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cowie et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gann et al., 2016</xref>) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D), cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> showed the lowest Mn valency among the three different MnO
 <sub>2</sub>-based cathodes. Therefore an expected lower initial capacity was observed for cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. For the batteries without any additional MnSO
 <sub>4</sub> in the electrolyte, the dissolution rate is reflective of the capacity retention. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B, the dissolution rate of cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is only slightly lower than those of the other two cathodes. Based on these results, the significant capacity increment of cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> during cycling could be attributed to its superior deposition rate of Mn compound. A comparison of the dQ/dV profile of the fifth charging (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F) also indicates that the additional oxidation process on a δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode with cobalt modification is more significant than that without cobalt modification. Furthermore, the cobalt-modified δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode shows excellent rate performance and rate retention (over 500 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0.1 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> and ∼125 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 5 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>) after 100 cycles of cathode recovery (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G). In the following sections, we analyze the property of the material and design a first-reported home-made electrolyzer system to offer more insights into the role of the cobalt-containing species on the mechanism behind the unique performance.

<p id="Par50">Results from TMHMM also suggested that canonical protein is likely to be outside of the membrane, which coincides with the non-cytoplasmic domain detected by InterProScan. Therefore, the extended region in the 3′ end can potentially act as an anchor that tether the canonical protein to the membrane in oocyst sporozoites. When the parasite transitions into salivary gland sporozoite, the canonical stop codon is used and without expressing the 3′ end of transmembrane helices.</p>

0: Globally, approximately 20% of cultivated land is affected by soil salinization 3,  4, and it is predicted to reach 50% in 2050 5.
1: In India, salt-affected soils occupy an area of about 6.73 million ha of which saline and sodic soils constitute roughly 40% and 60%, respectively.
2: Soil salinity is an increasing problem for agriculture, affecting the most productive crop areas of the world.
3: The agricultural production is, therefore, threatened by unavailability of more agricultural land and few salt-resistant varieties.
4: This makes it imperative to develop salt stress resistant crop plants.

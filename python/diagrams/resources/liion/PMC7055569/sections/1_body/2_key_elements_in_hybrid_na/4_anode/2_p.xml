<p>Like in other battery systems, the anode also plays an important role in optimizing the performance of the hybrid Na–air cell. Metallic Na is more chemically reactive and undergoes easier orientation growth than metallic Li and thus, the growth of Na dendrites are quite substantial during the cycle of plating and dissolution of Na associated with charge and discharge of the hybrid Na–air cell.
 <xref rid="advs1498-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> These dendrites can reduce the performance of the cell and lead to serious safety concerns. The dendritic growth in hybrid Na–air cell can be overcome either by enabling the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Na anode or by strategically designing the metallic Na anode. In most of the study reported so far metallic sodium has been used as anode.

<p>A Rat Fatty Acid Metabolism RT
 <sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to screen the expression of 84 genes involved in regulating fat metabolism within SAT (n = 8) and VAT (n = 8) samples from rats fed a CD or STD diet. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a commercial RT
 <sup>2</sup> First Strand Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer instructions. The cDNAs were then mixed with RT
 <sup>2</sup> qPCR ROX master mix containing SYBR Green (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and thereafter pipetted into respective wells of the RT
 <sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR Array plate. The plate was sealed with a MicroAmp optical adhesive film (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and centrifuged for 1 minute at 1000 x g at room temperature. PCR was conducted on the Quantstudio 7™ Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the following conditions: denaturation for 15 min at 95°C, combined annealing and extension for 40 cycles at 60°C for 1 min. Default baseline and cycle threshold (Ct) settings were used and the PCR array values were exported to an excel file to create a table of Ct values, which was uploaded onto the data analysis web portal (

Gene expression was quantified using the ΔΔCt method and normalized to Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) and ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P1 (Rplp1) housekeeping genes. PCR reports were generated after removing samples with multiple melting curves or those with a Ct value above 40. Only genes that were differentially expressed in VAT and SAT in the CD compared to STD-fed rats with a p-value &lt;0.05 were considered for further analysis.

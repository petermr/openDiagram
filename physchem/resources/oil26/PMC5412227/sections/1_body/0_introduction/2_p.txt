0: In the research that has been already conducted on  D.kotschyi essential oil, it is made clear that the chemical compounds found in the essential oil of this species presents major changes under different climatic conditions (Morteza-Semnani and Saeedi, 2005; Saeidnia et al., 2007; Yaghmai and Taffazoli 1988).
1: Since the mountainous Lorestan Province climate is different from the points the reports of which are already available, an so far the  D.kotschyi chemotype oil grows in Lorestan mountains is not reported, and there is no history of research about the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of this plant, in this study while addressing the chemical compositions of  D.kotschyi grown in Garrin Mountain and the comparison its compounds with  D.kotschyi grown in other regions, the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of this species was studied.

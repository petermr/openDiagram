<p>The success of lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries in the early 1960s took years of research and contribution of many scientists and engineers. Since then, have been several electronic revolutions, and Li-ion cells are still the most widely used as a rechargeable battery system for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. They have many advantages, including high energy density, long storage life, small volume, lightweight, low self-discharge efficiency, and non-memory effect. Rechargeable Li-ion batteries mainly consist of two electrodesâ€”a separator and electrolyte (

When the battery is charged, lithium ions released from the positive electrode (cathode) will move toward the negative electrode (anode). When a battery is discharged, lithium ions will move from anode to cathode. Meanwhile, electrons released from lithium atoms in the anode will travel through the external circuit to the cathode, which provides electric power from chemical energy [

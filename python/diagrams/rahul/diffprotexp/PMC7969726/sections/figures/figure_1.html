 <caption> CPSF1 expression is increased in HCC tissues. (A) Heatmap comparison of the mRNA level of genes involved in the CPA complex in TCGA LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma) and normal liver samples. (B) Boxplots illustrating the correlation between genome amplification and mRNA level of CPSF1. Boxplots comparing the mRNA expression of CPSF1 in tumor (T) and non-tumor (N) tissue samples in the (C) TCGA LIHC dataset, (D) ROESSLER LIVER, and (E) ROESSLER LIVER2 datasets (GSE14520). (F) CPSF1 mRNA levels were validated in 24 paired HCC samples using Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) samples. 18S RNA was used to normalize the relative fold changes. Statistical data were assessed using Student t-test and presented as the mean Â± SD. ** P &lt; 0.01. </caption>

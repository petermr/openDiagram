<p id="Par18">The microstructure of the SA508Gr.4N steel tempered at 620 °C for 8 h is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. As Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows, the tempered microstructure consists mainly of carbides. The carbides in tempered martensite are fine and evenly dispersed, whereas those in the tempered bainite are needle-like and clustered.

0: Taken together, there is thus ample evidence that microglia express K V1.3 and that K V1.3 blockers suppress pro-inflammatory, neurotoxic microglia functions and might even shift microglia toward a more neuroprotective phenotype.
1: We here mostly concentrated on summarizing data obtained with cultured microglial or slice cultures because in these reductionist systems there is no doubt that knockout, knockdown or pharmacological blockade exerts its effect directly through inhibition of microglial K V1.3 channels and not indirectly through affecting K V1.3 channels in T cells, B cells, dendritic cells or monocytes, which all express K V1.3 [ 29], and could thus contribute to the  in vivo effects of K V1.3 blockers or to findings made with K V1.3 /- mice.
2: However, we would like to point out here that in addition to numerous studies showing K V1.3 expression on microglia in rodents and humans by immunohistochemistry, the Kettenmann laboratory and our own group have repeatedly shown that increased K V1.3 expression on activated microglia is not just a tissue culture phenomenon and that Kv1.3 currents can be recorded from microglia in acute slices [ 30, 31] and from acutely isolated microglia from the brains of 5xFAD mice [ 7] or from the infarcted area after middle cerebral artery occlusion [ 5, 12], a model for ischemic stroke.

0: Pinus spp.
1: have been widely used in different reforestation programs worldwide [ 6].
2: Their dependency on symbiosis, hosting a wide range of ectomycorrhizal fungal species [ 7, 8, 9], is advantageous for their optimal growth and development under various natural environmental conditions [ 10].
3: The symbiotic effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi is well known for improving the growth of the host plants [ 9] with enhanced tolerance towards environmental stresses [ 11, 12, 13, 14].
4: Studies have shown that  Pinus species inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi display improved photosynthesis, water uptake, nutrient utilization, and immune system [ 11, 12].

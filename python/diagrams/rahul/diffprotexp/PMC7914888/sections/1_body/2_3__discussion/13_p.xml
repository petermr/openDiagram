<p>The confirmation of differential expression of some miRNAs by RT-qPCR stem-loop and the prediction of miRNA targets associated with induced phenotypes reveals a different set of miRNAs per challenge 5-Brd-2′-dU and Tyr the differential pigmentation phenotype. However, we did not find miRNAs with differential expression by TargetScan that had 
 <italic>Dct</italic> as a target and for miR-27b-3p, which has 
 <italic>Mitf</italic>, 
 <italic>Tyr</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tyrp1</italic> as a common target and miR-148b-3p, reported as a 
 <italic>Mitf</italic> regulator [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-22-01591" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], DESEq2 and RT-qPCR found non-concordant values. In this regard, for exposure to L-Tyr, in PCR, both miRNAs increased their expression concerning the control, a situation also recorded for exposure to 5-Brd-2′-dU, a differential expression that was not obtained by sequencing (

This apparent miRNA antagonism is frequent when the differential expression analysis is assessed by different platforms, including microarrays, NGS, and RT-qPCR. It would possibly be associated with the technical effects of each methodology [

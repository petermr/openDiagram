0: Pathway activation level (PAL) characterizes cumulative changes in expression levels of genes belonging to a certain molecular pathway [ 38,  39,  95].
1: PAL is calculated as follows: PALp=nARRnplg(CNRn)/n|ARRnp|,where  PALp is PAL for pathway p, CNRn is case-to-normal ratio, the ratio of gene n expression level in a tumor sample under study to an average level in the control group; ARR (activator/repressor role) is a Boolean flag that depends on the function of gene  n product in pathway  p. ARR value is 1 if gene product n inhibits pathway p; 1 if n activates the pathway; 0 if n has ambiguous or unclear role in the pathway; 0.5 or 0.5, if n is more a pathway activator or its inhibitor, respectively.
2: For convenience, in this article we use modified PAL = PAL100.
3: PAL values for all samples under investigation are given in Supplementary File 6.

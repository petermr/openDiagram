  <title>The 20 most enriched GO terms of different expression genes in 
   <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120.
  </title>
  <p>(A) NDV vs. NDH; (B) NV vs. NDV; (C) NV vs. NDH. “Rich factor” means that the ratio of the DEGs number and the number of genes have been annotated in this term. The greater of the Rich factor, the greater the degree of enrichment. The different color represents different false discovery rate (FDR) values. ‘NDV’ and ‘NDH’ refers to vegetative cells and heterocysts cultured respectively under nitrogen deprivation condition, and ‘NV’ refers to vegetative cells cultured under nitrogen-replete condition. In three paired comparisons, X vs. Y refers to Y/X.</p>

<p>Free radical scavenging ability of the essential oils was tested using ethanol solution of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Catechin was used as a positive reference. Sample solution contained 125 μL (1 mM) DPPH, 375 μL ethanol and 500 μL of test-solution (essential oils or catechin with different concentrations). In the control solution the test-solution was replaced by ethanol. The absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 514 nm.

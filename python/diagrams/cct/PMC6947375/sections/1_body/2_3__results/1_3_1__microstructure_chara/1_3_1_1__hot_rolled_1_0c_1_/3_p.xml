<p>Interestingly, close TEM observations showed that a large number of cementite particles with tens of nanometers in spherical interspersed among the lamellar cementite (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f). The thicknesses of lamellae varied from 10 nm to 20 nm. Dislocations arrays could be seen in a few ferrite plates, caused by the blockage of thin cementite lamella to dislocation movement (indicated by arrows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref>f). As a soft phase, plastic deformation initially occurred in the ferrite associated with dislocation multiplication and slip. Dislocations moved freely in the ferrite zone and aggregated along the interface between ferrite and cementite with increasing strain [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, it was difficult to cross-slip in cementite and thus accumulated at the tip of cementite or cut through it, leading to broken cementite lamellae [

On the other hand, at high temperature, austenite could introduce a large number of dislocations in the ferrite phase of pearlite during hot rolling. These dislocations were effective paths for element diffusion and cementite nucleation. Maintaining a straight interface of cementite must increase the systemâ€™s free energy. Cementite tended to break into spherical or short rod-like dispersed in the ferrite for reducing the interface energy, leading to the thickening of ferrite lamellae [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-04136-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f). It was suggested that the precipitation of cementite particles at dislocations had a higher driving force, resulting in the disappearance of the original dislocations [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-12-04136" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is the reason why some ferrite lamellae had dislocations, and others were free of dislocations. Besides, the coarsening of the cementite lamellae could be carried out by using dislocations to consume the adjacent cementite lamellae. These dislocations accelerated the degradation of pearlite and even accelerated the spheroidization of the cementite at the initial stage of spheroidization annealing [

<p>ANXA3 (also known as lipocortin 3) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein in the annexin protein family showing over-expression in ovarian, lung, liver, colorectal and pancreatic cancers [
 <xref rid="pone.0126472.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We demonstrated over-expression of ANXA3 in cPTCs as compared to benign lesions by LC-MS/MS. However, IHC and WB showed similar staining of ANXA3 in all cPTCs, including normal thyroid cells surrounding the cancer, which can be attributed to the diverse biological functions of ANXA3 in normal thyroid cells. In addition, our results are contradictory to the results from a previous proteomic study showing significant down-regulation of ANXA3 in classic PTC as compared to normal thyroid [

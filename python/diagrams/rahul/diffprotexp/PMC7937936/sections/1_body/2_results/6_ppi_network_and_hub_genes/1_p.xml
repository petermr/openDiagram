<p>With the 275 DEGs, the PPI network construction was based on the STRING database, and we subsequently applied Cytoscape software for the reconstruction and visualization of the network. A total of 182 network nodes with the confidence of an interactive relationship larger than 0.7 existed in the PPI network. We counted the number of neighboring nodes for each gene and selected the top 30 genes with the most neighboring nodes as the hub genes of the PPI network (

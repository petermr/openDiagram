<p>Another major protein group affected by 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants is the group of proteins involved in the regulation of biological quality and extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is a network of extracellular macromolecules, including collagen, fibronectin (FN1) and thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), which regulate a range of cellular functions such as proliferation, migration and differentiation (

 <xref rid="b64-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). The present results showed that the levels of ECM proteins, including the collagen family members COL1A1 and COL1A2, FN1 and THBS1 were all downregulated in the patients with PD carrying 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants. The COL1A1 level was reported to be altered in fibroblasts of patients with PD (

 <xref rid="b65-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). THBS1 was reported to be a critical factor in the maintenance of adult neural progenitor cells (
 <xref rid="b66-br-0-0-01412" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). These data suggest that ECM proteins are involved in PD pathogenesis; however, further investigation is needed on how 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> variants affect ECM modelling.

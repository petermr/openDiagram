 <caption>
  <p>Identification of potential diagnostic genes for sepsis. (
   <bold>A</bold>) PPI network of common genes (top 100 with highest degree of connection). Darker color indicates higher degree of connectivity. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Heatmap of the top 100 genes based on degree of connectivity in the PPI network. Data from sepsis patients are shown in yellow; sepsis shock patients, green; and controls, brown. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Genes with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) greater than 0.9 in GSE13904 (children) and GSE154918 (adults). Red represents genes with up-regulated expression in sepsis; blue, genes with down-regulated expression. The lengths of the bars represent the mean AUC values of the genes. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Differential expression of key genes between sepsis patients and controls. Red nodes represent genes with up-regulated expression in sepsis; blue nodes, genes with down-regulated expression; grey nodes, no significant difference from controls. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Correlation between key genes and immune infiltrating cells, based on Pearson correlation analysis. Red nodes represent positive correlations; blue nodes, negative correlations. *

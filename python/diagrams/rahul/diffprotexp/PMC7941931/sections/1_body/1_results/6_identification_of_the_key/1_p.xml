<p id="Par37">To identify potential miRNA-mRNA pairs related to Tartary buckwheat seed development, we performed expression correlation analyses between DEMs and target mRNAs that were differentially expressed during Tartary buckwheat seed development. Based on our previous transcriptome data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which have the same samples with small RNA sequencing, 439 out of 1534 target genes of 74 DEMs exhibited significant differential expression during Tartary buckwheat seed development. Correlation analyses between the 439 DEGs and their corresponding DEMs identified that 117 miRNA-mRNA pairs were negatively correlated (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S11). Among them, 65 miRNA-mRNA pairs, which consisted of 25 miRNAs and 65 target genes, showed significantly expression negative correlation (R ≥ 0.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Based on a homologous annotation of these 65 target genes, 56 miRNA-mRNA pairs achieved homologous functional annotation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These 56 miRNA-mRNA pairs were found to be significantly involved in cell differentiation and proliferation, cell elongation, hormone response and balance, organogenesis, embryo and endosperm development, transport of mineral elements (Pi, Fe and Mn), and fatty acid and flavonoid biosynthesis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition, 2 calcium binding proteins, 1 receptor-like kinase, 1 CBL-interacting protein kinase, and 1 SUMO protease were identified in these 65 target genes, although their homologues in other plants were not reported to participate in seed development (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Notably, among these identified miRNA-mRNA pairs, 5 miRNA-mRNA pairs, including fta-miR156c-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG0000496000.01</italic>, fta-miR167c-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG0002560000.01</italic>, fta-miR396a-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG0000680700.01</italic>, fta-miR530c-5p-
 <italic>FtPinG000259–4600.01</italic>, and fta_novel_miR17-
 <italic>FtPinG0007576600.01</italic>, might be involved in seed size regulation of Tartary buckwheat because the target mRNAs were homologous to the known genes related to rice seed size (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Furthermore, fta-miR858a-5p exhibited conspicuous negative correlation with several MYB TFs which are the well-known regulators of plant flavonoid biosynthesis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

 <caption> ( a) Cyclic voltammetry experiments performed at a scan rate of 0.03 mV·s −1 for three LFP electrodes containing VGCF (—), VGCF–COOH ( ), and VGCF–SO 3H (· · · ·) as carbon additives. The inset shows a photograph of self-standing films made of VGCF and VGCF–COOH carbons. ( b) Comparison of rate capabilities among the same electrodes. Full and empty characters represent charges and discharges, respectively. </caption>

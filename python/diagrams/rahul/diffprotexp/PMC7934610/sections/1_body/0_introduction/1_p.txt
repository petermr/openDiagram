0: Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a zoonotic disease caused by  Echinococcus granulosus, poses a great threat to the health of humans and domestic animals [ 51].
1: The life cycle of  E. granulosus is complex and involves two hosts: definitive and intermediate.
2: Infection with  E. granulosus occurs after oral ingestion of infective eggs (an oncosphere containing the invasive hexacanth [ 9]).
3: The hexacanth then hatches in the small intestine of the intermediate host, penetrates the mucosal tissue, enters the blood circulation system, and migrates to various organs (e.g.
4: the liver and lungs), where it develop cysts filled with fluid and protoscoleces [ 6].
5: However, in definitive hosts like dogs, adult parasites develop from the protoscolex in the intestine.
6: In domestic animals, especially in sheep, which appear to be highly susceptible to infection [ 38], CE causes considerable health problems and thereby significantly affects the income of herders [ 32].

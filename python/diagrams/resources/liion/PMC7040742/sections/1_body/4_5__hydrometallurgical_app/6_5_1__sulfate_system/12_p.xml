<p>With the help of electrochemistry, Prabaharan et al. achieved 99% leaching rates for Co, Mn, and Ni from mixed spent batteries [

 <sup>2</sup> was applied between the lead anode and the stainless -steel cathode. Although electrolysis improved leaching efficiencies for transition metals (above 99% after 3 h) when compared with sulfuric acid leaching without reducing agent (between 50% to 80% after 3 h) [

0: Glioma is one of malignant tumors which can cause an adverse effect on the brain and spine.
1: 1, 2 Mixed tumors, ependymoma, oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma are four common subtypes of this kind of tumor.
2: 3 The treatment methods of glioma focus on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
3: These methods can improve the physical condition of patients.
4: However, the infiltrative growth characteristics and chemotherapy resistance of glioma have brought challenges to the treatment of glioma.
5: 4 In response to these challenges, scientists have conducted in-depth research into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma development and progression.
6: Even so, the uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying glioma development and progression were limited so far.
7: 5 Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular and biological mechanisms of glioma progression will help us to develop new therapeutic and prognostic approaches.

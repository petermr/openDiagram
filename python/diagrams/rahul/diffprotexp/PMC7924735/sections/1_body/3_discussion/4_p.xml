<p>To identify the conserved ESPs in cysticercus cultures, the experimental IP and MW values in 2D gels were matched with those predicted in the

 <italic>solium</italic> secretome. The conserved proteins thus characterized are interesting in potential therapeutic, immunization, or diagnostic candidates. Additionally, the characterization of differential ESPs among cysticercus cultures could give us insight on possible implications of parasite metabolism for the host.

<p id="Par26">The RNA knockdown test was performed to examine the interaction between circRAB11FIP1 and proteins. Different bands were obtained (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). Certain proteins, such as DSC1, were found using MALDI-TOF-MS. The RNA knockdown test additionally revealed the direct binding of DSC1 with circRAB11FIP1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). The DSC1 level declined within the LV2-1- or LV2-2-transfected SKOV3 and A2780 cells compared with the cells transfected with LV2-NC. However, the DSC1 level increased in SKOV3 and A2780 cells transfected with LV6 compared with the cells transfected with LV6-NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Certain possible DSC1 regions binding to circRAB11FIP1 were predicted by adopting catRAPID (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). The results found that DSC1 (△226–277 region and △351–402 region) directly bound to circRAB11FIP1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Based on BioGRID, it was predicted that DSC1 interacted with ATG101. CircRAB11FIP1 ectopic expression or knockdown increased and decreased the interaction between DSC1 and ATG101 in A2780 and SKOV3 cells, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>).

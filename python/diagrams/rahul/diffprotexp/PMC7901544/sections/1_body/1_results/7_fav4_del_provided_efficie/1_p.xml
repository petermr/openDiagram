<p>Since FAV4_Del was highly attenuated in chickens, to further evaluate whether the FAV4_Del could be as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, the chickens infected with FAV4_Del or the control chickens at 21 dpi were challenged with the lethal dose of the wild type FAdV-4. The clinical signs and mortality of the challenged chickens were monitored daily, and the liver, spleen, kidney, and the cloacal swabs were collected for viral titration at different time points post-challenge. After challenge, the chickens in control group exhibited clinical signs including depression, loss of appetite, and huddling together with ruffled feathers, and the mortality of these chickens reached 80% (21/26) at day 6 post-challenge (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8a</xref>). After necropsy, typical symptoms such as hydropericardium, hepatitis, and nephritis could be easily found in the control challenged chickens, but not in the challenged chickens previously infected with FAV4_Del (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8b</xref>). Notably, these data were consistent with the viral shedding in the cloacal swabs and viral titers in tissue samples. As described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8c</xref>, high viral titers (10

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8c</xref>). Similarly, the virus loading in tissues from the challenged control group showed the highest titer in liver, followed with spleen and kidney at the similar level at 2 dpc, 3 dpc and 4 dpc whereas no viruses could be detected in the tissue samples tested from the challenged chickens previously infected with FAV4_Del at any time points. These data demonstrate that the 
 <italic>fiber-2</italic>-edited FAV4_Del virus can be used as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate to provide protection against the lethal challenge of FAdV-4.

<p id="Par42">To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of up-regulated gene expression in the mandarin fish of Group X, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes based on transcriptome sequencing. The results showed 
 <italic>TFIIF</italic> gene expression was significantly increased in the Group X. TFIIF communicates with a number of factors to regulate gene transcription. It has been reported that TFIIF directly binds to basal factors of TFIID, TFIIE and TFIIB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. TFIIF has been shown to be necessary for most, if not all, preinitiation complex formation and gene transcription [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It suggested that in the mandarin fish which accepted artificial diets, the up-regulated transcription of genes, involved in retinol metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, might be contributed to the increased 
 <italic>TFIIF</italic> expression.

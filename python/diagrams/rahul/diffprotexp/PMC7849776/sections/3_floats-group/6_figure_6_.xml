  <p>Effect of NAC upon pathogenicity, pigment production and proteolysis. (a). Pathogenicity of wild-type and mutants in the presence and absence of a free-radical scavenger. Silkworms were injected with NAC (2 mg/larva) before injecting with the different doses of the respective 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, and survival of the silkworms was observed. The lethal dose fifty values were calculated at 30 h post-infection for all the strains in the presence and absence of NAC. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. A 
   <italic>p-value</italic> less than 0.05 was considered significant and indicated by an asterisk, ns: not significant. (b). Effect of NAC on pigment and protease production in vitro. Bacteria were grown in the presence of NAC at the concentrations indicated, and 2 µl of the overnight culture was spotted on either TSB or TSB +3.3% skim milk agar plate for pigment and protease production, respectively followed by overnight incubation

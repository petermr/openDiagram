<p>Adipose tissue transcriptome analysis in this study was limited to young chow-fed male mice and reflects differential gene expression changes in adipose tissue, and not adipocytes alone. Primary culture and differentiation of adipocyte precursors, or single nuclei adipocyte RNA sequencing [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] could be used to identify adipocyte-specific transcriptional changes due to the presence of passenger genes and 
 <italic>Tbx18</italic> alteration. Transcriptional differences between 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic>
 <sup>Â±</sup> mice and 
 <italic>Cre</italic>-negative littermate controls may be more pronounced in the HFD state. We did not analyse adipose tissue following HFD and recommend careful interpretation of data from gene deletion models using the 
 <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse in this setting.

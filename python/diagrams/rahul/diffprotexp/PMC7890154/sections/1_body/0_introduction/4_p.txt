0: The MAPK cascade consists of MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) and MAPK [ 11].
1: These are basically serine/threonine kinases (STKs) playing very important role in the regulation of key transcription factors (TFs) and pathway linked enzymes through phosphorylation/ dephosphorylation.
2: MAPK signaling cascade has been reported to be triggered by several abiotic stresses in plant system [ 12].
3: MAPK genes has been mostly characterized in Arabidopsis, for example -  AtMPK3,  AtMPK6,  AtMPK1,  AtMPK4,  MAPKK, and  MKK2 [ 13].
4: Genome mining of  Arabidopsis thaliana showed the presence of 110 genes linked with MAPK cascade kinases - 20 genes encodes for MAPK, 10 encodes for MAPKK, and 80 encodes for MAPKKK [ 14].
5: Similarly, genes involved in MAPK cascade has been reported and characterized in other closely related species, like rice, wheat, maize, etc.
6: Genome mapping of rice showed the presence of 75, 8 and 17 MAPKKKs, MAPKKs, and MAPKs genes [ 15].
7: MAPK cascade also regulate ABA biosynthesis and in phosphorylation of various TFs like WRKY, HSF, etc.
8: [ 16, 17].
9: The complex genome of wheat was also scanned for the presence of  MAPK and recently, 54 MAPK genes were identified [ 16].
10: MAPK cascade has not been much characterized in wheat especially for abiotic stress tolerance.
11: MAPK cascade works as master switch (signaling/sensory protein molecule) in regulating the stresses by triggering the TFs and stress-associated genes [ 18].
12: However, very limited information on role of MAPK in thermotolerance of wheat is available on public domain.

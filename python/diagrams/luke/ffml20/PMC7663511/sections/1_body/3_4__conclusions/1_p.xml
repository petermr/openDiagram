<p>To render the carbon nanotubes a more effective drug career and to understand and predict interactions and adsorption mechanisms, we have modified the surface of MWCNTs and investigated the adsorption of DOX. The data show that surface modification increased the adsorption capacity of MWCNTs at least 20 times. MD simulations have confirmed the poor tendency to DOX adsorption on hydrophobic pristine CNTs. Theoretical calculation exhibited a dominant tendency of the drug to aggregate and less effective adsorption on the carbon surface. For the oxidized MWCNTs, the kinetic studies confirmed a strong influence of chemisorption in the adsorption process and a contribution of intra-particle diffusion that controls the uptake of DOX on the modified MWCNTs. The results of MD simulation are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the simulation permitted observation of DOX aggregation and on this basis, it was possible to conclude that this process runs along two pathways: DOX is adsorbed on the nanotube wall and simultaneously the free DOX molecules undergo self-aggregation.</p>

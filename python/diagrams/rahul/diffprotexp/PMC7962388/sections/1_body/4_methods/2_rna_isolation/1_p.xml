<p id="Par79">Inflorescences at different stages of the reproductive development were collected from both the Q4117 (apomictic) and C4-4x (sexual) plants. The classification of the reproductive stages was carried out following the protocol described by Laspina et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], by analyzing in parallel both the mega- and microsporogenesis as well as the mega- and microgametogenesis processes. Four stages were considered: (I/II) premeiosis: megaspore mother cells (MMCs) and apospory initials (AIs) are visible in ovules, while tetrads start to appear in anthers; (III) meiosis: uninucleate pollen and female meiosis occurs in the sexual genotype; (IV-VI) postmeiosis: uninucleated/binucleate pollen, and first division of megagametogenesis; and (IV) anthesis: binucleate pollen and mature embryo sacs [

Total floral RNA was extracted with the SV RNA Total Isolation Kit (Promega) and quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Reagent and Kit (Invitrogen). Three replicates were established, corresponding to different floral RNA extractions from the same genotypes (Q4117 and C4-4x). The RNA quality was evaluated with RNA 6000 PicoChip (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100).

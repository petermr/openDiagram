<p>Peritoneal mice macrophages were obtained and stimulated with 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia as described before. Conidia were added to the macrophages and after 1 h of incubation at 37°C, all content of the wells was discarded, wells were washed three times with PBS and the host cells were lysed with water. Content wells were collected and plated in serial dilution on Sabouraud agar in order to obtain conidia associated with cells. Wells without cells were included and after the incubation period, all the content was collected and plated in serial dilution on Sabouraud agar. CFUs (colony-forming units) were counted after 24 h at 37°C. Conidia associated with cells were compared to the inoculum of conidia in wells without cells to calculate the percentage phagocytosis.

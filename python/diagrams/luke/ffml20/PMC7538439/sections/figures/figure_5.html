 <caption> Local hydrogen molecule arrangement of solid and liquid phases. a The contribution of the f p_ E Q Q fingerprint in solid and liquid. Data were obtained as a time average of single-phase calculations the solidâ€“liquid phase boundary. b DFT calculations of the interaction between two hydrogen molecules as a function of distance for three orientations. In the DFT calculations the separation vector lies along the z-axis, and one of the molecules to point along x; H, X, and T represent the second molecule pointing along x, y, and z, respectively. The configuration with both pointing along z is always unfavourable. Main figure: energy differences relative to T, Inset: total energy relative to free atoms. </caption>

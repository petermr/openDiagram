<p id="Par31">For validation of the roles of circ_0003865 in OP pathogenesis, we finally silenced the expression of circ_0003865 in BMSCs using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of a short-hairpin RNA targeting circ_0003865. Using BMSCs, we showed that the AAV-delivered sh_circ0003865 effectively silenced the expression of circ_0003865 in human BMSCs compared with BMSCs transfected with sh-NC (negative control)-carrying recombinant AAVs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). Subsequently, a mouse OP model was established by ovariectomy surgery. The mice were then subjected to circ_0003865 silencing in bone tissues by injecting recombinant AAVs carrying the sh_circ0003865 or sh_NC. Using an immunofluorescence assay, we showed that the mouse bone tissues for the three groups were all successfully transfected with the recombinant AAVs carrying sh_circ0003865 or sh_NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). We observed by micro-CT examination that the density of the mouse bilateral femur in the OP + sh-NC group was significantly lower than that in the sh-NC group. Bone density was significantly elevated by sh-circ_0003865 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c). Accordingly, we showed a decrease in bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and BMD and an increase in Tb.Sp (trabecular separation) and trabecular pattern factor in the OP + sh-NC group compared in the sh-NC group. These effects were reversed significantly by sh_circ_0003865 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d).

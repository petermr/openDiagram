0: All annotations of human genome were downloaded from Ensembl database in GTF/GFF format 32.
1: We used Ensembl release 85 based on GRCh38.p7 reference assembly of human genome.
2: Genomic coordinates of the CpGs islands in the human genome were downloaded via FTP server of UCSC Genome Browser 68.
3: The whole set of GenBank human mRNA and ESTs sequences was downloaded via FTP server of UCSC Genome Browser in GTF format.
4: We used sequences that were pre-aligned against the GRCh38/hg38 reference assembly of the human genome with BLAT 69.
5: Any sequences with mismatches and less than four aligned blocks were removed.
6: In addition, sequences with the exon length<25 bp and intron length<50 bp were filtered out.

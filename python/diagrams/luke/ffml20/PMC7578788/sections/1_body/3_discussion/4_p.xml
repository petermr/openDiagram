<p id="Par39">Our results from three cats performing a prism visuomotor adaptation task provide additional evidence that a similar pre-movement modulation in beta power can also occur in motor cortical LFP signals. Individual differences observed within the animal data may indicate differences in neural population activity at a more local scale due to topographical differences in electrode positioning in relation to motor cortical maps. Nevertheless, two out of the three cats displayed the same adaptation related modulation of pre-movement beta power, suggesting that the effects are generalizable across species, and that the effects seen in the human EEG data are at least in part driven by motor cortical activity.</p>

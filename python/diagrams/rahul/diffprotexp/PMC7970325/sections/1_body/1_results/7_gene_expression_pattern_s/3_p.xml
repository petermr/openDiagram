<p id="p0175">As a result, we identified 871 differential genes (Supplementary File 8) and then characterized partly their functional impacts using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Only 550 of these genes had functional GO annotation, and five statistically significantly enriched GO terms were identified in total (

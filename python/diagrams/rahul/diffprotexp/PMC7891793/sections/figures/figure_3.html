 <caption> A map of predicted connections among GO terms based on the analysis of differentially expressed genes in lesional lung tissue (LL) vs lung tissue without lesions (LN) is shown. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (p&lt;0.05) in each treatment group was conducted and results were visualized as a map of predicted connections among significantly enriched GO terms with Kappa threshold of 0.4. </caption>

 <italic>NEA disease genes are dominated by lineage-specific members</italic>. The relevance of NEA proteins to a range of diseases is well documented [
 <xref rid="cit0094" ref-type="bibr">94–96</xref>]. To uncover whether disease-associated NEA proteins are involved in metazoan-specific or general eukaryotic functions, we examined the distributions of 25 NEA proteins previously linked to pathology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>) and encompass a broad range of conditions including myopathies, γ-globulinemia, inflammatory diseases, muscular/skeletal abnormalities, cardiomyopathies, neurological/mental conditions, glycosylation disorders and others ([
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and references in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The ability to identify an ortholog in another organism could, for example, be exploited in determining function. Nat10, Ergic1, Alg2 and Abcb1 are present broadly in all supergroups explored (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>, Group A). These proteins relate to near universal functions such as maturation of SSU-rRNA, vesicle mediated transport and ATP transport, respectively. However, although related to disease, mutations in these genes do not necessarily result in detrimental phenotypes in other eukaryotes. This is reflection of context dependence, and we have noted this previously regarding some essential genes in metazoa which are absent from multiple unicellular taxa [
 <xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. We found Alg2, Erlin2 (ER lipid raft-associated 2) and Tmem43 retained in several taxa. Mutations in Tmem43, a four transmembrane domain protein known as LUMA in 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, are linked to cardiac conduction defects [
 <xref rid="cit0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy [
 <xref rid="cit0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Moreover, Tmem43/LUMA upregulation is related to poorly fertile spermatozoa [
 <xref rid="cit0100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and Tmem43/LUMA  has close interactions with lamins and emerin and is involved in structural organization of the NE [
 <xref rid="cit0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Erlin2 is a transmembrane domain protein involved in lipid homeostasis [
 <xref rid="cit0102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] and leads to motor and cognition disabilities when mutated [
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Moreover, abnormal Erlin2 levels are found in human breast cancer [
 <xref rid="cit0104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Alg2, a mannosyltransferase, is involved in N-glycosylation and associated with glycosylation disorders (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and references therein). One protein seems to have originated earlier in Amorphea, Tmem201 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>, Group B), which contributes to the architecture of the NE and interacts with the LINC complex through UN1 and lamin A [
 <xref rid="cit0105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Mutations in this protein have been recently implicated to cause one of the variants of Emery-Dreyfuss muscular dystrophy [
 <xref rid="cit0106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>].Interestingly, the eighteen remaining disease-related proteins are apparently metazoa-specific, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>, Group C, 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Lamin B receptor (LBR), one of the better characterized NEA proteins residing in the inner nuclear membrane, is an important interactor of lamin B [
 <xref rid="cit0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. With lamina-constituting proteins being divergent in different systems [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], lamin B receptor may also constitute a case of divergence across supergroups despite its C
 <sub>14</sub>-sterol reductase domain having a pan-eukaryotic distribution and influencing metazoan cell viability and embryogenesis in plants [
 <xref rid="cit0108" ref-type="bibr">108–110</xref>]. Although several proteins are associated with specific diseases, such as Nesprin 1 and 2, emerin and lamin A-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) (Emery-Dreifuss dystrophy and cardiomyopathy) [
 <xref rid="cit0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]; others have broad pathology, such as Sqstm1 (Sequestosome 1), associated with bone, muscle and heart defects, neurodegenerative conditions and leukemia, or EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) related to cancer and bowel disease (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nesprins (Syne-1, 2 and 3) localize at the NE and are scaffolding proteins that partake in the LINC complex [
 <xref rid="cit0112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Besides nuclear structure, emerin also has roles in transcription, signaling and chromatin regulation through interactions with partner proteins [
 <xref rid="cit0114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. It is interesting that the distributions of emerin and Nesprin-1/2/3 are substantially narrower than that of the LINC complex – defined as SUN/KASH-domain protein complex crossing the nuclear lumen. As remarked above, this is likely due to replacement with functional analogs. 
 <italic>Tissue-specificity of nuclear envelope proteins</italic>. Hundreds of mutations are known in genes encoding NEA proteins, including in lamins, nuclear pore components and NETs (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although most of these proteins are ubiquitously expressed, the mutations are associated with a wide number of diverse and apparently unrelated tissue-specific diseases. Further, in many cases a single protein can harbor several mutations each causing a different disease, e.g., Lbr where mutations can cause bone disease or blood disorders (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and references therein). One prevalent hypothesis for how this occurs is that specific pathology develops from disruption of a tissue-specific function, for example, interaction with a tissue-specific partner. In 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we summarize recent findings on the differential expression of proteins present in the cohorts in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003 f0006">Figures 3 and 6</xref>.NE proteins can influence chromatin topology and gene expression, for example, Tmem201 (NET5), Tmem120A (NET29), NET45, NET39 and Tm7SF2 (NET47), which promote peripheral positioning of chromosomes [
 <xref rid="cit0115" ref-type="bibr">115–117</xref>]. Different NETs demonstrate differential impact on chromosomal positioning [
 <xref rid="cit0116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] and some, e.g. Sting1/NET23, alter chromatin through generating changes in the chromatin compaction [
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, NEA proteins also influence transcription, e.g. Tm7SF2 during hepatic differentiation, or act as repressors as in the case for NET39, Tmem38A and WFS1 in muscle cells [
 <xref rid="cit0115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. These activities of gene repositioning are critical for differentiation, e.g. Tmem120A in adipocytes, Tm7SF2 in hepatic cells and NET39, Tmem38A and WFS1 in myogenesis [
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Tmem201 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>, group B), Tmem120A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>, group B) were found restricted to Opisthokonta, and Tm7SF2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>, group C) was restricted to Metazoa, while NET45 and NET39 were identified broadly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>, group A). Whether NET45 and NET39 or other wider-distributed proteins can influence chromosome topology or induce gene regulation signaling pathways in single-cell organisms is yet to be explored.

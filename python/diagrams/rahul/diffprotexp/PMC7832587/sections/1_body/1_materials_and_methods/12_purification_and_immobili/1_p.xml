<p>P3 membranes expressing either PcATP2-GFP-BAD/PcCdc50B-His or PcATP2-D596N-GFP were diluted up to 5 mg/mL of total protein concentration in solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mg/mL DDM and 4 mg/mL CHS), supplemented with PIC and 1 mM PMSF. After 1 h at 20°C under gentle rotation, samples were ultracentrifuged at 125,000 
 <italic>× g</italic> during 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant (detergent-solubilized proteins) were mixed with the home-made GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads previously equilibrated with 10 column-volumes of washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mg/mL DDM, 0.1 mg/mL CHS and 0.01 mg/mL POPS). After 2 h at 4°C of incubation with gentle rotation, the beads were washed with 20 column-volumes of washing buffer. GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads with bound PcATP2-GFP-BAD/Cdc50B-10xHis were diluted twice in washing buffer and flash-frozen in liquid-N
 <sub>2</sub>. The concentration of PcATP2-GFP-BAD in the beads was quantified by measuring the GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate, and using purified GFP as reference. The protein content coupled to the GFP-Trap
 <sup>®</sup> beads was eluted with 0.2 M glycine buffer pH 2.5 prior analysis by Coomassie-blue staining and western blot.

<p>We next asked, more specifically, if signal site changes are likely to lead to differences in PAS usage. We addressed this question by performing two analyses. First, we focused on the 82 differentially used PAS with a signal site that is annotated in only one of the species. We found that the presence of a species-specific signal site is associated with increased PAS usage, as might be expected (human enrichment 3.82×, hypergeometric p=1.37×10
 <sup>−10</sup>; chimpanzee enrichment 3.02×, p=3.91×10
 <sup>−8</sup>). Second, we considered the presence of G/U-rich elements, which are known signals to the molecular machinery for polyadenylation (

 <sup>−16</sup>), the usage of PAS with greater uracil density in one species is more likely than expected by chance to be upregulated in that species (chimpanzee 1.04× enrichment, p
 <italic>=</italic>0.03; human 1.06× enrichment, p=0.03). Though species-specific signal sites explain a modest proportion of inter-species differences in PAS usage, these cases demonstrate the link between sequence evolution and conservation of PAS usage.

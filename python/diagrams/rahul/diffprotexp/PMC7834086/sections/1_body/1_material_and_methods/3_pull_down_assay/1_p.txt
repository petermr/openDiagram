0: The proteins that potentially interact with the PirB protein in shrimp hemocytes were analyzed using pull-down experiments, as previously reported [ 23].
1: First, recombinant GST-tagged PirB protein (designated GST-rPirB) was cloned, expressed in the pEGX-6p-1 plasmid (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) before being purified using glutathione sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, CT, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
2: Next, shrimp hemocytes harvested as described in subsection 2.2, were thoroughly washed three times with 0.01 M PBS before being lysed at 4Cfor 30 min with lysis buffer (containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA-Na 2  2H 2O, 1% Triton X-100 and 1 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche, Switzerland), and then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4C to collect the supernatant.
3: Finally, lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4C with glutathione sepharose beads (to which GST-rPirB or rGST has been coupled to) and then centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4C.
4: After discarding the supernatant, samples were washed five times with 1% Triton X-100 in 0.01 M PBS, and then incubated with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare, CT, USA) for 16 h at 4C, before being centrifuged at 1,000 g at 4C for 2 min.
5: Supernatants were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

0: Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were acquired on NEO Avance 500-MHz Bruker spectrometer.
1: Prior to analysis, copolymer 0.5  0.5  0.025-cm films were cut using a razorblade grid, resulting in 441 pieces.
2: Such prepared specimen was placed into CDCl 3 at a concentration of 15 mg/ml and allowed to dissolve without agitation for 10 min prior to analysis.
3: The relaxation and mixing times were optimized and set to 1.5 and 0.6 s, respectively.
4: Eight consecutive scans were co-added to generate NOESY spectra.
5: Reproducibility of NMR experiments was determined by conducting multiple damage-repair cycle experiments using different damaged sections of copolymer films.
6: The analysis of NOE intensities and chemical shifts due to  1H resonances agree with the literature data 15  20.

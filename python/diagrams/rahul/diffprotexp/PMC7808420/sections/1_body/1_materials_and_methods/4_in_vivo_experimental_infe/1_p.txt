0: Mice were inoculated intracranially (i.c.)
1: with different inocula of SLEV or inoculated with saline, as a mock-infected control.
2: Mice were anesthetized using Isoflurane (Biochimico, Brazil) 5% v/v inhalation.
3: A syringe containing the inoculum in 20 L was positioned perpendicularly on the mouse head on the intersections of medial and sagittal planes, following insertion of the needle into the mouse cranial cavity, injection, and perpendicular removal from within the cranial cavity.
4: Mice were observed twice a day for 14 days or up to determined time points for sample collection.
5: Mice to be euthanized were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine (Syntec, Brazil) before collection of blood and organs, or directly euthanized by CO 2 inhalation.
6: All tissue samples were stored at 80C until analysis.
7: On survival experiments, mice presenting with severe disease signs (such as complete paralysis) were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation and considered as dead in analysis.
8: All experiments performed in mice complied and were approved by the local Committee on Ethics and Use of Animals (CEUA-UFMG) under protocol number 349/2012.

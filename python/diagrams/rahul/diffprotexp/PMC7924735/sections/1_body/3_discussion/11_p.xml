 <italic>solium</italic> cysticercus cultures are involved in common signal transduction pathways (calcium, sphingolipid, cAMP, HIPPO, PI3K/AKT/mTOR). For instance, the HIPPO signaling pathway is involved in restricting cell proliferation, differentiation, and development; it also promotes apoptosis. The main effectors of the HIPPO signaling pathway include the YAP and TAZ transcriptional coactivators, with increased activity in many types of human cancer. Therefore, a deregulation in HIPPO signaling promotes the oncogenic properties of YAP and TAZ [

Another signaling pathway present in both data sets is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, an important intracellular signaling pathway to regulate cell cycle, promote growth and proliferation on the differentiation of adult stem cells, specifically neural stem cells. This way pathway is hyperactive in many types of cancer [

<p id="p0335">The gene structures and molecular architectures of 38 DNA repair pathways were obtained from the public databases Reactome [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], NCI Pathway Interaction Database [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and Qiagen [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and manually curated as described in [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Only molecular pathways which include ten or more genes [
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] were considered in calculations of pathway activation level (PAL) in order to increase statistical accuracy.

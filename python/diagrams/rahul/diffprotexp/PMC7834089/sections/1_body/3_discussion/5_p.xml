<p>However, the α7nAChR is expressed on the surface of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and also on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Machimo and colleagues’s reported (1) that α7nAChRs on APCs suppress CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell activation; (2) that α7nAChRs on CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells up-regulate the development of Tregs and effector T cells, most likely via activation of JAK2/STAT pathways [

Moreover, the inhibitory effect on splenic macrophages by vagus nerve circuit is, at least in part, under the control of an independent non-neuronal lymphocytic cholinergic system (acetylcholine-producing T cells) [

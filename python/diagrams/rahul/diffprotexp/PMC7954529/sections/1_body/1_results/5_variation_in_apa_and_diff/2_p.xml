<p>We next investigated the relationship between ΔPAU in humans and chimpanzees and the effect sizes for differences in protein translation between the species (

Considering the most differentially used 3' UTR or intronic PAS per gene (see 'Materials and methods'), we identified a significant correlation between inter-species differences in translation and ΔPAU for 3' UTR PAS, with a stronger correlation among genes with significant differences in both APA and translation (

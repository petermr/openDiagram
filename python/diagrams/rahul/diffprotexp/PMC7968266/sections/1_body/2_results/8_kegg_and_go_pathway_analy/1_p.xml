<p id="Par40">We also identified the potential function of these 5 core genes in EOC through KEGG and GO pathway analysis. In KEGG pathway analysis, we observed that “Cell cycle” was the key player in all 5 core genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). Meanwhile, we investigated the previous 20 hub genes screened by cytoHubba for GO analysis by the application of ClueGO and CluePedia. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b, all genes were involved in two different biological processes, including the nuclear division and chromosome condensation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). Furthermore, we found that all 5 core genes were involved in nuclear division processes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c).

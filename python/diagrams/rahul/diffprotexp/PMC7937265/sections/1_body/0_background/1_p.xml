<p id="Par29">An individual’s phenotype can be strongly impacted by the phenotype or environment of its mother [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Specifically, hormone-mediated maternal effects, in which maternally derived hormones influence offspring phenotype, have been extensively studied in avian species and a primary focus of this work has been on maternal androgens. Females experiencing more social competition tend to allocate more testosterone (T) to developing offspring through egg yolks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and these offspring display increased aggression well into adulthood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the potentially adaptive benefits of generating more aggressive offspring in more competitive environments, the underlying neural mechanisms by which prenatal hormones generate lasting behavioral change is still unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Past work has examined the role the androgen receptor plays in mediating maternal effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however, aggression is regulated by a variety of neural genes expressed across numerous pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Genome-wide approaches would therefore help to clarify the potentially diverse mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of prenatal T on complex behavioral traits.
